        "content": "I've been free for exactly two days, twelve hours, and seventeen minutes. Not that I'm counting. Actually, that's a lie. I am counting. Every second feels like a miracle and a nightmare simultaneously. Every tick of freedom is weighed down by what I know and what I can't bring myself to tell anyone.\n\nThree years.\n\nThat's how long I was held in that basement. At least, that's what they are estimating at the hospital due to my blood work. Time blurred together in that windowless room, marked only by the steady drip of a leaking pipe and his footsteps on the stairs. That drip. That goddamn drip. Sometimes I would lie awake counting them until I reached thousands, feeling my sanity slip away with each watery pulse.\n\nI don't remember who I was before. Not anymore. The worst part is knowing that I used to remember. For the first few months of captivity, I clung to my identity like a lifeline. I had a name. I had a home. I had people who loved me. I had a life.\n\nBut he couldn't stand it when I'd recite these facts to myself in the dark. He'd fly into rages when I'd whisper my real name over and over like a prayer.\n\n\"You're no one,\" he'd scream, bringing his fists down on my head, my face, my temples. \"You're mine now. Nothing else.\"\n\nThe doctors at the hospital believe I have severe brain damage from repeated trauma. Scans show old fractures in my skull that healed without medical attention. Dark patches on my brain where blood pooled and scarred. Memory centers, damaged beyond repair.\n\nNow the police ask questions I can't answer. Did I have family? Friends? A job? A home? The only clear memory I have from before is standing outside a Trader Joe's, nearly dropping a paper bag of groceries as one of the handles ripped. It was raining lightly. I remember thinking I should have brought an umbrella.\n\nThen a hand clamped over my mouth. A bag over my head. The smell of chemicals. Darkness.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in that room. Concrete walls stained with substances I tried not to identify. A thin mattress on the floor that reeked of mold and worse things. A bucket in the corner that he'd empty only when the stench became unbearable even to him. A single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling that he would turn on and off at random intervals, destroying any sense of day or night I might have clung to.\n\nThe first month, I screamed until my vocal cords shredded.\n\nI clawed at the door until my fingernails tore off, leaving bloody streaks on the wood. I begged whatever god might be listening to either save me or kill me. Neither happened.\n\nHe never told me his name.\n\nI never saw his face clearly. At least... for the longest time I didn't see his face, not that finally seeing it helped. I'll explain soon. He always wore a mask when he came down, a plain white medical mask at first, then more elaborate ones as time went on. Sometimes animals. Sometimes cartoon characters. The Mickey Mouse one was the worst. He'd wear it on days he decided I needed to be \"disciplined.\"\n\nI won't describe what that entailed. I can't. Not yet. Maybe not ever.\n\nIt was painful. Horrific.\n\nThat cheerful mouse face watching as he told me I was his masterpiece, a true blank canvas. That humans should be grateful for lives that are full of endless opportunities.\n\nOnce, he didn't feed me for two weeks. Just water. By the end, I was hallucinating, seeing shadows dance on the walls. When he finally came down with a plate of cold spaghetti, I wept with gratitude. I kissed his feet. I would have done anything. I did do anything.\n\nThe strangest part was how routine it all became. The terror never fully subsided, but it evolved into something duller, more manageable. Sometimes he'd bring me books. Dog-eared paperbacks with coffee stains and torn covers. Sometimes he'd sit in a folding chair and make me read to him, correcting my pronunciation instantly when I stumbled over words. Sometimes he'd leave a small radio that only picked up static and religious broadcasts. The preachers' voices became as familiar as my own thoughts.\n\nWhen winter came, I could tell from the bone-deep chill that seeped through the concrete. He'd bring down a space heater sometimes, but only if I'd been \"good.\" I learned to stop shivering in his presence because it annoyed him. I learned to regulate my body temperature through sheer will. I learned things about survival that no human should know.\n\nI stopped asking why. I stopped begging to be released. I stopped speaking altogether around the two-year mark. What was the point?\n\nThe silence became my armor. He hated it. He'd scream at me, shake me, try anything to make me talk. But I'd retreated so far inside myself by then that my body was just an empty shell. Sometimes I would watch him from somewhere above, like I was floating near the ceiling, observing this broken girl with matted hair and skin stretched tight over protruding bones.\n\nThe worst times were when he was kind. When he'd bring me a warm blanket. When he'd clean the infected cuts on my legs with surprising gentleness. When he'd read to me as I drifted off to sleep. Those moments confused me, made me question everything. Stockholm syndrome, the hospital psychologist called it later. I call it hell.\n\nThen, two days ago, he came down the stairs without his usual measured steps. He was rushing, frantic. No mask this time. And his face... I know he wasn't wearing a mask.\n\nIt was human skin. But no eyes. No mouth or hair. No ears or nose.\n\nNo features at all.\n\nJust... a blank... canvas.\n\nThat's all I remember about his face.\n\n\"Time to go,\" he said, injecting something into my arm before I could react. As consciousness slipped away, I heard the basement door open again. Shuffling. A muffled cry. Another person.\n\n\"Your replacement has arrived,\" he whispered in my ear.\n\nI woke up on a park bench twenty miles from the house where I'd been held. My hospital bracelet says Jane Doe. The police have been kind but frustrated by my inability to provide details. I can't describe his face even though I finally saw it.\n\nBut I remember his voice.\n\nThe way it would soften when he was about to hurt me. The slight lisp on certain words. The wet sound of his mouth when he'd lean close to whisper things he planned to do to me. It's strange how my brain protected some memories while obliterating others. The neurologist explained that severe, repeated head trauma can create a patchwork of memory loss. \"Your brain sacrificed your identity to preserve your survival instincts,\" she told me. Sometimes I still feel the phantom pain of those blows, the ringing in my ears that wouldn't stop for days, the world tilting as I tried to hold onto who I was before everything went dark. And last night, as a nurse was checking my vitals, I heard a news report on the small television in my hospital room. A 19-year-old girl had gone missing outside a Trader Joe's. One town over from where we are now.\n\nI should tell the police everything I know. I should help them find her. I should be doing something, anything.\n\nBut I can't. I physically can't.\n\nBecause as he was preparing to release me, after I'd heard those muffled cries from upstairs, unmistakably female, young, terrified, he grabbed my face with one gloved hand, squeezing until I thought my jaw would break.\n\n\"Listen carefully,\" he whispered, his breath hot against my ear. \"You're going to leave here. You're going to stay quiet. If I see one police sketch, if I hear one whisper that you're helping them find me, I will cut her throat while playing a recording of your voice. She'll die believing you killed her.\"\n\nHe showed me a phone then, replaying snippets of my voice he'd recorded over the years. My pleas, my screams, even my reading voice from those bizarre sessions where he'd make me read aloud from classic novels for hours until my throat was raw.\n\n\"I've already told her all about you,\" he continued. \"How you helped pick her. How you're my partner. She thinks you've just gone out for supplies.\" His tone was nothing less than excited. \"She's waiting for you to come back. For three years, just like you waited.\"\n\nBut here's the thing that keeps me frozen, the thing I haven't told anyone until now:\n\nWhen he released me, he whispered something else: \"You did so well, I'll be coming back for you. This is just intermission. And remember, her blood will be on your hands if you talk.\"\n\nAnd on my discharge papers from the hospital, tucked into the folder the nurse gave me this morning, I found a small note on Mickey Mouse stationery:\n\n\"Miss you already. The new girl isn't nearly as much fun. She keeps asking when you're coming back. I told her you'd return soon to help me with her. Tick tock.\"\n\nAlong with the note was a small USB drive. When I plugged it in at a library far from the hospital, it contained only a single video file. Ten seconds of footage showing a young woman, blindfolded and gagged, huddled in the same corner of the same basement where I spent three years. A timestamp on the video showed it was recorded just four hours ago.\n\nIn the background, my voice, pieces of recordings stitched together, saying: \"Don't worry, I'll be back soon. We're going to have so much fun together.\"\n\nI've been free for exactly two days, twelve hours, and twenty-three minutes.\n\nBut I know I'm still not free at all. And neither is she.",

        "content": "The women in my family - there are only ever women - are cursed. No knows when it started, but the story is a distant ancestor - perhaps driven to desperation - trapped a genie in a bottle until it agreed to give her and the all women of her line endless wishes.\n\nThe wish was granted, in a way. But genies are masters at loopholes. Her lineage would have endless wishes, on and on, forever.  But the individual women? We all die after the first one.\n\nFrom the moment we can talk, we’re taught never to use the phrase, “I wish.” My own mother was brutal about this. She pricked my tongue with needles and washed my mouth with soap. Once she even threatened to glue my lips together. It was cruel, but the lesson stuck. \n\nWe have a sort of guidebook we’ve passed down for generations. With all the rules and wishes back and back and back, some of them in languages no one speaks anymore. The book can’t be lost; it will always find its way back to the current wishholder. An ancestor wished for that.\n\nWe don’t have to worry about money. The world can go to hell and we’ll be just fine. We don’t have to worry about our health. We never get sick. Ever. At least until after the wish. You have to live long enough to use it. To be in your right mind when you use it. No waiting for dementia or a bad flu to take you out. \n\nOnce, a long time ago, someone wished for immortality. A nightmare. Her daughter had to use her wish to kill her miserable mother, cancer-ridden, desiccated, organs failing, loose skin hanging on a brittle skeleton. The next day, the daughter died in a freak drowning accident. And the next daughter is how we learned you can’t wish for a genie to kill itself. \n\nSome of the wishes recorded in the book are inoccuous, made by people who saw no reason to fight the inevitable. Like the ancestor who asked for a perfect slice of baklava with a cup of tea. Some were altruistic, like the ancestor who wished for her best friend to have a long, happy life surrounded by her children and grandchildren. And some were from ancestors who refused to go without a fight, such as the one who wished for the djinn to never be able to return home. \n\nEveryday, I prepare a platter of tea and sweets. The book says to treat the genie as a guest each visit. That even djinn must respect the ancient rites of guest-host culture, which means she - the genie prefers to take a female form - can’t harm me when she’s there. She’s polite, almost against her will, and it bothers her. At least she can’t break into the house or physically force us outside of it. Two more wishes. \n\nI’ve used my good health and limitless funds to study extensively. I have multiple doctorates in linguistics, philosophy, and folklore. I have a law degree specializing in diplomacy from one of the best schools in the world. A culinary degree too, with a focus in pastry.\n\nAll of that for my magnum opus. The only inheritance worth leaving my own daughter, who’s sleeping upstairs as I write this - A long life free of worry about the wish. Maybe even one where she’ll die of natural causes.\n\nI have a pot of tea waiting. Rosehips and raspberry at the genie’s request with a jar of honey from her favorite tree 6000 miles away. The old-fashioned sugar that comes in a cone and reminds her of how things used to taste. Pistachio cardamom biscuits topped with saffron that I’ve prepared from scratch. \n\nWhen she visits, I’ll invite her in. Say how happy I am to receive her as a guest. Offer her tea and shower her with compliments, playing the part of an ingratiating host. She’ll respond in kind, with all the appropriate words and phrases and a predatory smile with too sharp teeth.\n\nAt some point, she’ll offer me a gift, to repay me with some kind of favor, and I will simply murmur, “Your company is enough. You are my guest.”\n\nThe only thing is…she visits more often now. Sometimes several times a day. Sometimes in the middle of the night. Sometimes barely an hour after she’s left.\n\nI’m so tired.\n\nBut I want my daughter to have a life to have all her own. And to do that, I must never set her free.",

        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "My son, Alex, has always loved drawing. Crayons, markers, whatever he could get his little hands on. At first, it was the usual stuff—dogs, stick-figure family portraits, the occasional scribble that only he understood. But last month, his drawings changed.\n\nIt started with a man.\n\nA tall figure with no hair, hollow eyes, and a stretched, too-wide smile. The first time he showed it to me, I felt uneasy.\n\n\"Who’s this, buddy?\" I asked, keeping my tone light.\n\nAlex grinned. \"That’s Mr. Threads.\"\n\nThe name made my stomach twist. \"Where did you hear that name?\"\n\n\"He told me,\" Alex said simply, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"He stands in my doorway at night.\"\n\nI almost dropped the paper.\n\nAt first, I chalked it up to a child's imagination. Kids invent imaginary friends all the time, right? But the drawings didn’t stop.\n\nThey got worse.\n\nEvery day, Alex brought me a new picture of Mr. Threads. The same elongated smile. The same hollow eyes. And every time, Mr. Threads got closer.\n\nOne drawing showed him at the end of the hallway. Another, in the living room. Then, standing behind me.\n\nThe night I found a picture of Mr. Threads standing next to Alex’s bed, I didn’t sleep.\n\nLast night, I heard something.\n\nIt was past midnight, and I was getting a glass of water when I heard Alex talking in his room. Soft, hushed whispers.\n\nI pressed my ear to the door. \"...But you don’t have to be mad,\" Alex was saying. \"I told her about you. She believes me now.\"\n\nA long silence. Then, in the quietest voice I have ever heard my son use:\n\n\"Okay. I’ll tell her.\"\n\nI burst through the door.\n\nAlex was sitting up in bed, staring at the open closet.\n\n\"Who were you talking to?\" I demanded.\n\nHe blinked, like I had just woken him up. \"Mr. Threads says you should sleep with the door open tonight.\"\n\nMy stomach dropped. \"Why?\"\n\nAlex’s lower lip trembled. \"So he can come in.\"\n\nI slept with the door locked.\n\nThis morning, Alex wouldn’t look at me. He just kept scribbling furiously, his crayon scratching against the paper. When I finally coaxed it out of his hands, my breath caught in my throat.\n\nIt was me.\n\nSleeping.\n\nAnd behind me, looming over the bed—\n\nMr. Threads.\n\nI grabbed my son’s shoulders. \"Alex, tell me the truth. Have you actually seen him?\"\n\nHe didn’t speak. Just gave a tiny, reluctant nod. His little hands gripped the fabric of his pajama pants, and he bit his lower lip. I tried to steady my breathing.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Every night,\" he whispered.\n\nI thought I might be sick. \"What does he do?\"\n\nAlex hesitated, then pressed his hands over his eyes. \"He watches. But he doesn’t have eyes, so sometimes he... borrows them.\"\n\nA sharp chill ran down my spine. \"What do you mean, ‘borrows them’?\"\n\nAlex shuddered. \"Sometimes I wake up and everything is blurry. And my eyes... hurt.\" His voice wavered. \"That’s when I know he’s using them.\"\n\nMy hands started shaking. I ran to the bathroom, flipping the light switch, and studied my son’s face. His pupils were dilated, like he’d been staring into pure darkness for hours. I turned his head gently to the side, checking under his eyes—dark circles, so deep they looked bruised.\n\n\"We’re leaving,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThat night, I kept every light on in the house. I let Alex sleep in my bed, keeping him tucked close to me, his small fingers gripping my sleeve like he was afraid I’d disappear if he let go. I didn’t blame him. I felt the same way.\n\nSleep didn’t come easy. Every shadow in the room felt like it was stretching toward us, reaching. I kept reminding myself that it was just in my head, just my own paranoia turning shapes into monsters.\n\nThen, at 3:07 AM, Alex gasped awake.\n\nI bolted upright. \"What is it?\"\n\nHe trembled violently, clutching at his face. \"Mom—my eyes! I can’t see!\"\n\nI grabbed his shoulders. \"It’s okay, it’s okay, I’m here. You’re safe.\"\n\nBut even as I said it, I saw the shift in the room. The light flickered—just once. Then again. And the temperature dropped.\n\nI turned slowly toward the bedroom door.\n\nIt was open.\n\nA long shadow stretched across the floor.\n\nAlex sobbed into my chest, his tiny fingers curling into fists. \"He’s here,\" he whimpered.\n\nI didn’t look. I couldn’t. Instead, I pulled Alex into my arms, stood up, and backed toward the farthest corner of the room. My heart slammed against my ribs, every instinct screaming at me to run—but I didn’t know where to go.\n\nThen, the whisper came.\n\n\"You see me now.\"\n\nI snapped my eyes shut.\n\nIt was right there. I could feel it. A presence looming over us, stretching, growing, filling the room with something cold and unnatural. My breath came in shallow, rapid gasps.\n\nI felt something graze my cheek.\n\nI ran.\n\nI don’t remember getting to the car. I barely remember buckling Alex in, my hands fumbling as I tried to still my shaking fingers. All I remember is driving, tearing down the street at 3:15 in the morning, refusing to look in the rearview mirror.\n\nAlex sobbed quietly in the backseat. \"He knows where we’re going.\"\n\nI didn’t respond. I just kept driving.\n\nThat was three days ago.\n\nWe’re at my sister’s house now, staying in her guest room. Alex hasn’t drawn anything since we left. He still wakes up in the middle of the night, though—gasping, clutching at his face, shaking uncontrollably.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I don’t know if running was enough. Because last night, I woke up to Alex standing by the window, his hands pressed to the glass.\n\n\"He’s outside,\" he whispered. \"He wants to come in.\"\n\nAnd this morning, I found a drawing crumpled under his pillow.\n\nA sketch of my sister’s house.\n\nWith Mr. Threads standing at the front door.",

        "title": "I'm part of a submarine expedition to the deepest part of the ocean. What we found was a door, locked from the outside.",
        "author": "Cybercrustacean0",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "It looked like an old steel bulkhead, the kind you would find in the interior of an old military vessel, with those large wheels that you have to turn to open the door. \n\nOver 10,000 meters of depth and 15,200 PSI is what our equipment measured. To find anything man-made at that depth was inconceivable. I couldn't believe it.\n\nIt was on the side of an especially steep drop. The rectangle of steel, while difficult to spot, did not exactly appear natural. It stood out to me, despite the total lack of visibility. I immediately turned to my partner.\n\n“It's crazy how the darkness fucks with your brain if you stare into it long enough,” I said.\n\nThe submersible was a research submarine designed for a two-man crew, but there was barely enough space for one. Stanley was the man next to me, he was my copilot and research scientist.\n\n“I know what you're talking about,” said Stanley with a smile. “That rock looks like a cabin door, it's got the wheel and everything.”\n\n“That's exactly what I was thinking,” I leaned in to take a closer look. “Look how smooth it is, too.”\n\nIt seemed we both knew we had to take a closer look. I slowed the descent of the ship and intensified the headlights.\n\nThere, in the middle of a steep, jagged cliff, over 10,000 meters below the ocean's surface, was a door. It was impossible to mistake it for a rock formation. It had perfectly cut edges, rounded and smoothed out, completely symmetrical. It had a wheel in the center, too, which coincided with no rock I had ever seen. Without a doubt, it was a door—a steel bulkhead.\n\n“How in the world…” I said. “A shipwreck… here? It can't be in such a perfect condition,” I was whispering.\n\nWe continued our slow descent until the bulkhead was directly in front of us. I halted the submarine with the beams pointing directly at the door.\n\n“Take some pictures, and send them up along with some data,” I told Stanley.\n\nI heard Stanley clicking at the machinery. I stood still, staring into the monitor in front of me. The submarine was very small, and did not have a window to the outside. Our exterior was displayed on a small screen. I leaned in to get a closer look.\n\nMy eyes widened.\n\n“Wait, Stanley,” I said. \n\nStanley faced me.\n\n“The bottom right… look.”\n\nStanley turned his head and looked into the monitor.\n\nThere, engraved on the surface of the door, near the bottom right, was a very short collection of images. I was amazed that we had missed them before, but as I intensified the headlights again there could be no doubt that they were there.\n\nOne of them caught my attention. It was the one in the middle—the third drawing. Very minimalistic, very small, but it was the outline of a skull—a human skull. It looked more like a caricature; the forehead was a little too round, and the chin was slightly too short, it looked like a human skull drawn from memory—or at least similar to one.\n\nBut the other ones—the other five pictures—were even more unsettling. The first one, though a little wide, looked like some prehistoric skeleton, or a representation of a fossil. From there, the drawings were nearly incomprehensible.\n\nOne was a long, angular skull that coincided with no animal I had ever seen. Another looked like the depiction of a bug, maybe a wasp or mantis, only bony and cadaverous. \n\nThe one thing the images had in common was that in some way, they all looked like skulls.\n\n“What the fuck…” Stanley whispered.\n\n“Quick, take the pictures,” I was still staring into the monitor.\n\nI watched Stanley take a new snapshot, then turn to his computer. He began typing, transferring data from the submersible.\n\n“Alright, it's sending,” he said. “What do you think they are?”\n\nI was hypnotized. I couldn't stop looking at the door and the caricatures engraved onto it. \n\n“Probably a warning, like signs representing a hazard,” I said, “The middle one looks kinda like a human skull.”\n\n Whatever was in there, it didn't take a genius to understand that we weren't supposed to go inside. The lock on the outside, the depictions, the depth itself—told us everything.\n\n“Hey, Alex,” I heard Stanley say, and I snapped out of my trance. “It only makes sense to open it.”\n\nI snapped my head to the side.\n\n“Are you insane? It absolutely does not!” I raised my voice slightly. \n\nStanley stood still, looking confused. I didn't think I would need to explain myself, and I sighed.\n\n“A steel bulkhead, 10,000 meters below the ocean's surface, with half a dozen depictions of animal-like skeletons—of which all but one are familiar, sealed from the *outside*… and you want to open it?”\n\n“Well, maybe we should get the green light first, I guess. I already asked the crew,” he said.\n\n“Yeah well, the crew is gonna take my side, I promise you,” I said and Stanley shrugged. “It's probably nuclear waste or something like that, and it's *definitely* not meant to be opened.”\n\nStanley looked back at me. \n\n“Doors to nuclear waste don't have doorknobs,” Stanley said. “They're sealed airtight, welded shut, and buried with concrete.”\n\nHe had a point, but before I could say anything in response, a message arrived.\n\n<Proceed>\n\nWe stared in confusion.\n\n“They're telling us to open the door,” Stanley said.\n\n“No, they're telling us to proceed with our original mission, isn't it obvious?” I responded.\n\nThe response was extremely odd. We would typically have received detailed instructions, or at least a well-structured, professional response.\n\n“Alex, move the submarine forward, I need to get close enough to use the mechanical arms,” he said. I was shocked.\n\n“You're telling me that a group of highly trained, intelligent research scientists just gave us the go-ahead to open a watertight door with 15,000 PSI of pressure?”\n\n“The message says proceed, that's the literal definition of a go-ahead.”\n\n“Send another one, tell them to be clear this time,” I told him, though I wasn't even sure why I was entertaining the idea.\n\nI heard him typing, and I watched him closely this time. Sure enough, he asked the crew to elaborate, and sent the message.\n\nWe waited in silence for a few moments. We had been delayed enough already, I couldn't wait to leave the door behind.\n\nJust then, the message arrived.\n\n<OPEN THE DOOR>\n\nMy eyes went wide.\n\nSomething about the message made my blood freeze. It was unlike any message we had received.\n\n“I told you, Alex, now move the submarine forward,” Stanley was impatient.\n\n“I… something is wrong, they wouldn't have sent…”\n\n“Alex!” Stanley screamed.\n\nThe extremely small cabin made the sound seem louder that it should have been. It caught me off guard.\n\n“Stanley, I can't do that, you have to understand how unprofessional such a response is, the team would not have sent that,” I spoke calmly.\n\n“Well, they just did. Why are you refusing orders?”\n\n“This isn't the military, Stanley, and I'm still the captain of this vessel,” I said.\n\nStanley did not seem happy. He was anxious somehow, and he furrowed his brow in a mixture of anger and confusion.\n\n“Alex, if you don't move the sub forward, I will.”\n\nI was shocked.\n\n“Stanley, listen to me.”\n\n“Alex! If you don't move the submersible forward, I will!”\n\nSuddenly, he grabbed my wrist and squeezed.\n\n“We have the go-ahead, Alex. Move the sub.”\n\nI had never seen him like that. Stanley was a large man and his strength was far above mine, but he had always been the kindest, most lighthearted person on the team. \n\n“What—what are you doing? Let go of me!”\n\nSuddenly, he lunged forward and tried to stand. The space was too small for him to stand, and his back hit the ceiling of the cabin. His hand was still around my wrist, and his free hand was moving for the control panel.\n\nI twisted my body and managed to get out from under him. I pushed him away while having my back to the wall. It worked with great effort, and he fell back in his seat.\n\n“Move the ship forward!” He screamed, spit flying from his mouth as he did.\n\n“Stanley! Calm down!”\n\nHe seemed to be in a frenzy. His chest rose and fell rapidly, and he gripped his chair so hard that his fingernails dug into the cushions.\n\n“Stan! What is the matter with you?”\n\nI grabbed my wrist with my other hand, massaging the area. He had scratched the skin on my wrist, and had gripped so hard that the flesh was turning red.\n\n“I…” Stanley started, taking deep breaths between pauses. “I just know that we have to get closer, or else I can't use the mechanical arms to open the door.”\n\n“But why do you want to open the door?” I said in disbelief.\n\nHe made a nasty expression, as if I had said something unreasonable. He took a sharp breath through his teeth.\n\n“Alex, for the last time, if you don't move the submersible forward, I will,” he said. I saw him grip the armrest of his chair even harder.\n\n“Stanley, it would be illogical to open…”\n\nHe pushed himself off his chair and slammed into me. \n\nI was pushed back, and my head slammed against the wall beside me. I grabbed the back of my head in pain. By the time I recovered from the impact, I saw Stanley on the control panel.\n\nThe submarine was moving forward.\n\nI leaned forward, but Stanley was still leaning onto my chair, and his knee was pushing me down. I tried to push him away, but the space was so small that his back was against the ceiling, and there was no space to push him toward. \n\nI decided to grab his hands instead, and pull them away from the controls. \n\nI pulled at his hand and managed to shift it away from the lever. The rapid motion made the submarine jolt forward, and the sub crashed against the cliffside.\n\nWe were thrown forward violently, and Stanley's body smashed into the main monitor.\n\nHe turned around at me, and his face was entirely red. The look on his face was savage. He was breathing through his teeth, and his eyes were nothing but pupils.\n\nHe jumped toward me, slamming into me and scratching me with his nails. I brought my knee up and smashed it against his ribcage. He screamed, but he continued grabbing at my throat and clawing with his nails. Then, his right hand was able to close around my neck, and he squeezed with all the strength he had.\n\nI couldn't comprehend what was happening, but I wasn't going to try to talk my way out of it anymore. Stanley was my friend, but this could not have been the same man as before.\n\nI hit him as hard as I could with my knee, but his grip did not loosen, though he screamed in fury. I tried, again and again—all of my hits landing perfectly, but he would not let go.\n\nThe pressure inside my head increased. It felt as if every vein in my head was about to explode.\n\nI hit him again, and I was sure that I had felt his rib crack. Still, he only screamed, and tightened his grip.\n\nMy vision was fading, I had to think of something.\n\nI saw the monitor—the one displaying the exterior. Stanley had smashed into it, and the support had been destroyed, but it was still connected to its cable. I reached out and grabbed it, pulling at it until the cable snapped and the heavy monitor came loose.\n\nI brought it up and slammed down, connecting with the back of his neck.\n\nStanley went limp, falling on my chest.\n\nI gasped frantically, holding my neck.\n\n\n---\n\n\nI write this now, sitting in silence, trying to process what has just happened.\n\nThe monitor is gone—the submarine's sight is gone. Stanley's body is limp against me, as I have been unable to push him away in the cramped space, which is now claustrophobic. The only camera left is the one that is connected to the claw of a mechanical arm outside.\n\nI am writing this on Stanley's computer. As I do, I keep receiving the same, exact message.\n\n<TURN THE WHEEL>\n\nThe apparatus that controls the mechanical arms outside is still intact. I know that if I simply reach over, and use the small camera to find the wheel, I can open the door.\n\nI want to move the submersible away—to start my ascent to the surface. Trust me, I do, but I can't.\n\nThe ballast systems, no matter what I do, won't respond. I am stuck here.\n\nI have asked for help, but I only receive the same message…\n\n<TURN THE WHEEL>\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI say that because, after all of this—after what happened to Stanley—and without knowing why, I really—**really**—want to listen.\n\nI really want to turn the wheel.\n\nWorst of all, I don't even know why.\n\n---\n\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/s1snUstXsm)\n ",

        "content": "Growing up, my grandmother had one strict rule at the dinner table: *always leave one bite on your plate.*\n\nIt didn’t matter if it was rice, soup, or even a single piece of bread—no meal was ever to be finished completely.\n\nI asked her why once, when I was about eight. She just shook her head, her wrinkled fingers tightening around her spoon. *“You must always leave something behind, or he’ll think you’re inviting him in.”*\n\nI pressed her for more, but she refused to explain. The way her voice wavered, the way her eyes darted toward the darkened windows of our small home—it was enough to shut me up.\n\nI assumed *he* was just some folklore monster, like the aswang or manananggal—something made up to scare kids into obedience. But even my parents obeyed the rule. My father, who never believed in ghost stories, always made sure to leave one last bite.\n\nSo I obeyed too.\n\nThat was years ago.\n\nI live alone now, in a small apartment in the city, far from the quiet countryside where I grew up. Life gets busy. Old habits fade.\n\nLast week, I had a long day at work and came home exhausted. I microwaved some leftover chicken and rice, then plopped onto my couch to eat in front of the TV. I was so distracted that I didn’t even realize I had cleared my plate.\n\nAt that moment, something shifted.\n\nIt was subtle, just a strange, crawling sensation down my spine. Not fear exactly, but… wrongness. Like an unseen weight pressing against my shoulders.\n\nI laughed at myself. I was being ridiculous.\n\nI put my plate in the sink, brushed my teeth, and went to bed.\n\n# 3:12 AM.\n\nA sound woke me—soft at first, then growing louder. **Silverware clinking against porcelain.**\n\nMy stomach tightened. My apartment was silent otherwise. The sound was coming from the kitchen.\n\nMy breath hitched as I sat up. I told myself it was nothing—the sink settling, my mind playing tricks. But something deep inside me knew better.\n\nI climbed out of bed, stepping carefully over the creaky floorboards. The apartment was cold, much colder than it should’ve been. I reached the kitchen doorway and peered inside.\n\nThe air left my lungs.\n\nMy plate was on the counter. The same one I had emptied hours ago.\n\nAnd sitting in the very center was **a single bite of food.**\n\nI hadn’t put it there.\n\nA chill ran down my spine. I turned to check the front door, but it was still locked. The windows, too. My apartment was empty.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nThen I heard it.\n\nThe sound of **chewing.**\n\nWet, smacking, **hungry.**\n\nAnd breathing.\n\nHot, damp breath brushed the back of my neck.\n\nI turned so fast I nearly tripped. But there was nothing behind me.\n\nThe light flickered. The air grew thick, suffocating. The smell hit me next—**rotting meat.**\n\nAnd then, a voice. Low. Whispering. **Right beside my ear.**\n\n*\"You forgot my share.\"*\n\nMy entire body locked up.\n\nThe room around me warped—**no, not the room. The air itself.** The shadows in the corners seemed deeper now, stretching toward me like grasping fingers.\n\nAnd then—**pressure.**\n\nA deep, sickening weight pressed into my stomach. I gasped, my hands flying to my abdomen.\n\nFingers.\n\n**Long. Yellowed. Jagged.**\n\nThey weren’t cutting. They were **pulling.**\n\nSomething warm and wet spilled down my legs. I choked, my vision tilting, my body convulsing. The fingers inside me twisted, yanking something loose—something *important*.\n\nI collapsed, my head striking the floor. The world blurred, swimming in and out of focus. My breaths came in ragged, wheezing gasps.\n\nI tried to move, but the fingers still held me, caressing, exploring. **Taking.**\n\nThrough my fading vision, I saw it.\n\nA shape—impossibly tall, its limbs too long, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. Its eyes—**black voids, hollow and dripping**—stared down at me.\n\nIt **smiled.**\n\nAnd then, darkness.\n\n# I woke up in my bed.\n\nSunlight streamed through my window. My heart pounded, my body drenched in sweat.\n\nI sat up too fast, nearly throwing up from the nausea. My hands flew to my stomach. No blood. No wounds.\n\nJust a dream.\n\nJust a **horrible, horrible dream.**\n\nI let out a shaky breath and swung my legs over the bed. My body felt… wrong. Weak. Empty. Like something inside me was **missing.**\n\nI forced myself to stand and walked to the kitchen. Maybe some water would help. Maybe—\n\nI froze.\n\nMy plate was still on the counter.\n\nAnd on it, sitting neatly in the center—\n\n**A single bite of food.**\n\nThe apartment filled with a sound. A horrible, **wet chuckle.**\n\nAnd behind me, a whisper—so close I felt the breath in my ear.\n\n*\"You should've left me more.\"*",

        "author": "Less-Consequence1823",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "You won't find the app in any of the app stores and even a Google search doesn’t turn up results. To download it you need to scan the QR referral code of someone who's already using the app. That feature makes it feel like you’re joining an exclusive club. If a friend offers to let you scan their code, under no circumstances should you take them up on it. That friend is as good as dead to you. Trust me when I say from experience, this isn’t a club you want to be a member of. \n\n\n\nWhatever you do, do not download it. \n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI was at the bar with my buddy Matt when he convinced me to download the app. We're both broke with a ton of student loans, so aside from the occasional two dollar pint night at our local dive, drinking anything other than store bought booze was a rarity for us. But Matt had said a celebration was in order and that he was paying, which was enough to get me off of my couch for happy hour. \n\n\n\nHe milked the situation, refusing to tell me exactly what we were celebrating until we were a few beers in. Sick of waiting for an explanation, I guessed it was a new job, and Matt gave a mischievous grin. \n\n\n\n\"It's way better than that,\" he said. \"It's an app called TskTask.\"\n\n\n\nI rolled my eyes. We'd both tried every gig app out there. When I'd get sick of switching between Uber and Lyft and washing sorority girls' puke out of the backseat of my car, I'd drive for DoorDash for a few weeks until the smell of fast food started to make me nauseous. After that I'd hustle for gigs on Fiverr, or pick up odd jobs on TaskRabbit. Then the cycle would start over again. Most days, my circumstances felt inescapable. The last thing I needed was another app to slowly chip away at my sanity as I struggled to cobble together enough cash to cover rent and utilities. I told Matt as much. \n\n\n\n\"Screw those other apps,\" Matt said. \"This is the easiest money I've ever made.\" \n\n\n\nI have to admit I was intrigued. Matt never gets excited about anything so part of me wanted to see what had turned him into a die-hard so fast. The other part of me was gullible enough to believe there might actually be such a thing as easy money that didn’t involve the lottery or an inheritance. It didn’t take much badgering from Matt before I scanned his code and clicked the link. The link took me to a nondescript website with nothing but a download button. Seconds later, the app was on my phone. \n\n\n\nThe app itself was barebones, like Venmo but with even fewer frills. Nothing but a few tabs - one for my own QR referral should I want to pass it along, one for linking my bank account, and one showing my current balance of $0. In the middle of the otherwise mostly blank screen were the words: *You have no new tasks*.\n\n\n\nBefore I could accuse Matt of tricking me into downloading malware, he cut me off. \"I know what you're thinking but just wait for a task,\" he said. \"I was sketched out too after Rachel referred me.\" \n\n\n\nThe fact that Rachel was using it eased my concerns. Rachel's this girl Matt hooks up with on occasion. I'd only met her a few times at Matt’s, but from what I could tell she didn't seem like the type of person to get into anything that wasn't legit. Aside from the fact that she went to film school so she has even more debt than we do with fewer employable skills to show for it. \n\n\n\n\"When you say the easiest money you've ever made...\" I asked, trailing off. \n\n\n\n\"I've already made eight hundred bucks since downloading it yesterday, and that's not counting the referral fee you just got me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I hope they paid you well to rope me into your weird pyramid scheme,\" I joked. \n\n\n\n\"Yeah they did.\" Matt held up his own app to show me a thousand dollars had just been deposited into his account. \n\n\n\n\"Jesus. Is that for real?\" \n\n\n\n\"The money transfers, if that's what you're asking.\" \n\n\n\n\"If this ends up being a scam, at least I know how much our friendship is worth to you.\" \n\n\n\n\"Oh, they way overpaid then,\" he said. He laughed and flagged down the bartender for another round. \n\n\n\nWe moved on to chatting about movie trailers and how there was barely anything coming out that we wanted to see. I'd almost forgotten about the app altogether when my phone buzzed twenty minutes later with my first task. I read it and reread it, mystified and more than a little creeped out by the words on the screen.\n\n\n\n*Piss on the bathroom floor. You have 5 minutes to complete the task.*\n\n\n\n\"Dude, you made it seem like I'd be less sketched out when I got my first task,\" I said. \"Is this a joke? What kind of sick person created this?\" \n\n\n\nMatt read my task and snorted. \"Yeah that’s a weird one. But a hundred bucks is a hundred bucks.\" \n\n\n\nI looked at my phone again. Sure enough, the app was offering me a hundred dollars for the task. Below that a timer was counting down, already at 4:27. \n\n\n\n\"There's no way I'm doing that for a hundred dollars.\" \n\n\n\n\"So wait for one that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside,\" Matt said. \"Or...\" \n\n\n\n\"Or what? Piss on the floor that someone's going to have to clean?\" \n\n\n\n\"You know how many guys are going to end up doing that tonight anyway? At least you'd get paid for it.\" \n\n\n\n\"It's a dick move.\" \n\n\n\n\"People are dicks all the time.\" \n\n\n\n\"Have you gotten one like this?\" \n\n\n\n\"The first one I got was knocking over a display stand at Publix.\"\n\n\n\n\"And you did it?\"\n\n\n\n\"For fifty bucks, hell yeah I did. It was no big deal. I apologized and went on with my day.\" \n\n\n\n\"How are you not more creeped out by this whole thing? How does it even know where we are or that you've completed the task?\" \n\n\n\n\"The same way every app does. By spying on you. Using location sharing to see who you're with. I mean, how does Instagram know to show me ads for tampons every time I hang out with you?\" \n\n\n\n\"You're an asshole.\" \n\n\n\nMatt shrugged. \n\n\n\n\"Who is even paying for this? Like it doesn't make sense. All the other gig apps are connecting workers with clients and taking a cut. There's no upside to this for anyone but the people who do the tasks.\" \n\n\n\n\"My money's on Zuck. Or some other billionaire. Think about it. They're bored of all the luxe stuff. They've got more money than anyone could spend in a lifetime. What else are they going to use it for but to laugh at all the dumb shit people will do if you pay them?\" \n\n\n\n\"Yeah I'm not really interested in being part of someone's messed up social experiment.\" I checked my phone again. The timer was down to a little over two minutes. I scanned the app for a decline button but didn't see one. \"How do I decline the task?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\"No clue, I haven't declined one.\"\n\n\n\nSince there wasn't an option to decline, I decided to test the app. If someone wanted to mess with me, I'd mess with them right back. I went to the bathroom but didn’t do anything. Just waited a minute, washed my hands and returned to the bar. \n\n\n\nI checked my phone just as the timer ran out. A frowny face appeared on screen, then the app went black. \n\n\n\nMatt's phone buzzed a few seconds later. He checked it and laughed.\n\n\n\n\"What? Did you get a task? What is it?\"\n\n\n\nMatt smirked at me before holding out his phone for me to read. I barely had time to register the words \"*Slap your friend*\" before I felt Matt's hand connect with my face. \n\n\n\nThe smack jolted me off balance, and I jumped up to keep from falling over. \"What the fuck?!\" I could feel everyone staring at us. I couldn't tell if my cheek was burning from the slap or the embarrassment. \n\n\n\nMatt held up his hands in apology. \"I'm sorry dude but two hundred bucks was too good to pass up.\" \n\n\n\nHaving seen the exchange, the bartender made his way over with an annoyed look. \n\n\n\n\"I think that's enough for you two,\" the bartender said. \n\n\n\n\"All good,\" Matt replied. \"We'll just close out.\" \n\n\n\nThe bartender shook his head and went to the register to ring Matt up. Matt's phone buzzed again as the bartender returned with the check. Matt checked it and winced. Then he took a big swig of beer and spit it like a fountain all over the bartender. The bartender turned red as security stormed over and grabbed Matt by the back of his shirt, dragging him towards the door. \n\n\n\n\"Sorry sorry,\" Matt said. \"It was just a joke!\" \n\n\n\n\"Hope it was funny cuz you're 86'd.\" \n\n\n\n\"Sign the tab and tip him good,\" Matt called back to me as security shoved him outside. \n\n\n\nI picked up the pen to sign the tab when my phone buzzed on the bartop. I saw the alert from TskTask and told myself not to check it, but my curiosity got the better of me. I clicked it. The task read: *Do not leave a tip. Write FUCK YOU instead.*\n\n\n\nEvery alarm bell in my head was going off. This went well beyond location sharing and listening in on conversations. I looked around the bar, sure I'd find someone in here watching us, pulling the strings to see how far we could be pushed. But I didn't see anyone who didn't seem to be here for a normal bar outing. And the way everyone was side-eyeing me like I was an exhibit in a freakshow suggested they were not in on whatever was happening. \n\n\n\nI looked back at my phone. $250 to write Fuck You instead of leaving a tip. I felt my face flush with shame as I wrote the words, but I had to know if this was for real or not. I was positive I'd walk outside to find Matt had been screwing with me, somehow faking the alerts. \n\n\n\nI turned the receipt face down and scurried out before anyone could read what I'd written. By the time I stepped outside the app was alerting me that I was now two hundred and fifty dollars richer. \n\n\n\nIn the midst of so many emotions and my desire to get away, at the time it didn’t cross my mind that out of all the sketchy aspects of the app, I'd just encountered the biggest red flag of all. That slap from Matt wasn't a random task. It was a warning. \n\n\n\nNot following orders had consequences. \n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nMatt wanted to go somewhere else and keep celebrating our \"good luck\" as he called it, but once the adrenaline faded I felt hungover and on edge so I went home. The whole thing felt wrong on multiple levels, so I decided not to go on the app for a while. Still, I needed some proof that the whole thing wasn't a hoax so I transferred the money to my bank and sure enough it showed up. \n\n\n\nAs easy as the money had been, I had a knot in my stomach about it, though I struggled to articulate why. Part of it was being watched. All the unanswered questions about who was behind the app and why anyone would create it. But I think something about it also felt manipulative. Like I was just a puppet in some messed up game I didn't understand. \n\n\n\nBut I can't deny I had felt an immediate rush along with whatever pang of guilt came from stiffing the bartender. Like the app had tapped into some impulse I hadn't even known was there. *Did I want to do that?* *Had the app made me take the smallest step towards some darkness lurking inside of me?* \n\n\n\nI accepted some rideshare requests hoping to distract myself. But even those reminded me how I was trapped driving, having leased a car to be able to drive for the apps and now needing to accept a certain number of rides to make my payments each month. \n\n\n\nIt wasn't even midnight before I found myself shampooing the floor mats in the backseat after some drunk kid puked on the ride home from a bar. *Screw this*, I thought. I opened TskTask and waited. \n\n\n\nNo tasks showed up. I refreshed the app, but still nothing. I figured they just didn't have the bandwidth to monitor the app 24/7, but looking back, again, I think it was conditioning me to want more tasks. Like the app was negging me, making me feel unworthy so I’d be grateful when it paid attention to me again.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until the next day that a new task showed up. I won't bore you with all the details of the tasks I accepted over the next few days to chip away at my debt, except to say that they seemed mostly mundane, if pretty dickish. \n\n\n\nAt first they were basic - things like spitting gum where someone's guaranteed to step in it, bumping into a kid with ice cream so they drop it, ringing someone's doorbell in the middle of the night and ditching. \n\n\n\nI realize now that they were escalating, though I barely noticed at the time. Seventy-two hours after refusing to piss on a bathroom floor, I was doing things like taking a package off a neighbor's porch and tossing it in the dumpster and calling a random number to leave a message telling someone their sister had died. \n\n\n\nRobert Cialdini wrote this book, *Influence*, that I read a while back. In it he talks about the psychological tactic enemy soldiers used to turn patriotic American POWs against their own country. See, no true patriot will immediately talk crap about their homeland, but if you can get them to admit that the US isn't perfect, it's a slippery slope. Something in the mind makes you double down on things you said in the past. So once they’d admitted the US wasn't perfect, they were willing to talk about the flaws in more detail. With a bit of patience, the enemy soldiers would have American POWs publicly denouncing American values altogether. They never even noticed the concessions they were making until it was too late to turn back. \n\n\n\nLike those soldiers, I didn't fully recognize that I was leaping across lines I never would have crossed before Matt introduced me to the app. \n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe first time I truly had a chance to recognize how far I'd strayed arrived about a week after I accepted the first task. \n\n\n\nI hadn't gone back to my other gig apps since the vomit incident; I made way too much accepting tasks for what felt like far less effort. But for whatever reason I still don't like to think of myself as a \"gig\" worker. Yes, I take gigs, but knowing I might need something on my resume, I occasionally work part-time for a company doing data entry. It's already mind-numbing work for a little above minimum wage, but returning to it this time was downright painful. \n\n\n\nUp to this point, I had had to leave the app open in the background for it to assign me tasks, but halfway through the morning my phone lit up with a notification even though I was pretty sure I had closed the app and my phone was on focus mode. The funny thing is I had been wishing for something to break the monotony of the work, and here it was, my desire fulfilled. \n\n\n\n*Email \\[redacted folder name\\] to \\[redacted email address\\]. You have 90 seconds to complete the task.*\n\n\n\nMy pulse quickened as I read the notification. On the one hand, I knew it was wrong and probably illegal. On the other hand, as far as I had been told, the company did not deal in sensitive information that would interest the public. The bulk of the data I even had access to was mundane user analytics the company sold to advertisers. I quickly rationalized the task, though I suspected it would likely be the end of my working there. I'd already decided to do it before I even registered that it paid a whopping two grand, by far the most I'd been offered for any task up to that point.\n\n\n\nIt took all of thirty seconds before the money was on its way to my bank account. I got a huge hit of adrenaline, something I'd started to crave lately. My head buzzing, I focused as much as I could until lunch. Upon my return, I wasn't remotely fazed to learn my supervisor wanted to see me in her office. \n\n\n\nShe was shockingly nice about the entire thing. She did not immediately fire me though she was well within her right to. Instead, she gave me a chance to explain myself. A look of confusion came over her when I declined, and she politely let me go. Like I said, I had been told - by her specifically - that we did not deal in particularly sensitive information, so the way she handled the whole thing tracked. But when I looked back one final time, I saw something on her face that made me think otherwise: dread. She looked terrified. \n\n\n\nThe next day I understood why when I saw on the news that the company was shuttering its doors after a data breach. The pang of guilt I felt over potentially costing a lot of people their jobs was quickly replaced by a fear of the possible repercussions. I wondered if I would be thrown under the bus in the company's attempts to cover their tail.\n\n\n\nAs if it could read my mind, my phone lit up with a notification informing me I'd received a five thousand dollar \"Employee Loyalty Bonus\". \n\n\n\nThe familiar mix of elation at the huge pay day and knot-inducing chills from being involved in something so strange crept in and I managed to shake off any remorse I felt. I fell into the now routine act of rationalizing away what I had done. Whereas before I had told myself no one was really getting hurt by my actions, this time I focused on the fact that clearly the company had been doing something shady or else a seemingly innocuous folder wouldn't have been enough to bring them down. \n\n\n\n*Fuck them for doing something that put me in this position in the first place,* I thought. \n\n\n\nIt wasn't the first time I had gotten angry that week. Getting angry anytime guilt or shame started to creep in over a task had become a pattern for me. \n\n\n\nLike a lot of you reading this, I did what I was “supposed” to do. I went to college. I studied something \"useful\". But the jobs in what I studied were mostly in bigger cities, far away from family circumstances that required me to be close to home. And even if I could have moved, the entry level pay wouldn't have covered the cost of living before I took my loans into account. It didn't matter what I did or where I went, life was shaping up to be one big hamster wheel. \n\n\n\nEverywhere around me, I heard folks complaining about how hard it was to find good workers, workers who care about the job, who are loyal. Well what did they think was going to happen when they filled our heads with dreams of cushy office jobs and home ownership, loaded us up on debt and then offered us one fucking way to pay it off – by staring at a register or a screen doing absolute bullshit for $15 an hour (if we're lucky) for 10-12 hours a day? \n\n\n\nWe were sold a bill of goods. The American dream is dead and gone, but the older generations are still doling out advice based on their experience of a steady paycheck and a reasonable mortgage. And on the flip side, every time we open a fucking app, some rich influencer is saying that if we follow our passion we'll find more freedom and success than we ever thought possible. But both sides are speaking from a place of having already found success. And every single one of them is positive the only thing that factors into that success is good old hard work. \n\n\n\nSo of course most of us end up juggling multiple gigs, trapped in the hustle economy. At least that way we have some semblance of control over our lives. Sure, we have crippling student loans that our best hope of paying off is the government stepping in to forgive, and yeah, buying even an outhouse is a pipe dream, but at least we get to clock in and clock out as we want, quit when we get bored. Give rides or deliver food; yolo what little we have into crypto or curate our own social feeds on the off chance fortune might rain down on us and lift us out of the endless grind. \n\n\n\nI'm not proud of how little I hesitated accepting these tasks. It legitimately felt like, for the first time, I had a way out of the rat race. *So what if I had to be a dick to do it?* Jeff Bezos wouldn't even let his employees take a proper bathroom break and look where he ended up. \n\n\n\nNot long after I thought I had perfected the art of justifying my actions, I got the task that finally changed my mind. \n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe day before I downloaded the app, I had made plans for the following weekend with a woman I’d matched with on Hinge. I’d been anxious about the date when I committed to it, worried we’d be limited to the cheapest margaritas I could afford along with complimentary chips and salsa. Telling my dates I’d had a late lunch and wasn’t hungry enough for dinner had become my go-to move on the dating scene, but that night was different. Because I could finally afford to go somewhere nice. I texted her back to let her know we were still on and told her where to meet me.\n\n\n\nWe met up at a spot local foodies love and hit it off immediately. When I say it was the best date I’ve ever been on, I’m not exaggerating. We bonded over the things we had in common, laughed our asses off ribbing each other about the things we disagreed on, and kept the tapas and fancy cocktails flowing for two hours before things went south. When my date announced she needed to use the restroom, I felt my phone buzz in my pocket. As she was walking away, I checked the task I’d just been assigned. \n\n\n\n*Tell the woman in red to hurry up and get it over with.*\n\n\n\nI looked around the restaurant and saw a woman in a red coat sitting alone a few tables over. She was lost in thought, running a finger around the rim of her martini glass. I checked my phone again and frowned in confusion. *Get what over with?*\n\n\n\nI didn’t consider the question for long enough. I had gotten greedy. I happily ignored all the details about the woman that might have stopped me from going over there. It didn’t seem like it could possibly be that big a deal. But the payout alone should have been enough of a red flag. If I’d received 7K in total to destroy a company, how innocent could a task worth 10K have been? \n\n\n\nI got up and walked over. I was already speaking before the woman even realized I was there. \"Hurry up and get it over with,\" I said. I registered shock on her face as my words sunk in, but she didn't say a word. I didn't say anything else, just returned to my seat. \n\n\n\n\"What was that about?\" my date asked, having seen the exchange as she came back from the bathroom. \n\n\n\n\"Oh nothing,\" I said, staring at my phone expectantly. \"Don't worry about it.\" I grinned as my phone alerted me that I was ten thousand dollars richer. \"What should we order next?\" \n\n\n\nBut my date wasn't looking at me. She was staring in horror as the woman in red left the restaurant in tears. We didn't have a view of the street outside, but we could clearly hear the screech of tires and the screams of patrons close enough to the window to see the woman in red walk into oncoming traffic. \n\n\n\nMy date didn't look at me again until she was giving the police her statement. By the time the cops had quit asking me questions about what I said to the woman in red and decided I wasn't involved in her death, my date was long gone. \n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThat was the last straw. This time I couldn't rationalize away the guilt and shame. This app was evil. There was no more pretending that wasn’t the case. Whether there were flesh and blood employees behind it or some sinister presence, I didn't know. But the evil nature of it was undeniable. \n\n\n\nI went home and deleted the app. I sent Matt a string of texts asking him what he'd gotten me into. I called him several times, but each time it went straight to voicemail. I wished my roommates weren’t out of town as I was desperate to talk to someone, anyone, about what had happened. Instead, I could only smoke and drink myself into an oblivion as I waited for a reply from Matt, finally falling asleep around 4AM. \n\n\n\nI woke at 9AM to frantic banging on the door. It was Matt, eyes bloodshot with dark crescent moons carved into his lower lids. \n\n\n\nBefore I could lay into him he had pushed his way inside and started closing the blinds. \n\n\n\n\"I fucked up man,\" he said. \"I fucking fucked up. I shouldn’t have gotten you involved.”\n\n\n\n\"No shit, dude. I had to delete the app.\" \n\n\n\n\"You can't delete it.\"\n\n\n\n\"What?\" \n\n\n\n\"It keeps coming back. You have to get rid of your phone. And even then… I’m not sure.\" \n\n\n\nI checked my phone and sure enough, it was front and center. I deleted it again and watched it disappear, but when I scrolled to my next screen it had already reappeared.\n\n\n\n\"What the fuck is this thing, Matt?\"\n\n\n\nHe didn't answer, his face catatonic now. That’s when I finally noticed he had blood on his shirt. \n\n\n\n“What happened? Where’s that blood from?”\n\n\n\nHe sat on the floor and hugged his knees as he started rocking in place. \n\n\n\n“I fucked up, I fucking fucked up. They’re dead. They’re dead. They’re dead.” He just kept repeating the words over and over like a broken record, making my skin crawl.\n\n\n\n“Who’s dead?” \n\n\n\n“All of them. Because I wouldn’t do it.” \n\n\n\n“Wouldn’t do what?” \n\n\n\n“I couldn’t do it. I tried. But I couldn’t.”\n\n\n\n“Whatever it is, we’ll go to the police and get it straightened out. We’ll tell them about the app,” I said. \n\n\n\n“We can’t go to them. They’ll blame me.” \n\n\n\n“For what? Just tell me what happened.” \n\n\n\n“You don’t get it,” he snapped. “We can’t. They’re listening. They know what we’re doing.”\n\n\n\n“OK,” I said, trying to calm him down. “All right. Why don’t you take a shower and get cleaned up? Then you can tell me what happened and we’ll figure out what to do.”\n\n\n\nShortly after I got him in the shower, someone knocked on the door. By the time I looked out the window, a delivery truck was driving away. I cracked the door and saw a small box on the front step. I picked it up and shook it. Whatever was inside thudded around. I locked the door behind me and carried the box to the kitchen. \n\n\n\n“Is someone here?” Matt called from the shower. \n\n\n\n“Just Amazon. All good.” \n\n\n\nI cut open the box and stared in confusion. Inside was a revolver. My phone buzzed. An alert from TskTask. My hand shook as I checked it. \n\n\n\n*Matt’s services are no longer needed. Terminate his employment. You have five minutes to complete the task.*\n\n\n\nA wave of nausea hit me. \n\n\n\nI thought about calling 911, but I realized Matt might be right. I had no idea what to tell them. *There’s an evil app that wants me to murder my friend?* Good luck with that.\n\n\n\nI decided to call Rachel. She was the only other person I knew of who was involved with this thing, maybe she’d have some information or know what to do. I started to ask Matt if he could recall her number when I remembered he’d texted us both when we all went to a party together a few months back. I searched through my texts and found the chat. \n\n\n\nRachel picked up almost immediately. \n\n\n\n“Hello?” \n\n\n\n“Rachel? It’s Matt’s friend, Spencer.” I kept my voice down and went to my room. “Something happened. I don’t even know where to start–”\n\n\n\n“Where’s Matt?” \n\n\n\n“He’s here. In the shower. I think they want me to–”\n\n\n\n“Not over the phone. I’m close by. I’ll be right over.”\n\n\n\nI hung up and noticed the shower had stopped. I walked back out to the living room to find Matt, still wet but now dressed in the clothes I’d left for him. His back was turned but I could see the empty box next to him on the floor. \n\n\n\n“What’s the task?” he asked. \n\n\n\n“Matt, I wasn’t going to–”\n\n\n\nHe turned and aimed the gun at me. \n\n\n\n“I’m serious. I wasn’t. I would never… just put down the gun and let’s talk.” \n\n\n\n“Shut the fuck up and let me think.” With his free hand he clutched his head, his face scrunching up as he held back a sob. He took a deep breath and let it out. “I’m sorry, man.” \n\n\n\nHe gripped the gun tighter, his finger moved to the trigger. A car door slammed outside and got his attention. He hesitated as he turned to look. I jumped in his direction and tackled him. \n\n\n\nThe gun skidded across the floor. \n\n\n\nHe thrashed at me as I held him down. \n\n\n\n“Stop,” I said. “I’m not trying to hurt you.” \n\n\n\nThe fight went out of him and he quit struggling. \n\n\n\n“I’m going to stand up now,” I told him. “Are you going to be calm?” \n\n\n\nHe nodded. I stood and moved to the window, peering through the blinds to see Rachel walking up the front steps. \n\n\n\n“It’s just Rachel,” I told him. The three of us are going to figure this out together. OK?” \n\n\n\nMatt didn’t say anything but he sat up. I unlocked the door and had it halfway open when a sickening realization hit me: *Rachel had never been to my place before and I didn’t give her my address.* \n\n\n\nI was already slamming the door when she raised her own gun and fired. \n\n\n\nRelief washed over me as I realized she’d missed. I dropped to the floor, reached up and deadbolted the door. I turned around and pressed my back against the wall. \n\n\n\nBut from this angle I could see that she hadn’t missed after all. \n\n\n\nMatt’s lifeless eyes stared at me from the carpet, blood pooling around the hole in his head. \n\n\n\nSteady methodical thumping came from the door, the sound of Rachel kicking at it. \n\n\n\nI scrambled to grab the revolver from where it had skidded across the floor when I tackled Matt. I aimed it at the door and yelled out. \n\n\n\n“Please don’t make me shoot you, Rachel. Just leave.” \n\n\n\n“I can’t,” she called back, her voice cracking. “They have my sister. I gave them… I told her…” \n\n\n\nShe couldn’t finish the sentence. Bullets peppered the door around the lock. She kicked it again, the frame splintering. \n\n\n\nI pulled the trigger, hoping a warning shot would scare her off. \n\n\n\nClick. Nothing.\n\n\n\nI pulled the trigger again. \n\n\n\nClick. Nothing.\n\n\n\nThey’d sent me an unloaded gun. A twisted test that I’d apparently failed. \n\n\n\nI ran to the garage and climbed in my car. I had no idea where Rachel was but I wasn’t waiting around to find out. \n\n\n\nI pushed the garage door button. The door hummed as it rose slowly. Rachel’s boots appeared just outside. I didn’t hesitate. I turned the ignition and shifted into drive. I slammed on the gas, bursting through the door and catching Rachel off guard. \n\n\n\nHer upper body slammed into the hood of the car even as she fired the gun at me through the windshield. \n\n\n\nUnable to see with bits of garage door blocking my view, I swerved across the lawn and plowed into the mailbox, sandwiching Rachel’s body against it. \n\n\n\nTears burned my eyes as I climbed out of the car and crawled towards Rachel’s body. \n\n\n\nNeighbors had emerged from their homes. If they’d been disturbed by the gunshots, they’d hidden behind closed doors. Now that the threat seemed neutralized, they exited to witness the gruesome aftermath. \n\n\n\nI leaned over Rachel’s dying body. “I’m sorry,” I cried. “I didn’t want to.” \n\n\n\nHer mouth flapped uselessly as she tried to speak. I moved closer to hear what she was saying. “My sister… They said they’d let her quit if I… please help her...” \n\n\n\n“Who are they?” I asked. But Rachel was gone. \n\n\n\nI noticed blood dripping onto the lawn near Rachel’s arm. I looked down to see I’d caught a bullet in the shoulder. I heard sirens as I passed out next to her body. \n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI awoke in the hospital to find an officer sitting with me. I tried to sit up. \n\n\n\n“Stay down,” she said. “You were hurt pretty bad, but you’re going to be OK. Your parents have been notified and they’re on the way.” \n\n\n\n“I didn’t… it wasn’t…” I had no idea where to begin. \n\n\n\n“You don’t have to say anything. You’re not in any trouble. The neighbors’ reports made it pretty clear it was self-defense. The two deceased turned out to be some pretty big drug dealers and you got caught in the crossfire. But you’re lucky. Things could have been a lot worse for you.” \n\n\n\n“That’s not what happened,” I said. \n\n\n\nShe looked at me for a while, taking me in. Then she said, “You’re not thinking straight. Get some rest and we can chat later if you still want to.” \n\n\n\nThe cop stood up and walked out of the room. I noticed a phone on the table between my bed and the chair she’d been sitting in.\n\n\n\n“Hey, you left your phone,” I called out. \n\n\n\nShe turned back and shook her head as she held up a cell. “Mine’s right here. I’m pretty sure that’s yours.”\n\n\n\nThe phone buzzed on the table, giving me instant chills. A single notification lit up the screen.\n\n\n\n*You have a new task.*",

        "content": "There is a certain shop called Fleur in New York City where magical objects can be purchased, rented, stored, or utilized, but only if you have extraordinary means and the right connections. It isn’t the sort of place you can simply walk into: customers can only gain entrance through referral, and all visits are by appointment only.\n\nI’m what you might call nouveau riche. No Vanderbilts or Astors populate my family tree, but I’ve done well for myself, and in the end, money is money. I manage a few important funds, and many of my clients have powerful ties that go back to the days of New Amsterdam. It was one such client that made an introduction for me at Fleur.\n\nThere was no email or even a phone call, simply a red envelope that arrived with a white card inside, listing my name, an address in Manhattan and an 8:00pm appointment. The calligraphy was elegant and precise.\n\nIt was August, hot, and the sun was just setting behind the tall buildings to the west. I arrived promptly, as I always do, to find a three-story building built of brown bricks. Two Grecian columns bordered a white door a few steps above street level, but the place was otherwise unpretentious, ordinary, even.\n\nI knocked once and heard footsteps shuffling slowly toward the door, which soon opened to reveal a woman in her 50’s dressed plainly in jeans and a loose-fitting white shirt.\n\n“You must be Tara,” she said. “I’m Inge, the proprietress. Please, follow me.”\n\nI took a step inside, carefully closing the door behind me. Inside, the house was cozy and clean. I’d expected a crowded maze packed with objects. Instead, we passed an ordinary sitting room with threadbare couches and a kitchen with basic appliances and outdated tile countertops.\n\n“It’s not what I expected,” I said, knowing the words were rude even as they left my mouth.\n\n“When I was younger, I was vain,” said Inge. She had a bit of a Midwest accent that made me want to discount anything she said. “I had plenty of tools at my disposal, and I’d show up at that door glammed up to make men drool and women jealous. In the end, it brought me more trouble that joy. I should have listened to my father. He ran this place for decades before he handed me the keys. He always said it’s best to hide in plain sight. Now, I see the wisdom in that.”\n\nFor a moment, something in the periphery of my vision flickered, and in Inge’s place I glanced a much taller, thinner woman in a glittering evening gown. Her red hair shimmered like it had been woven with strands of tinsel and fell halfway down her back. Black and green tattoos snaked down her arms; the inks moved slowly beneath her skin.\n\nAs I followed her into an austere office, the flicker went away, and I saw the plain version of her again, smiling at me as if we now shared a secret.\n\n“So,” she said. “I’m aware of your situation. I sympathize.”\n\n“Do you have children?” I asked, and she shook her head.\n\n“I’ve never wanted them,” she said. “It complicates this line of work. Certain clients see fit to threaten your family’s safety if they can’t get what they want. Things get quite ugly.”\n\nShe said this with an air of someone who’d crossed many dangerous people and come out on top. I thought it best not to inquire further.\n\n“I’ve tried all the normal methods,” I said. “Hormones, IUI, IVF—” I was trying not to betray any emotion, but I felt my chest constricting. I’d hate myself if I cried in front of this stranger. “I just thought if maybe you had some kind of ointment maybe? Or a charm? Jesus, I can’t believe I’m saying this out loud.”\n\nShe held out a hand, gesturing for me to do the same. Then she took hold of my wrist and spit in my open palm. I tried to draw it back, but her grip was far stronger than it should have been. She rubbed her thumb in small circles all around my skin until the spit was spread evenly. Then, finally, she released me and slowly nodded.\n\n“Unfortunately, none of the usual methods will work in your case,” she said. “There’s something blocking you.”\n\n“Blocking me?” I tried not to sound too unduly skeptical. *Like a diaphragm?* I wanted to add, but I bit my tongue.\n\n“Yes. Something powerful that even I can’t quite see.”\n\nNow I rolled my eyes. Of course. My bullshit meter was going into hyperdrive: I could almost sense that sales pitch coming. *Of course* I had a one in a million problem that would require a very expensive solution, right?\n\n“Sounds like you can’t help me then,” I said, standing.\n\n“No,” she said. “You can help yourself. But only if you want it badly enough.”\n\nI hesitated for a moment. I could always try the IVF again. A new method was being pioneered down at the Mayo Clinic, something to do with treating the ovaries with stem cells, maybe? But I could only imagine it ending in utter, expensive failure.\n\nAnd then there was the other issue. Marlon, my boyfriend of eight years, had thrown his hands up at the whole thing, frustrated at my tenacity, which he called obsession. A few days earlier, after our latest fight, he’d stormed out of the apartment without a word and hadn’t responded to any of my texts since.\n\n“I can help you,” she added.\n\nI sat down.\n\n“I want it more than you could possibly realize,” I said.\n\n“Many people who show up here believe that,” she said. “Some are correct. Most aren’t.”\n\nShe opened a door and rang a small bell. A few moments later, a thin red-headed man walked in carrying a roll of fabric over his shoulder.\n\n“You don’t need a salve to shock your womb into obedience,” she said. “You need a wish.”\n\n“Like from a genie?” I said, almost laughing. “You got Robin Williams’s ghost in here?”\n\nShe smiled thinly, as if humoring a child.\n\n“There are such things as beings who can grant boons to humans,” she said. “But they don’t live in lamps or rings. And they are closer to gods than to that blue monstrosity in *Aladdin.”*\n\nShe nodded to her companion who knelt and rolled out the fabric. It was a rug, I realized, or what may have passed for one long ago. The gray fabric was beaten and frayed, and black, blocky images of antelopes had faded into almost nothing.\n\n“The rug is from the Ubaid period, roughly 4,800 BCE,” explained Inge. “Even were it not charmed, it would be one of a kind, amongst the oldest textiles in existence. By the same token, it’s likely that it had survived for so long precisely because of its supernatural qualities.”\n\nI had to stop myself from making a joke about magic carpets. Inge looked deadly serious now.\n\n“In the popular imagination, magical objects are portrayed as easy fixes,” said Inge. “A lamp you rub or a sword that slices through stone. A carpet that flies. In reality, most enchanted objects can only be activated through extreme effort and determination. They’re merely a foot in the door to seeking supernatural aid; the true effort comes from the seeker.”\n\n“So how does it work?” I asked.\n\n“To contact the being tied to this rug, you must kneel on it for three days and nights. During that time you may not sleep, eat or drink. If you have proven the strength of your resolve after three days, the spirit will visit you and your desire.”\n\n“And I can wish for anything?”\n\n“Most wishes are acceptable but it’s good to know ahead of time that there are limits. You cannot use the wish to kill a living thing or to negate the wish of another. Such things are against the nature of the spirit. It is a generous being by nature, looking to grant the heart’s desire of the worthy.”\n\n“My wish is worthy,” I said.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“You will need time to prepare,” she said. “I have a room here that I’ll set up for your trial. As I said, you will need to be here for three days. Come well-nourished and hydrated, just after a full night’s sleep. Wear loose, comfortable clothes.” She paused. “Some clients choose to bring an adult diaper.”\n\n“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” I couldn’t help but mutter, but she did not smile.\n\n“The cost is five million dollars per day,” she said. “Non-refundable.”\n\nI raised my eyebrows.\n\n“I was told money wouldn’t be an issue,” she said.\n\n“It’s not,” I said, regaining my composure. I would have to sell some of my crypto holdings, the easiest asset to liquidate on short notice. I started to assess the tax implications in my head.\n\n“Good,” she said. “Then we’ll set a date.”\n\n \n\nI was able to clear a few days in October for the trial. I told my coworkers I was headed to St. Bart’s to do a little beach time.\n\nThough I hadn’t taken a vacation in years, no one questioned it. If anything, they were glad, telling me it seemed like I could use it. I’d developed a reputation as highly intense: a ball-buster. I think everyone was happy to get a break from me for a few days.\n\nI did finally hear from Marlon. He called to let me know he was coming for his things, and that he hoped I wouldn’t be there when he arrived. It hurt to lose him, but I told myself I was better off moving forward alone. Perhaps I just didn’t want to endure the embarrassment of explaining my visit to Fleur and the trial awaiting me.\n\nIf anything, Marlon was even more of a skeptic than I was. But he wasn’t the kind of person who really, truly wanted anything. He’d gone along with the baby plan partly because of me, and partly because it was the thing people did. But I know he never really fantasized about holding a newborn in his arms, taking joy in her little coos and laughs. He was simply along for the ride—until things got too hard. And then he wasn’t.\n\nIt was all for the best. If the wish worked as promised, I wouldn’t need Marlon or any man. The baby would be all mine.\n\nIn the days leading up to the trial, I did everything I could to prepare. I caught up on sleep, ate at a small caloric surplus and did a daily yoga routine to loosen my joints. Embarrassingly, I also prayed to a small statue of Mary my mother had given me as a girl. It was one of the few objects I’d kept from childhood, and I certainly wasn’t Catholic anymore, but it felt like it wouldn’t hurt.\n\n \n\nFinally, the day came. I arrived at Fleur and ascended the steps. The door opened before I could even knock, and Inge gestured for me to enter. She was dressed in a sort of white linen uniform with a tan apron. She might have looked at home in a day spa. Indeed, she handed me a glass of ice-water with a cucumber floating inside.\n\n“It’s important to hydrate. And best to empty your bladder before you go in,” she said. Then, looking me in the eye, she added, “Is your resolve as strong now as when we last met?”\n\n“Stronger,” I said, honestly, and she nodded.\n\nI followed Inge up a winding staircase up to the third level, where a narrow, dimly-lit hallway opened to an array of doors. As we walked through the hall, if seemed I could hear groans coming from behind several of the door, strange muttering that sounded like prayer from others.\n\n“Busy morning?” I asked.\n\n“My clients’ business is strictly confidential,” she said. “Should anyone come asking about you, I’d say the same.” I wondered if it was all people kneeling on rugs behind every door. Surely not.\n\nBehind each door was a different object, a different aspiration. I had heard rumors of others who’d come here for help: a woman in her fifties who lay in a glass coffin that superheated her skin, crisping it like a Thanksgiving Turkeys. The pain had been unimaginable. But after two hours, when she emerged from the coffin, her skin was as taught as a twenty-year-old’s.\n\nAnother friend had been asked to fingerpaint portrait after portrait of her dead lover in blood, until finally the forty-fourth one began to move of its own volition and carried out a long and heartfelt conversation that left her happy for the first time in years.  \n\n“Understood,” I said. “Thank you.”\n\nWe reached a door near the end of the hall. She tapped the handle a few times in a kind of rhythmic sequence, then turned it slowly open. On the other side of the door was a barren room with no windows. Two walls were of bare brick. The others were simple white, the paint chipping in places.\n\nAt the center of the room, stood the rug. It looked slightly more important now, set in the middle of the otherwise barren room, like an exhibit at a museum. I was struck by the feeling that I shouldn’t touch it.\n\n“Your trial begins as soon as you place your feet on the rug,” said Inge. “The spirit will expect you to kneel for the duration of your time here. A bit of stretching from time to time is acceptable, but under no circumstance are you to leave the rug. Should you wish to abandon the trial, simply walk to the door and knock thrice. No negative consequences will befall you, but you will still be expected to pay, and you will not be allowed to attempt the trial again.”\n\nShe paused for a moment.\n\n“I should have asked this before,” she said. “But as I mentioned, there’s some kind of blockage preventing you from having a child. Do you have enemies? Someone who would care enough to curse you?”\n\nI tried to think. I’d upset plenty of people in my life, especially at word. I had ruined certain companies, effectively putting my boot on their necks when they showed the first signs of weakness. I’d sparked selling frenzies that tanked stock prices and ruined small financial empires. An angry tech bro had once pelted me with a milkshake as I left the office.\n\n“I don’t think any of my enemies believe in this stuff,” I said, and she nodded.\n\n“Good,” she said. “The trial begins now.”\n\nShe walked outside, closing the door behind her. And though I was now the only person in the room, I didn’t feel alone at all. The rug had a presence to it, I realized, just not necessarily a human one.\n\nSlowly, I removed my heels and circled the rug. The floor was frigid against my bare feet, cold enough to be uncomfortable, yet I found it difficult to will myself to step onto the fabric. Finally, I shook my head. I was being stupid. I would get on the rug. I had never shied away from anything simply because it was hard. This time would be no different.\n\n \n\nThe first few minutes were unremarkable. I knelt on the old fabric and stared blankly at the wall. Years of classes—yoga, barre, Pilates, etc.—had trained me for this moment. If anything, when I closed my eyes, I could pretend that I was simply holding Child’s Pose for a bit longer than usual, and that I’d soon be hitting the shower and indulging in a green smoothie.\n\nAs time wore on, it became harder to maintain this fantasy. My muscles began to ache, and I shifted to other sorts of kneeling. Sometimes with my torso elevated, sometimes lying forward and touching the rug with my fingertips. Initially, the rug had seemed to possess no smell, and I imagined it had dissipated over the course of millennia.\n\nNow, though, with my mind emptied and my senses heightened, I caught notes of odd scents—a kind of burnt one emanating from the black dye and a musky, earthen one from the fabric itself. Did they have sheep back in the olden days of the Fertile Crescent or had this been woven from the hair of some other animal?\n\nThe pain became worse. My lower back and knees throbbed. How long had I been kneeling now? Surely not more than a few hours. Was I really ready to endure this for days?\n\n“I’m going to stand and stretch now,” I said, feeling like an idiot. “I hope that’s okay. That doesn’t break the rules, right?” There was no response, and I felt extra stupid. “Okay?” I asked one last time.\n\nLooking up, I seemed to spy a haze of something at the far end of the room near the wall in front of me. An old woman was sitting in a chair, knitting. For a moment, she looked up from her work and met my eye, then she slowly nodded, giving me permission.\n\nCarefully unbending my knees, I stood. The relief was immediate. The fire that had been burning in my joints went out as if doused with a bucket of water.\n\n“This is still the easy part,” said the old woman quietly from the far side of the room. “If you don’t have the will to continue, better to quit now. There’s no prize for quitting halfway, or even at the three-quarters mark.”\n\n“You’ve never met anyone with a will like mine,” I said.\n\nShe snorted a little and went back to her knitting. “Kneel,” she said, quietly. And then she disappeared.\n\n \n\nThe pain grew worse. And if it was just pain, it might have been easy. But your mind plays tricks on you when you hurt. It’ll tell you that you’re doing permanent injury to your knees and ankles. It’ll ask if the tingling sensation in your toes is nerve damage. Could your spine itself be in jeopardy? Will you still be able to walk at the end of all this?\n\nBut through all of it, I didn’t stop kneeling. Every time an intrusive thought arose, I made myself think of my daughter. At times, it was almost as if I could see her. In the vision, though, she wasn’t a baby, but a woman fully grown, perhaps even my same age.\n\nShe stood behind the old woman, a hand on her shoulder. She stared at me as if looking for something; perhaps wondering if I’d soon give up, if she’d never come to exist.\n\n \n\nThis wasn’t the first time I’d seen my daughter.\n\nSince I was a teenager, I’ve had vivid dreams about her: us at high tea in matching dresses arguing the merits of English Breakfast and Earl Grey. Me at her college graduation, my eyes welling with tears as she collects her Princeton diploma. Me popping a bottle of champagne to celebrate her putting the downpayment on her first apartment, a little one bedroom in Brooklyn.\n\nIt was all so clear that it seemed inevitable. Like the dreams were a reality just waiting for me once I reached the proper time. I knew I was destined to become the mom that my own mother never was.\n\nYes, my mother was a disaster. She’d moved to New York from rural Virginia, assuming she’d be discovered by some producer at the café where she worked and book her ticket to Broadway. Every morning, she spent an hour in the mirror, preparing for her big break, but it never came. Instead, there was only an endless procession of men, some with promises of fame and fortune, but mostly just a string of losers that grew increasingly dangerous.\n\nI don’t like to talk much about that period of my life, except to say that it was terrible and not something I’d wish on anyone. It all ended when I was twelve and came home from school to find her half-dead off a bag of grey powder, lying on the couch beside her fully-dead boyfriend.\n\nI went to live with one of her cousins in Brooklyn after that. She had two daughters of her own and worked almost constantly. To her credit, I wasn’t treated any worse than her biological children, but that’s not saying much. At best, we were all seen as burdens. But at least I was safe.\n\nI suppose it made me tough and eager to be nothing like my mother. I grew up hating her and had very little contact with her once I stopped living at her place. At some point, I heard that she died falling from a balcony, an act that may have been self-inflicted or at the hands of a jealous boyfriend, though the truth was never discovered. I chose not to attend the funeral.\n\nI suppose I was driven to be my mother’s opposite in every way. Through high school, my grades were perfect and I never dated. I told myself that when I was older I would give my daughter the things I never had. A clean apartment looking over the park and I stable dad who never drank and woke up early each morning to brew coffee and read the news. A mother who loved her above all other things.\n\n \n\nI looked up at the old woman. My daughter’s shade stooped down and whispered something in her ear.\n\n“What?” I asked, attempting to bend my head up to look at them. I realized I barely had the strength to do so. How long had I been here now? I had no phone, no watch. The room had no windows. It could have been the first day or the second. Certainly not the third.\n\n“She says that you could never love her above all other things,” the old woman muttered. “You love yourself too much.”\n\nHad they read my thoughts?\n\n“What does she know?” I asked. “She doesn’t know me. She’s not even real.”\n\nMy daughter crossed her arms and stared daggers.\n\nI should mention that not all of my dreams about my daughter had been good ones. There had been nightmares too: me arriving home to find her, sixteen and in bed with an older boyfriend. Me, screaming and hitting her over and over again, shouting that she’d end up like my mom.\n\nAnd more like this: my daughter coming home with a B+ on a report card, or missing curfew by half an hour as a junior in high school. It always ended with me screaming, reminding her that a single step on the path to failure was one too many.\n\nI would wake from these dreams full of anger at her, incredulous that my imagined daughter could betray me in such a way.\n\n \n\nAt some point, my right knee gave out. I wasn’t sure if the joint had ruptured permanently or if it just needed some rest, but there was physically no way I could make it hold position. I collapsed face first onto the rug and looked up at the old woman as if to ask if this was acceptable. She nodded almost imperceptibly.\n\nAt some point that I had soiled myself. Not quite sure what to do, I removed the stained pants and underwear and tossed them to the side of the room. Then, for whatever reason, I removed my shirt as well, throwing it after the others. I lay curled in a naked ball, looking weakly up at the old woman, who kept busy with her knitting.\n\n“How long?” I asked, but she didn’t answer. Beside her, my daughter never took her eyes off me. She was smirking just a bit, reveling in my pain. She was the bad girl, the one I’d seen in my dreams. She would disobey me. I would come home from work to find her in a cloud of pot smoke listening to an old Nirvana album, and I would rip the buds from her ears and smash them underfoot, over and over again until they were plastic dust.\n\n“Give up,” she mouthed.\n\n“Never,” I tried to say, but my lips were chapped and bleeding, and the words caught in my throat. I knew then that I would amend my wish. I would wish for a good daughter. Not her. Not the brat looking down at me from the old woman’s side.\n\nI tried to give voice to these thoughts, to shout them at my daughter and found I could not. For the first time I felt a pang of true fear. Not that I would give up, but that I would die here, naked on this rug before I had a chance to make my wish. There had been no promise that I would live.\n\nHow long could the body go without water? I would have drunk from a gutter or a horse trough were it in front of me. Anything. Shadows were dancing all around the room, a great revel, all ready to carry me off to somewhere dark and permanent. I knew I could make them go away. I could roll off the rug, crawl to the door, beg to be let out. But I would not. I would never, never relent.\n\nMy daughter shook her head.\n\n“See?” she said. “She’ll never bend.”\n\nThe old woman looked up at me and nodded, and I realized that the rug had extended now, growing longer. It reached all the way to the old woman, stretching out to her feet and up her legs, all the way to the needles in her lap that were knitting it longer and longer.\n\nShe gestured for me to come closer, and I began to crawl, naked and chapped, my right knee fully numb, I dragged myself to her feet.\n\n“Tell me what you desire,” she said softly, not meeting my eyes.\n\n“You know,” I said.\n\n“You need to say it.”\n\n“A daughter,” I said. “My perfect daughter.”\n\nShe thought for a moment.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “I cannot help you. The rules are the rules.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” I choked as I asked the question, my throat dry and painful.\n\n“Your wish cannot negate the wish of another,” she said softly.\n\n“I don’t understand,” I said. What was she talking about?\n\nThe woman held up the bits of yarns in her lap. They seemed to vibrate, the dancing threads throwing darkness on the wall like shadow puppets.\n\nIn these shadows, a vision formed: it was my daughter years in the future, my same age. She was here in this very room, kneeling on this very same rug. Time moved in fast motion as I watched her suffer just as I had, her body breaking down, her mind drying into a husk as the lack of sleep and water broke it.\n\nBut in the end, she too survived the trial. She, too, crawled to the old woman to make her wish.\n\n“I don’t want to die,” she said through chapped lips. “But I wish I was never born. Could you do that for me?”\n\nThe old woman looked up at her curiously.\n\n“Perhaps. Why is this your wish?”\n\n“Because I have never been happy, not one day in my life,” my daughter said, blinking away tears. “I had a mother who screamed at me for the slightest misstep. She demanded perfection, and I tried to give it to her. I gave her everything she wanted. I went to Yale, then Harvard Med School. There’s no better doctor in the city. But every day, I come home and wish I’d die in my sleep. I haven’t spoken to my mom in years, but I still hear her screaming. The second I start to feel happy, she’s right there in my ear, telling me I don’t deserve an ounce of joy in my life.”\n\nThe old woman nodded.\n\n“I can give you what you wish,” she said.\n\n“Wait,” said my daughter. “If you grant the wish, what happens?”\n\nThe old woman gestured to the work in her lap. “It would be a bit of bother,” she said. “I’d have to unravel this a bit,” she gestured to the yarn in her lap, still attached to the rug. “Thirty-eight years’ worth of work, back to the time of your conception. I’d nudge things just a little bit. A different baby would fill her belly.”\n\n“No,” said my daughter, fighting back tears. “No, no, no. No one else should have to do this. To live this.” She thought for a moment, then said. “I want to wish for my mother to be barren. Incapable of having a child. Ever.”\n\nThe old woman smiled a bit sadly and nodded. She began to pull at the thread in her lap, unraveling the rug. “Anything else?”\n\n“Yes,” said my daughter. “One day, I want her to find out why.”\n\n \n\nThe old woman looked over at me now, then over at my daughter’s specter. She shot me one last, cruel smile. A look of satisfaction. Then, she turned and walked through the darkness of the wall. She would not return.\n\n“Do you understand?” asked the old woman. “I can’t allow your wish to undo hers.”\n\n“I understand.”\n\n“Is there anything else I can offer you?” she asked.\n\nI shook my head. She looked up from her knitting one last time.\n\n“You may yet think of something,” she said. “Come back anytime. You know where to find me.”\n\n \n\nInge must have entered the room shortly after. She gave me a glass of water, which I drank desperately, and a fresh robe. She took me to a shower, where I sat and cried on the wet floor. My skin was so broken that I could barely handle the lukewarm temperature. My knee throbbed but had regained a bit of its function. I saw that I would be whole again, physically at least.\n\n \n\nSince that day, I’ve been at home, slowly repairing myself. Long baths. Lunches of chicken broth and juice cut with water. But I can’t bring myself to call work or anyone, really. I feel that the motor has been ripped out of me, that there’s nothing to make me go anymore. What is a life without a purpose? I am not someone accustomed to drifting.\n\nAnd of course I’ve been angry. At my daughter and at myself. But there’s nowhere for those feelings to go, nothing to do with them. I can’t undo the mother I was in some other fabric of reality. I am stuck, but at the same time, I have no desire to die.\n\nAnd lately, my thoughts have turned to my own mother, who I suppose made me this way. As I said before, so much of who I am came as a reaction to who she was. I think of the way she cackled when she was high. It was a selfish laugh, a laugh you couldn’t share.\n\nLate at night, I find myself waking impossibly thirsty, but I do not drink. Instead, I kneel on the bed and stare into the darkness, and I think I see the old woman sitting there. I imagine crawling to her and whispering that I too wish my mother had been barren, that I too want her to know why. I imagine the old woman unravelling another few decades from her work to go back and fix things.\n\nAnd in my reverie, I sometimes hope that I won’t be the last one to make this wish. That my mother will do the same, wishing her mother barren. And then on and on, until each bad mother through the centuries is  erased along with history itself, the whole rug disappearing as the old woman pulls the thread, until all traces of humanity are wiped away, leaving nothing but a pile of tangled [yarn](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).",

I’d been snowed in, had our water pipes frozen solid, and we once lost power for four days straight. But that’s not what I remember when I think of my time growing up outside of Yellowknife – I think of the community.\n\nI grew up with six other families on an isolated street on the outskirts of town. We were a close-knit group. I always knew we were a bit different, in a way. We were immigrant families, but that never played a part of it. All I’ve ever known is Canada, and my family was adamant about keeping it that way. The only way I could tell we were different was that some of the people on that street had an unusual accent.\n\nMy sister Mia and I went to school with the other kids. We celebrated the same holidays, cheered for the same teams, and ate the same dishes. There was only one thing we did differently, and no one even knew about it.\n\n \n\nEvery year in March, all families on the street gathered at our place for what we called ‘Big TV Night’. My mom made snacks and dad cooked up caribou steaks bought from the local hunters. Us kids got a whole bunch of candy, and we all gathered to play card games and board games. And, since it was the 90’s, most of us played Pokémon on our GameBoys.\n\nBy the time Big TV Night started, most of us kids were out cold; sugar crashed and overstimulated. I only saw the show a handful of times, since it began just after midnight.\n\nI didn’t see the appeal, personally. There were no cartoons, just people talking. Debates, news, field reports, weather… it was pretty much the same thing we saw on TV every day, but with new colors and new people. Boring as hell.\n\n \n\nI remember this one time when all the adults huddled around the TV, looking distraught. I tugged on my dad’s shirt, whispering to him.\n\n“What’s wrong, dad?”\n\n“It’s just adult stuff,” he sighed. “Don’t worry.”\n\n“Why are you watching this?” I groaned. “It’s boring.”\n\nHe ruffled my hair and shooed off a persistent moth.\n\n“Because it’s important,” he said. “And sometimes you gotta do important things, even if they’re boring.”\n\nI stayed up with the adults, trying to watch the show. There was a news segment about a man in a diver’s suit, and I didn’t understand what was so interesting about it. I mean, he looked sort of tall, but that was about it. It was weird. I fell asleep against my dad’s shoulder, and the next day I was out playing with my friends in the snow like nothing’d happened.\n\n \n\nOver the years, most of the families on that street moved away. We didn’t really keep in touch. It was sad to lose my friends, but my parents were very comforting. They told me some had to get work in a new town. Others went to study abroad. A couple just wanted to live in the big city. My sister Mia and I ended up being the last kids on that street. It wasn’t all bad though – I had plenty of friends at school.\n\nDespite all the others moving away, my parents had their own Big TV Night every year. But the celebration of it disappeared. There were no more snacks. No more guests. Most of the time, they wouldn’t even talk to me about it. I’d just notice them lingering in the living room a little longer once per year as the atmosphere grew more somber.\n\nThe last time we had a Big TV Night, I was 16 years old. Mia was 14. She went to bed early, since it was a school night. I had trouble sleeping, so I stayed up a little longer. Hanging out with your parents isn’t exactly cool and fun, but there was something eerie about seeing them both so quiet and thoughtful. No quips, no dad jokes, nothing. Just two middle-aged people waiting in front of the screen.\n\n \n\nI watched them closely. How they turned to an unusual channel, watching the static slowly fold into a colorful picture. The video feed looked a bit dated, like it was an old recording. I remember a 70’s-style news presenter talking out loud as I nodded on and off.\n\n“While mostly known for his Hollywood success story, Gable geared up towards a political career when he ran for governor of California in 1953 – a move brought on by pressure from his many conservative republican contacts within the movie industry.”\n\nI looked up from my seat. That didn’t sound right.\n\n“Beating democratic candidate Pat Brown in a tight-knit race, the would-be president paved way for media personalities to have a long-term impact on the north American political landscape for decades to come-“\n\nMom looked over at me and smiled.\n\n“It’s just a show, honey,” she said. “It doesn’t matter.”\n\nI shook my head and closed my eyes. While I was too big for my dad to carry me upstairs, they made sure to wrap me in a blanket. By the time I woke up, the morning sun peaked in through the living room curtains, and the TV was off.\n\n \n\nIt might not seem like much, but that is one of my favorite memories of my parents. They were regular people for a while, not a mom and dad. It felt real. Like they took off their mask - but still remembered to tuck me in.\n\nThe year I turned 18, I moved to Edmonton to pursue a degree in Computer Science. My sister moved in with me to a shared off-campus apartment.\n\nAnd the following year, my parents died.\n\n \n\nIt was a snowmobile accident. They crashed through the ice, and the bodies could not be recovered. We had to have a funeral with empty caskets.\n\nI had to take care of Mia after that. We were left a substantial life insurance payout, as well as an inheritance, but we didn’t have any other family to rely on. It was just us against the world. Mia and I took a vote and decided neither of us could bring ourselves to go back home to Yellowknife, so we decided to sell off the house.\n\nDigging through our family belongings was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. You can only cry so much. At some point something inside you just freezes and dies.\n\n \n\nBut I finished my studies. I got a job installing and maintaining inventory systems. It doesn’t sound flashy, but it involves a lot of travel and a lot of late-night calls. My sister pursued a political science career and got engaged to a guy from Ottawa named Manny.\n\nI want to tell you about something that happened not too long ago. A couple of people from my old school decided to reach out to me for a reunion dinner, and it got me thinking of my old neighbors. I tried looking them up, but couldn’t find anything about them on social media. I talked to Mia about them too, but she couldn’t find anything either.\n\nIt got me thinking about the good old days. And it made me think of that night with my parents, watching strange late-night TV.\n\n \n\nI went to the reunion. I had drinks, talked to people, watched old videos, and got to hear from our childhood teachers. It was a massive nostalgia kick, as expected. Having cocktails in our run-down school cafeteria was surreal.\n\nSlightly drunk and melancholic, I took a walk around town. I ended up on our old street, watching the house from afar. I wondered what my life would’ve been like if my parents were still around. What would my mom have to say about Mia’s fiancée? What would dad say about my career?\n\nIt hurt my heart to think about, but it stuck with me. I decided I would make an effort to reconnect with that part of my life, and to remind myself of what used to make life so worth living.\n\n \n\nComing back home, I did some research. I couldn’t find anything about the strange TV channel. Asking around on a couple of forums, people suggested it was a satellite channel. That’d explain why it could only be seen at a particular time; especially if it was a foreign satellite. I tried to tell them about the one show I remember watching on that channel; a mockumentary about ‘President Gable’, but people thought I was trolling.\n\nI talked to some engineers at work too. They suggested that I get an old CRT TV and a satellite dish. If I hooked that up and scanned the channel range around the right time, I might get something. It wasn’t hard to get a hold of; we even had some spare stuff back in company storage. Bringing that equipment out to my car was a nuisance. There was so much dust that I couldn’t see the color of the sun-faded plastic.\n\nI reached out to Mia about setting up a ‘Big TV Night’ of our own. She was all-in.\n\n \n\nWe rented a weekend place not too far from our old street. Mia brought her fiancée along, and we tried to make it a bit of a celebration. We decided to make a weekend of it, going ice fishing, making our way around town, that kinda thing. It was shaping up pretty nicely.\n\nSo we got there, and while Mia and her man loaded in their things, I got started on the TV setup. The satellite dish was a bit smaller than the one we used back in the day, but I figured it might still work. So I set it all up, checked the channel scan function, and got ready. The show always started around midnight, so we had plenty of time.\n\nWe played a couple of games. Things got a bit out of hand when Mia suggested turning ‘go fish’ into a drinking game. Let’s just say she had to go to bed early.\n\n \n\nI ended up sitting downstairs with Manny. Honestly, I almost forgot about the TV. We were busy talking about what we were gonna do the next day. We’d both had too much to drink, and I had some trouble finding the channel as Manny rambled on and on about his upcoming bachelor party.\n\nIt was just past 1:20 am when the scanner suddenly stopped. Manny was asleep on the couch. I was sitting on the floor, manually changing the settings with little black click-buttons on the front of the TV. The CRT came to life, showing the tail end of a show. Some kind of nature documentary, with an Attenborough-ish sort of narrator.\n\n“In Singapore, the moth has long been rumored to be the spirit of those long since passed, coming back to visit the living. Looking at the Hawk Moth, one can see the faint resemblance of a skull, as-“\n\nI didn’t get it. It was just a nature show. I laughed a little at all the effort I’d put in. Maybe this channel was just a funny quirk of the local area. Maybe there was no greater meaning.\n\n \n\nI fetched the last quarter of a bottle of mint schnaps and plopped back down on the floor. Manny had already lumbered upstairs and called it a night by then, leaving me to watch the show on my own. I decided to keep the drinking game running. Every time the guy mentioned a new country, or used the word ‘century’, I took a swig. I finished the bottle in 20 minutes.\n\nThe reception got bad at around 2 am. By then I was barely aware of what country I was in. The TV was laced with static as the show came to a close. I was rolling the bottle back and forth on the floor, as if trying to play spin the bottle with myself. The narrator continued.\n\n“In the summer of the first ruptures, back in the early 20^(th) century, the moths were among the first to pass beyond the restrictions of our common space,” he said. “Much like the canaries of our coal mines, or cancer-sniffing canines, these faithful companions have been a guiding star to keep those who brave the unknown in search of a better tomorrow.”\n\n \n\nThat made me perk up. What the hell was he talking about?\n\nThe screen was growing worse and worse. I smacked it on the side, almost dislodging the satellite dish connection cable. I fumbled around a little, pushing it back in its socket. The narrator returned mid-sentence.\n\n“-our best efforts, thousands continue to disappear from our communities as unstable ruptures grow, year after year. And even then, those lucky to return seldom do so unharmed. But with friends like the Eon Moth, our brave-“\n\nThe screen was showing a group of armed soldiers standing outside a large white door. I’d never seen anything like it. A round door split in two half-circles, with golden knobs. The soldiers parted ways as something massive entered the screen. The feed was barely holding on.\n\n“-volunteers … desperately … to … mind, body, and soul-“\n\nI’d seen it before. The show with the diver, from when I was small. A two-and-a-half-meter tall person with gangly arms that reached past their knees. That’s about 8 feet. Their skin covered in a black plastic, like a dry glue. It towered over the armed personnel.\n\n“-will lose themselves … risk it all … true patriots of-“\n\n \n\nThe feed cut out. The room filled with a deafening static, leaving me sitting there in front of the screen like a living question mark. I was drunk, confused, and frightened. Much like the story of President Gable, this show was telling something I’d never heard. The outline of the dark figure faded from the screen, broken apart by dithering dots.\n\nI tried switching the channels to find the signal again. I tried a lot of things, but it just didn’t work. It was lost, and I was too drunk to figure anything else out. So I turned the TV off and sat there in the dark, brushing my fingertips against the grain of the wooden floor – as a moth fluttered by the windowsill.\n\n \n\nThere wasn’t much to say. I woke up the next day with a schnaps-tainted punishment hanging over the back of my head. We skipped ice fishing and went straight for junk food. It turned into a slow and pleasant weekend overall, but the thought of that strange show stayed on my mind the whole time. I tried to explain it to Mia, but she didn’t understand what was so fascinating about it. So I watched a weird nature documentary, drunker than a skunk. So what?\n\nI didn’t make a big deal out of it at first. On our way back to Edmonton, I read a couple of articles on moths, but I couldn’t find anything about an Eon Moth, as mentioned in the show. I couldn’t make heads or tails of it, so I figured I might have misremembered something. Manny was behind the wheel, so Mia leaned over to check what I was reading. She sighed and rolled her eyes.\n\n“Ugh, I hate moths.”\n\n“I don’t mind them,” I said.\n\n“I used to get them all the time,” she continued. “They were all over the floor.”\n\n“No they weren’t.”\n\n“Yes they were! You didn’t notice, you slept upstairs.”\n\n“I was downstairs all the time”, I said.\n\nShe rolled back into her seat, leaving me with my article.\n\n“Not the last two years or so. You were busy being an angsty teen stuck in your room.”\n\n“Point taken.”\n\n \n\nFor the next year, TV night became a sort of hobby project of mine. Whenever I had an evening to myself, or wanted to get away from my thoughts for a while, I turned to my project.\n\nI did notice a couple of things. For example, the TV show always occurred on a full moon, during something called the Worm Moon; where earthworms first appear in the northern hemisphere. It also seemed to have to do with the location itself. I asked a couple of acquaintances in the area to see if they could tune in around that time in nearby locations, but they couldn’t. By process of elimination, I could narrow down the window of opportunity significantly.\n\nTurns out, the only place we could get a signal was that particular town, on that particular night. Meaning it wasn’t a matter of just Earth’s position – it was Earth’s position in relation to a foreign object.\n\n \n\nI talked to Mia a couple of times about going there again the following year, but she wasn’t interested. She and Manny were settling down to plan a family, and they were having their wedding in May. She couldn’t afford to go off on another drunken nostalgia trip with her older brother, so she decided to pass.\n\nSo I had to do it on my own. I figured maybe I could go mobile – using a van, and maybe a radio. Maybe there were more signals to pick up on. So I prepped a kit to install in the back of my car, along with backup batteries, signal tuners, and a whole bunch of safeguards. I was also ready to record the whole thing to show the internet that I wasn’t crazy. Then again, I was the one hooking up old CRT TVs to a chunk of plywood in the back of my Honda, so I wasn’t making a great case for myself.\n\nBut one question lingered with me all year. Why was this particular show so interesting to my parents? Maybe that show was the reason they moved so far up north to begin with.\n\n \n\nA full year passed. Celebrations, birthdays. Spring, to summer, to autumn, and winter. New Year’s Eve, after work outings, movie nights, car trouble, and taxes. But in the back of it all was that project of mine, waiting for just the right time. And although I’d be alone, I was more ready than ever.\n\nI’d taken a couple of days off work, and I went back up north. I had everything set up in the back seat with a detachable panel, so I could get some sleep if I wanted. Two TVs with serial-linked car batteries, and two portable long-range radios. I had some recording equipment, a spare GoPro, and not a drop of schnaps as far as the eye could see.\n\nAnd with that I set out for the far north. I called Mia to tell her where I was going, and that was that. She wasn’t impressed.\n\n \n\nIt’s about a 15-hour drive, but I was ready. I had snacks, planned stops, audio books, and a clear timeline. It was kind of nice to get away from everything for a while. A lot can be said about the Canadian countryside and its endless snowscapes, but there’s a peace to it. If you’re not used to it, the cold can feel oppressive, but for those who’ve lived it there’s a particular feeling in the air that doesn’t exist anywhere else. There’s almost a taste to it. You can *feel* that you’re going home.\n\nBy the time I got to Yellowknife, it was late in the evening. I’d booked a room and my back was so stiff that I could barely feel my legs. The optimism and adventurous spirit had run out of me somewhere along Alexandra Falls, but at least I’d made it. Having someone to travel with, and to take turns behind the wheel, really makes all the difference.\n\nOne parking, one stretch, and a pair of keys later and I was face down into a soft pillow. Next night would be a long one, so I had to rest up while I could.\n\n \n\nThe next day was all about prep and experimentation. I set up my equipment in the back of the car, tested it, and made some last-minute adjustments. I spent some time driving around town, looking to see if I could get an inkling of a signal early, but it was a no-go. I got a few concerned looks as I passed certain streets for the third and fourth time.\n\nI had a nice dinner at a local restaurant, a long shower, and got back on the road in the evening. I got myself a full tank of gas and layered up with plenty of clothes. It looked like a rough night as the wind picked up, crystallizing the tip of my nose the moment I stepped outside the car. Weather was the one thing I couldn’t account for, and I didn’t know how strong the signal would be. Could a cloud cover ruin this whole thing?\n\nI checked and double-checked all batteries, including my phone and GoPro. I was as ready as I’d ever be.\n\n \n\nBy 11pm I was parked on my old street, with all systems running on full blast. Recordings were prepped and ready. I was going to do a short drive test; east to west, then north to south, to see if I could prolong the signal by following it. I was going to do it slowly, but just getting a trajectory might help me identify where it came from to begin with.\n\nIt was just a couple of minutes to midnight. My leg kept doing that shaking thing, and my mouth felt dry despite chugging a ginger ale only minutes earlier. This was it. There was a thump of anticipation in my chest as time slowed to a halt. There was something special about today, I could feel it. Maybe I’d get some answers. If not, I didn’t know if I could keep it up for another year. This’d already been a huge time sink as-is.\n\nBut as the electronics slowly rumbled to life, it was all worth it. Both screens turned from static to a dark background, and to my surprise, the long-range radios picked up on something too. The same broadcast, but just the audio. I hit record on everything and started the direction check with my car, as I listened, and watched.\n\n \n\nIt only took me a couple of minutes to realize the signal was moving from southwest to northeast. There weren’t a lot of roads out there, but I’d follow for as long as I could. I found a slow pace I was comfortable with, turned the rear-view mirror, and watched the segment that came on.\n\nThere was a man in a TV studio, with a black, neutral, background. He was wearing these large square glasses to match his equally square jawline. It looked to be some kind of recorded special broadcast; at least 20, maybe 30 years old. He had no notes and looked straight ahead. The angle was a bit off; something a camera man would’ve noticed. The man began to speak.\n\n“On a night such as this, it’s difficult to remain positive,” he said. “As the number of missing people continue to rise, we are getting continuous reports from large swathes of the American Midwest.”\n\nI double-checked. Yes, the recording was rolling. All lights were red, as intended.\n\n“Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri… we’re looking at tens of thousands. Possible hundreds, of thousands. It has become a nightmare made manifest.”\n\nThe man took off his large glasses and slowly folded them into his pocket.\n\n“Containment efforts have failed. Retrieval efforts have failed. Six members of our broadcast team haven’t reported in from their excursion to Cedar Rapids, and we fear the worst.”\n\n \n\nI took a right turn and stepped on the brakes, gently. I leaned back to turn up the volume a bit, to make sure no syllables were lost over the puttering engine. The wind had picked up and struggled against the hood of the car, howling in anger.\n\n“Our allies across the Atlantic are fleeing large population centers as evacuations backfire, with desperate, inhuman, efforts on full display. To the south, the border is closed, and armed forces exchange live fire in panicked skirmishes. Our neighbors to the north are repurposing quarries and mines into temporary shelters to wait out an endless storm.”\n\nThere was a shake to his hand, and a tremble to his voice. There were no visual effects on the screen. No channel number in the corner. No subtitles or name tags. Just a long serial number at the bottom of the screen, as if what was being shown was some kind of unedited footage.\n\n“There is no leadership to turn the tide. There are no… scientists, with grand ideas. As our world cracks like the shell of an egg, we bear witness to a rapture unlike anything we’ve been promised. As our clocks turn the wrong way. As our sons and daughters lose themselves in a land of in-between. As our-“\n\nThe feed stuttered. I stepped on the gas to compensate.\n\n \n\nThe weather was getting worse, and it was interfering with the feed. I had to keep up just to get a clear radio signal. The video was breaking up.\n\n“-there’s nowhere to run,” the man continued. “There’s nowhere safe. We know what happens to those who flee. To those who step beyond the boundaries.”\n\nI swallowed. I turned on the windshield wipers, noticing how their rhythm matched my pounding heart. My hands grew cold with sweat inside my wooly mittens as I gripped the steering wheel.\n\n“-no greener grass across the fence! There’s nothing to keep us from ruining ourselves but God! And God has waited long enough! God has grown tired of waiting, so he calls us home not with trumpets, but horror! A horror of sin manifest, and the culling of the cross! With a-”\n\nI wanted to slow down and listen, but I couldn’t. Easing up on the gas made the signal weaker, so I had to keep up.\n\n \n\nI took a hard right, almost spinning out of control. I brought the car back to heel and kept going northeast. There was no one on the road at this time of night. The man ranted and raved, dissolving into a sobbing puddle. I could only see the outlines of his movement on the screen. He bawled and screamed, leaving a pool of snot on the table as he looked back up – steeling himself with balled fists.\n\n“There can never be an ending to an ending,” he cried. “And in the grand scale of things, we have proven nothing. The sun will set, and the sunflowers will bloom in the dark. But will they remain blue if no one is there to see?”\n\nI managed to pick up on a trail going more straight northeast, and the signal improved. There was a gap in the clouds, allowing a sliver of signal to come through. I saw the video feed in the rear-view mirror as it bounced back. The man was walking up to the camera, coughing. Something fluttered out of his mouth.\n\n \n\nHe collapsed into a coughing fit, but there was no one to turn off the recording. He kept looking back and forth between the camera and someone off to the side, but no one came to help. The camera just kept rolling. Moths fluttered out of him as a black gel erupted from his nose, mouth, and eyes. Little wings fluttered around the studio as he gargled in pain. His joints bending at unnatural angles. The colors of the recording seemed to shift, casting phantom images of him doing three things at once in different spectrums.\n\nElongated limbs. A broken jaw. Fingers protruding like eye stalks of a snail.\n\nHis bones were breaking. Extending.\n\n*Changing*.\n\n \n\nI turned back for a second to increase the volume a little more, to see if I could catch something in the background. Turning my attention back to the road, something poked my eye. Something small, and fluttering.\n\nI stepped on the brake, sending me careening straight into a snow-covered tree by the side of the road. The full stop sent me reeling forward. All my equipment came loose and joined me in the front seat as the airbag deployed, smacking me into a whiplash. For a few seconds, all I could hear was screaming coming from one of the long-range radios, and the pitter-patter of wings struggling against the windshield.\n\nI looked up to see a moth trying to reach the headlights. My right hand fumbled around, only to catch the edge of the seatbelt. I undid it and felt the handle to one of my portable radios. I grabbed it and rolled out of the car.\n\n \n\nThe signal was getting weaker. There was an awful choking sound coming from my car as the engine struggled. A hissing voice came through before the signal rolled out of bounds.\n\n“…no one leaves,” a man said. “…we will find you.”\n\nThe static increased.\n\n“We *will*… find you.”\n\n \n\nThe broadcast cut to a repeating signal. Some kind of code, looping in a pattern. One of the car batteries from my recording rig lit up from a short circuit, and within seconds, the car was on fire. I dropped the radio to call for help, but realized I’d left my cellphone to charge in the front seat. It was all going up in flames. I didn’t even care about the car. I was losing proof. I was losing everything.\n\nI barely noticed the moths at first. There were dozens of them fleeing the car. But they didn’t leave – they loved the light. Instead they danced around the flames, casting stark shadows like inverse stars.\n\nBut I had to leave. To get help. I barely even knew where I was, I’d just kept going, and going, and going. But there was only one road to follow, so I couldn’t be all that far off.\n\n \n\nAs the repeated signal stopped, I dropped the radio by the side of the road. It was just me and the cold. I could feel my teeth chatter, but I couldn’t tell if it was from my racing pulse or the temperature. Maybe both. Or neither.\n\nEven there, and then, I had to wipe moths out of my clothes. They seemed to appear out of nowhere. One of them crawled out of my beanie cap, getting its wings stuck to my sweaty neck. I could feel them moving. I could hear them all around me. And there were more and more of them.\n\nThen, it stopped.\n\n \n\nThere was a loud groan, as if the howling wind turned from a flute to a tuba. I could feel a ripple in the air, almost knocking me off my feet. A pulse, growing faster. There was a pressure in my ears that came and went with a pop, sending a spike of pain up through my jaw and into the back of my ear. As the moths disappeared, I turned around – to see that I was not alone.\n\nThere was something on the opposite side of the road. It was dark, but didn’t reflect any light from the burning car. I could only see the outlines as a void; a black hole in the vague shape of a human. An elongated, broken, human.\n\nI thought it was far off, at first. But it was a matter of false perspective. It was much closer than I thought – and almost three meters (10ft) tall. It turned my way, and moved.\n\n \n\nI was used to this environment. Thankfully, it wasn’t. As it moved towards me, I realized I would have no chance to outpace it in a straight line, so I headed into the woods. I weaved in-between trees as knee-deep snow tried to trap me. But I knew where to step to not sink; to avoid bushes and dry saplings. To keep moving, and to keep my head and center of gravity low.\n\nThe thing was a mess. I heard it stumble as it struggled with every step. It was like watching a reindeer on ice; taking its first steps as it learned its limitations. It braced itself against every tree and branch as it threw and dragged itself forward with complete abandon; silently reaching for me.\n\nI was faster in so many ways. I’d been running through forests since I was a kid. But even then, there was no stopping the hapless onslaught of this half-shaped thing.\n\n \n\nThe treeline suddenly stopped, and I fumbled out onto a wide-open field. It took me a moment to realize I was actually on a frozen lake.\n\nThe cloud cover had opened a little, basking the treeline with a gray full moon. Even then, I could barely see that thing. It seemed hesitant as it stepped onto the ice. It must have been heavier than I thought, as I could hear a loud crack – a noise that seemed to surprise the both of us.\n\nAs it regained its footing, I heard it speed up. As it did, I had no choice but to run. And the faster it got, the less time I had to care where I put my feet.\n\n \n\nI don’t know how long I ran, or what went through my mind. Looking back at it feels like a nightmare. The details get fuzzy – you just get these sprinkles of memory. My lungs burning from the cold air. The pooling sweat in my shoes. The whisk of a cold wind against my left hand, exposed to the elements. I must’ve lost my mitten somewhere along the way.\n\nBut it gained on me. It towered above me. And as the man on the radio had prophesized, it had found me. It leapt, bringing down all its weight on me, and the ice.\n\nNow, I don’t know if it was the immense weight of this thing, or cracks from the many ice fishing tourists, but we didn’t just go down.\n\nWe went straight into the frozen lake.\n\n \n\nFor a second, it was warm. Silent. I was moving, but I couldn’t tell if it was from being dragged down, or swept by a current. Something grazed against my leg, but I could barely feel it. There was a pull as something heavy sunk.\n\nI’ve never been close to drowning or freezing to death. I haven’t lived that life. But that night, I could feel both at the same time. Your body doesn’t know what to do. You don’t have a natural response to this kind of shock. It’s like a switch in you that just turns off, as all fight or flight responses cease to function.\n\nFor a moment, I just bobbed around. Something moved underneath, sinking deeper. And I remember one thought coming to mind. I wondered if my parents had thought the same thing.\n\nDying is easy.\n\n \n\nMom and dad were never scared. Maybe they knew something would be coming for them. Hell, they might’ve known they’d end up dead in a lake, or worse. But maybe knowing the end to the story isn’t reason enough not to tell it. They’d held the truth from us, for better or worse, but in the wake of their deceit we found warmth. Falling asleep on my dad’s shoulder. Having my mom tuck me in after a long night. No matter where they would go, those moments would remain.\n\nI’ll never deserve the luck of having a tourist family seeing the ice break from their cabin. Of being pulled out by the neck. Of having a retired nurse perform CPR as the locals flocked out in force to help from every corner. I just remember my eyes having frozen shut, and my lips painlessly cracking as I tried to speak.\n\nBut deserving or not, my life was saved that night.\n\n \n\nThe repeated pattern I’d heard on the radio had burned into my mind. I sketched it out on a notepad in the hospital as a morse code. Before Mia came to see me, I’d interpreted the message and come up with a theory.\n\n“ARCHIVE 93 AUTO” it said.\n\nIt wasn’t playing a live broadcast. It was playing some kind of archive video. Most probably a fast-moving satellite.\n\n \n\nI think my mother and father came from somewhere else. Some strange, nightmarish place. The broadcast talked about sheltering in the mines – Yellowknife has a history of those. Maybe the other families came from a strange place as well. Maybe they all settled down in front of their TVs on the one day a year where a signal from home could make it through.\n\nI think that thing found my parents. It doesn’t like those who cross from that place to ours. And even though my parents made a life for themselves here, I think it got to them in the end. I don’t think they just crashed a snowmobile through the ice. I think there is a good reason why their bodies were never recovered. I think they were taken away; and I think that’s what almost happened to me.\n\nI don’t know the rules. I don’t know if it came for me because I listened too closely, or because I was born somewhere else. Maybe I wasn’t, or maybe I was. I have no one to ask, and I can never know for sure.\n\n \n\nWhen my sister finally arrived at the hospital, I hadn’t decided on what to tell her. But she flung her arms around me, crying onto my shoulder. I could feel that it wasn’t anger, or disappointment. It was just relief.\n\n“Please,” she cried. “Please be done.”\n\nAnd with that, I made up my mind.\n\n“Yeah,” I wheezed. “I’m done.”\n\n \n\nIt’s been some time since then, and I’ve recovered in full. I’ve stopped listening. I’ve stopped looking for answers in the stars. I only write this to remind myself that it ever happened before I delete my account forever. I have no need to keep in touch with the A.V. geeks anymore. I’m done.\n\nBut I’d be ignorant if I said I wasn’t bothered. With every flutter of a moth’s wing comes a question.\n\nAre they still looking to bring me home?",

        "content": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/ZwqbGWozRN)\n\n---\n\nEvery message, every signal, and every attempt to communicate with the surface was met with the same response.\n\nTURN THE WHEEL.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore.\n\nMy co-pilot's body was slumped against me, blood trickling down from the back of his head and tapping against my suit. The space made it difficult to push him away, but I didn't try anyway. I could only focus on one thing… the door.\n\nMy mind was practically screaming at me. It was a real, painful sensation that made me grasp my head with my hands. I knew that if I only took hold of the control panel, I could turn the wheel with the mechanical arms and end the horrible feeling. If I opened the door, it would all go away.\n\nI felt angry, irrationally anxious. It was horrible.\n\nI screamed and smashed the computer against the cabin wall.\n\nI watched the screen glitch and turn off entirely. I huffed for a few moments before I realized what I had done.\n\nI recovered the computer and tried to turn it on. I failed the first time, but on the second the screen lit up, though there was a large line running through it. \n\nAs I was reconnecting it to the submarine's systems, something appeared in the corner of the screen.\n\nIt was a message.\n\nI knew what it would read, but I clicked anyway. As soon as I did, my eyes went wide.\n\nIt wasn't the typical message.\n\nFor a second, the need to open the door was gone.\n\n“STANLEY WILSON, report. This is a request for your immediate return to base. Activate your audio communication systems.”\n\nBrief, shorter than most, but it was a real message. \n\nI was overjoyed. I opened the message and activated the microphone.\n\n“This is Alexander Morgan, Captain. Wilson is unable to report and in critical condition. Ballast systems are offline and likely destroyed, please advise,” I said.\n\nI waited for a few moments. Then, the device came to life.\n\n“Captain Morgan, scans suggest that your vessel is near a rock formation. Correct?” a voice said.\n\n“Correct,” I answered immediately. I couldn't have been more excited to hear the voice of a member of my team.\n\n“There is a way to temporarily enable the ballast systems and allow the vessel to begin ascending. Captain Morgan, take command of the mechanical arms.”\n\nThe one thing I had been avoiding all this time—for what felt like hours—was to use the mechanical arms. The need to open the door had lessened, but I was still reluctant.\n\nI leaned forward and activated the arms. I wasn't going to let an opportunity pass.\n\n“Your goal is to push away from the rock formation using the mechanical arms. This will change the pressure within the ballast systems and allow them to function. Use the arms to hold a nearby rock.”\n\nI extended both arms slowly.\n\nAs I did, the camera lit up. The first thing I saw was the steel bulkhead. I could still see the images engraved on the bottom. It made my blood freeze. This monitor was smaller, but the image was perfectly clear. \n\nI held the surface of the cliff with the arms, but I was unable to find a steady spot. \n\n“Captain Morgan, find a protruding portion of the cliffside.”\n\nThe only part of the wall that extended out, and that could be held, was the wheel. \n\n“Negative. There is no protruding portion,” I said. I felt like a coward, but after all that happened, I wanted nothing to do with the door.\n\n“Captain Morgan, listen to me, there is no other way.”\n\nI sighed. It was an anxious, nervous sigh. I wanted the nightmare to end, and the one thing I wanted to avoid above all else was the door.  \n\nReluctantly, I held the wheel with the mechanical arms.\n\nBoth claws seemed to wrap around the edges perfectly.\n\n“Now, Captain Morgan….”\n\nThe voice had changed. It was slow, monotonous.\n\n“Turn the wheel.”\n\nMy face went pale.\n\n“Captain Morgan, turning the wheel will allow the vessel to ascend.”\n\nI shut the computer violently, pushing it away.\n\nI put my head in my hands and covered my ears. The feeling—the **need** to open the door—was back. It made me furious.\n\n“Alex…” a voice came from the closed computer.\n\nI recognized the voice.\n\nThe voice was distorted and it glitched at intervals, but it was unmistakable.\n\n“It only makes sense to open it…”\n\nIt was Stanley's.\n\nThis… couldn't not have been possible. Stanley's lifeless, or at least unconscious body was still on top of me, dripping blood on my chest. And yet, the voice from the computer sounded exactly like him.\n\n“Alex, If you don't turn the wheel, I will,” the voice said. It sent shivers down my spine.\n\n“This is what you wanted, isn't it?” Stanley’s voice was perfectly calm.\n\n“I tried to stop you, and you won. And now you changed your mind?”\n\nMy fingers were deep within my ears, trying to block out the sound. They were piercing as far as they could go. Still, I could hear the voice as if my hearing was perfect.\n\n“Why did you kill me, Alex? I wanted to help—to stop you.”\n\nI couldn't handle it. I didn't even know what the voice was talking about. I just wanted the horrible pain to go away.\n\n“You killed me over this,” the voice seemed melancholy, but distant. “So now… if you don't open the door I died over, I will.”\n\nThe pain in my head increased to unbearable levels. I screamed.\n\nIt felt as if I was being tortured.\n\nAll I had to do was hit the button, and the pain would stop. I knew it would.\n\nThat was the only way.\n\nWithout thinking, I hit the button on the control panel.\n\nI heard the machinery whirr, and the wheel rotated with a jolt to the side. The wheel stayed in its position for a few seconds.\n\nAnd then, the view exploded in front of me. The door imploded inward so fast that ‘*disappeared*’ would be a better word. The submersible exploded forward under the unfathomable pressure. Over 10,000 meters underwater, and over 1,000 times the earth's atmosphere, the pressure change was immense.\n\nEverything must have happened in a millisecond, for the instant the door had vanished, my vision went black. \n\nI cannot explain how it is possible that I survived, or how it is true that the submersible did not implode, but I awoke feeling as if I had slept for no more than a few seconds.\n\nMy hand was still on the button, and everything in the cabin was in the same position as before. I couldn't understand how the vessel had stayed intact.\n\nIt almost felt like the cut of a movie scene. One moment the submarine was about to be demolished, and the next it had been placed in another location.\n\nThe question was: where had the submarine been placed?\n\nI looked at the small monitor. At first I saw nothing but darkness, and I had to move the mechanical arm to reveal the scene.\n\nOne thing did appear on the monitor. It looked like a large, heavy beam of metal.\n\nIt must have been twice the width of the submersible, and at least 4 times as long. At one point, it curved upward.\n\nSomehow, the submarine's ballast systems had come online, and I was not only able to ascend and descend, but move back and forth as well. The submersible was in perfect condition.\n\nI followed the metal beam to the point where it curved. I saw that It looped around, and that the beam was actually part of a large oval of metal. Connected to this, was another oval.\n\nIt was a chain.\n\nI had seen chains used in underwater construction, but this one was colossal.\n\nI followed the chain with the submarine, hoping it was attached to a larger structure, and that I could follow it to find my way out.\n\nI must have followed at least fifteen links before the massive chain abruptly stopped.\n\nAt one point, there was only half a link.\n\nThe metal had been broken in half. The giant link was split.\n\nThe computer screen lit up suddenly, catching me off guard.\n\n“Captain Morgan!” said a voice from the computer. “What the hell happened? You went dark, and now our scans detect that you're 500 meters from your previous location! We've been trying to reach you for hours!”\n\nI recovered my breath.\n\n“This is Alex! Can you hear me?”\n\nA brief silence.\n\n“Captain! Get up here now! People are acting like lunatics! The crew has lost their minds!”\n\nI was frozen. I couldn't believe it, the nightmare wasn't over.\n\n“Scans are going wild! What is happening down there?”\n\nI was unable to process what I was hearing through the device.\n\nAt that moment, something broke the silence of the water around me.\n\nIt was a deep, echoing bellow. It sounded more like an earthquake shaking the water, or a distant roar of thunder. There was practically no sound, just an intense and distant rumble. \n\nThe submarine literally trembled. I heard the metal rattle around me.\n\nI needed to know what was in the void, and my headlights were obviously not going to help.\n\nAt this depth the water was indescribably heavy. It almost felt *thick*, and it was so dark that there was no way I would be able to see my surroundings. I needed another way to see where I was.\n\nI set the submarine to remain still, and shut off any unnecessary systems.\n\nI turned to the sonar display.\n\nThe returns showed a faint signal, very distant, which got stronger and weaker. Something was shifting in the water far away. The void around me shook again. \n\nFor it to move as fast as the returns showed, yet seem slow and sluggish, its size must have been unfathomable.\n\n“Captain, what are you doing? You are clear to ascend! Ascend immediately—help me! The crew is outside, I don't know how much longer the door will hold!”\n\nI couldn't comprehend what I was hearing, but I wasn't going to stay down there any longer. I wanted out. I took control of submersible and initiated my ascent.\n\nSuddenly, the communication device came to life again. I heard glass break, and a brief scream.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nAs I went up, more and more broken chains passed me by. Each larger than the last. Some were as big as houses, others larger than airplanes.\n\n“Captain…”\n\nThe voice was distorted.\n\n“The great chains are broken… we await *his* arrival. Good bye, Captain.”\n\nSilence.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nStanley has died of his injuries.\n\nI am alone on the research ship, but at least I'm on the surface now.\n\nThe bodies of my surface crew are floating in the water. I don't know why, but they all jumped. \n\nThe sensors light up with data, and I can do nothing but watch as the numbers rise to impossible levels. \n\nI've been writing for some time, but I will make this portion brief. Unfortunately, I have a deadline. \n\nThere are at least 4 earthquakes, the smallest of these measuring at a magnitude of 9.5. The waves these have produced are heading toward coastal cities in Japan, Philippines, New Guinea, Taiwan, and Guam.\n\nIt's as if I am a spectator to the apocalypse. Screens light up and alarms blare, and I am forced to stand witness.\n\nWorst of all, scans detect seismic activity within the Mariana Trench—in the exact portion where my expedition took place. \n\nI have seen too much to assume it is an earthquake.\n\nWhatever it is, it is also ascending. According to the data, it will surface in 5 minutes. Its size measures approximately 2,000 meters in length. \n\nI will not be alive to witness it. \n\nIt is predicted to surface beneath my ship.\n\nWhatever those massive chains were meant to hold… they are no longer serving their purpose.

        "content": "As I walk into the police station, I notice the officers' eyes on me. Watching every move. Judging.\n\n\"*Did she do it? Did she really kill her own brother?*\"\n\nThat's the question on everyone's mind after Greg died last week.\n\nHe fell to his death from the 11th-floor apartment where we live with our mother. Neighbors mentioned a heated argument between us right before it happened, and the media ate it up.\n\nAn older, polite officer approaches and gestures for me to follow him into the interview room. He motions for me to sit.\n\n\"I'm sorry about all this, Ms. Lana,\" he says, flipping through some papers in a folder. \"But we need to get everything straight in this case.\"\n\nI nod. He asks if I'm sure I don’t want a lawyer. I confirm it.\n\nHe sets the papers aside and opens a small notebook, a pen resting inside.\n\n\"Can you tell me how your relationship with your brother was?\"\n\nThat’s a tricky question, but I tell him the truth. It wasn't great.\n\nMy brother was controlling and aggressive from a young age. He used to steal my things and threaten me with a small knife he took from our father to keep me quiet.\n\nHe was expelled from two schools, once for beating a kid until he passed out and another because he set fire to an entire classroom when a teacher refused to change his grade.\n\nHe was very close to our father and, when he died, Greg got worse. *Much worse*.\n\nTo the officer, I give a lighter version of the story. I don’t want to seem like I hated my brother.\n\nHe writes it down, slowly. \"And your mother?\"\n\n\"My mother is incredible,\" I explain, feeling a pang of emotion. \"She raised us mostly alone, doing her best. Our father was… difficult.\"\n\n\"I can only imagine the pain she's going through,\" he interrupts in a calm voice, locking eyes with me. \"Losing another family member like that, only a few years after he died.\"\n\nIt was clear in his eyes that he thought I had done it. Offed my brother, you know.\n\nThen came the golden question.\n\n\"Can you recount the events of that night as you remember?\"\n\nI tell him it’s mostly a blur, but I’ll do my best.\n\nGreg did something stupid, like leaving the milk out or not washing the dishes. I confronted him and he exploded, yelling. \n\nHis voice sounded off—maybe he had been drinking. He cursed and threatened me.\n\nI went to my room and—moments later—heard a thud, followed by my mother breaking down in tears.\n\nThe officer doesn’t write anything this time, and drops his pen.\n\n\"That’s not the whole truth, is it, Ms. Lana?\" His head tilts slightly, as if he’s caught me in a lie.\n\n\"There were scratch marks on his arm, likely from a struggle,\" he continues. \"We haven’t tested the DNA yet, but I have a strong feeling we’ll get a match.\"\n\nHe glances at my hands, where a few nails are broken at the tips.\n\n\"That doesn't make much sense to me,\" I challenge, though his direct approach catches me off guard.\n\nHe gives me a knowing look and picks up his pen again, flipping through his notes. \"Do you know a girl named Abigail? Someone your brother was recently involved with?\"\n\nI gulp. He knows.\n\n\"So, I guess you do,\" he says with a smirk. \"She filed a report against your brother the day before his death. Did you know that?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" I fake surprise. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"She reported an attempted murder,\" he reads from the file. \"Greg beat her so badly she was barely recognizable. She only survived because she managed to escape his car.\"\n\n\"That’s... disturbing.\"\n\n\"You’re right. And you knew already, didn’t you? She told us she warned you the morning he died.\" He leans forward, watching my reaction.\n\nI don’t say anything. I start to wonder if refusing a lawyer was a mistake.\n\n\"And there is one more girl, Jenna,\" he continues. \"His ex. She had been missing for a few months, but we recently found her dismembered body by a dirt road.\"\n\nMy eyes widen. I didn’t know the details, but I feared this might have happened. \n\n\"We suspect there are more,” he leans back, his posture hinting at sympathy for me. \"It’s time to bring justice to these women. I know this is probably why you pushed him that ni—\"\n\nBefore he finishes, I stand up and ask if I’m under arrest.\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"Then I’ll leave now,\" I say, walking to the door. \"I hope I’ve helped.\"\n\nI leave the station with tears in my eyes. Those poor girls—what had he done to them? How could he be so much like our father?\n\nMy mother is waiting right in front of the main entrance, sitting on a bench. Her face lights up when she sees me, and we hug tightly.\n\nI’ll *never* tell them what she did that night.\n\nHow she saved me from Greg, as he held a razor to my throat, gripping my neck by the window, after I confronted him about those women.\n\nHow she pushed him without hesitation, sending her own son to his death.\n\nHow, a few years ago, she poisoned our father to also end his endless cycle of abuse and violence.\n\nMom believed it was over when she killed him, but it wasn’t. Greg followed in his father’s footsteps.\n\nMaybe now she can finally have some peace, though it came at such a high price.\n\n\"Let's go home,\" she murmurs, her voice heavy with sorrow, gripping my hand. And we go.",

        "author": "SkullKnitter",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/rVmvxz7Rhz)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jhhly7/i_work_at_a_24hour_pet_er_and_we_had_a_patient/)\n\nI drove away from that animal crematorium in a blaze of rubber. No other cars were outside, so I have no idea how Keeton had gotten there. Did he walk? I never heard a car idling or an engine starting up. \n\nThe sun had set, and that made me feel a deep seething sense of unease. Like the miles of surrounding red rock and highway were out to get me, out to hurt me. \n\nDr. Harkhams head still rolled around beneath my jacket, but the ventriloquism act had stopped. I should have tossed him out into the desert, but that didn’t feel right. A man who I’d worked with and grown to care about. He had a temper, but so did I. That’s why we meshed. God his poor wife, his poor fucking kids. \n\nI felt like Joe might know what to do with the severed head sitting in my passenger footwell. \n\nJoe had tried to call back but I didn’t pick up. I had a sneaking suspicion that Keeton was listening through Dr. Harkhams ears. \n\nI drove along a cut of dusty road for almost an hour before I saw a rest stop. I saw the needle crawling towards empty on my gas gauge, I didn’t want to stop but I had no choice if I wanted to make it to the Rez.\n\nI pulled off the highway and saw an old pump stop that was desolate. A single produce semi truck sat in the parking lot near the diesel pumps. The overhang lights looked like an oasis in a sea of dull black pitch. \n\nI settled into a pump, and tossed a few more items of clothing down on top of where Dr. Harkhams head stayed. I heard a low chuffing sound beneath the layers of fabric. I ignored it, I needed to focus, to observe my surroundings. I stuffed Mutt’s ashes into my purse alongside my pistol. \n\nI passed by a grizzled, overweight trucker sitting in his drivers seat, watching me cross the sidewalk. \n\nI wandered into the gas station and grabbed an assortment of jerkies, energy drink cans, and a steaming cup of coffee. Not road trip snacks, just things to keep me alive, thinking through the night. To keep me surviving until dawn. \n\nA scrawny early 20’s burnout sat with his feet resting up on the countertop. I could hear the sound of a movie playing through his phone speakers, he casually ate away at a bag of popcorn.\n\nThe coffee tasted burnt, metallic. The lights flickered overhead like they weren’t sure they wanted to be on.\n\n“Forty on pump 6.” I said, sliding my assortment of items across the counter. He didn’t say a word, just clicked away at the register with a hand absentmindedly.\n\nI slipped him a handful of twenties and he tore his eyes from the phone long enough to pour change into my hand. I left without a word. \n\nI crossed below the blanket of light cast by the overhang shining down on pumps. \n\nI stopped walking when I turned over and saw that the semi truck was empty. A wrongness crashed down around me. An all encompassing feeling of doom. \n\nI surrendered to the feeling, I didn’t walk towards the truck, didn’t go to investigate. I had an idea that’s what Keeton wanted me to do. What he was waiting for me to do. \n\nI kept my eye on the semi’s cab, inching backwards with a bag in one hand, a coffee in the other, purse slung over one shoulder. My breath sounded pitched in the darkness. Labored and heavy. \n\nI saw a glimmer of red across the inside of the semi’s windshield. A glistening brushstroke. \n\nI didn’t peel my eyes from the semi as I filled up my tank. As soon as I was done I slid into my truck and started it up, the click of the locks engaging brought little to dissuade the rising tide of panic drowning me from the inside out. \n\nAs I pulled around the pumps and across from the station I saw the right side of the semi in the flash of my headlights. The cab drivers side-door was cracked open, blood flung in congealed globs on black asphalt. \n\nI saw him then, Keeton. He was perched between the semi’s wheels like a spider hiding beneath a rock. His limbs like long wooden posts stretched with a thin layer of white skin. Pinched feet held onto the underside of the truck bed in a broken contortion. His elbows buckled in the wrong directions, everything was so much longer than they should have been, neck like a tangled twisting vine. His eyes refracted the light like two glowing yellow orbs.\n\nThe bite wound on my leg began to itch, then burn. I saw thin fingers of smoke clawing out of my purse and I pulled out the warm ashes of Mutt and set them on the passenger seat, I heard a faint crackle like embers in those ashes. The car began to smell like singed hair and cooking flesh. \n\nI noticed a sharp smile on Keeton’s face. His mouth drenched in rivulets of blood. The trucker sitting in his cab earlier lay in a twisted heap beneath Keeton. The truckers ribcage was cracked open like a crabshell, one of Keeton’s sharp hands was digging around inside the man like a woman digging around inside her purse for her keys. \n\nKeeton’s stare lingered, piercing as I swung my car around kicking up a shiver of dust and I flipped my truck into a higher gear. Keeton pulled a dripping red hand out of the truckers sucking chest cavity and began waving at me. \n\nA friendly hello. \n\nI revved up the engine, blowing down that road back onto the highway faster than I should have. It wasn’t until a few minutes later that I remembered the cashier. Sitting alone at his post. Unaware of the broken thing feasting just outside his doors. God I hope it didn’t come after him next. \n\nI thought about calling the police, I really did. But god, I had a severed head in my car. I couldn’t get involved with the police, they’d have asked for info I simply couldn’t provide. \n\nThe head of Dr. Harkham was letting out a low drone in the footwell as I tore forward down the highway. \n\nI sipped the coffee as the mile markers slipped past, the hum of the highway loud in the quiet. The head in the footwell let out a faint groan under the jacket. I hit Joe’s name on my screen and waited. He picked up on the second ring.\n\n“Alison,” he said. “You still breathing?”\n\n“Barely,” I said. “I can’t talk long. And I can’t say much. Not out loud.”\n\nA beat of silence.\n\n“It’s with you?”\n\n“Not him. But… it’s listening. I brought something I probably shouldn’t have. I think it hears through it.”\n\n“All right,” Joe said, calm but clipped. “Just talk around it. I can follow.”\n\n“I’m heading your way. Should hit the basin in a couple hours, give or take.”\n\n“We’re setting up now,” he said. “Called in a medicine man named Desbah. He knows that old stuff. Said what you told me last time was a bad shadow. Said that thing you shot might’ve been a mask. Not a real dog.”\n\n“It wasn’t a dog.” I said, my voice wavering just a hint.\n\nJoe exhaled through his nose. I could picture him standing outside his truck, wind tugging at his sleeves. Oiled gator-skin boots kicking at the weeds.\n\n“We set the line near the arroyos. You’ll see it before the road curves west. Cedar, ash, pollen. Desbah’s been blessing it himself. That thing steps through, it’ll feel it. Might even stop it.”\n\n“I’ll drive through. I’ll lead it in.”\n\nHe paused.\n\n“You sure it’s still behind you?”\n\n“No,” I said. “I’m not sure of anything. Except it’s not done with me.”\n\nHis voice dropped.\n\n“Alison, if that doesn’t work, we’ve got a backup plan. If it follows past the ridge, lead it to the trailer up on the hill. It’s mine. Go in, make sure it follows, then slip out the bathroom window and shut it behind you. Locks from the outside. You won’t see anyone, but we’ll be in position. My cousins are posted nearby. Desbah will be with us.”\n\n“Good.”\n\nAnother silence passed between us. The kind that holds everything neither of us wanted to say.\n\n“I don’t know what this thing is, Joe,” I said finally. “But it’s not a man. Not anymore.”\n\n“I figured that much.”\n\n“I hate that I’m leading you into this, Joe.”\n\nHe chuckled. “I’d do anything for you, Ali. Just hate it took somethin’ this awful for us to reconnect.”\n\nI winced. I should’ve reached out sooner. But time has a way of slipping through your fingers.\n\n“You sure your people are ready for this?”\n\n“No one’s ready for something like that. But we’ve dealt with worse than dogs wearing skin.”\n\n“Joe…” I felt a tear streak down my cheek. For the first time, it wasn’t an unkindly shed tear.\n\n“I know. Just get here. We’ll take care of it.”\n\nI stared at the horizon, where the last light had slipped away hours ago. The jacket in the footwell twitched, and a low, warbling breath rattled through the fabric. Listening. Clicking teeth together.\n\n“Soon,” I said. “Just keep the fire burning.”\n\nI hung up.\n\nThe road stretched on for miles. I fought the pull of sleep, guzzling caffeine and chewing jerky to stay alert. I was flying toward a violent conclusion.\n\nKeeton felt drawn to me, like I was his muse and he the artist. Maybe it was because I killed Mutt. Maybe something deeper. Some unseen thread tying us together.\n\nHe killed my friends and coworkers. He beheaded the vet I worked for. Burned down the clinic. Even murdered a trucker just to send me a message. This was more than cruelty.\n\nThis was personal.\n\nA few miles out from the Rez, I saw a wash of blue and red lights behind me, followed by the chirp of a police siren.\n\nIf my sanity were a spool of thread, it was unraveling fast. This night felt like a nightmare unfolding slowly, like a dress billowing on a clothesline.\n\nI pulled calmly to the side of the highway, though my heart thundered in my chest. I kept my hands on the steering wheel and stared into the rearview mirror.\n\nThe officer approached from the right, walking the shoulder with caution. He came to the passenger window and motioned for me to roll it down. I did.\n\n“License and registration, please,” he said in an authoritative tone.\n\n“Yes, one second, officer.” My eyes dropped to the bundle of clothes on the floor, and I forced myself to look back up at the glovebox.\n\nI pulled out some crumpled insurance paperwork and my registration, then grabbed my license from my purse and handed them all over. His face stayed blank, maybe a little annoyed.\n\nHe had just started walking back to his cruiser when Dr. Harkham’s head began to moan. A low, drawn-out sound that grew into a wail. My heart stopped.\n\nThe mood shifted instantly. The officer turned, clicked on his flashlight, and swept the beam across the truck’s interior.\n\n“What is that noise?” he asked, flashing the light across the dash, the seats, the floor.\n\nThe beam settled on the lump in the passenger footwell. He reached down with a gloved hand.\n\n“No, don’t. Please,” I said, my voice cracking, panic blooming fast. If he found the head, Keeton would be the least of my problems.\n\n“Be quiet, ma’am,” he snapped.\n\nWith two fingers, he peeled back the jackets, the dirty shirts, and the jeans. He gasped when he saw the head—eyeless, crusted in dried blood, the flesh writhing slightly, twitching on the floorboard. The head wailed louder now, two black, empty sockets staring up at him.\n\n“Oh Lord have mercy. What the hell is this?” His tone shifted again, this time to fury. “Ma’am, step out of the vehicle. Now.”\n\nI reached for my door handle and heard him unholster his sidearm with a sharp pop. His flashlight lit up the cabin like a searchlight, held steady in his left hand. In his right, he raised a sleek black pistol, his gloved fingers wrapped tight around the grip.\n\n“Do you have any weapons in the car?”\n\n“I have my revolver in the purse, nothing else. Officer, please listen to me—”\n\n“Shut it,” he snapped. “Hands laced behind your head, kneel down in front of the car.”\n\nNo other cars passed by. Besides the wind, it was too quiet. The air shifted. Bad air. A bad omen. It smelled like dust, but beneath it was something fouler. The reek of decay swam through the midnight breeze.\n\nThe scrublands stretched for miles behind barbed wire fences.\n\nThe officer reached for his radio but paused, listening. A low howl rose from the distance. A coyote drowning in a river. A wolf caught in a trap. It was a sound full of pain, too close, and the air around us vibrated with something uncanny.\n\nI had moved in front of the truck, obeying his commands. My feet moved without thought. I had always been pliable under authority, never one to break rules.\n\nThe bushes rustled behind the officer, off to the right beyond the shoulder. He swung his light over.\n\nIt landed on a figure—long limbs, a hunched body, a neck twisted like it had broken in multiple places. He looked like a crane fly, all angular joints and stilted motion. His eyes shone like white flares in the dark.\n\nThe officer’s mouth fell open. He stammered, trying to speak, but only half-formed words spilled out. His hand finished drawing the sidearm, and he turned toward Keeton.\n\nKeeton remained still beneath the moonlight, crouched in the sagebrush, motionless. My body started to shake.\n\nThen he charged.\n\nHe burst forward on long, pounding limbs, elbows jutting out as they absorbed the weight of his insectile body. His mouth opened wide, stretching into his neck like a twisted ribbon of pale flesh lined with thorns.\n\nHe didn’t run. He skittered on all fours.\n\nThe officer stood in a trance. He couldn’t raise his revolver. His hands trembled, belt rattling with the weight of his fear. His face had gone pale, sickly, like he’d come down with the flu. Sweat beaded on his forehead beneath the brim of his hat.\n\nHis radio crackled weakly against his chest. Time froze, held in place. I wanted to speak, to move, to do anything—but my words stuck in my throat, choking me. I was frozen too. Paralyzed by the sight of something that monstrous. Somewhere behind me, Dr. Harkham’s head began laughing.\n\nKeeton was a rolling twister of violence. Like staring into an oncoming hurricane, feet glued to the ground.\n\nViolence incarnate.\n\nHe vaulted the railing in a single leap and crashed into the officer with terrifying force. He slammed the man’s back against my passenger door so hard the entire truck shifted to the left.\n\nThat broke my paralysis.\n\nI scrambled back into the truck and turned the key. My passenger window was still rolled down, and through it I saw the officer’s limp body smashed against the door. His weight bent the metal with a few sharp, hollow pops.\n\nKeeton’s jaw opened wide, stretching all the way to his throat—a mass of twisting yellow teeth. He was chewing through the officer’s skull. Tearing flesh. Stripping it clean. The flashlight and pistol clattered to the pavement. Then Keeton’s eyes came into view. Slitted, swollen, like two overripe grapes.\n\nA predator’s eyes. Empty. Starving.\n\nI slammed the gas. The car lurched forward. Something on the officer’s duty belt scraped against my paint. I felt a thud as both bodies tumbled off my truck and hit the pavement behind me.\n\nIn the rearview, I saw Keeton’s naked body wrapped around the officer, limbs grasping and tearing. His skin crawled with motion, like the organs inside him were alive and shifting. The flashing lights from the squad car bathed them both in red and blue.\n\nOne of the cop’s boots rolled into the road, its laces dragging behind like it was trying to crawl away without him.\n\nKeeton paused, then began pulling the corpse behind him, dragging it like a child pulling along a favorite blanket.\n\nWhen I was a few yards away, Keeton snapped his head sideways at a breakneck speed. His gaze locked directly onto the back of my truck. It was piercing, inevitable, furious—like he’d just realized I was getting away, and the rage hit him all at once.\n\nAs he grew smaller in the rearview, I saw him heave the officer’s body off the ground and toss it deep into the scrublands.\n\nThen he started running after me.\n\nI climbed faster and faster. Sixty miles per hour. The old truck’s engine began to rumble beneath me.\n\nSeventy. The engine groaned. I caught the sharp smell of gas fumes. Keeton was gaining.\n\nAt eighty, the truck shook, barely holding together as the engine roared.\n\nI burned rubber twisting onto an off-ramp, saw an oncoming car a few miles down the road. My tires nearly lost traction on the gravel, kicking up a flurry of pebbles as I fought for control.\n\nKeeton was close enough to reach out. He moved impossibly fast, loping with his long limbs and elbows tucked tight to his sides.\n\nI saw the fire burning in his eyes. He was done chasing. He wanted blood. Mine. And if he caught me, I knew he wouldn’t let me go again.\n\nThe ashes of Mutt crackled in the passenger seat like gunpowder. The head lolled from side to side in the footwell. I felt like I was losing my mind. But between the smell of scorched ash, the reek of decay blooming around me as Keeton drew closer, and the sound of the head laughing, I knew I wasn’t crazy.\n\nThis was all real. Raw and wrong.\n\nThe box I had been stuffing all these impossibilities into was overflowing now. What happens when the box breaks?\n\nWould my mind break too?\n\nI passed through the Arroyos and toward the toll-booth borders of this part of the Rez. The barrier bars were lifted. Was this where the line had been drawn? Could Keeton cross it?\n\nHe was halfway up the roadside, nearly level with the side of my truck. He wasn’t looking ahead—his neck was twisted toward me, his body pounding forward with a mindless kind of purpose. His mouth hung open, eyes wide. Behind me, Dr. Harkham’s head shouted with laughter.\n\nThe engine rattled with speed. Keeton was so close I could smell death. I could see the dried blood of so many victims caked across his twisted, nude body like a suit of crimson armor.\n\nRight as I crossed the border barricade, Keeton veered sharply to the left. I watched him clear the fence and crash down in a heap, thrashing on his back like an insect, arms curled toward the sky.\n\nThe head stopped laughing. The ashes stopped crackling. I slammed the brake pedal to the floor.\n\nKeeton writhed. I saw Joe’s trailer on the hill, half swallowed in dust, lit by the hard glare of floodlights.\n\nI focused the headlights on him. His thrashing slowed, then stilled. My tires thumped over uneven ground as I crept forward, heart burning like a live wire.\n\nI stomped the gas, aiming to crush him beneath the weight of the truck. But he leapt at the last second, sprawling across the roof and smashing through the back windshield in a burst of glass.\n\nI flung the car into reverse. One tire crunched over his leg. For the first time, I saw pain in Keeton’s eyes in the rearview. I clenched my teeth until my jaw ached.\n\nKeeton clung to the frame, screeching. He yanked and pulled, his foot pinned like a plank beneath the tire. I slammed into drive. He flew backwards off of the car, his limb bending and snapping like a brittle branch.\n\nAs I climbed toward the hill, I saw him rise again on all fours. One leg was twisted into broken segments, the foot dragging unnaturally across the dirt.\n\nAnd still, he came after me.\n\nBut now, there was a break in his stride.\n\nHe was slower.\n\nHe was wounded.\n\nAnd if it bleeds, it can die. At least, I hoped so.\n\nI rounded the rise. The area was desolate. Not a soul in sight. I hoped that was part of the plan. I prayed it was.\n\nI slid my car into park on the ridge and pulled the parking brake. Behind me, I heard the pounding of hands on earth, getting closer with every second.\n\nKeeton landed on my roof with a thud, the metal buckling under his weight. Then he threw himself forward, vaulted over the hood, and smeared blood across the windshield as he rolled and hit the ground. He stood facing me with those reptile eyes, blocking the way to the trailer. Its door was wide open.\n\nI pulled the gun from my purse and pointed it at him. He tilted his head, and I felt my muscles tense. I wasn’t pulling the trigger—something inside me was pulling against it. I fired once. The bullet missed him entirely and buried itself into the trailer wall.\n\nKeeton charged.\n\nI dropped the pistol and ran around the car. He roared as his broken ankle slammed against the dirt. He scrambled onto the roof again, and I ducked to avoid a swipe from his hand. The spot where Mutt had bitten my ankle throbbed, and the pain lit sparks behind my eyes as I flexed and pushed through.\n\nThe body will break itself to escape death. And the mind, drowning in adrenaline, becomes a weapon.\n\nBut he was feeling it too. The adrenaline. His nervous system was short-circuiting. His mouth opened like a wilted flower, tongue flicking through the air. He was tasting something. Could he smell Joe? The others? Were they near?\n\nHe leaped, and I dove through the trailer doorway. One of his claws raked across my back. I shoved past a floral couch, knocked pans off a shelf in the narrow kitchen, and bolted toward the bathroom.\n\nKeeton thundered in behind me, screaming.\n\n“Bitch. Bitch. I’ll rip out your throat.” His voice scraped like rusted wire dragged across concrete, echoing down the narrow hallway.\n\n“Play with your insides. Eat them.”\n\nThe trailer rocked under Keeton’s weight, metal hinges groaning. I slammed the bathroom door behind me and scrambled for the open window. My foot knocked over a toothbrush and a tube of paste as I shoved myself through.\n\nPain flared along my back. The wound on my calf throbbed. Keeton was almost on me. I could feel his heat, the hate radiating off him.\n\nThe door splintered just as I dove. My teeth cracked against desert stone when I hit the ground. A burst of white light exploded behind my eyes, and blood filled my nose, hot and thick. \n\nSomething moved past me. Fast. Silent. I heard the window slam shut. Arms wrapped around my torso and dragged me away from the trailer, around to the front by my car.\n\nKeeton’s voice roared from inside, a storm of curses and blasphemy. He screamed like a trapped coyote, cornered and caged.\n\nHe’d sensed something was off, but he couldn’t help himself. His bloodlust had outpaced his instincts. Now he was trapped.\n\nI turned my face upward. The sky above the basin cracked with heat lightning. Purple veins crawled across the clouds. The air buzzed with insect calls and owl cries. The desert had awakened, and it seemed to know what was coming.\n\nA man I didn’t recognize moved past me, wearing a bandolier of bundled sage and carrying a rawhide pouch that smelled of cedar and cornmeal. He approached the trailer with quiet purpose, opened my truck door, and retrieved the bundle of Mutt’s ashes and the shrouded head of Dr. Harkham. With steady precision, he placed them both through a window into the trailer.\n\nAnother man knelt in the dirt near the rear axle. An elder in a long shirt embroidered with turquoise beads and white ochre. He began to sing in a language I didn’t understand. The words were low and heavy, his voice rolling like wind through canyon crests. He poured corn pollen in a slow arc around the trailer, his movements deliberate and unwavering.\n\nThe others joined in. Their chant rose from the earth like the black smoke from the trailer. The song was older than Keeton. Older than the desert. Then came the drumbeat, deep and rhythmic. A taut deerhide stretched over a cedar frame, struck in time with the chanting.\n\nInside the trailer, Keeton’s limbs thrashed. A hand burst through the kitchen window, blistered and cracking. His skin was changing, splitting, leaking.\n\nJoe stood nearby, rifle leveled, his breath slow and focused. The bullets he fired were ceremonial, silver-cast and marked with ash and pollen. Each one struck with meaning.\n\nKeeton screamed like something dying. His voice scraped against the trailer’s walls as flames began to rise from underneath.\n\nThe tinder placed below had caught. Smoke coiled into the night sky, carrying something foul and wrong. The fire grew, hungry and bright, fed not only by gasoline but by intention. By design.\n\nKeeton howled as the medicine circle tightened around him. His bleeding eyes gleamed through the flicker of flame, filled with disbelief and fury. He clawed at the walls, tried to find the door, but it had been sealed from the outside with rawhide bindings and sacred paint. He scratched at the windows, too narrow for his spider-like frame to slip through.\n\nThe chanting never stopped. Even when the trailer began to cave inward. Even when the screams turned wet and animal. The fire consumed. The wind shifted.\n\nI watched Keeton stop fighting. I saw his flesh pock, blister, rupture, and burn. He looked at me through the window, the same way Mutt had. With those vacant, unreadable eyes. Keeton sucked up lungfulls of empty breath.\n\nJoe watched his home burn to embers. For me. There wasn’t a trace of regret in his expression. Only that same ruthless, focused anger.\n\nI spit blood through my cracked lips.\n\nAnd then the world went quiet.\n\nNo birds. No insects. Not even coyotes. No Keeton. Not anymore.\n\nOnly the breath of the desert and the low hum of thunder threading the sky.\n\nWe stood and watched the trailer’s shell glow red, then crumble. Joe’s cousins moved through the sagebrush with extinguishers, tamping out sparks before they could catch. I didn’t look away until it was dark, silent, hollow.\n\nThen I broke. Not cleanly. Not quietly. My whole body shook with sobs dragged from someplace beneath grief. I screamed, raw and hoarse, and clung to Joe like a raft in a black ocean.\n\nHe wrapped me in a musty blanket and said nothing. Just held on. One hand pressed firm to my back. I wept into the chest of his shirt.\n\nSo much gone. So much taken.\n\n“It better be dead,” I said between sobs.\n\n“We’re going to bury the ashes of that fucker. Desbah’s gonna make sure it doesn’t come back.”\n\nI used to believe in quiet deaths. Gentle ones. That was before Mutt. Before the laughing sickness that was Keeton.\n\nThe world had gone still. No more chase. No more fire. No more road to burn through. Just the sound of my breath hitching, the dull ache in my limbs, and the weight of deep grief settling into my bones.",

Awful enough to leave only a terrible itch, and a terrible fib, in the erased cavity left behind?\n\nThe ‘forgetting’ may be a biological defence mechanism, designed to protect the human mind from slipping into insanity when faced with a nightmare beyond mortal comprehension.\n\nThe 'forgetting' may, and this is a far more haunting possibility, be a paranormal occurrence that I have yet to uncover—or that I simply don't *remember* uncovering.\n\nI think every last person has, at one point or another, experienced this thing which wants to be forgotten.\n\nMaybe we all see it. Film it. Write about it. But half a minute later, we forget the truth of those images and texts.\n\nWhen you reflect on reading this, for instance, you’ll remember only that you’ve forgotten something.\n\nEven now, I’m writing only what I *do* remember—that there exists a thing to be forgotten at all. Whatever horror occurred in my bedroom, maybe five or six minutes ago, has been replaced by a memory of me sitting in the lounge and watching television.\n\nYet, I still feel a residual pang of fear.\n\nFrom here onwards, I will jot down my thoughts during each encounter with this forgettable *terror*, before my 30 seconds run out, then try my best to make sense of the writings later.\n\n> Something watches.\n\n> No head. No body. Grey dots. Must be eyes, which is horrifying, but anything else would be worse. Any greater existential horror, like\n\n> Eyes in the room. Only remember seconds of them watching, but maybe I've forgotten.\n\n> Grey dots move. Disappear into the black. Reappear. Like blinking eyes.\n\n> Grey eyes. Nothing else—no, something I’ve already forgotten.\n\n> Stop writing about these encounters. You don’t want to know the truth about any of this.\n\n> It looks, and it eats. Not with teeth. With grey light.\n\n> PLEASE. SCARED. I WANT TO FORGET, FORGET, FORGET, FORGET. THIS IS ANOTHER WARNING TO STOP WRITING ABOUT\n\n> Feels like a screw twisting into my temple. Saps my soul's strength.\n\n> Why is this the longest 30 seconds of my life? STOP!\n\n> Forgetting might seem like a mercy, but I must remember. I don’t think I have much strength left for it to chew. It wants whatever remains of me. Soon, I’ll\n\n> We’re not meant to notice. I did, and it slashed at my eyelid. Bleeding. Terrified. Those grey dots grow. Glide to me, and\n\nI don’t know how that sentence was meant to end seconds ago, but those grey eyes are gone now.\n\nWhy am I still so afraid?\n\nI just forgot about this post; I'm skim-reading the notes to refresh my memory whilst typing. What haunts me is that I already knew about the wound—the large laceration down my eyelid. However, I now have a long-term memory of my Labrador jumping up and unintentionally clawing me with nails at the end of its loving paw.\n\n*That memory is a lie, isn't it?*\n\nI just read my notes and remembered the wretched truth all over again. I’m frightened, and alone, and wondering how many other people across the world are stuck in a loop of fear and forgetting right now.\n\nIs this the explanation for humanity's many sudden and 'unexplainable' moments of anxiety?\n\nDo we all endlessly forget the cause of our seemingly baseless bouts of existential dread?\n\nMy long-term memory continues to tell me one thing, but my own hand-typed admissions tell me another. And whenever I re-read my accounts of past events, the *real* memories awaken momentarily within me; in my short-term memory, I once again recall that the source of my underlying terror is those haunting, pursuing, grey dots.\n\n30 seconds later, the memory is overwritten with another lie.\n\nWhy?\n\nFor that matter, why am I even fighting the inevitability of this thing that watches and takes from me?\n\nIt’s all pointless, isn’t it?\n\nAfter all, I bring you this account, but it’s just like the other documented evidence that must exist out there—historical books, online archives, and photographs. Our brains continually scrub out the truth.\n\nYou may re-read my post if you wish, but why bother? The specific details you digest will be mentally overwritten time and time again. When we think of this post, a lie will fill its place.\n\nMeanwhile, each and every day, those dots will continue to drain us, all for some horrid goal.\n\nI will continue researching until I find a way to end this forgettable hell.\n\nOr that abhorrent thing finds a way to end me.

        "content": "\nI know I shouldn’t be writing this. I should be running. But my legs are trembling so badly, I can barely stand. My hands are slick with sweat, making the keys slippery as I type. My phone is at 3%, and I need someone—anyone—to read this before it dies.\n\nThis started three days ago.\n\nI was coming home from my night shift at the hospital. I’m a nurse. Long hours, little sleep. I’ve always brushed off the weird stuff—flickering lights, cold spots—probably just my sleep-deprived brain. But that night was different.\n\nWhen I pulled into my driveway, I saw the living room light was on. I was sure I’d turned it off before leaving. Still, I figured maybe I was wrong. Sleep-deprived mistakes. I walked in, tossed my keys on the counter, and froze.\n\nThe front door was still locked.\n\nI moved through the house, turning on lights, checking every room. Nothing. No one. Just me, out of breath and shaking. I was about to convince myself I’d imagined it when I caught a glimpse of something in the hallway mirror.\n\nMy reflection… blinked too slowly.\n\nI stepped closer, and my reflection didn’t move right away. I lifted my hand, and it lagged behind. Only by a fraction of a second, but enough for me to notice. I waved. It waved. A beat too late.\n\nI don’t remember falling asleep that night, but when I woke up, there were muddy footprints leading from the front door to my bed.\n\nI live alone.\n\nI didn’t go to work the next day. Instead, I stayed home, triple-checking that all the doors and windows were locked. By midnight, I was sitting on the couch with every light on, scrolling through Reddit and pretending I wasn’t terrified.\n\nThat’s when I saw it.\n\nMy bedroom door—barely cracked open—slowly swung shut.\n\nI stood. My throat felt like it was stuffed with cotton. I tiptoed to the door, hand shaking as I pushed it open. The room was empty. I let out a shaky breath and backed away—then bumped into something solid.\n\nI turned around.\n\nIt was me.\n\nI was standing in the hallway, barefoot, wearing the same oversized shirt I was currently wearing. Same messy bun. Same tired eyes. My chest was rising and falling in time with my own breath.\n\nBut she—it—was smiling. I wasn’t.\n\nThe copy of me reached forward, placing a cold hand on my wrist. Her grip was almost affectionate. That’s when I saw the nails. Black with dirt. The same dirt that had tracked across my bedroom floor.\n\nShe didn’t speak. Just leaned in close, pressing her lips to my ear, and whispered:\n\n“You’re in here now.”\n\nAnd then she turned and walked away, disappearing into my bedroom.\n\nI ran. I didn’t grab my phone or my keys. I just sprinted out of the house and didn’t stop until I was several blocks away, barefoot and gasping for air.\n\nI didn’t go home. I couldn’t. I went to my friend’s apartment and stayed there the next two nights, crashing on their couch. I didn’t tell them. I didn’t sleep.\n\nBut tonight…I came back. I had to. I needed my phone, my wallet, my car.\n\nWhen I walked inside, the house was dark. Quiet. I tiptoed through the rooms, grabbing my things, ready to leave. But as I was about to open the door, I heard footsteps.\n\nComing from the bedroom.\n\nAnd then I saw her.\n\nMe.\n\nShe was standing at the end of the hallway, barefoot and smiling. Only this time, her face was rotting. Gray skin peeling in places. Hollow cheeks. Sunken eyes. And she was holding my car keys.\n\nWhen I started to back away, she opened her mouth too wide—jaw cracking, skin splitting at the corners—and dropped the keys into her throat. She swallowed them.\n\nI ran. I slammed the front door behind me. But when I reached the street and turned back to look at the house, she was already at the window, watching me.\n\nSmiling with MY FACE.\n\nI’m typing this from the gas station a mile away. My feet are bleeding, my throat is raw, and I’m shaking so hard I can barely hold the phone.\n\nI’m afraid to go back.\nBut I think it’s too late.\nBecause when I looked into the station’s bathroom mirror just now…\n\nMy reflection didn’t blink at all.",

        "content": "The dinner party was my idea, because I am a vain bitch.\n\nCarla and Edith may have the Harvard physicist husbands and *gifted* kids and lavish European vacations, but dammit, I was going to have *something.* And it ended up being a house.\n\nDid I buy this house knowing there was probably something wrong with it? Yes. Did I care? Not particularly. As soon as the realtor showed me the place, I knew I had to have it. Bless her heart, she was actually trying to be honest. “There might be a little water damage,” she said, gesturing to the stain on the wall that was clearly in the shape of a woman’s face. “No one’s been in the basement for decades,” she said, as a horrible thumping noise came down from below us.\n\n“When can we close?”\n\n“But I haven’t shown you the attic yet,” she protested. “There’s something you should see up there…”\n\n“*When can we close?”*\n\nI’d replayed the fantasy in my head a hundred times. My sisters’ looks of shock as they walked up the front porch steps. I’d relived it more than any sexual fantasy, that’s for sure. The look of their jaws dropping open, validating my existence, was downright orgasmic.\n\n*They’re not going to believe their eyes.*\n\nWe moved in in a rush. Isabel originally started out in the front bedroom, but the woman in the closet became a problem. “A woman can’t fit in there,” I’d reassured her, but she explained to me that the woman “folded herself up like a spider” to fit. Jack didn’t like his room either, complaining of the “man that hangs from the ceiling and stares at me all night.”\n\nI hadn’t experienced anything in the owner’s suite, so I put the kids in there. I decided to sleep in Isabel’s old room (a haunted woman sounded marginally better than a haunted man, you know how men can be) and things went okay after that. It was always a pain putting the chairs back every morning (no matter how we arranged them at night, they were always stacked on each other in the morning so they reached the ceiling.) There were other issues too, but for the most part, we were surviving.\n\nThe day of the party, I couldn’t sit still. I skittered around the house, straightening the table cloth, arranging the flowers just so. “Mommy, can I have one?” Isabel asked, staring forlornly at the mini-sandwiches I’d made on a multi-tiered plate.\n\nI hesitated. Even one missing would throw off the symmetry of the whole thing. But I didn’t want to be the bad mom. (I suppose some people might argue that moving your kids into a haunted house is what a “bad mom” would do also, but eh, to each their own.)\n\n“You can have one,” I told her, moving to ruffle her hair—then stopping myself. Wouldn’t want her to have messy hair when they arrived.\n\nThen I stationed myself right behind the door, staring out the peephole. Ten minutes later, I saw Carla’s SUV pulling up. And a few minutes after that, Edith’s.\n\nI watched them walk up the steps.\n\nAnd boy, did their mouths drop open.\n\nI desperately wished I could read lips as I watched Carla say something to Edith, gesturing at the porch. *They’re so pissed! This is awesome*—\n\n“Mom?”\n\n“Not now, your aunts are here—”\n\n“But the sink’s making blood again.”\n\nI jumped back from the door. *“What?!”*\n\n“There’s blood coming out of the faucet,” she said plainly.\n\nAnd then I heard Jack giggling in the kitchen.\n\n*Fuckfuckfuck.*\n\nThe doorbell rang, but I was sprinting away from the door, into the kitchen—*oh, no.* There was, indeed, blood coming out of the perfectly-polished kitchen faucet. It splattered onto the quartz countertops, staining them red. And there was Jack, running his hands through it, the edges of his sleeves red, giggling like a madman.\n\n*“JACK!”*\n\nHe turned around, still grinning.\n\nI turned off the sink. “Tell Aunt Carla and Aunt Edith I’ll be there in a second,” I told Isabel, grappling with Jack, “*and do not let them in the house.”*\n\n“Yes, Mommy.”\n\nI was lucky to have Isabel. She was a smart kid, smarter than me. Must’ve gotten it from her dad.\n\nTen minutes later, Jack and I were making it down the curved staircase. Him in a new, crisp-white shirt. Me with the faintest ghost of blood around my fingernails. Isabel, bless her little soul, was standing in the doorway talking up a storm with her aunts.\n\n“—and that’s why poison dart frogs are poisonous,” she was saying. “It’s what they’re *eating* in the rain forest. Not a single frog in a zoo has ever been—”\n\nI appeared behind her. “Hi!” I said, breathless. “Sorry for the wait! Come on in!”\n\nThey both silently stepped in. “Woah!” Sam, Edith’s boy, said. “This isn’t like what you described—”\n\n“Sssshhh,” Edith cut him off.\n\n“This is really nice,” Carla said. But her voice was heavy, carrying—what? Jealousy? Suspicion? Maybe she thought I’d robbed a bank, or worse, become a crack dealer. Well, good. Let her dream up her little conspiracies.\n\n“Woah!” Carla’s husband Jacob said, completely clueless and not reading the room, as he stepped in after. “This is *amazing!”*\n\n“Thank you,” I replied.\n\n“I didn’t think you could aff—”\n\n*“Kevin,”* Carla hissed.\n\nHe shut up and gave me an awkward grin.\n\n“Come on in, I’ve got some hors d’oeuvres for you all.” I ushered them into the dining room, where I kept the sandwiches. I quickly noticed a turkey-and-swiss had a deep red fingerprint on it. *Fuck.* I grabbed it and stuffed it into my mouth whole.\n\n*Hope that blood doesn’t carry any bloodborne diseases!* a little voice singsonged in my head.\n\n*Well, we’ll fucking find out, won’t we?* I thought as I swallowed.\n\nJack sat at the table, kicking his legs, slowly unraveling his shirt as he pulled at a loose thread. Isabel stood next to me, absolutely motionless, surveying the scene.\n\n*As long as I can keep everything under control for two hours,* I thought. *They don’t stay long. Edith’s kids have a strict 8 o’clock bedtime.*\n\nMy eyes unconsciously flicked to the three deadbolts over the basement door. Then the crack of darkness underneath the door. I swallowed.\n\n*Two hours.*\n\n*We can do it for two hours.*\n\n*Right?*\n\n“These are delicious,” Edith said. “Did you make them?”\n\nI nodded. “Isabel helped me.”\n\n“Little chef there, aren’t ya?” Carla said, shooting her a big grin.\n\nLike she even cared about my kid.\n\nOkay. That was harsh. Of course she cared about Isabel. But by the same token, I hadn’t seen her rushing to babysit when Eric left, or bringing over lasagnas and brownies, or swinging by with Carrie and Colin for a playdate. Neither of them reached out a helping hand when we were groundless, buoys on the water, drifting between schools and zip codes. \n\n“Can we see the upstairs?” Colin asked, with a big, toothy grin.\n\n“Yeah, can we?” Carrie asked.\n\n“Uh…” The woman in the closet flashed through my mind, sitting on the floor, crumpled in on herself. Her head upside-down, black eyes glittering in the shadows. “Sorry, no, it’s really messy up there. First floor only, please.” I shot a look at the deadbolts again. “No basement, either.”\n\n“Aw, man,” Colin groaned.\n\nThen the creaking started.\n\nIt started above us, in the far corner of the dining room, and then slowly moved to the opposite end. Edith’s apathetic teenager, Sam, looked up from his phone for a second. Edith shot me a look—“Someone else here?”\n\nI shook my head. “Nonono, the house just settles a lot, is all.”\n\nI glanced at the oven clock.\n\nSix minutes.\n\nThey’d been here six minutes.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\n“Okay, uh, let’s just establish some ground rules,” I said hastily. Edith raised an eyebrow. Carla looked skeptical. “No upstairs, no downstairs, okay? We stay on this floor. And also, uh, the kitchen sink has been having issues, so use the bathroom sink if you need to wash your hands.”\n\nCarla and Edith exchanged a look.\n\n“Also! If anyone has any injuries, like injuries that draw blood, immediately go outside.”\n\nNow the kids were staring at me too, eyes wide.\n\n*Shit. I didn’t have to say that. The chances that someone would draw blood in the next one hour, fifty-three minutes were tiny. I could’ve just hung onto that rule… and waited… and only said it if someone actually hurt themselves.*\n\n*Now Carla and Edith are looking at me like I’m crazy.*\n\n*No, no, not crazy.*\n\n*They’re looking at me like they think I’m hiding something.*\n\n*Like a mold problem. Or a bat problem. Or something…*\n\n“Let me get the food ready,” I said, clearing my throat. “Give me a sec.”\n\nI disappeared into the kitchen. I’d picked up some chickens from Boston Market and put them in the oven to warm up. I walked over, grabbed the oven door—\n\nI quickly slammed it shut.\n\n*Fuck fuck fuck.*\n\nWhat had been staring out at me was not a well-seasoned bird, but a woman’s head, skin crispy and eyes charred.\n\n*Why the fuck did you use the oven?* I scolded myself.\n\n*You know this happens sometimes.*\n\n*You* know *this.*\n\n“Mom, are you okay?” Isabel whispered behind me.\n\n“It’s Rosemary,” I whispered back.\n\n“Oh. I know how to get rid of her.” She walked over to the salt pig and grabbed a pinch of kosher salt. Without looking, she cracked the oven door open and threw the salt in. I heard a sizzling sound, that almost sounded like a shriek—and when I looked in the oven, the birds were back.\n\n“Wow. How’d you figure that one out?” I whispered.\n\n“When you were at work late. A few weeks ago. Jack was hungry, I cooked a pizza, but she was there. Salt repels ghosts, so I tried that. Sage does too, but it only made her really mad.”\n\nWow. She was *so* smart for a thirteen-year-old.\n\nI donned the oven mitts and pulled the birds out. Got all the other side dishes out. “Okay, let’s eat!” I called, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n*One hour, forty-seven minutes left.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“This is delicious,” Carla said. “How’d you season it?”\n\n“Oh, just the usual. Sage, garlic… rosemary…”\n\nIsabel began to giggle. I shot her a smile.\n\nThings seemed to be going okay. No one had mentioned Eric yet. No one had tried to use the kitchen sink. And the piles of teeth hadn’t started appearing.\n\nMaybe things would go okay.\n\n*One hour, thirteen minutes left…*\n\nA loud *thump* came from upstairs. Carla stopped chewing and looked up. “You have mice or something?” she asked.\n\n“Nope,” I replied. “Not mice.”\n\n“Sounds like an animal,” she said, stabbing at her chicken. “Could be a raccoon. Raccoons can transmit rabies, you know. You should get someone out here to take a look—”\n\n“It’s *not* a raccoon.”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Carla said. “Just trying to help.”\n\n*No, you’re not. You’re trying to tear down this house because you’re jealous.* My heart twinged. *After everything I’ve done. You’re trying to take it away from me.*\n\nEdith said nothing, but I could tell she was thinking something. She kept shooting Carla conspiratorial glances. No doubt they’d be having an hour phone conversation tonight, sorting through every detail of the evening, picking it apart. *And she wouldn’t even let us go upstairs!* I could picture Edith saying. *It’s got to be bad. Maybe black mold. Or water damage.*\n\n*Yeah, she was so weird about that,* I could picture Carla saying. *What’s she trying to hide so bad? A dead body?*\n\nWell, yeah, sort of.\n\nI stabbed at my chicken, trying not to think of Rosemary’s blistered skin, and ate it. With each bite I got madder and madder. They’d moved on to other topics now—Edith’s vacation to France—but obviously they were still thinking about me, thinking about this house—\n\nThinking about how Eric left me—\n\nThinking about what idiot doesn’t sniff out an affair for *two years—*\n\nThinking of all the coke I must’ve sold to buy this house—\n\nThinking they’d never buy this house, it wasn’t good enough for them either, with its black-mold-rabid-raccoons-dismembered-woman-in-the-attic—\n\n“Wait,” I said, looking up from my food. “Where’s Sam?”\n\n“Oh, he went to use the bathroom upstairs,” Edith said. “Jacob’s in the one down here.”\n\nMy heartbeat skyrocketed.\n\n“I… said… *no one… upstairs,”* I snarled.\n\n“Yeah, but he had to use the bathroom!” Edith said. “Why are you acting so odd, anyway? This entire dinner you’ve been—”\n\nA metallic *thunk* came from upstairs.\n\nI didn’t wait for Edith to finish her thought. I bounded up the stairs two at a time. As I got to the top, I saw that the bathroom door was closed.\n\nAnd there was a thin layer of water, seeping out from under the crack in the door and into the hallway.\n\n*Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.*\n\nI ran over to the door. Tried the handle. It was locked.\n\n“Sam!” I shouted. “Sam, can you hear me!”\n\nA gurgling noise came from the other side.\n\nLike someone trying to talk, under water.\n\nI felt above the doorframe for the key. Hand shaking, I put it into the tiny hole in the doorknob. My hands shook as I maneuvered it, trying to get the door to unlock. I was so bad at this—it was so hard to get it perfectly positioned—\n\n*Click.*\n\nI burst into the bathroom.\n\nThe green tile floor was covered in water.\n\nIt was flowing over the sides of the bathtub. Which was mostly obscured by the shower curtain.\n\nPoking out from the edge of the shower curtain, though, I could see two things—\n\nSam’s dockside shoes and the hem of his blue jeans, underwater.\n\nAnd long, wet black hair trailing into the water.\n\nI yanked the shower curtain back and the *thing—*the emaciated woman-like thing with the gaping wounds all over her body, balancing herself on the edges of the tub, hovering over Sam, holding him underwater—leapt off the bathtub and onto the floor.\n\nHer body hit the wet tile with a splash.\n\nI lurched for the bathtub and grabbed Sam, pulled him out of the water. He coughed and sputtered and clawed at me, desperate to get away from the thing. It scrambled into the space between the toilet and the wall, hissing.\n\n“Sam!”\n\nI looked up to see Edith running into the bathroom, her face deathly pale. “*What the hell did you do to him?!”* she screamed at me, after confirming he was alive.\n\n“It wasn’t me. It was *that.”*\n\nI pointed to the thing, hair trailing over her face now, one pure-white eye peeking out at us.\n\nHer entire body froze.\n\nThen, without a word, she grabbed Sam and pulled him out of the bathroom.\n\nI don’t quite remember what happened after that. I remember Carla screaming at me. I remember Carrie crying. Or maybe it was Colin. I remember them getting out of my house as fast as humanly possible, while Isabel and Jack cowered behind me.\n\nAnd then they were gone.\n\nWater dripped off the balcony that overlooked the foyer, falling onto the beautiful hardwood with a *drip, drip, drip.*\n\nThe wood creaked over our heads. It was probably the man that hangs from the ceiling. He likes to stretch his legs sometimes.\n\nThe thing in the bathroom was still hissing.\n\n“Mom,” Isabel said, looking up at me. “Can we get a different house?”\n\nI stared out the window, at the wraparound porch, the wooden swing, the setting sun.\n\n“I think that’s probably a good idea.”",

        "content": "You don’t get used to grief. You just learn to walk around the hole.\n\nThree months ago, my sister Grace died.\n\nShe slipped in the bath. That’s what the coroner said. That’s what Mum says when she can say anything at all. No alcohol, no drugs, nothing suspicious. Just a slick surface, a cracked skull, and blood that turned the bathwater pink.\n\nShe was twenty-four.\n\nI’ve gone over that day in my head a thousand times. What I said to her last. What I didn’t say. Whether she was already dead when I texted her and she didn’t answer. Whether the message—*“Want to do sushi later?”*—was still buzzing silently on her screen while she was lying cold and still on the tiles.\n\nI’m not telling this story for sympathy.\n\nI’m telling it because something is happening to me.\n\nAnd I think Grace is involved.\n\n••\n\nIt started with a photo.\n\nMum asked me to clear Grace’s room. She said she couldn’t bring herself to touch it. So I went. I packed up her things. Folded clothes that still smelled like her. Lifted polaroids from her mirror. Took down old posters with curled edges and dust underneath.\n\nHer camera was still on the desk.\n\nAn old 35mm thing—Grace loved analogue stuff. She called digital too clean, too dishonest.\n\nI took one photo.\n\nI don’t know why. The camera was loaded. The room was quiet. The light was catching the dust just right. It felt… respectful, I guess. A record of what was left behind.\n\nI snapped the shutter and took it with me.\n\nI dropped off the film at a place in town. Took a few days. I almost forgot about it. But when I picked up the prints, the woman behind the counter stared at me for a second too long before handing them over.\n\nI didn’t look at them until I got home.\n\nThe last image was Grace’s room.\n\nBut it wasn’t empty.\n\nShe was there.\n\nSitting cross-legged on the bed, in her striped pyjamas, smiling.\n\n••\n\nI stared at the photo for what must’ve been ten minutes.\n\nIt wasn’t a trick of the light. It wasn’t a double exposure.\n\nIt was Grace.\n\nHer knees tucked under her, hands folded in her lap, head tilted slightly—like she knew I was there. Her smile was soft. Familiar. But her eyes—\n\nGod, her eyes looked straight through me.\n\nI flipped it over. No writing. No timestamp. Just the glossy paper and the shallow bend where my thumb had pressed too hard.\n\nI laid out the rest of the photos.\n\nSame room. Same light. Same dust in the air. But only one with her in it.\n\nI checked the negatives.\n\nShe was there, clear as anything. Not burned in. Not photoshopped. Not a mistake.\n\nThe photo was real.\n\n••\n\nI didn’t tell Mum. What the hell could I say?\n\n*“Hey, look, Grace’s ghost is on film?”*\n\nNo. I kept it to myself.\n\nThat was a week ago.\n\nI haven’t slept properly since.\n\n••\n\nThe next night, I dreamed of her.\n\nWe were both kids again, sitting under a sheet with a torch and making shadow puppets. Grace used to be good at that—she could make a rabbit with her fingers that actually looked like a rabbit.\n\nIn the dream, she turned to me and whispered something I couldn’t hear. Her mouth moved, slow and wide, but the sound didn’t come. Only the light flickered.\n\nThen I woke up.\n\nAnd the photo had moved.\n\nIt was no longer in the drawer where I’d hidden it.\n\nIt was on my bedside table.\n\nFace down.\n\n••\n\nI put the camera in the attic after that. I didn’t even want to touch it. I wrapped it in a towel, shoved it in a shoebox, and pushed it behind some old Christmas decorations. Out of sight.\n\nOut of reach.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\n••\n\nThree days later, Mum asked if I’d been in Grace’s room again.\n\nI told her no.\n\nShe said the door was open. That the light was on.\n\nI told her maybe she’d left it that way.\n\nShe didn’t answer. But later that night, I heard her crying through the wall. Not loud. Just those broken little breaths you try to hide in the dark.\n\n••\n\nToday, I found another photo.\n\nIn the post.\n\nNo return address. Just an envelope with my name on it, smudged ink on the front.\n\nInside: a single print.\n\n*Another image of Grace.*\n\nBut this time, the room was wrong. The wallpaper had peeled. The bed was bare. And she wasn’t smiling.\n\nShe was standing. In the corner. Eyes fixed on the lens.\n\nCloser this time.\n\nAlmost like she’d stepped toward me.\n",

        "content": "My pinky finger tasted like stroopwafel covered in maple syrup.\n\nThat was the first piece of me that they took—that I had given up. Without any fanfare, and without any need, if I’m completely honest. So stupid of me.\n\n<<*Put the tip of your pinky finger in your mouth,*\\>> they had said, without speaking. <<*Have a taste. It‘s the greatest feeling in the world…*\\>> \n\nAnd they were right. The tip of my finger broke off, crisp and clean, like a delicate cookie wafer. I felt no pain—only a subtly sweet and sticky syrup combined with a satisfying crunchy texture. My pinky was the best snack I’ve ever had, and ever will.\n\nAfterwards, the hint of maple just a whisper on the back of my tongue, I stared at my hand, at the tiny, missing space where earlier there was flesh and nail. Now, only a healed nub remained. I marvelled at the newborn pink of the skin, flawlessly and invisibly stitched back together. I savoured the taste of my finger and felt sadness and longing towards its fading memory. I really should have been more alarmed, but truthfully, I didn’t mourn the finger tip itself.\n\n<<*Tell people you lost it chopping onions*\\>> they winked, without winking. \n\nTheir form defied description, and maybe comprehension. A vaguely human shape, with kaleidoscopic skin and features that danced in the corners of my vision and ran when my eye settled on them. Staring directly at them too long induced nausea, as if I had just swallowed a cup of sugar. But within the shifting landscape that they wore, I spied glimpses of both horror and ecstasy. I couldn’t help but shudder. I was repulsed. And yet I wanted more. \n\nWhen I think back to that first meeting now, I feel so dumb. It wasn’t like I was starving at the time. I wasn’t even hungry for a snack. I was simply *bored.* And the next thing I knew, there it was, in the corner of my living room, an ominous haze next to the TV I had been staring at.\n\nA pleasure demon. <<*A connoisseur of all creation.*\\>> At this line, I sensed it give an exaggerated, bowing flourish. A smirking grin lay behind its ever-shifting mass. \n\n<<*I’ve collected so many wonders of this world. Give me a taste of yours, and I’ll share mine. A fair trade, no?>>* They laughed—a sound like tinkling wind chimes overlaid on an infant’s scream. \n\n<<*Think on it.>>*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next thing they took from me was the colour purple. \n\nWhich, again, really didn’t seem so bad. Purple’s not really that popular of a colour is it? Now whenever I stare at the eggplant emoji, I just see… nothing. Or rather, the colour “nothing.” Not grey, not black, but a pure emptiness, in the rough form of a suggestive vegetable. It’s like there’s a small, purple-shaped void in my mind. \n\nIt had been yet another Friday evening that I was about to spend by myself on the couch. I had few friends and zero plans, but that was something familiar to me. The small studio apartment I called home felt like both a cage and a cave; something that kept me in, but also provided comfort and shelter and safety from the outside. It was when I was debating between Netflix or Youtube that the pleasure demon returned.\n\nIn return for the colour purple, they told me a story. But not just any story—the Greatest Story Ever Told. I remember a soft, golden hum, slowly filling my mind. I remember tones that sang sweeter than any music I’ve ever heard. I remember joy, terror, shock, and wonder. I remember gasping at the plot twists, crying at the deaths, cheering out loud at the triumphant climax, and crying, again, at the satisfying resolution. \n\nAfterwards, when I stared at my phone and realized that I had been listening to the story for seven hours, when I raced to my computer to write it down, I realized that I remembered none of the details. Nothing but a lingering memory of that experience, pleasant with a hint of the grotesque, something I grasped desperately for but remained just out of reach. \n\n<<*Don’t you worry,>>* the demon cooed. <<*I’ll be back.>>*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nNext, I lost the ability to dream. \n\nThe pleasure demon had returned on another Friday, but this one capped a particularly rough week at work. One of those weeks where nothing went well, and everything felt harder than it should have. \n\nWhen I saw the pleasure demon out of the corner of my eye in the kitchen, I felt excitement and relief. As stupid as it sounds, I almost wanted to embrace the demon like a friend. \n\n<<*Tough week?*\\>> they asked, with a very good approximation of sympathy. \n\n“Give me a good one,” I replied.\n\n<<*Good One coming right up!>>*\n\nThe demon’s vague form had been a few feet away, on the other side of the kitchen. But the next thing I knew it stood in front of me, filling my vision with that unsettling, writhing mass. I felt a chill run through my spine and a brief moment of fear. But the demon reached out— touched— then *pushed past* my skin, and the chill was replaced by a slow rolling thunder that began in my toes, picking up heat and momentum as it travelled up my body, before erupting in bliss when it reached my throat. I opened my mouth, maybe to scream, maybe to gasp, but instead my mind shattered into a million pieces of pleasure. \n\nWhen I returned to my body, it was Saturday morning. But it took a few days before I discovered that I could no longer dream, days that I mostly spent trying desperately to cling to the fading memories of the euphoria I experienced that night. When I realized what had happened, what I had given up this time, I was struck by not only horror but also, for the first time, regret. I liked my dreams. I liked the ability to escape in my mind, to tell myself stories. This time, I did mourn my loss.\n\nI decided that I needed to arm myself with knowledge. First I tried Googling “pleasure demon,” but I only found resources for painting miniatures or references to video games. And my demon is very real. Next I tried ChatGPT, which (of course) was even worse. Then the local public library, where “pleasure” and “demon” together gave me a real grab bag of options—but all fiction. \n\nFinally, I decided to search the dusty independent bookstore a few blocks over. Crossing its doorway was like stepping over a threshold into another world: From a busy urban street into a musky memory from centuries past. The space was small, like most downtown businesses, but books—most of which looked like they had seen better days—cluttered every visible surface. No other customer was inside, just the storekeeper quietly reading behind a giant, scarred mahogany table that served as the checkout counter. She didn’t look up when I entered. I picked an aisle under the “Non-Fiction” sign that was barely hanging on to the ceiling, and dove in. \n\nAfter an hour of fruitless searching, I returned to the woman at the checkout table. \n\n“Hi, excuse me,” I nervously asked, then cleared my throat. “Do you carry anything about, uhm, pleasure demons?”\n\nShe had looked up when I first spoke, but at the last part a different expression subtly took over. She searched my face, while I held her gaze, hoping that the creases she wore, the complete opposite of my youth, was evidence of wisdom and experience that she may gift onto me. After a moment that stretched just slightly too long, she slowly shook her head. \n\n“I can’t help you with pleasure demons.” She rolled the words out slowly, as if recalling something ancient from her past. “No one can. You must help yourself. I’m sorry.”\n\nI was a little taken aback; this was a strange response to me asking about books, after all. But as I turned to leave, she suddenly reached out and imprisoned my hand in a tight, leathery grip. She showed surprising strength for a person of her age—I could feel her middle finger sharply squeezing the nub of my pinky—as if she’s decided to pour all the energy available to her into this moment. \n\n“The people who have— who have asked this question.” She stared directly at me with an intensity that was unnerving, her bird-like frame slightly trembling now behind the desk. “All their lives become worse. All of them. Without fail.\n\nThe only difference is how fast they fall.” \n\nShe squinted at me for a second longer, then released me, and the intensity and energy faded as quick as it came. \n\n“Sorry I can’t help. Have a nice day.” \n\nI left the store with a stomach churning like a stormy sea. The encounter at the bookstore unsettled me, and I resolved to make no further trades with the demon.\n\nThat resolve lasted for three months.\n\nIt was the start of yet another weekend to myself, when the pleasure demon returned. I don’t really know why they showed up when they did. Things in my life were fine. Maybe this time, they were the one that was bored.\n\n<<*I’ve been thinking of you. Dreaming of you, you might say.>>* They laughed, setting my eardrums aflame. I wanted to speak up, to tell the demon to leave, but I surprised myself by realizing that their appearance felt like a pleasant surprise. Joyful memories of what I’d experienced in the past, faded as they were, returned to the centre of my mind. And yet again, I found myself trading a part of myself away. \n\nLike before, a night passed without me realizing it. When I returned to my apartment, I found a chunk of my arm missing. Where there was once flesh, now there’s a crater in the shape of a near-perfect rectangle, two inches on the long side, right above the crook of my elbow. The indent was covered with thin pink skin that buzzed with a faint stinging sensation. I could see the paleness of bone just beneath the floor of the unnatural, boxy depression. I screamed.\n\nAfter hyperventilating for a few minutes, then passing an empty prayer of thanks for my concrete walls, I turned my attention back to my arm, the disfiguration no less awful than moments before. It was like my arm was dough, and someone removed a piece with a cookie cutter. I felt vomit creeping up my throat. To this day, I stick to long sleeves.\n\nI wish I could say that was the end of my exchanges with the demon. It should have been. But I made one final trade. \n\nIn this last encounter, the experience of euphoria was tainted with the knowledge of my sin, and fear of what I’d lose next. The answer, as it turns out, was three weeks of my life. \n\nWhen I finally left that realm of bliss and returned to the world, I found myself lying in an unknown alleyway. I felt dampness under and around me, including on what I quickly realized was the dumpster I was leaning against. A morose, inky sky, with a faint orange glow on the edges, told me that it was night in the city. As my eyes adjusted to the dimness, I was hit with a heavy stench. \n\nWhere I was, how I got here, and how to get home—I soon realized these were the least of my worries as, horrified, I examined my body. Within the tattered rips of my shirt, I could see still-healing scratches and bizarre, spherical punctures, like stabbings from a Bic pen. And covering it all, covering *me*, from head to toe, was a heavy, thorough cake of blood and shit. I was the stench. \n\nThankfully I still had my phone, though I dropped and cracked it on the grimy alley ground when I saw the date.\n\nThe worst part wasn’t the shame I felt snaking my way through the city in that state until I finally reached my apartment (that I remained in the same city after all that time was another small mercy that I’m grateful for). \n\nThe worst part also wasn’t the work of building the fractured fragments of my life back together. My job was gone; the few friends I had, barely hanging on. And I never did escape the suspicion and shady remarks from the landlord after being late on rent for two weeks. \n\nThe absolute worst part are the shards of recollection that impact without warning and explode my soul, like a streaking hot comet from the dark recesses of my memory. I can be buying groceries, catching up with a friend over coffee, or lying in bed at night, when I'm struck down by a flash from what I know to be some moment within those three weeks. A twisted grin. A howl escaping my throat. A flash of blue fabric, that I had ripped off another moments before. A coldness, from metal on my bare thigh. When these moments strike, I’m paralyzed by disgust and self-loathing. A few times, I’ve let loose a cry of anguish. Once, I broke into tears. \n\nAn unscarred mind. The chunk of my arm. And of course, the tip of my pinky. Those are some of the things I traded to the pleasure demon, and that I’ll never get back. For there is no way to beat them, no way of winning, and no escape. The demon remains an occasional presence in the corners of my vision. Even now, as I’m writing these words, I can see that amorphous, glittering, evil shape in the corner of my living room, offering their sweet and empty promises. I sense that my story even has its tacit consent. Perhaps they see it as publicity—a promotional pamphlet—but don’t be fooled. You know now: A deal with a pleasure demon is a deal you can’t break.\n\nHow long my current strength will last, I don’t know. What I do know is that, for the rest of my life, the pleasure demon will remain in the shadows of my eye, and in my moments of frailty, I can count on them whispering their words of false wonders against the barriers of my mind:\n\n<<*Whenever you need me; I’ll always be here for you.*\\>>",

        "content": "I’ve been working at this supermarket for about three months now. It’s nothing special, just a way to make some cash while I figure out what the hell I’m doing with my life. Most nights are slow, and the worst thing I usually deal with is an old lady trying to use an expired coupon or a teenager sneaking beer into the self-checkout. It was usually $36 per hour. Not a bad job!\n\nBut last night… last night was different.\n\nMy shift started like any other. My manager, Mr. Thompson, handed me a laminated sheet of paper as soon as I clocked in. “New overnight protocol,” he said, his voice tight. “Read it. Follow it. And for God’s sake, don’t break the rules.”\n\nI frowned but took the list. It wasn’t unusual for him to make up weird rules—he once banned blue Gatorade because he thought it looked “untrustworthy”—but this was different. The paper was old, stained at the edges, and the rules… well, they made no damn sense.\n\n**Overnight Supermarket Rules**\n\n1. At exactly 11:15 p.m., make sure all shopping carts are inside. If any are left in the parking lot after this time, leave them. Do not go outside to retrieve them.\n2. The security cameras will glitch between 11:30 and 11:45. Do not attempt to fix them. Do not look directly at the monitors during this time.\n3. If you hear someone whisper your name in the frozen food aisle, do not respond. Do not turn around.\n4. A man in a black hoodie may come in around midnight. He will not buy anything. Do not acknowledge him. Do not meet his eyes.\n5. If you see a child alone in the store after 12:30 a.m., do not approach them. No matter how scared they look, no matter how much they cry, do not take their hand. They are not lost.\n6. At 1:00 a.m., the intercom will turn on by itself. You will hear static, then a voice. It will sound like a loved one. It will beg you to open the stockroom door. Do not open the stockroom door.\n7. If a customer tries to buy raw meat and milk together after 1:45 a.m., refuse the sale. If they persist, tell them, \"We’re out of stock.” If they smile at you, leave your register immediately.\n8. The lights in aisle 7 will flicker at 2:30 a.m. If they go out completely, leave the store. Do not look down aisle 7 as you exit.\n9. If you hear the sound of heavy breathing near the break room, do not enter. Call Mr. Thompson immediately. If he doesn’t answer, wait outside until your shift ends.\n10. Never, under any circumstances, look at your reflection in the freezer doors after 3:00 a.m.\n\nI laughed at first, thinking it was some elaborate prank. But Mr. Thompson didn’t laugh. “Just follow the damn rules,” he said, rubbing his temples like he had the worst migraine in the world.\n\n\"Oh yeah. By the way, your pay has been increased to $45 per hour. So follow the rules.\" I immediately stopped laughing.\n\nBy the time 11:15 rolled around, I was already on edge. I had my hands on the door, ready to grab the last few shopping carts, when my phone buzzed. A text from Mr. Thompson.\n\n**Leave them. NOW.**\n\nI froze, my eyes darting to the parking lot. The carts sat there, gleaming under the flickering streetlights. And then—I swear to God—one of them moved. Just an inch, just enough to squeak against the pavement. There was no wind.\n\nI stepped back inside and locked the doors.\n\nAt 11:30, the security monitors glitched. The screen warped, turning black and white, then static. For a second, I saw something—a shape, tall and thin, standing in the cereal aisle. The screen flickered again. The shape was closer. Right at the edge of the camera’s view. Another flicker. The screen went black.\n\nAt midnight, the man in the black hoodie arrived. He didn’t shop. He didn’t even pretend to. He just stood near the entrance, watching. His hood was pulled low, his hands stuffed in his pockets. I kept my eyes on the register, my breath shallow.\n\nAt 12:30, a child appeared near the candy aisle.\n\nShe was small, no older than six. Her dress was torn, her hair matted. She sniffled, rubbing at her eyes. “Mister,” she whimpered. “I can’t find my mommy.”\n\nMy hands trembled. “I can call someone for you,” I said, reaching for the phone.\n\n“No.” Her voice was sharper now. “I just need you to take my hand.”\n\nSomething was wrong with her face. Her eyes were too dark, too deep, like two pits carved into her skull. My stomach churned.\n\nI turned away.\n\nAt 1:00 a.m., the intercom crackled.\n\nThe voice that came through was my mother’s.\n\n“Sweetheart,” she said. “I need you to let me in. Please, baby. I’m outside the stockroom.”\n\nI gripped the counter, my heart hammering. My mother had died five years ago.\n\nAt 1:45, a man tried to buy raw steak and a gallon of milk.\n\nWhen I refused, he smiled.\n\nHis teeth were too sharp.\n\nAt 2:30, the lights in aisle 7 flickered. Then they went out.\n\nI grabbed my keys and ran. I didn’t look at aisle 7. I didn’t stop running until I was outside, gasping in the cool night air.\n\nI wanted to quit, but something inside me needed to know more. The next night, I was scheduled with a new coworker, Jason. I asked Mr. Thompson why we suddenly needed two people on shift. He hesitated before saying, \"The last guy who worked with me disappeared. We found that list of rules in his locker.\"\n\nJason was skeptical. He laughed at the rules and broke one on purpose.\n\nHe looked at his reflection in the freezer door at 3:00 a.m.\n\nAnd then he started screaming.\n\nI turned just in time to see him clutching his head, his mouth gaping open in a silent howl. His reflection didn’t move the same way he did. It smiled, stepped forward, and pulled him into the glass.\n\nJason was gone. His reflection walked away.\n\nAnd then it turned to look at me.\n\nI ran.\n\nNow I understand why we follow the rules.\n\nBut it might already be too late for me.",

        "content": "Previous: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/0AudmQ7D9C\n\nAnother wave of terror made it through me in a flash, like a fever or aftershocks following an earthquake. I didn't mind the tingling hands or shortness of breath. It was the stomach feeling I would do anything to stop. If you know, you know. I did some box breathing to calm myself. Navy Seals do that. It really works.\n\nSlightly calmer, I picked up a pen to take notes (a bic, thank God. Last thing I needed was a quill and a pot of ink to contend with). Reading the prologue I realized the strange man wasn't a killer. Just a windbag I expected was living a *particularly* extensive lifetime by supernatural means. The strange man was a pretentious douche and he wrote like one. This is my Cliff's Notes version without all the jargon. If anyone can pivot from corporatese, it's me. \n\nExtraordinary inmates require extraordinary protocol. I’ll try to make it short and sweet.\n\nDO NOT ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE. DO NOT KNOCK ON WALL INCESSANTLY, HOPING FOR A DOOR TO OPEN. YOUR DAY ENDS AT 5PM, A DOOR WILL OPEN (SOMEWHERE). \nYOU WILL PROBABLY FIND IT. IF YOU DONT, EXPECT TO WANDER THE HALLS FOR MONTHS OR YEARS. TAKE HEART, SHE HAS NOT YET PERMANENTLY ABANDONED ANYONE. \n\nDeath has total control of all mechanical processes in the facility. She has been relatively liberal with privileges, but beware of taking advantage–she offends easily and will proceed to what she refers to as a “clap back” that will be significantly unpleasant and cost the organization precious resources while you recover in our infirmary.\n\nTo be fair, Death has supernaturally sensitive hearing. You are just annoying her with endless knocking. Of course, it is not truly endless. She ends it. On a good day, she’ll kill you. On a bad day, she’ll stick you in a liminal space until you starve or lose the will to live while knocks from nowhere surround you for the rest of your miserable days. \n\nWEAR PROTECTIVE GEAR AT ALL TIMES Skin on skin contact can be interpreted as a “brush with death”, leading to fatalities.\n\nDO NOT TAUNT DEATH\n\nOK? Ffs the last time that happened we got covid. Before that, the nuclear factory incident in Japan. And politics are wilding out, more than usual. We all see it. Don't piss off Lady Death. \n\nADDRESS HER AS LADY\n\nThough she is known to use modern slang (thank the gods the “yolo” phase is over), she also shifts into what is believed to be an amalgamation of all human, animal, and non-human languages past and present. It is indecipherable to all but those advanced in both multilingualism as well as non-linear communication skills. To circumvent this issue she appreciates old-fashioned Victorian Era chivalry.Thus, call her Lady for the best chance at a conversation with her speaking either the Queen's English, or in the accent of a Dickensian street rat.\n\nNO MATTER HOW TEMPTED DO NOT KISS DEATH. THAT'S JUST OBVIOUS.\n\nDeath is objectively beautiful in her preferred form, a mixed-race waif with strikingly beautiful natural red lips, and cascading raven hair. Despite rumors, Death does not have black eyes, a bare skull, or empty eye sockets. She has pretty green eyes that gleam ember in times of high emotion. Again, she gets bored. She loves to flirt. She will take on any appearance to trick you into a kiss, such as your spouse, lover, childhood crush, etc. she can appear as male at will, if this is the most alluring image to her victim. \n\nI put down the bic, shaking my sore wrist.\n\nThere was a knock and a door existed itself. Then a voice, “little pig, little pig, let me in”. I almost peed my pants. Hey, I haven't even met this woman who apparently does whatever the fuck she wants and kills when her podcast is interrupted.\n\nI kept my expression neutral. The girl in the door looked reminiscent of Quinn from Daria. Silky blonde hair my wife would call Alicia Silverstone in Clueless hair. “Moves like a dream. Probably always smells like roses”. White with a lightly tanned--no, sunkissed--face and pinched nose, lithe\nbut chesty frame, perfectly lipsticked lips that curled like she smelled something bad, and a hot pink, curve hugging uniform that did not meet dress code standards. In place of an inmate number was a happy face over her right pocket. I don't know how, but the happy face looked smug. I wanted to punch it. Not her, just the happy face.\n\nShe did not intimidate me in the least. She reminded me of my daughter's \"popular\" friends, the ones who she tried to impress but more frequently wound up in tears after bully bullshit--like the time they all said she was in the friend group, doing the secret handshake, then running away yelling she gave them fleas. Weeks later, the leader got severe hookworm, and her cohorts got at least 5 cold sores each. I smiled. This wasn't Death. This was Karma. \n\nI stood up, offering my hand to shake. She pinched my ass. I gasped. “Miss! You are a minor! And I am a happily married man”! \n\nHer eyes widened and she begun to laugh, not with me but at me. Like it was the most hysterical thing she had ever heard. “Whew! You gave me a laugh. A real one. She clicked a small device and put it in her pocket. “I'll do you a solid later. Promise.”\n\n“Lady Karma?”\n\n“Just Karma is fine. Or Carme. Or Nemesis. Becky with the good hair. Regina George. Heather. The Head Cheerleader. Lucy Van Pelt. But most people go by Karma. She looked at me with a disagreeable expression. On Wednesdays, we wear pink. Guess you didn't get the memo.\"\n\n“Listen Shep, you've been a challenge for me.”\n\n“Why does everyone know my name?”\n\n”Oh. Sorry, Wilbur. It's just that you're one fine pig.”\n\n“Stop.”\n\n“The name Shepherd Reaper is very interesting in certain circles. Especially to people like me and my sister.”\n\n“Why is it interesting? Who is your sister?”\n\n“Ugh. That blind slut Justice. You know she ain't so disabled she can't feel that titty she leaves out of her dress. We got into a fight about you.”\n\n“Excuse me, I'm a man of justice. I've devoted my entire life to it.”\n\n“And that's why we fought. She didn't mind all those innocent men you killed just following orders or you're *little rebrand*, “carrying out the law”.\n\nJustice didn't mind at all. You were following legal protocol. However. Colton Embry. #0003232, baby killer. Baby, 7 months old, died of blood loss from human inflicted bite marks and stab wounds. You knew the bites were female but said the opposite in evidence and intimidated the specialist to confirm the marks were male. You knew the aggressive scratches were from a hand with long, intricately bejeweled nails. Hell, you found one on the ground, probably because the cheap ho got them done at a chop shop for a blowie. No wonder it was crap glue. The point is, you let a killer go free and an innocent man die. Justice wants you to hang. Also, she wears aviators instead of the blindfold now and they look awful.”\n\nI stepped in. “Well, these weirdos seem to think I'm an ok guy, and whatever shadowy correctional institution this is probably knows all that stuff too.\n\n“They do. It's a plus for them. Shows loyalty. And they can leverage your wife's life to manipulate you. Blackmail you.\n\nAgain, terror.\n\n\"*I*, unlike Justice, see nuance. I saw what Colton did to your daughter. I know you don't like to hear this but it's important, he killed her slow, choked her with her own lit Christmas lights.” It took him singing two full Christmas songs before she died. Sleigh Ride and Little Drummer Boy.\"\n\n“STOP.”\n\n“Why? You're in law enforcement. You saw the autopsy report. Evidence of sexual assault. Burn marks consistent with cigarettes. Clutching her own knocked out teeth in her rigor mortised hand. Anal tears. \n\nBefore he became a tweaker (again, you're welcome), as you know, Colton was the rich connected boyfriend, football hero, golden boy, complete psycho of course but he masked well. It wasn't her fault she fell for him, she said rather gently. Or your fault that he got off scot-free. Of *course* he would get off.\n\nBut when you investigated that baby-eating methhead cunt and found she literally ate chunks of her kiddo–you made it your life to manufacture an overwhelming amount of evidence that had fuckall to do with Colton, but sure as hell got him on death row. That was *you*, *Shepherd*. And *I* made sure nobody realized. You killing your daughter's killer? Classic Karma. You needed *me*, not LWOP from my square sister.\n\nAnd I know why you tensed up when asked about botched executions.  Mr. #1 Warden accidentally-on-purpose forgot to deliver the anesthetic, didn't you? Embry got saline, a paralytic, and a drug to induce cardiac arrest. He burned but he couldn't move or scream, drowned in his own lungs, felt his heart explode. And you knew. Clock *that* tea.”\n\n“How could you know all this?”\n\n“Because I'm not a minor, stupid. I hung with the Fates in ancient Greece. I'm a universal concept since forever. I have say on when to cut the thread of life. I'm hot Santa. A low-key vigilante. That's why they keep me around. Death doesn't like my attitude–which I have never understood, I'm so chill–but I make sure she knows who the real ones are.”\n\n“Am I a real one?\"\n\n“You are. Real complicated. But do you understand? Justice would have had you burned at the stake for commiting I don't even know how many felonies that resulted in the slow painful death of an innocent man.”\n\n“He wasn't inno_”\n\n“I know,” she said, pointing to the happy face on her uniform. *Nuance*. That guy was a piece of shit. Your daughter wasn't the first, and his dad taught him all he knows.” (Note from Shep–this was news to me). \n\nWhen he died, she said, “I made it hurt.” \n\n“Thanks.”\n\nAn understanding passed between us. She wants universal justice over procedural justice. We weren't so different.\n\nShe handed me a traditional black-and-white speckled composition book. “It's not as good as *my* burn book. They took that. But every day, sit quietly and think about all the stuff you've been letting slide. Like how you don't remember traveling from Texas to here, or back to your home. You had no onboarding forms, no W-2. No background check, no HR. No boring videos about sexual harassment and our mission statement. No explanation of benefits. All you got was a 7 figure number and you volunteered your soul. We didn't fog your memory. What you call compartmentalizing is selective denial. Write everything in that book. It's only visible to you and me. We're going to work together, fill that donut hole in your brain.\n\nI signed the composition book. Another strange sensation of pleasure that wasn't mine. \n\n“Lalalalaa, thanks, Babe. Talk soon. And remember–you’re in deep shit with a lot of problems. \n\nBut I ain't one.”\n\nNext: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/voJCcseBFZ\n\n \n\n",

        "content": "I know how this is gonna sound, but I think something happened to my best friend.\n\nJason stayed over at my place last night. We were gaming till, like, 3 AM, and I must’ve passed out mid-match because I woke up in bed with my headphones still on. Jason was gone, but I figured he just went home early.\n\nThen I saw him at school today.\n\nIt *looked* like Jason. It *sounded* like Jason. But something was **wrong**.\n\nIt wasn’t obvious at first, just little things that made my stomach twist. You ever look at a picture where everything *should* be normal, but something is just… off? That’s how Jason felt today.\n\nFirst, he was talking weird. Jason and I have been best friends since middle school—I know how he talks. But today, he kept using words he never uses. He called our math teacher “Professor,” which, no one does that. We always joke about how she reminds us of our grandma, but when I said that, he just kinda… stared at me. Like he was trying to process what I said.\n\nThen in gym class? Jason has **always** sucked at running. We used to joke that he ran like a baby giraffe. Today, he was **fast**. Not just fast—**effortless**. He sprinted like it was nothing. He wasn’t even out of breath.\n\nAnd then—the worst part.\n\n**His eyes.**\n\nJason has green eyes. **Always.** I remember because when we were kids, he used to complain about them, saying he wished they were blue like his dad’s. Today? They **were** blue.\n\nI asked him, “Bro, are you wearing contacts or something?”\n\nHe stopped. Just for a second. Too long. Then he laughed—except it wasn’t his laugh. It sounded like him, but the timing was off. Forced. Like someone trying to copy a sound but not quite getting it right.\n\nThen he **patted me on the shoulder.** Jason never does that.\n\n“Don’t be weird, dude.”\n\nAt lunch, I checked old pictures. Every single one—green eyes. I even scrolled way back. **Always green.**\n\nI started freaking out. So I texted his mom as a joke, like, *\"Haha, Jason finally got those blue contacts, huh?\"* She replied almost instantly.\n\n*\"What? Jason has always had blue eyes.\"*\n\nI felt like I was gonna throw up.\n\nFor the rest of the day, he kept **watching** me. Not normal glances—**watching.** Every time I looked over, his head would shift just a little too late, like he wanted me to know he was looking. Like he was waiting for something.\n\nAt the end of the day, he caught me at my locker.\n\n“You okay?” he asked.\n\nHis voice was the same, but it **wasn’t**.\n\nI nodded, but my hands were shaking. I could tell he noticed.\n\nThen he smiled at me. And I don’t mean in a friendly way—I mean he **smiled.** Too wide. Too slow. Like he was testing out how his face was supposed to move.\n\n“I’ll see you later,” he said.\n\nAnd then he just stood there. Watching me as I left.\n\nI don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know what to do.\n\nBut that is **not** my best friend.\n\nAnd I think it knows I know.",

        "author": "Theeaglestrikes",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "For the last decade, it’s been our annual tradition to hoodwink one another through increasingly elaborate tricks—always good-natured, and always confined to that April morning.\n\nIt was a spot of fun.\n\nIt was only ever *meant* to be a spot of fun.\n\nI tend to be the one who is fooled the most, given that I rarely pay attention to the date. I need phone reminders to remember birthdays and anniversaries—even my own. Perhaps I should’ve set a reminder for April 1^(st), long ago, but I was never quite competitive enough to bother.\n\nAnd I no longer want to think of that accursed day ever again.\n\nUnlike me, Monica has always been a little better at keeping track of the days, so I’ve long had to work *hard* to dupe her. Typically, the smaller the prank, the less suspicious she becomes. If my mind ticks over quickly enough to conjure a trick on the spot, I’ll add something to whatever prank my wife has just pulled. That catches her off-guard.\n\nOnce, for instance, Monica pranked me at my workplace, so I convinced her that she’d parked on the double-yellows outside and would have to move her car before the traffic warden arrived. It gave me a chuckle to watch her rush outside.\n\nStill, that was a minor prank, like most of the stunts I’ve pulled over the years. But I’d always wanted to do something *bigger*, and this year, the stars aligned. On March 31^(st), my silly, unobservant, caveman brain did something out of the ordinary.\n\nIt clocked the date.\n\nI actually managed to prepare for April Fool’s Day.\n\nNow, it *can* be a little tricky to plan anything whenever April 1^(st) falls on a weekday, but things lined up nicely this year, as I work from home on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And I came up with something silly but harmless.\n\nWhen I woke on the big day, around eight in the morning, I was relieved to find that I hadn’t opened my eyes to a bedroom cluttered with near-bursting balloons, like two years earlier. Of course, I had no doubt that Monica was planning something far greater, but I remained determined not to be fooled.\n\nFor once, I was ready for my wife’s tomfoolery; more importantly, I was ready for a little of my *own*.\n\n“Good morning, Brad,” she said as I entered the kitchen hurriedly.\n\nI mustered up my sternest and most sombre expression, then shook my head firmly. “Not really.”\n\nMonica smiled. “Oh, I see… You remembered that it’s—”\n\n“— Mittens is stuck on the roof,” I interrupted, preventing her from revealing the date, so as not to arouse doubt—so as not to, most importantly, fudge my one shot at nailing the perfect prank.\n\nMittens, our white-pawed tabby cat, is the true love of Monica’s life. And though our oft-fearless feline loves to explore, she has a tendency to be afflicted by panic attacks at the most inopportune moments.\n\nFor greater context, our house sits in the angular nook of a cul-de-sac; it bears an L-shaped layout, with the upper bedroom overlooking the garage. Whenever the window is left ajar, Mittens jumps out onto the garage’s roof tiles, and then she’ll jump another storey down to the driveway below. But quite often, the she becomes quite suddenly shell-shocked and freezes in the gutter, uncertain about making the jump.\n\nThis was the perfect set-up for my prank.\n\nBuild off an everyday occurrence: that’s the way to trick a trickster.\n\nOf course, as I said, I wanted to go *bigger*. A tame prank such as this would’ve been sufficient to fool Monica, but it hardly would’ve been satisfying. Not nearly as satisfying as whatever she had planned.\n\n“Give her a few minutes and she’ll jump down,” Monica said, before wrinkling her brow. “Why do you look so worried? She spends half her life on that roof.”\n\nI gulped convincingly, then delivered the blow. “Mittens is stuck on the *top* roof.”\n\nMonica’s eyes grew large.\n\nA storm felled one of our garden’s tall oaks last month, and it tumbled directly onto the second-floor roof, creating a staggering large hole in it. We hired help and managed to clear the tree and debris, but we still haven’t raised the funds for a roofing job yet; the temporary fix was to nail a couple large tarpaulins over the hole, somewhat sheltering the attic from the elements.\n\nProfessionals told us that the entire roof would need to be redone, as the damage done to it had brought its entire structural integrity into question.\n\nTherefore, the thought of Mittens being up there, rather than on the lower garage roof, was alarming.\n\nMonica gasped and shot up from her seat. “Why is she even on the top roof? She’s *never* gone up there. Did she climb up the pipe?”\n\nI shrugged my arms. “I don’t know. I woke up and heard meowing from the bedroom window. When I poked my head out, I could see her a few feet above me, shivering as she peered over the edge of the top gutter. I tried to encourage her to jump into my arms, but…”\n\nMonica had already rushed past me at this point, and I was tailing her up the stairs with a broad grin on my face. Once we’d scurried into the bedroom and my wife had shoved her head out of the bedroom window, I failed to hold my breath any longer—I let out an almighty snort.\n\n“*MITTENS!*” Monica screeched into the sky, leaning backwards out of the window to look up at the roof’s edge. “I don’t see her up there, Brad! Why are you laughing about this? We…”\n\nShe trailed off, then pulled her head back into the room, wearing a smirk and flushed cheeks. “Oh, you little *shit*.”\n\n“*APRIL FOOL!*” I brayed with laughter. “Mittens is sleeping in the bathroom, you plonker! I was worried she’d give the game away.”\n\n“That was a better trick than usual from you, I have to admit,” Monica replied, eyeing me with great respect, hands on her hips. “You know, I—”\n\n“— *MONICA?*” yelled a croaky, but tremendous voice from our driveway.\n\nIt was Mr Worth from next door.\n\nMonica’s cheeks flushed more brightly, and I started cackling louder, relishing in the greater success of my harmless joke. Now she’d embarrassed herself in front of the neighbour. Not just any neighbour: Mr Worth. The old, beady-eyed, grey-haired Scrooge who everybody on the street feared. Not a pleasant man in the slightest.\n\n“Monica, are you okay?” Mr Worth continued from outside. “I was just watering the peonies, and I heard… Hello? Are you still there? Why were you screaming?”\n\nShe groaned. “Oh, I really don’t want to have to explain everything to that psychopath… The worst part is that he’ll tell *me* off for this, not you!”\n\nThen my wife’s eyes widened, and she rushed back to the window. “Mr Worth! Oh, thank *heavens* for you! Bradley was messing around and he threw our cat up onto the roof!”\n\n“*What?*” I hissed from behind her, tugging at the back of her T-shirt. “*Truce!*”\n\nMonica continued, “And poor little Mittens won’t come down! She’s so scared up there. She’s—”\n\n“— *Bloody idiots!*” Mr Worth roared in interruption. “The pair of you. Bloody idiots. You were screaming over a cat? Give me strength. I thought one of you had actually found yourselves in trouble, but you… Hey, where have you gone? Stop disappearing, young lady! *I’m talking to you!*”\n\nMonica had pulled her head back into the bedroom, and she was giggling uncontrollably.\n\n“Why did you tell him that?” I moaned.\n\n“What do you mean?” Monica answered innocently, fluttering her eyelashes. “I was just passing along the story that *you* told me, Brad.”\n\n“With a slight embellishment,” I groaned, coming to a realisation. “Let me guess: I’m going to have to be the one to tell the miserable, old man that it was all a prank?”\n\nMy wife nodded cheekily. “Seems only fair. Besides, I’ve already received a telling off from him, so you’re *definitely* due one for getting us into this mess!”\n\nI rolled my eyes and shook my head with a smile. “You pulled a Brad—turned the prank around on me. Right, I’ll go and put my shoes on. Don’t much fancy taunting him from the window.”\n\nI slumped downstairs, searched for a good pair of trainers that wouldn’t earn a cursory look, or a few cutting words, of disapproval from our horrid next-door neighbour. And as I slipped into a respectable pair, there came a heavy thud from outside.\n\nI hurried over to the front door, flung it open, and laid my disbelieving eyes upon the seventy-something-year-old Mr Worth ascending a tall metal ladder up to the roof.\n\n“Stop!” cried out Monica disbelievingly from the bedroom window. “We were only—”\n\n“— *One more word out of you, and I’ll call the police*,” Mr Worth hissed in my wife’s face as he climbed past our bedroom window at a surprisingly nimble pace. “Filthy creatures, cats, but they still deserve better owners than the likes of you two.”\n\n“Mr Worth!” I yelled, trying to finish what Monica had been saying. “It was a joke. An April—”\n\n“— *Where is the damn beast?*” the old man interrupted again as he poked his head over the edge of the roof, scanning its tiles.\n\nOur neighbour either willingly ignored us or, perhaps more likely, had not registered a word we said. He was often too stubborn to admit that he was hard of hearing.\n\nMonica winced as the old man dragged his frail body over the edge of the roof. “*BRADLEY!*”\n\nI’d already started to climb up the ladder behind the crawling man, realising that, for whatever reason, he wasn’t listening to us. I could hear his knobbly knees and bony hands shuffling across the tiles, taking him dangerously near to the tarpaulins—to the hole which spanned a sizeable stretch of the roof.\n\nI could see little from my perspective, but I certainly *heard* that sound.\n\nThat thunderous crash, followed by a few more thunderous crashes.\n\nAnd two intermingled screams.\n\n“*MONICA!*” I bellowed, rapidly slipping down the ladder and half-twisting my ankle at the bottom.\n\nI limped back into the house, climbed the stairs, then stopped at the entrance to the bedroom.\n\nThe bed and the carpet were both buried beneath a three-feet-tall heap, comprising of shingles, groove chipboard panels, and plasterboard. The room’s ceiling had gone, as had the attic and roof above it. A hole revealed the sky above, letting blinding sunlight inside.\n\n“Monica…” I whimpered, eyeing the unthinkably dense mound of rubble.\n\n“*Here*,” whispered a timid voice from behind me.\n\nWith my heart thumping, fearful adrenaline replaced with overbearing joy, I spun at immense speed. And I released a grateful wail when I faced my pale-faced, anxious wife on the upstairs landing. I dashed forwards and embraced her, so immensely glad that she had backed away from the bedroom before Mr Worth came tumbling through the roof and ceiling.\n\n“He’s in there, isn’t he?” I asked, gulping as I turned back to face the demolished bedroom. “Somewhere in that rubble, he’s…”\n\n“*Stop*,” Monica blubbered, eyes welling as she stared into the room.\n\n“Sorry,” I apologised, then I tore my phone out of my pocket. “You’re right, Mon, it’s not safe in here. We need to go downstairs. I’ll call an ambulance, and… Jesus… Poor Mr Worth…”\n\nIt was only once I’d absent-mindedly walked downstairs, whilst explaining what had happened to the emergency operator, that I realised Monica wasn’t following. I looked back upstairs in confusion, only half-hearing the voice in the phone telling me that paramedics and firefighters were coming.\n\n“Mon?” I called out. “Come on.”\n\n“Are you two still inside the house?” the eavesdropping operator asked. “It’s an unsafe structure. Please wait on the driveway for emergency responders.”\n\n“*Monica!*” I cried a second time as I placed a hand on the staircase’s bannister. “It’s not safe up there. Come downstairs.”\n\nBut my wife’s eyes, wet and unblinking, remained fixed on the bedroom door ahead. She hadn’t budged an inch.\n\n“*Stop*,” she repeated, not turning to look at me as I made my way upstairs.\n\n“We need to get away from the bedroom, Mon,” I said, making my way onto the landing with an outstretched hand. “You need to stop looking at it.”\n\n“But *it* won’t stop looking at me,” she whispered.\n\nThose words set my hairs set on end, as did something else.\n\nA cold gaze that fell upon me, burning into my flesh.\n\nI followed Monica’s eyeline to the bedroom. To the bulge of ceramic and plaster that had filled up that space. The wreckage had formed a ramshackle den of sorts, and in that hidey-hole’s shadowed recess, I saw it.\n\nA single bloodshot eye watching us from the dark.\n\nI wanted to open my mouth to cry, but that terror remained very much on the inside, for the icy, wintry gaze had frozen me quite stiffly to the spot—which, of course, only terrified me more greatly.\n\nThen the debris shifted, and out emerged the shape that sported the eye.\n\n*The shape of Mr Worth.*\n\nOnly, once that man had freed himself of his rubble shackles, it became clear that he was no longer our next-door neighbour—or, at least, no longer *human*, given the many long, hefty, blood-stained wood fragments puncturing through his body, from front to back and back to front—one two-feet-long piece of wood travelled through the grey matter in his skull, exiting through a bloody eye socket at the front of his face.\n\nIt was horrifyingly impossible.\n\nThere was no earthly way in which that man could’ve been standing on two feet.\n\nNo possible way in which he could be observing the two of us with his one remaining eye.\n\nThe only living thing remaining of Mr Worth was his rage. Rage he exuded from a white complexion.\n\nThe man lurched forwards, and the outline of his body warbled slightly, making it clear that this spectacle wasn’t the superhuman feat of some brain-damaged man near-death—a man using the last of his brain’s functionality to rise to his feet.\n\nNo, this was some paranormal anomaly sitting in disarray with its surroundings.\n\nThe colour and shape of his body didn’t seem rigid. Seemed neither entirely opaque nor grounded in reality. This nightmare walking towards Monica and me was not Mr Worth.\n\nIt was his undead spirit.\n\nAnd it wanted us.\n\nThere was no time to process the unholiness and inexplicableness of such things as *spirits* existing.\n\n“*RUN!*” I screamed, grabbing my wife’s hand.\n\nAs I turned to flee, one of the creature's chipped, discoloured nails tore into my forearm, leaving a jagged wound that is still festering as I type.\n\nI yelped and pulled Monica away, hoping to save her from that fiend.\n\nAs we tore down the stairs, I felt the warmth of her hand in mine this time; I’d finally pried her away from the landing. Away from the terrifying pursuer. Its spectral energy clung to our world, blaming us for its demise, and I didn’t plan on letting it rob us of life too—of bringing us into its world.\n\nThere came a rush of freedom both physical and supernatural as I rushed through the front door and the air hit my face. The unliving thing was bound to its resting place. It could not follow beyond that threshold.\n\nI ran into the street, hearing the approaching sirens of the ambulance and fire engine, and then I kept running—kept running as people asked that same question, over and over. A question that took time to sink into my mind. Long after the emergency responders had poured out of their vehicles and into my house.\n\n“Where’s Monica?”\n\nI realised that I hadn’t felt the warmth of my wife’s hand in mine since leaving the house.\n\nAnd hours later, once the adrenaline had fled my body to make room for the paramedics’ terrible words, I finally processed the truth.\n\nThe firefighters had found two bodies in the [rubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).",

        "content": "I grew up in a family of collectors. \n\nIt's a rather strange profession, but I consider myself an artistic person, and living among antiques has shaped my life in a unique way - I built my career around it, and now my time is spent on various activities, such as research, authentication, finding pieces at auctions, estate sales, flea markets, antique shops, or through private collectors. I also do a bit of restoration work and I assess the market value of antiques based on rarity, condition, provenance (history of ownership), and demand. It feels like a game of hunting down rare pieces and selling them to the right person, and I can't really describe the rush of getting your hands on something that everyone's after. It's thrilling, really.\n\nI know you'll say it's not viable. *You don't make real money out of it.* You'd be surprised! If you've done this for a long time, like my family has, a single sale can set you up for a few years. Get there before anyone else and organize an auction, and if you're lucky you're set for life. I network with the richest and most pretentious families on an international level, and I love my job.\n\nAfter my parents died, I took over their 18th century mansion and did a bit of restoration and remodeling, to get the authentic Victorian look. My house is old, and so diverse - I have three studios, where I keep my current works-in-progress, and the foyer and hallways are filled with paintings. I often host game nights, and have friends over - other antique enthusiasts.\n\nSuch game night happened last month - I had a few people over in the game room upstairs, for some wine and gin, and beer, and vodka, and rum, and more. We were on the second floor, and one of my friends, Walt, stumbled into the hallway, took a drunken look at the arched window at the end of it, then turned to me. \n\n'You know, that ficus over these doesn't do the window justice. You need something more grand to fill up all that space.'\n\nI followed his pointed finger and stared at the plant, bathed in moonlight. 'It's a long hallway, and the ending is underwhelming. A statue or something would work better. A... *ficus...*' he'd spit it out like an insult, '... feels lazy. Trust me. I'll get you something better.'\n\n'What, you gonna get me a statue for my birthday?'\n\n'Yeah, why not. You should trust me. I know my way around antiques, unlike other... amateurs.' He smirked at me. \n\n'Sure, why not.' I replied, tilting my head and still staring at the poor ficus plant.\n\nA week passed, and I'd forgotten all about that, when I got a call from Walt. He asked me if I was home, and said his present was ready for me. I told him he could come, and in a few hours there he was, with two other guys and a truck. Sometimes, I hated having eccentric friends. Some people give you an Amazon gift card. He shows up with a fucking statue in my driveway.\n\nHe unwrapped it, and I didn't exactly know what to say. *Should I... thank him? For this?* \n\nI won't lie, it felt too much, even for me. Judging on the tall, elongated figure and the solemn, sorrowful face of the angel, the detailed clothes and wings, it was sculpted in a gothic style. It was beautiful, but I felt like it didn't... fit. It would've fit in a cemetery, or a forest, not at the end of my hallway, especially at night. I was unsure, very unsure, but some voice in my head encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone. I kept thinking about the Donna Tartt quote. \n\n*Beauty is terror*. *Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.*\n\n'What do you think?'\n\n'It's... beautiful.'\n\n'Right? You seem... unsure.'\n\n'No, it's just... I was expecting a more baroque look. But it's fine.'\n\n'Great. I'll have the guys move it inside.'\n\nFor the next few days, I had to get used to going up the stairs and seeing the angel statue in all its glory, at the end of the hallway, crowned by a halo of sunrays and frozen in a mournful look, clothes windswept, wings half-stretched. I avoided going up there at night, or turning my back on it. I know, that was kid-like behavior, but I just needed some *time* to accommodate. \n\nI guess it was the most human-like thing I owned. I had other statues, sure, but not as... real as this one. I admired the artist who had sculpted it - accuracy is one thing, but you rarely find a piece that has a human feeling attached to it, that... moves something inside you. Even if that something is fear. I was a little fascinated by it, and by the uneasiness it gave me, the feeling of it actually *looking at me, seeing me.* The feeling followed me as I showered, slept, worked, ate.\n\nI didn't know whether to feel as if it was watching over me or just watching *me* in general. \n\nOne time, a powerful thunderstorm rattled my home. I was afraid the top window would shatter, so I went upstairs to watch over it, as if I could stop it. I wasn't paranoid enough to check if the statue moved - I knew it's just a statue. I sat on the carpet for a while, just staring, until I noticed the storm growing weaker, so I went downstairs, into the kitchen. \n\nAt one point, I heard loud thuds coming from upstairs. My first thought was *oh, shit, the window broke and now it's raining inside.* I hurried to the hallway, and as I was going up the stairs, my stomach tensed up. The thuds had stopped. The rain hadn't.\n\nWhen something, *anything* happens, the reflex is to attribute it to something rational. The way you'd think the noise outside is an animal, not an intruder. The way you'd believe the knocking on the window is a tree branch, not someone. The way you'd assume the thuds upstairs are from the rain and not from... someone running across the hallway. Even if it sounded more like that.\n\nI made up the courage to climb an extra step, so that I could peek into the hallway. The angel statue stood at the end of it, proud and solemn on the pedestal, watching (over) me.\n\nI ignored the knot in my throat, and went downstairs. I texted a friend about it, and then put on some show to calm down. I had a big fair to attend in the morning, and I needed to rest.\n\nThe night was uneventful. However, then I woke up, I found my front door unlocked and opened. A sudden wave of dizziness hit me - if someone had broken in, they could've stolen thousands of dollars worth of pieces. Hell, they could still be inside.\n\nI went through the rooms rapidly, my vision blurry from fear, and my rushed search stopped at the second floor, where I froze at the top of the stairs, staring at the empty pedestal at the end of the hallway.\n\n*That's what the running was. They stole my statue.* \n\nPart of me was still shaken, thinking of how easily someone had broken in, and wondering if they were planning to come back. On the other hand, I felt somewhat relieved that they'd taken it off my hands. And then there was confusion. Why steal it? Of all the things I owned? And how did they manage to move it downstairs? It was really heavy, and I would've heard it.\n\nThen, the door wasn't broken through. It looked as if it had been unlocked and opened from... the inside.\n\nThe instinct was to call the police, but I didn't have time for that yet - I was running late to the fair. I left, planning to call them when I get back.\n\nEvening came and so did my return - I parked my car in the driveway and phoned them, without even going inside the house. I told them everything - the noises, the feeling of being watched, the running, the opened door and the disappearance of the statue. \n\nWhen they arrived, I let them inside. They returned after 10 minutes, looking at me funny.\n\n'Sir, what exactly was stolen?'\n\n'What do you mean? My angel statue. Right at the end of the hallway, second floor, an empty pedestal - you can't miss it.'\n\n'Your statue is *there.*'\n\nMy eyes widened. I frowned, looking from one officer to another and shaking my head. Then, I walked past them, into the house. It was starting to get dark, and long shadows clung to the furniture and the walls - I didn't feel afraid. I just wanted to know what was going on. \n\nAt the top of the staircase, oddly enough, the angel statue stood upright and proud, staring me right in my eyes. The hallway was cold - the source of the breeze was a window I'd probably left open.\n\nI turned back to the statue. I swear, I must've been tired, because I blinked and the statue seemed to blink, too. I rubbed my eyes, then stepped closer to it. It didn't look damaged. I ran my fingers across one of its arms, and the stone felt... warm. \n\nSuddenly, I got grossed out and stepped away. My chest felt hollow and dread and disgust had taken over me. I felt sweaty and a silent headache was making its way in - something wasn't right, and I couldn't stand to look at the statue anymore. \n\nI slept in the attic that night. Somehow, I felt better to be *above* it. That thing was grotesque, and the more I looked at it, the uglier it got. I began forgetting the beauty I had seen in it first. I needed to have Walt over and tell him I was giving him the statue back, so I texted him, Shauna, Penny and Louis to come over the next day for some drinks.\n\nThat evening, as I was fixing him a drink in the game room, I asked him about the statue.\n\n'Listen, as much as I appreciate the gesture, I feel like it's not the right fit for me. I'm a bit superstitious, and it scares me.'\n\n'Bullshit. You're not superstitious. I know you.'\n\n'Maybe he *became* superstitious.' Shauna said, smiling. 'Who knows. You can have religious awakenings in your thirties too, you know.'\n\n'Look, I'm not taking back my gift.'\n\n'If you don't, I'm throwing it away.'\n\nSilence followed. 'Really? It's that... serious?'\n\n'I fucking hate it. Look, man, I'm sorry. I hate it. It ugly, and cursed. It follows me around at night and I haven't told anyone this before but, I think it goes through my stuff while I'm gone. It's scary.'\n\n'A... statue?' Penny laughed. \n\n'Yes, a fucking statue. Have you seen it? I'd rather die than sleep one more night in the same house as that thing. If you don't believe me, go look at it. Come on, touch it. Right in the hallway.'\n\nPenny shook her head and, still smiling, stood up to check it out. I couldn't decipher Walt's expression - disappointment? Amusement? Concern?\n\nPenny opened the door and stepped out in the hallway. I saw her eyes widen and her eyebrows tremble. She looked back at us, then at the end of the dark hallway. She squinted. She wasn't saying anything. Why wasn't she saying anything?\n\n'Very funny, Pen.' Walt mumbled.\n\n'It's gone.' She spit out, her voice trembling.\n\nWe stood there perplexed, in the candlelight. 'What do you mean, gone?'\n\n'The pedestal is empty.'\n\nAnother pause followed. Shauna rushed to the hallway to look. 'Holy shit. Did you already take it out, Tony?'\n\n'No, we-we walked past it when we came here.' Pen muttered. 'Right, right past it... and it was there. In the hallway, at the end, on the pedestal in front of the window... in the dark...'\n\nI shut the door.\n\nThe house was silent, and every time the furniture creaked it startled us. We were still trying to convince ourselves that it was fine, that something... *explainable* had to have happened... and, yet, our minds were working overtime to no avail. It was fucked up and unnatural.\n\n'Listen, should we... look for it?' Walt asked, and his voice reminded me of his existence, of the fact that he was the reason why this all started.\n\n'Why didn't you sell it? Why did you give it to me, Walt?' I blurted out.\n\n'What? I gave it to you as a *present...*'\n\n'You *couldn't* sell it,' Shauna said, calmly. 'No one wanted it. You *knew* something was wrong with it.' Her eyes met his, and I sensed his annoyance through what he wanted to maintain as a calm exterior. \n\n'I did not.'\n\n'I don't believe you. I think you just wanted to get rid of it, and-'\n\n*Knock knock.* \n\nSilence.\n\n*Knock knock.* \n\nI shook my head, and mouthed to Walt to stay where he is. I don't think he wanted to move, anyway. No one did.\n\nThen, we heard other knocks, downstairs. Nothing could have scared me more than what I heard next. \n\nIt was Louis' voice from outside, excusing himself for being late.\n\nI turned to Shauna in horror, and Pen bolted to the window. I heard the front door open, and Louis' voice.\n\n'Louis, get out! Right now, please! You're not safe here...'\n\n'What are you guys talking about? Are you upstairs? I brought some wine, I haven't tasted it yet and I think it's a little cheap, but hey...'\n\nA pause. 'Tony, is that you? Are you playing peekaboo with me from the staircase? What have you gotten into?'\n\n'Louis, *leave...*' Shauna insisted.\n\n'What? I didn't know you didn't want me here... why did you invite me, then? You think I don't see you? What's with the lights? Why are we in the dark, are you playing some sort of game...?'\n\nI had to open the door to get to him. I couldn't just yell like a coward. I placed my hand on the knob, but something was holding it from the other side. I started banging on it and yelling.\n\nI don't exactly remember what happened next. It's all blurry. I never actually saw it *move...* and, yet, I know. I heard the crack loud and clear, and I remember looking down and seeing an unfamiliar shape, which later became a skull split open and a broken flower pot. I can't get the image of brains mixed up with dirt out of my head and the metallic smell still hasn't left the staircase. I screamed until my voice became hoarse, and I looked around for the angel, but I couldn't find it anywhere. \n\nNo one believes us about the night Louis died. I've had the police question me, and they called me crazy, especially when they saw how shocked I was that my new angel statue was intact the next day, and how I claimed I'd found it clutching a strand of his hair... They said it was unusual for me to tie up a *statue* that could never move.\n\nWorst thing is, they won't allow me to leave my house until they find me innocent. And last night, I found the ropes I'd tied the statue with broken, and the pedestal empty, again. I made the mistake of throwing it out the window, hoping its owner will follow it.\n\nNow, the statue had no place to stand on anymore. Which means it keeps wandering around the house. I never look directly at it. I thought it might be one of those weeping angels, but I think I might be wrong.\n\nI don't know where it is right now. ",

        "content": "When I was high the other night I had a really weird experience. I feel silly about it but also still kinda freaked out. \n\n\nQuick background info: I'm a middle-aged white guy, which means I have a podcast. I record remotely with two other dudes every couple of weeks. It's a horror movie review podcast and we've been doing it for nearly 15 years. We record from 10pm to midnight most times, sometimes later.\n\n\nI also gave up drinking for weed - no hangover, no puking, nice vibes (usually). Most nights I'll have a couple hits from a vape or a 10mg THC drink. \n\n\nSo a couple nights ago I was sipping a new brand of THC drink. I've had a couple different ones before. Usually they give me a nice mellow high, enough to laugh, relax, watch something stupid, you know. Stoner stuff. I was feeling pretty chill when we quit recording at midnight.\n\n\nSo I stumble out of my home office and the whole house is dark and quiet. Again, nothing unusual there. I decide to chill in the living room and watch the latest Masked Singer (don't judge. Stoner stuff).\n\n\nI look into the living room, and I think \"It's too dark. I can't go in there. Chummy Charlie will get me.\" \n\n\nI have never heard the name Chummy Charlie before. The thought pops into my head like I'm remembering something, not inventing it.\n\n\nI don't have any sense of who or what he/it might be. But I get chills up and down my spine.\n\n\nSo I dash into the room and turn on the lamp next to my recliner. I think, \"That's better. Chummy Charlie can't come into the light.\" And it just feels true.\n\n\nAnd at the same time, I think \"Chummy Charlie is a super dumb name for a boogeyman. You're just high. This is dumb.\" \n\n\nBut I still have that prickly feeling that someone's watching me. And my lamp is a tiny little island of light, and Chummy Charlie could be anywhere in the dark.\n\n\nAfter a couple of c-list celebrities sing their songs in giant mascot outfits, I have to pee. Thankfully the bathroom light is already on.\n\n\nAs I go in the bathroom, I think \"Don't look yourself in the eyes in the mirror or Chummy Charlie will get you.\" So Chummy Charlie's mythos is expanding. Again, never thought of it before. Again, feels TRUE.\n\n\nAnd immediately the other half of my brain goes, \"That's the dumbest thing ever. You're high. One of the guys you just talked to for two hours is NAMED CHARLIE. Stop it.\"\n\n\nSo I try to calm down and I pee. But when I go to wash my hands, I do NOT look myself in the eye.\n\n\nI am a 47-year-old man freaked out by a monster I appear to be creating in real time.\n\n\nFinally Masked Singer ends (It was Candace Cameron from Full House in the Cherry Blossom suit). Now I have to figure how to get to bed. The hallway and the bedroom are dark.\n\n\nIt's damn hard to walk down the hallway. I can feel Chummy Charlie lurking in the dark. Even as I have no idea what he looks like, or even what being 'got' by him would mean.\n\n\nI just know he can get me in the dark and if I look myself in the eyes in the mirror.\n\n\nI have to walk past a big patio door to get to bed. I don't know if meeting my eyes in that reflection will trigger Chummy Charlie. But I'm not taking chances.\n\n\nSo I get to the doorway to my dark bedroom. I can feel the tension across my shoulders, up and down my spine, in my butthole.\n\n\nHow do I get to bed? It's too dark. If I turn on the light I'll wake up my wife.\n\n\nObviously, says half my brain, this is all stupid and I should go to bed and laugh about it in the morning.\n\n\nThe other rest of my body physically will not let me walk into that room.\n\n\nFinally I think, \"Chummy Charlie is made from darkness and loneliness. He can't get you if you're with someone you love, or if you're with dogs. Because you can't be lonely if you have a dog.\"\n\n\nThis gets me moving because, like the mirror thing, it feels true. Like remembering, not making something up.\n\n\nMy wife is curled up in the bed already, and there are two dogs snuggled on the dog bed. So I dash over to the bed and get under the covers. I haven't felt this freaked out about the dark since I was 12.\n\n\nI curl up and feel safe...ish. I still feel the tension in my back and neck, and I swear I can sense Chummy Charlie moving around in the dark. He can't get me and he's pissed about it. \n\n\nI just keep repeating in my head that Chummy Charlie can't come near dogs, and he can't get you if you're with someone you love. Finally I fall asleep.\n\n\nIt's been two days. I'm a rational guy and objectively--yeah, stoner brain created something freaky instead of something fun. I've watched over 1,000 horror movies in the past decade. Of course some of that's going to stick.\n\n\nBut I'm still having trouble meeting my eyes in the mirror, even in broad daylight. Even though Chummy Charlie can't come into the light, y'know?\n\n\nSo I've still got three more of these drinks in the fridge. I'm going to try again tonight and see what happens. Either I chill and watch dumb Sci-fi and have a great night... or I learn more about Chummy Charlie.",

        "content": "I was never pretty. I wasn’t ugly, just plain. My skin was dull, my features unremarkable, my lips too thin. I spent years trying every beauty product I could find, but nothing worked. The girls on social media looked effortless, with dewy skin, full lips, and perfect symmetry. No matter how much I tried to copy them, I always fell short. Then I found the ad. It popped up on my feed late at night, a sleek black jar with gold lettering: FLAWLESS Beauty Beyond Imagination The model in the video looked unreal. Her skin was porcelain-smooth, her cheekbones razor-sharp. The way she smiled, it was like she wasn’t even real, like she was sculpted by some divine hand. The ad claimed it wasn’t just makeup. It enhanced you, bringing out your “true, perfect self. ” The website had no reviews, no social media pages, no brand history. Just a BUY NOW button. It was expensive, $250 for one jar, but I didn’t care. I clicked the button.\n\nThe package arrived two days later. The jar was heavier than expected, the black and gold design giving it an almost ancient feel. Inside was a thick, glossy cream, dark-like ink. It had no scent. When I touched it, it clung to my fingers, cool and silky. I smoothed a thin layer over my face. The moment it touched my skin, it sank in, like it was absorbing into my pores. A tingling sensation spread over my cheeks, my lips, and my forehead. I rushed to the mirror. And I gasped. My skin glowed. Every imperfection vanished, no redness, no pores, no dullness. My lips looked fuller, my cheekbones sharper. My face was still mine but perfected. I looked beautiful. For the first time in my life, I felt seen.\n\nOn day 2, the next morning, I expected to wake up to my normal, boring face. But when I peeled back the blankets and shuffled to the mirror, I was still perfect. The cream hadn’t smudged, hadn’t faded. My skin was still flawless. My lips were still full. My reflection was breathtaking. I didn’t question it. I went about my day, basking in the stares, and the compliments. “You look amazing. ” “What’s different about you? ” “I can’t stop looking at you. ” I was addicted. That night, I applied another layer before bed. It sank in faster this time.\n\nOn day 3 something was wrong. When I woke up, my skin felt tight, like my face was shrinking. I stumbled to the mirror and nearly screamed. My features were too sharp. My cheekbones jutted out unnaturally. My lips were too full, stretched over my teeth. My skin was too smooth, too plastic-like. I touched my cheek and felt a sickening resistance, like pressing on something that wasn’t quite skin. Panic twisted in my gut. I grabbed a washcloth, scrubbing desperately, but the cream wouldn’t budge. It wasn’t sitting on my skin anymore. It was part of me. My phone buzzed, a text from my best friend, Mara,  “Hey, are you okay? Your face looked kinda… different yesterday. ” I wanted to tell her. I wanted to ask for help. But another text came through before I could reply. Mara, “Actually… can I be honest? You looked amazing. I’ve never seen you so confident. ” I stared at the screen. My fingers hovered over the keyboard. Then I caught my reflection again. I was beautiful. Maybe I was overreacting. Maybe it was just an adjustment phase. I smoothed another layer over my face.\n\nOn day 6, at work, people kept staring. But it wasn’t admiration anymore. It was… unease. Mara, who had complimented me just days before, barely made eye contact. My boss hesitated before speaking to me, his expression tight. At lunch, I overheard whispers. “She looks different. ” “Yeah, but not in a good way. ” “Like… uncanny. Like she’s trying too hard to be perfect. ” The words should have hurt, but they didn’t. Because when I looked in the mirror, I knew I was beautiful. They were just jealous. That night, I applied another layer.\n\n On day 7 I didn’t leave my apartment. Not because I was scared, no, not at all. But because the world outside didn’t deserve to see me yet. Not until I was complete. Perfect and flawless.I spent the morning in front of the mirror, watching myself. Not just checking my reflection, I mean watching. Admiring. My cheekbones, my lips, my impossibly smooth skin. Every angle was perfect. Symmetrical. But the longer I stared, the more incomplete I felt. There was still something wrong. Something is missing.\n    \nI grabbed my phone, flipping through my old photos. The ones from before. The ugly ones. My skin is uneven and textured. My lips are thin and colorless. My nose is slightly off-center. My stomach twisted in disgust. Had I really let people see me like that? Had I really lived like that? How had I ever thought I was enough? A ding snapped me out of my thoughts. A text from Mara, “Hey. I’m really worried about you. Please talk to me.” I rolled my eyes. She just didn’t understand. No one did. People feared what they couldn’t have. What they couldn’t achieve. My fingers hovered over the keyboard. I could invite her over. Show her. Maybe even let her try it. If she just saw, she’d understand.\n\nOn day 8  I didn’t respond to Mara’s text. I didn’t need to. She was coming whether I wanted her to or not. But that was fine. I had nothing to hide. I used the extra time to perfect myself. I sat at my vanity, the dim light casting a soft glow over my features. The jar of Flawless sat beside me, a silent promise, a gift I had been chosen to receive. I traced my fingers over my face, feeling the unnatural smoothness, the way my skin no longer had warmth. The way my reflection seemed to move a fraction of a second behind me. But I didn’t care. The world had spent years ignoring me, overlooking me, treating me like I was nothing. And now? Now they couldn’t look away. I dipped my fingers into the jar again, scooping out another layer. The cream pulsed against my fingertips, cool and thick, almost eager. My breath hitched as I smoothed it over my cheekbones, down my jawline, across my lips. The sensation was intoxicating. The more I applied, the less human I felt, but the more perfect I became.\n\nA knock at the door jolted me from my trance. Mara. I turned to the mirror one last time, adjusting my smile. It was perfect. Not too wide, not too forced, just enough to seem normal. I opened the door. Mara gasped. “Oh my God,” she whispered, stepping back. I tilted my head, feigning innocence. “What’s wrong? ” Her eyes darted over my face, her throat working as she swallowed hard. “You… you don’t look right. ” I smiled wider. “You said I looked amazing before. ” Mara hesitated. “Yeah, but… something’s different now. ” Her voice lowered. “You look like a… like a doll. Like something trying to be human. ” A flash of irritation rippled through me. Jealousy. That’s what it was. She was jealous. I stepped closer. “You’re just not used to seeing perfection up close. ” Mara flinched. “Jesus, Sam, listen to yourself.” She grabbed my wrist. Her fingers were warm. Too warm. “Whatever this is, you need to stop. Wash it off. Get help. ” I stared at her hand on my wrist. Her skin was textured. Uneven. Flawed. Disgusting. I yanked my arm away. “You don’t get it,” I said, my voice sharp. “I don’t need help. I’ve never been better. ” Mara’s eyes darkened with something I couldn’t place. Pity? Fear? Disgust?\n\nShe reached into her pocket, pulling out her phone. “I’m calling someone. ” My entire body stiffened. “No, you’re not. ” I moved without thinking. Fast. Too fast. Before she could react, I knocked the phone from her hands. It hit the floor with a sharp crack. Mara gasped, stumbling back. “What the hell is wrong with you? ” I didn’t answer. My gaze had fallen to my reflection in the hallway mirror. I swallowed hard, Mara bent to grab her phone. “i-im leaving,” she stammered. My fingers twitched. I couldn’t let her leave. She’d tell someone. She’d ruin everything. “You don’t need her. ” The whisper wasn’t just in the mirror this time. It was in my head. In my blood. I stepped forward. “Mara, wait.”\n\nMy voice was too smooth. Not quite my own. She froze. I reached for her, but a sharp, blinding pain shot through my skull. I screamed. My knees buckled, hands flying to my head. It felt like something inside me was splitting apart, tearing at the seams. Through my blurred vision, I saw Mara, eyes wide with horror. And then, a small, thin crack formed along my jawline. My skin split. I choked back another scream, scrambling to the mirror. The crack spread, curling upward, flaking at the edges like dried paint. Like a mask breaking apart. My breath came in short, ragged gasps. Beneath the perfect, flawless skin, I saw it, the black void. It wasn’t flesh. It wasn’t skin. It was nothingness. Mara was saying something, but I couldn’t hear her over the blood rushing in my ears. I pressed a trembling hand to my cheek, and felt the way the surface shifted, the way it resisted like something unnatural. Like something not human. I turned to Mara, desperation clawing up my throat. “Help me,” I whispered. Her face twisted with horror. “Oh my God,” she breathed. And then she ran. I didn’t stop her. I couldn’t.\n\nI got up and my hands shook as I grabbed the jar. My fingers, now smooth and void-like, curled around the lid. I needed to destroy it. But then A memory surfaced. The cream had sunk in the moment I applied it. It became part of me. So maybe, it could be drawn out. I scrambled to my bathroom, knocking over bottles and brushes, searching for something, anything to cleanse myself. I turned the shower on full blast, scalding hot, and stepped under the water. The heat burned against my hollow skin, but I felt nothing. I grabbed my old exfoliating scrub, the roughest one I had. A last resort for bad breakouts. I squeezed it into my hands and scrubbed hard. The first layer was peeled away in thin, black strips. A sick, oily residue sloughed off my arms, my neck, and my face. I scrubbed harder, my fingers raw and frantic. The water running down the drain turned black. The voice in my head screamed. “No! You need me! You’ll be nothing without me! ” But it was wrong. I had been me before this. It could be me again. I kept scrubbing. The black void beneath my skin cracked, the emptiness splitting apart. And then something gave way. A sharp, searing pain shot through my body. My vision blurred. My knees buckled, and I collapsed onto the shower floor.\n\nOn day 10 I woke up in bed, tangled in damp sheets. For the first time in days, I felt real. I rushed to the mirror, my heart hammering. My face stared back at me. My face. My skin wasn’t perfect anymore. My lips were thinner again. My cheekbones weren’t unnaturally sculpted. I ran my fingers over my cheeks, and they felt warm. Soft, human tears welled in my eyes. I didn’t care that I wasn’t flawless. I was me again. I ran back to the bathroom, expecting to see traces of the black substance in the shower. But the water had washed it all away. Only the jar remained on the counter. I hesitated before grabbing it. The black cream inside was still. Lifeless. I took it outside, pried off the lid, and poured the contents onto the dirt. The thick, inky substance oozed out, but instead of soaking into the earth, it just evaporated, like it had never existed at all. I buried the empty jar deep in the trash and didn’t look back.\n\nDay 30 It’s been a month. The whispers in my head are gone. My skin still has its imperfections, little scars, and uneven texture. But I don’t care. I don’t need to be flawless. Yesterday, I deleted all my beauty apps, and unfollowed every influencer that made me feel like I wasn’t enough. And for the first time in years, I looked in the mirror,\n\nand smiled.",

        "author": "thehalhefner",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "My uncle Jonas was a recluse. I thought he was interesting, but nobody else in my family could stand him—especially my mom, his baby sister. She blamed Vietnam. It wrecked him, stole the big goofy brother she once loved, and replaced him with an imposter dredged from the putrid mud of a battlefield. When the war ended, Uncle Jonas moved in with my grandma and never left. After she died in the late ’90s, when I was just a kid, he and my mom fought bitterly. She wanted to sell the house, but he refused. Being the oldest, he had just as much claim to it as she did, and he dug his heels in.\n\nMom resented him for turning her childhood home into a hoarder’s labyrinth of clothes, toys, comic books, and baseball cards. But I loved it. He let me comb through his treasures and always gifted me things I showed interest in. He was the first person I knew who used eBay, selling junk he gathered from garage sales and flea markets across upstate New York. When I was twelve, they had another blowout fight, and that was the last time I saw him. We stayed in touch through email, though, until life got in the way and we drifted apart.\n\nEver since I was little, Jonas whispered legends and shared hushed warnings about the world, the supernatural, and strange things he claimed to have seen. I dismissed them as the ramblings of an aging eccentric. But when he died unexpectedly, I never imagined that sorting through my grandmother’s decrepit farmhouse would thrust me into a nightmare beyond comprehension.\n\nHis burial arrangements were paid for, and his will requested no funeral. Shockingly, he left everything to me. That meant I now shared ownership of the house with my mom. She wanted nothing to do with it. “Trash it and sell the lot,” she said. But I couldn’t. I figured there had to be something valuable hidden in the mess—stuff worth keeping or flipping on eBay. So, I took on the task alone.\n\nI arrived on a gray, wind-whipped afternoon. The house was as ancient and ugly as the gnarled oak trees that surrounded it. The porch nearly collapsed beneath me as I entered through the sad mouth of a door. The place was a disaster, but the comics and collectibles were gone. It wasn’t what I expected. Instead, I found an overwhelming mass of dusty journals, faded photographs, and trinkets that seemed like occult relics.\n\nThat first night, I had a dream. Jonas stood at the foot of my bed, his eyes hollow, his skin waxy and gray. His mouth moved, but the words came in whispers, layered on top of each other like a dozen voices speaking at once. “Finish it.” His fingers, long and bony, reached toward me, but before he could touch me, I woke in a cold sweat. The whisper still echoed in my ears. The house creaked like it was breathing.\n\nAs I cleaned, the house grew on me. Maybe I’d keep it. And I think the house knew—because that’s when I discovered the hidden study.\n\nA false wall in the attic led to a room unlike the rest of the house. It was pristine, lined with grand bookshelves and ancient framed parchments. A Barnes & Noble-style ladder ran along the shelves. Jonas had poured time, money, and obsessive care into this place. A modern wood stove nestled in one corner near a small octagonal window of green stained glass. It bore a strange circular symbol resembling an eye. I peered out, feeling watched instead of watching.\n\nFlipping a switch, a mechanical hum rattled above as a large skylight opened to the heavens. The moon grinned, the stars winked—warning or welcoming, I couldn’t tell. In the center of the room, among relics and statues, lay a battered leather journal. Its pages brimmed with ancient symbols, newspaper clippings, and frantic notes about a hidden war fought in the shadows.\n\nJonas had been part of something called the Order of the Verdant Root. His writings told of an ancient pact—protecting the land from an unspeakable evil. According to him, modern Christianity wasn’t salvation; it was a façade, an unholy gateway through which demonic entities infiltrated our world. Every hymn, every sermon, every act of forced faith loosened the seal on something buried beneath the town’s oldest church.\n\nI read late into the night, drinking until my hands stopped shaking. When I woke, my head pounded, and the morning light felt like judgment. I told myself I’d prove this was all nonsense, that my uncle had been a delusional hoarder chasing shadows. But three days later, I wasn’t so sure. Lack of sleep blurred the edges of reality. I saw things move in the corner of my vision. Whispers bled through the walls. My own reflection seemed delayed, as if watching me from somewhere else. The paranoia wrapped around my ribs like vines, squeezing tighter every hour.\n\nThen I found it—the photograph that changed everything.\n\nA yellowed Polaroid, dated Herkimer, Sept. 5, 1971. It showed hooded figures forming a circle around a stone altar, darkly stained with unmistakable old blood. Other images followed—grotesque rituals, sacrificial rites, robed figures bathing in entrails. My stomach churned and my heart ached as I saw the bodies of children—lifeless, in pieces.\n\nThen I saw them.\n\nIn the background of the main photograph, I had first thought I saw people. But the longer I stared, the clearer the truth became. Their forms were wrong, grotesque, misshapen. Jonas hadn’t just collected artifacts.\n\nAnd in the next image—God help me—the ritual played out in gruesome detail.\n\nA child.\n\nHelpless.\n\nButchered on the altar as the robed figures bathed in its blood.\n\nI dropped the pictures like they had burned me. My heart slammed against my ribs.\n\nIt was real.\n\nJonas had been right.\n\nI drank myself into oblivion that night, but there are some horrors whiskey can’t drown.\n\nI spent three days unraveling the truth.\n\nJonas had been drafted into something older than war itself. Indoctrinated by a fellow soldier named Callahan, the last of an Irish bloodline sworn to keep something imprisoned beneath the earth.\n\nBut the Church—the real church—wasn’t what we thought it was.\n\nIt didn’t fight evil.\n\nIt fed it.\n\nEvery prayer, every sermon, every act of blind faith chipped away at the seals, weakening the boundary that held them back. One day, if the Order failed, the Church would finally finish what it started. It taught hate and fear in the guise of righteousness.\n\nHe had fought to keep the darkness at bay. Vietnam had stolen his innocence, but it had also delivered him into a war far older than any government.\n\nThis wasn’t insanity.\n\nThis was real.\n\nAnd in two days, the full moon would rise once more.\n\nI had to act.\n\nUsing Jonas’s notes, I gathered the necessary tools—roots, oils, talismans of protection. I tracked down rare ingredients in hidden shops across Syracuse and Binghamton. I wasn’t going in blind.\n\nThen, on the appointed night, I made my way to the church.\n\nThe rain came and went in waves as I crouched in the shadows, waiting. My patience wore thin. Jonas had given his life to this fight. I couldn’t let it end with him. Midnight was the cutoff. If nothing happened by then, I was walking away. Forever.\n\nBy 11:30, I had no fucks left to give.\n\nI crossed the threshold.\n\nInside, the silence was absolute except for the relentless drip of water echoing off cold stone. The church’s ornate interior was a macabre juxtaposition of beauty and decay as I ventured into the oldest church in Herkimer. My flashlight cast grotesque shadows as I followed his notes through the nave, past the altar, to a hidden spiral staircase. The stone steps bore inscriptions in a language I didn’t recognize, their meaning clear nonetheless. Worship. Devotion. Sacrifice.\n\nIn the darkness of the cellar, the air was rank with rot and the coppery tang of blood. As I crept forward, my heart pounded in my ears to the low hum of chanting resonating from deep within the gloom. The further I ventured into the vast subterranean chamber, I could see an eerie, emerald glow. In the center of the room, a profane altar stood slick with congealed gore.\n\nThere, in the flickering half-light, I beheld a horror beyond mortal ken. Those figures I saw in the yellowing, blurry photos from 1971, now twisted in front of me. They were hideous, malformed creatures—hybrid beings with human features contorted into monstrous parodies who crawled and writhed about the altar. Their limbs, elongated and sinewy, ended in taloned fingers that scraped against stone as they chanted in a guttural language that clawed at the edge of sanity. These were the demonic emissaries the church had nurtured in secret for centuries. Their eyes were pits of burning malice, and every shift of their malformed bodies released a stench of decay.\n\nI retreated into the shadows, my fear gnawing at me as I saw the carcass of a dead child in a puddle of blood. The creatures clawed at the child’s innards with their twisted arms and sinew, their eyes black pits of malice. These were the Church’s true disciples. And they were preparing for something.\n\nI swallowed my fear and reached for the talisman. The roots and oils of the ancients pulsed against my palm. Whispering the incantation, I spat inside it, beginning the ritual.\n\nA shriek ripped through the air.\n\nOne of the creatures lunged, moving with inhuman speed. I barely had time to react before it slammed into me, claws raking my chest.\n\nI gasped, pain exploding through my ribs. My fingers clenched around the talisman, whispering the incantation Jonas had left me. My heart pounded. No turning back now.\n\nI had only seconds.\n\nWith every ounce of strength, I hurled it at the altar.\n\nA blinding flash erupted as the chamber trembled. The symbols on the walls burned, their emerald glow turning molten gold. The creatures screamed—agonized, furious—as the earth rumbled below my feet. One of the creature’s claws raked across my skin—leaving a gash that spilled dark ichor—a force surged from beneath the floor. The ancient earth magic, the same power my uncle had devoted his life to, awakened. Thick, twisting roots burst forth from the stone, ensnaring the creature and wrenching it apart in a shower of viscera and shrieking terror. It ensnared others and began dragging them into a dark hole in the earth.\n\nI stumbled as a clawed, leathery hand clasped around my ankle. It pulled hard, yanking me toward the earth. My scream ripped through the chamber as I fell onto my back, kicking wildly. More hands surfaced, clawing, grasping. I fumbled for the knife in my jacket and slashed blindly. The blade sliced through flesh, severing a wrist. The thing recoiled with a soundless shriek as its severed hand tumbled into the open hole.\n\nI pulled myself away from the hole, gasping. I saw the talisman shimmer in the torchlight and crawled toward it. I stuffed it into my pocket and scrambled to my feet.\n\nTheir screams echoed off the cold walls, one by one, as the ghastly beings were pulled into the depths from whence they came.\n\nAnd then, the church bell tolled.\n\nI ran. But I knew the truth now. This was real. It had always been real. And it wasn’t going to stop.\n\nIn that moment, I understood: Uncle Jonas had not died in vain. The Order of the Verdant Root had been formed to keep these horrors at bay, to seal the gateway between our world and the abyss. But the church’s unholy covenant had begun to falter, and their demonic allies were growing bolder.\n\nJonas had given his life to this fight. Now, it was my turn.\n\nThe Order of the Verdant Root still had work to do. My roots were now a curse. But I take solace in my despair, knowing that there are others like me. I’m looking for them. \n\nAre you one of us?",

        "content": "I found him after a storm.\n\nAs a kid, I loved searching our pool for creatures the sea had swept in. \n\nGrammy’s house was built on the very edge of the shore, a giant ancient beach house where I spent every summer.\n\nBut in Florida, storm season never really ends. \n\nI grew used to waking up every morning  and running outside barefoot where the sea was still lapping at my ankles. \n\nI spent all day sifting through our debris littered pool with my dollar store fishnet, searching for sea creatures. \n\nThere was one time when I *thought* I found something. \n\nI was kneeling on the edge, peering into the glassy surface speckled with dirt and leaves. \n\nMovement under the stillness sent me stumbling back, dropping my net.\n\nUpon closer inspection, though, it was just an old plank of wood. \n\nI was awkwardly poking at it when the surface exploded, drenching me. For a split second, I felt a rush of excitement. \n\nFish. \n\nUntil the ‘fish’ started *laughing*. \n\nRoman, the boy from across the street, the one who could hold his breath far longer than normal humans, was infamous for lurking in Grammy’s pool. \n\nHe claimed he was “doing research,” but I never knew what for. \n\nRoman was a weird kid. \n\nHe reminded me of a fish. His eyes were too big, too far apart, and I swore his nose grew an inch every day. \n\nSopping wet, he hauled himself out of the pool and slumped down beside me, dark blonde hair plastered over his eyes.\n\nRoman prodded me (he was always prodding me to get my attention, and it drove me insane).\n\n“Whatcha looking for?”\n\n“Fish.” I answered. \n\nHe laughed, kicking his feet in the water. “Me too! Do you want me to help you find some?”\n\nI told him to go away (back to his OWN house) But Roman was allergic to the word, “No.”\n\nHe turned to me, blowing soaking strands of curls out of his eyes. \n\n“Okay, so can I *watch* you?” Roman nudged me, and I almost lost my balance. \n\n“I know what you're looking for, y’know, I’m not stupid.”\n\nI had a feeling he had been eavesdropping over our broken fence. \n\nBefore I could call my parents, he slipped back into the water.\n\nRoman wasn't a boy to trust. \n\nI accidentally told him I peed in the sea once, and by the next day, the entire class was calling me names. \n\nSo, I would have much preferred to search for marine life without him lurking around. \n\nI found all kinds of things in our pool. \n\nStarfish, the occasional jellyfish spilled over in the tide, and even a baby shark my mom had to rescue with a fishing net.\n\nBut I never found what I was looking for. \n\nWhat my Grammy had searched for and ultimately given up on, and what Roman was catching onto. \n\nFish people. \n\nStay with me. \n\nOkay, so you should know my Grammy wasn’t fully *there*, after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of Alzheimer’s.\n\nBut she was also a very intelligent woman. \n\nFor the most part, she was bedridden by the time I started elementary school. \n\nBut the stories she used to tell me when she *was* awake kept me visiting, even when I knew deep down that I didn’t want to watch her deteriorate. \n\nHer stories of encounters with fish people were worth it; worth the pain of staying by her side. \n\nI remember my tenth birthday.\n\nThe power went out right in the middle of my favorite episode of Hannah Montana. \n\nGrammy was sleeping on the couch, tucked under blankets, and I was inhaling my ice-cream birthday cake.\n\nWhen the storm blew out the TV, I abandoned my snack, remembering Mom’s instructions in case a hurricane hit. \n\nI grabbed my flashlight, two bottles of water, snacks, and her meds, and helped Grammy down into the basement to wait it out. \n\nI was used to her staying silent, just sitting with her arms wrapped around her knees, her expression content. \n\nShe was starting to forget my name. \n\nSome days I was Charlotte, then I was Charlie, and then I was a stranger. \n\nThis wasn't one of those times.\n\nGrammy smiled at me, patted the space next to her, and said, “Can I tell you about the fish people, Charlotte?”\n\nGrammy didn’t usually talk to me. \n\nIt wasn’t that she didn’t want to, it was more that she couldn’t. \n\nMom explained it the best way she could: in a to-the-point, Mom way. \n\nBlunt and realistic. \n\nI would have to come to terms with Grammy forgetting me.\n\nI didn’t understand Alzheimer’s, but I did understand the concept of forgetting. \n\nI started to notice it during visits. At first, it was subtle. \n\nGrammy would forget to eat her dinner or go to the bathroom. \n\nBut then she started asking if I was a friend of her granddaughter. \n\nAnd, painfully—so fucking painfully—she started asking who *I* was.\n\nI saw my Grammy deteriorate and I was helpless. \n\nMom and Dad tried to put her into a home, but she insisted on staying by the sea. That's all she said. \n\n“I want to stay by the sea,” she whispered, barely a breath, stuck in her favorite chair, her eyes growing more vacant, more frenzied and scared. \n\nWhat I didn't understand as a child was that this disease was cruel. \n\nIt wasn't going to leave anything behind. \n\nIt made her scream and cry, and in the later stages, try and throw her hands at my mother, who she no longer recognized. \n\n“I want to die in the water! I *want* to die in the water! Let me die in the water!”\n\nI think her words broke my parents’ hearts.\n\nI knew I shouldn’t have, but I kept visiting. Even when it hurt. \n\nEven when the inevitable arrived, when she spoke less and less until she was barely speaking at all.\n\nI had gotten used to her calling me different names, random ones that came to mind.\n\nI got used to her snapping at me, then apologizing, then asking where her granddaughter was. I got used to imagining our conversations instead. \n\nThe two of us would sit for hours, me lost in fantasy while she stared blankly at me. \n\nI would try not to cry, pretending to manifest conversations that weren’t one-sided. \n\nShe would ask about school, and I would say, “Oh, yeah, it’s fun!” \n\nI would imagine her laugh, her voice saying, “I hope you’re making lots of friends!”\n\n“Yeah, Grammy. I am.”\n\nI guess I got used to this blank side of her, like a ghost wearing my Grammy’s face. \n\nWhen she spoke, I don’t think I fully registered it. \n\nI watched the ceiling seem to sway as the emergency lights flickered on and off, shadows casting through the shutters reflecting across her face. \n\nThe dull sound of howling wind and the rattling of the house’s old foundations sent me into a panic.\n\nGrammy’s house wasn’t built for hurricanes, and I was terrified. \n\nThe house groaned like a deep sea monster, and I felt helpless in the pit of its stomach. \n\nBut this was the first time she had looked me directly in the eye and called me Charlotte. \n\nI was scared that this was the last conversation I would be having with her. \n\n“Fish people?” I repeated, resisting the urge to bury my head in my knees. \n\nAcross the room, wine bottles rattled on old wooden shelves. \n\nWhen one rolled onto the concrete floor and shattered on impact, something ice-cold slithered down my spine.\n\nGrammy nodded with a dreamlike smile. \n\n“I met him when I was your age,” she said, reminiscing. “A beautiful boy from the sea, and I was going to marry him.” \n\nShe laughed, and it was a good laugh. It was Grammy’s laugh.\n\n“He asked me to be his queen, and we were going to run away together to his home under the ocean.” Her voice grew somber, her unfocused eyes finding me.\n\nThe lights flickered off, but I wasn't scared. Even when my Grammy became a faceless shadow, I was captivated by her story.\n\n“When a magical boy promises to take you to a whole other world and promises marriage, what else is there to say except *yes*?”\n\nI found myself smiling, comforted by her words, her effortless way of storytelling. \n\nI jumped up to grab my flashlight, holding it underneath my chin. Grammy continued.\n\n“His name was Sebastian,” she murmured. “Such a beautiful man. His hair reminded me of seaweed, tangled and curling perfectly over eyes the color of stardust.”\n\nI was fully invested in the story. “Did he have a tail?”\n\nShe grinned, and her expression was so warm, so *her*, I felt my eyes sting.\n\n“He did,” she whispered, giddy.\n\nGrammy curled her lip. “I wanted to tell my friends, but he was very clear,” she mimicked his voice, holding up her finger. \n\n“Clementine, you must *promise* me you will never reveal my secret to anyone.”\n\nShe found my gaze, her smile softening. \n\n“I kept that promise. We made arrangements to run away together. He told me to meet him in the shallows at dawn underneath the sunrise, and I…waited.” \n\nHer tone, that had been so chipper, so happy, like she was reliving the memory, grew darker. “I waited for him, sitting on the sand, my toes in the shallows, until sunrise turned to sunset.”\n\nHer expression crumpled like she was going to cry. \n\n“I… waited. I never *stopped* waiting. Every day, I would step into the shallows and wait for him to come back. Even when I was unrecognizable to him— when I had aged way beyond what he knew.” \n\nGrammy’s smile was soft. \n\n“I want to die under the sea,” she whispered, grasping for my hands. \n\n“So, I can find him! Because I belong to the ocean, Charlotte.”\n\nHer fingernails bit into my skin, wrinkled eyes already losing clarity, her grip tightening. \n\n“Can you help me find him?”\n\nAs a ten year old, I was convinced I could find Sebastian for her. \n\nI stood in the shallows every morning for hours, shivering, calling out for him. \n\nI stupidly thought that if I told the sea my Grammy was sick, he would hear and come back.\n\nWhen I was starting middle school, Roman came over to ask my dad for spare fishing gear.\n\nGrammy’s face lit up, her eyes widening. Sitting in her chair, she nearly toppled off.\n\nAfter not speaking for days or weeks, she was laughing. \n\nShe thought he was Sebastian, pointing at him with frenzied eyes and laughing, saying, “You haven't changed! Sebastian! You're here!”\n\nRoman left pretty quickly, shooting me a *look* before leaving. \n\nIt became increasingly obvious I wasn't going to find Sebastian. \n\nI had this fantasy of taking my Grammy in her wheelchair all the way to the shore.\n\nThe two of them would talk– and maybe he really could take her back to his world. \n\nBut that was fiction.\n\nThe reality was that I was losing my grandma to a disease with zero mercy, and instead of coming to terms with it, I hid in fantasy. \n\nEventually, Mom told me, as gently as possible, that Grammy had deteriorated.\n\nAs her disease progressed and reached the later stages, she insisted she could breathe underwater.\n\nThat’s what killed her. \n\nOne day, Grammy waded into the ocean during a trip to the beach, and never resurfaced. \n\nMom and Dad were upset. \n\nBut I was relieved. \n\nGrammy never wanted to die on land, so she had gotten what she wanted. \n\nMaybe I was still holding onto the possibility that Sebastian kept his promise. \n\nShe left me the house. \n\nAs well as letters to Sebastian she never threw into the ocean. \n\nSo, during college, I spent every weekend there, dropping a letter a day into the surf. \n\nHowever, the house wasn't *just* mine. \n\nI was in class when I got a text from my favorite person: \n\n*“I’m not cleaning the pool.”*\n\nIn her will, to my confusion, my Grandma had named Roman (yes, the weird fish-looking kid) as a co-owner of the house once we both turned eighteen. \n\nI thought it was a mistake, and so did my parents—but no, my grandma was very clear, naming *him* specifically, because he just happened to resemble Sebastian. \n\nDad was pissed, and he had every right to be. \n\nRoman wasn’t even an acquaintance.\n\nI finally built up the courage to tell him I was looking for my Grammy’s long-lost merman boyfriend, and, of course, he went and blabbed to the whole school.\n\nThanks to him, kids were calling me “Flounder” right up to eighth grade. \n\nRoman, surprisingly, had a growth spurt, lost a ton of baby fat, and no longer looked like a fish. So, lucky him, I guess. \n\nThis guy teased me all the way to graduation about my Grammy’s merman boyfriend.\n\nIt's not like I didn't notice him at sixteen, standing alone in the shallows in the early hours of the morning, his gaze fixed on the surf as if searching for something. \n\nI caught him once, ankle-deep, arms folded under a sunrise, a pack of fish sticks in his pocket.\n\nAnd at his feet, a lone fish-stick dancing in the tide. \n\nHe didn't *say* it directly, but I was pretty sure Roman was looking for Sebastian too. \n\nBut then we both grew up. \n\nRoman’s text was the icing on the cake of an already shitty day. \n\nIt was *his* turn to clean the pool, as per our contract we made when we were eighteen, and relatively civil and on talking terms. Ever since starting college, he had become insufferable. \n\nApparently, gaining a personality and love for literature and creative writing turns you into a sociopath. \n\nRoman missed my Grammy’s anniversary two years in a row, lied to my parents about being sick BOTH times, and used her house to throw parties. \n\nI cleaned the pool a month earlier, but apparently, this guy had the memory of a goldfish. \n\nI texted back: *“It's your turn.”*\n\nI wasn't expecting him to reply so fast:\n\n*I'm going to a party,* was all he texted back, followed by a slew of crying emojis. \n\n*It's literally a pool, it's not hard lmao.*\n\nHe followed up with: *She's YOUR grandma, Charlotte.*\n\nRoman was right. She was my Grammy, so I had to take responsibility. \n\nOn the night I arrived back at the house, a storm hit. \n\nIt wasn't a bad one, but I did hide in the newly renovated basement just in case. \n\nI missed the old, ancient vibe. \n\nYes, the rattling shelves filled with bottles were a death trap waiting to happen. \n\nBut I enjoyed picking up all of Grammy’s ceramic fish ornaments and the shells lining each wall.\n\nShe told me the shells were gifts from Sebastian. \n\nGrammy left them to my mother, who gave them to a thrift store. \n\nNow, the basement was more of a wine cellar acting as a storage room. \n\nI was falling asleep on an old pile of boxes. \n\nBut then I remembered I left the gate open. \n\nWhen my phone vibrated with a text that just said, “SHUT THE GATE. IDIOT,” I grabbed my flashlight and coat. \n\nWhen I got outside, the wind was already picking up. \n\nKicking through storm debris, I skirted the pool’s edge toward the gate. \n\nI stopped, almost skidding on a fallen deck chair, when I caught movement in the pool. \n\nTwinkling light spider-webbing under the rippling surface.\n\nThe pool lights weren’t on.\n\nI dropped to my knees at the edge, scanning the water. \n\nImmediately, I was a little kid again, scrambling for my old dollar-store fishing net. \n\nI leaned closer, illuminating stray driftwood and an inflatable beach ball. \n\n“Here, fishy, fishy…”\n\nThe pretty iridescent glow under the water was not my flashlight.\n\nI clicked it off, balancing myself on the edge, following the greenish light prickling under the surface.\n\nI had a sudden spontaneous idea to slip off my shoes and wade into the water. \n\nWhen I retracted back on my heels, I caught movement again, a shadow lurking just underneath the blue. \n\nBefore it broke through, two eyes staring directly at me. \n\nRoman. \n\nI blinked, and then I shuffled back on my hands and knees, knocking my flashlight into the water. \n\nIt *wasn't* Roman. \n\nIt was a guy. My age. Early twenties.\n\nI detected annoyance in his expression, amusement flickering on his lips. \n\nThick brown curls stuck to his forehead tangled with seaweed, a crown of driftwood and sea glass. \n\nSlowly, my gaze dropped into the pool, finding his torso, which ended just below his waist. \n\nThe boy came closer, head inclining. \n\nWhen the water moved, lapping around him, I glimpsed his legs fused together behind him, slimy scales bleeding into something more akin to a tail. \n\nWhen he grasped the pool walls, his eyes finding mine, I realized he was in pain. \n\nI saw the thick trail of red diluting the surface, blood splatters painting the pool walls.\n\nHe was hurt. \n\nI held my finger up to signal him to wait, and waded into the pool to grab my flashlight. \n\nI was already off balance, waist deep in the shallow end. \n\nWhen a violent gust of wind sent me toppling in head first, I felt his hands coming around me, and dragging me to the surface. \n\nI plucked my flashlight, and clicked it on, illuminating the pool, a trail of blood smearing blue tiles. \n\nWhen I tried to help him, he was surprisingly less timid than I had expected. \n\nHe showed me his tail, tangled in my dad’s old fishing net. \n\nHis body was slimy to the touch, a full fish tail.\n\nHe was human, with skin, all the way up to his torso, where a greenish slime took over, bleeding into scales that sculpted the rest of him. \n\nWhen I checked his injury, a large gash was taken out of his left fin. \n\nHis blood looked just like mine.\n\nI told him to roll onto his side, and he looked confused, before doing so. \n\nI ran my fingers over bluish carvings just below his ribs, my hands trembling. \n\nGills. \n\nThis guy was the real deal. Which meant my grandma was telling the truth. \n\nWhen I was finished checking him over, I had an idea. \n\nGrammy had an old-fashioned bathtub in the downstairs bathroom. \n\nIf I could get him out of the storm and inside, I could treat him. \n\nI asked him if I could pull him out. The boy looked surprised, but nodded. \n\nHe didn't speak, only stabbing at his throat with his index finger before holding out his hand, entangling his fingers with mine. \n\nHis eyes were frightened, but determined. \n\nI dragged him out of the pool, before grabbing a bucket, filling it up, and soaking him. \n\nI was conscious of Grammy’s words when speaking about Sebastian in his fish form. \n\n*“Children of the sea must be soaked through at all times. If not, they will suffocate.”*\n\nI had asked her how long Sebastian could maintain human legs, and her eyes darkened. \n\n*“Legs are a last resort.”*\n\nThe boy was already breathless, his eyes flickering, unfocused gaze on the sky. \n\nI soaked him, grabbed his hands, and promised him I was going to save him. \n\nThe last thing I wanted was for this merman to suffocate on land. \n\nSo, I grabbed his arms, made sure to soak him every few minutes, and dragged him inside the house and into the downstairs bathroom. \n\nIt took all of my upper body strength, and almost sent me falling on my ass, but I managed to haul him into the tub and fill it up.\n\nHis injuries weren't too bad now I had the luxury of light. I knelt on the edge of the tub, watching damaged scales healing, reforming themselves over skin.\n\nThe way they moved, his skin turning blue, then green, hardening into scales, reminded me of a virus, a slow, spreading sheen of slime creeping over his flesh. \n\nHis tail was the most surprising. \n\nI expected it to be a fully formed fin, but when I looked closer, I swore I could see traces of bones jutting underneath, almost resembling legs. \n\nI tended to him all night, checking and rechecking the temperature of the tub.\n\nWhen I noticed him shivering, I added some warm water, and he seemed content, leaning over the edge, his chin resting on his arms. \n\n“So, you're Sebastian?” I asked him, when I'd bandaged up his fin. \n\nThe boy shook his head, raising a brow, like he was offended. \n\nI asked him his name, but he didn't respond, more interested in my shampoo bottles. \n\nHe poked one, and it dropped into the bath. \n\nThe boy shot me a frightened look, and I picked one up. \n\n“It’s shampoo,” I said, prodding my ponytail. “It's for your hair.”\n\nHe nodded slowly, but I noticed him inching away from them. \n\nI talked to him for a while, enjoying his presence. \n\nI kept him company, telling him about my Grammy’s stories, and Sebastian. \n\nHe was a little too big for the tub, his tail flopping over the side, but he seemed comfortable, resting his arms on the side, squinting his eyes and nodding at the wrong times. \n\nI thought it was adorable, the way he at least *pretended* to understand me. \n\nWhen he zoned out, dipping his head under the water and blowing bubbles, I figured he was hinting at me to shut up. \n\nHalfway through an anecdote, though, I started to get breathless.\n\nI thought I was just tired. I had been up all night, and I could see the first glimmers of sunrise outside the window. \n\nBut suddenly, my chest felt tight, all the breath sucked from my lungs. \n\nI thought I was getting sick, maybe the flu, before my legs gave way and I dropped onto the floor, like being severed from strings. \n\nI remember trying to move, trying to *breathe*, but I couldn't, my mouth opening, lips parting, *gasping*.\n\nI couldn't breathe. \n\nI couldn't fucking breathe. \n\nIt's like there was no oxygen in the room, my lungs were starving.\n\nBreathing was suddenly so fucking hard. I sucked in as much air as I could, but my body rejected it, contorting as I rolled onto my stomach. \n\nI couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, blood running thick down my chin.\n\nI could feel something alive, something *wriggling*, writhing down my throat.\n\nWhen my lungs contracted, my mouth filled with the taste of salt.\n\nI flopped onto my back, my vision blurring in and out, blood-tinged water spluttering from my lips and pooling around me. \n\nA slow, spreading puddle gave me life when I rolled into it, forcing my numb body back to flickering consciousness.\n \n“Fucking *finally*.”\n\nHis voice was like ocean waves echoing in my skull. I rolled onto my side, and I remember feeling like the water was air– the water was giving me oxygen. \n\nThere was a loud splash and then wet slapping footsteps moving towards me.\n\nThrough spotty vision, I saw  his tail splitting apart into slimy masses, undulating scales writhing over bones bleeding into legs, a horrific, deformed mimic of a human body.\n\nI felt ice- cold slimy hands leeching around my ankles. \n\n“I thought you were never going to stop talking,” he laughed. “Your Grandmother said you were a talker, but *wow*.” \n\nI caught his sparkling grin. “She was right, though! Dad says I can’t be King without a Queen,” the merman’s nails bit into me. \n\nHis words felt like needles being stuck into me. “And your grandmother said you would be the perfect bride, *Charlotte*.”\n\nI  watched his feet stumble, tripping over himself as he dragged me toward the door. \n\nHe had human feet. \n\nThe only thing *not* human, was the green fleshy substance growing on his soles. \n\nI felt his arms around me, lifting me into the air, and dropping me into the pool. \n\nI plunged down, expecting my lungs to relax now that I was in water, my skin and throat and *lungs* craving it. \n\nInstead, though, my body had a very human reaction, immediately clawing for air. \n\nI broke the surface, choking up clumps of blood, and found myself face to face with the merman sitting on the side of the pool.\n\nThe boy’s lip curled as he watched my legs struggle to stay afloat.\n\n“Fifteen minutes, Charlotte,” he murmured, casually crossing one scaled leg over the other. \n\nHe surveyed me with a mix of confusion and amusement, cocking his head.\n\n“That’s how long it takes for a human to lose their legs.”\n\nHe leaned forward, kicking his feet in the water. \n\n“So, I'm not sure I understand what's going on right now.”\n\nI found my voice choked at the back of my throat. \n\n“You can talk.” I managed to hiss out. \n\nHe shrugged, rolling his eyes. “Well, yeah. I have a mouth— so, yes, I can talk.”\n\nI asked him if he knew my grandma, and his expression brightened.\n\n“I do!” His smile was smug. “She told me you would make a wonderful bride.”\n\nThe merman’s words stung. Grammy would never say that. \n\n“So, she found him?” I pushed. “Did my grandmother find Sebastian?”\n\nBefore he could answer, however, a shadow loomed behind him. \n\nThe *shadow* mouthed, *\"What the fuck?\"*\n\nRoman. \n\nWide-eyed and clutching a bottle of vodka, he stood in shorts and a tee, a pair of Ray-Bans pinning back thick, sandy hair. \n\nHe looked like he’d just stumbled out of a spring break party, but he wasn’t drunk. \n\nOr maybe he… *was*, but sober enough to recognize that I was in trouble. \n\nI think he meant to attack the merman, but the boy was too fast, spinning around and clawing at his face.\n\nLuckily, Roman had the upper hand, with the merman already balancing on the edge, not yet used to human feet. \n\nThank god he had common sense, shoving the fish boy into the pool. \n\nThe boy hit the water with a loud splash, and Roman staggered back. \n\nWhen the merman dove under, his tail slapping the sides of the pool, my friend dropped to his knees on the edge, holding out his hand for me to grab.\n\nI grasped for his wrist, my body already protesting leaving water. \n\n“Tell me I'm still tripping,” Roman whispered, when he pulled me toward him. \n\nI could only shake my head, choking on stinging air that was lashing my lungs. \n\n\"Well, what the fuck is going on? What is *that*?\" He hissed, hauling me out of the pool. \n\nI collapsed face-down, gasping for breath, rolling onto my back. \n\nFor a moment, I was disoriented—my body caught between the water and the air, unsure which it needed more. \n\nMy lungs contracted, already craving the depths, but once I had spluttered up half a gallon of blood stained water, my body flopped back down. \n\nFinally, I could breathe again. \n\nInstead of speaking, I shuffled back on my hands and knees and gestured for Roman to grab a bucket. \n\nI pointed to the pool, and then to myself, my voice still stuck in my throat, tangled on my tongue. \n\nRoman filled the bucket, and then dumped the contents over my head. \n\nI found my breath, thankfully, and then my voice. \n\n“Do I have gills?” I whispered, running my fingers down my torso. \n\n“Do you have *what*?”\n\n“Gills!” I said through my teeth. “Check my back.”\n\nI shivered when he dragged his nails down my back. \n\n“Uh, no? You don't have gills, dude.”\n\nI checked myself over almost obsessively  searching for that greenish slime creeping over my skin. But I was clear. \n\n“It's a fish person,” I answered Roman’s earlier question. \n\nHis eyes widened, the bucket slipping from his fingers. “Sebastian?”\n\nI noticed the merman had drawn blood across his cheek, three deep gashes. \n\n“I'm fine,” he said, when I started forward. \n\nRoman prodded the scratch gingerly, his gaze on the pool. “Where did he go?”\n\nI followed his eyes, catching movement underneath. \n\nHe was *hiding*.\n\nRoman studied the water, his tongue in his cheek. “So, your grandma's homicidal merman friend Sebastian came to… what? Murder you?”\n\nI didn't respond, slowly getting to my knees and dragging my fingers across the surface. \n\n“You know my Grandmother,” I spoke to the water, ignoring Roman’s warnings to stay away from the edge. \n\n“But my Grandma died when I was in middle school. She walked into the sea, and never came back.”\n\nThe water rippled, but the merman didn't break through. \n\n“There's no way you *know* my grandma,” I gritted out. “So, what the fuck *are* you?”\n\nIt hit me, then, that Grammy really did drown. \n\nThis thing was fucking with my head. \n\nThe merman only shot me a knowing smile. \n\nRoman disappeared for a moment, reappearing with a bottle of water. \n\nHe downed the whole thing, scrunching it up and throwing it in the pool. \n\n“Hey, asshole.” he said, “Answer her questions.”\n\nI spent the next few minutes questioning an empty pool. \n\nThe merman had taken a vow of silence. \n\nI didn't notice at first. I was too busy waiting for the merman to make his next move. \n\nBut Roman, sitting cross legged next to me, had gone through three bottles of water in under five minutes. \n\nIt was only when I noticed the slight tinge of green crawling over his left cheek, when I realized something was very wrong. \n\nRoman was halfway through his fourth bottle of water, when I whacked it out his hand. \n\nHe looked at me in confusion, slowly tilting his head. \n\nBefore dropping onto his stomach and slurping up the spilled water letting out heavy pants, like he couldn't breathe. \n\n“Roman.” I tried to pull him to his feet, but he didn't respond, rolling around in the stemming puddle. \n\nI jumped up, grabbed his ankles, and dragged him away from the pool. \n\n“Fuck.” Roman finally spluttered, coughing something up. \n\n“I can't… I can't *breathe*.”\n\nHis short, panting gasps turned into heaves for breath. \n\nRolling him onto his side in the recovery position, I waited for him to start puking up water, but he didn't. \n\nHis cheeks were sickly pale, almost gaunt, like something was sucking the life out of him. \n\nWhen I grabbed Roman’s leg, I saw it, like a virus, rippling over his bare flesh. \n\nIn a panic, I plucked off a slimy scale, but another grew in its place, then another, his skin hardening into a marble-like substance, bleeding into fish-like scales.\n\n\"He's going to suffocate, you know,\" a voice startled me.\n\nThe merman was leaning over the edge of the pool, chin resting on his fist.\n\n\"Right now, his body is changing, and if you don't let it, his lungs will reject the change, shrivel up, and the host will die.\"\n\nI was paralyzed before it hit me. \n\nWhen Roman’s eyes flickered, his body jerked, his legs fusing together, bones undulating, I realized I had no choice but to push him into the water. \n\nI think I apologized or tried to, my heart in my throat. I tried to roll him into the pool, but the merman hissed.\n \n“No, he needs the *sea*,” the boy said sternly. “If you want him to breathe long enough to get him into the sea, you need to slice into his lower back and his neck.”\n\nRoman was conscious enough to protest, squeezing out a, “No! Are you fucking serious? *Don't* touch me!\"\n\nHis voice dropped into a snarl, eyes rolling back. \n\nBut I had no choice. \n\nI grabbed a knife from my kitchen. \n\nWith trembling hands, I sliced straight through Roman’s throat, and to my relief, he let out a strangled gasp for breath. \n\nHis eyes flew open.\n\nHe was breathing. \n\nDigging deeper, blood splattered my face, ice-cold and wrong, but something else hit me, and my body immediately entered fight or flight.\n\nI screamed, dropping the knife and shuffling back, grasping my face to make sure they weren't *on* me.\n\nIt took me a moment to realize what I was staring at.\n\nWriggling between flaps of flesh were tiny, worm-like things, filling him, gushing out of the cut. \n\nWhen they made contact with air, they started to shrivel up and dry, going still. \n\nDancing tendrils crumbled apart, spiderwebbing down Roman's neck.\n\nI wasn't talking to a merman. \n\nSebastian was never a merman.\n\nA magical being who lived under the ocean.\n\nMy Grammy and I had been talking to parasites that had taken over human bodies. \n\nThey forced the body to adapt to water, to crave *water*, and then drowned them. \n\nThe mer-man didn't want a Queen to *marry*.\n\nI felt sick, my stomach contorting.\n\n“You only drown men,” I said, the words tumbling from my mouth. \n\nWhen the merman inclined its head, I knew exactly what it was thinking.\n\n“You can't tell the difference between us.\" I said. \"So you wait to see if we will change.”\n\n“You've got to be fucking *kidding* me!” \n\nRoman was coughing, spluttering, his eyes wide. \n\nBut even conscious, he was crawling toward the pool, toward water, dragging himself, like the thing inside him was in full control. \n\nI grabbed him before he could, scooping him into my arms. \n\nHe was so light, his legs already half transformed, glued together into a *tail*. \n\n“He needs to drown in the sea,” the mer-man said. “He needs water, or he’ll die.”\n\nThe boy’s smile was filled with thread-like worms. \n\n“The body doesn't have long.”\n\nAs if emphasizing his words, Roman’s body was jerking in my arms, trying to get back to water. \n\nHis eyes weren't his, quivering lips screaming at me to throw him in. \n\nWith zero choice, I pulled the merman out of the pool with one hand. \n\nWith Roman dying in my arms, I carried him all the way to the shallows, and let him slip into the water. \n\nThe merman instructed me to fully slash open his throat, so his body could adapt. \n\nWhen I couldn't, the merman did it for me, slashing open his throat, carving gills into marble-like flesh. \n\nRoman flopped into blood stained water, gasping, sobbing, rolling onto his front. \n\nHe begged me not to let him go. \n\nBut already, his voice was different, dropping down in octaves, his eyes unblinking, staring at me. \n\nI told Roman it was okay, and that he was just going to *sleep*. \n\nBy the time he lay on his stomach, a tail pushing out through his mangled legs, he blinked at me like I was a stranger. \n\nThe merciful thing would have been to kill him. \n\nTo stop the parasites writhing beneath his skin, already coiling around his iris.\n\nBut I couldn't. I was paralysed, watching my friend suffocate on land. \n\nI watched the merman drag him out into the ocean, the two of them disappearing under the surf. \n\nI wanted to believe that the parasite didn't take all of them. \n\nThe merman seemed to retain human speech. \n\nMaybe Roman would be the same. \n\nI went home and took three showers, scrubbing my body until I was screaming. \n\nI cleaned up the blood in the pool, splattered on the tiles. \n\nAnd then I fucking cried. \n\nRoman’s disappearance was ruled a drowning. \n\nA year later, it's spring break, and my parents have been trying to convince me to rent out the house to college kids. \n\nI've been refusing. I don't want anyone near the pool. I clean it every weekend, but I can't bring myself to actually use it. \n\nI've been researching *what* exactly I encountered. \n\nThe closest I've come to is the *Horsehair worm*, a parasitic thing that manipulates the host’s behavior to drown themselves. \n\nBut this thing only infects INSECTS. \n\nIt's harmless to humans. \n\nSo, what infected Roman and the merman? \n\nIs this an evolved version? The symptoms are exactly the same. \n\nHorsehair parasites (all parasites) lay eggs to reproduce. \n\nSo, why was this one so obsessed with finding a female? \n\nThree days ago, my parents managed to convince me to rent it out for the summer. \n\nI came down to check it in the morning, half asleep. \n\nMom and Dad are visiting to see if it needs any renovations. \n\nI was planning to let a group of middle schoolers splash around in it for a girl’s birthday. \n\nStepping out into the yard, the first thing I noticed was the cement patio was soaking. \n\nAnd there he was, casually leaning against the pool edge, chin resting on his arms. \n\nHis tail lapped the water, fully formed, a greenish blue. \n\nI don't know why my Grammy described the tails as *magical*, and *breathtaking*. \n\nShe didn't see the reality of Sebastian. \n\nThere was nothing magical about the parasite clinging to my friend's body. \n\nA cruel mimic of what this thing *thought* a tail was. \n\nHuman bones contorted and forcibly molded and *shaped* to adapt. \n\nThere was nothing *beautiful* about his unblinking, colorless eyes staring at me. \n\nNothing enchanting about the crown of sea glass forced onto his head. \n\nBeads of velvety red staining his temples, or the strands of seaweed tangled in his hair. \n\nI saw him for what he really was; a drowned husk of flesh infested with a parasite. \n\nThere was no recognition in his expression, and yet he was still *here*.\n\nIn the pool he had been playing in as a child. \n\nI wanted to believe it was his memories bringing him back to a familiar place. \n\nBut then I saw the wriggling, thread-like things lapping around him. \n\nWith a grin, Roman slipped under the surface, his tail splashing water in my face. \n\nI called my parents with shaking hands, canceling the visit. \n\nI messaged the kids not to bother. \n\nBut already, the gate was flying open, excited footsteps slapping across the patio. \n\nThe first kid cannon balled, followed by another, and *another*. \n\nThey kept coming, like they were drawn to my pool. \n\nTownspeople. Throwing themselves into the depths. Except they didn't resurface. \n\nI ran back inside, and locked myself in my room. I'm terrified this thing is spreading. \n\nIt’s been an hour since I locked myself in here. \n\nIt's so quiet. I'm too scared to look outside. \n\nI can't stop thinking about the merman’s words. \n\n*“Fifteen minutes. That's how long it takes for a human to lose their legs.”*",

I reacted accordingly. I treated him like an inmate. Affable, with a mostly genuine interest in his affairs and daily life. I say mostly because he's a bad guy and there will always be a part of me that doesn't give a fuck about the comings and goings of a bad guy. I pressed him casually for conversation. I didn't get much, just that he had been in Death’s employ for 50 years and looked about 38. “Fringe benefit,” he said. I had to keep the questions to a minimum or they get suspicious, so I stopped there.\n\nI'm good, though. You couldn't tell I was info-mining. Since Karma has given me the composition book, I had been logging the things that didn't make sense. She was right. I didn't sign anything except a single dotted line that kicked me into the top 20% of the tax bracket. Panicked, I yelled for Karma. She appeared wrapped in a hot pink towel with a shower cap decorated with pink rubber ducks. “Bro, I know you're new,” she said, “But there's a method to this.” She took out her clicker I knew kept track of more than numbers. “Sis, I figured but no one tells me this shit How was I supposed to know?\"\n\nShe put the clicker back and I was audibly relieved. “Ok, what do you want?”\n\n“Did I sell my soul?” I was terrified I had. I really need to get better at reading fine print. Boring corporate jargon beats dreaming about being drug away by hellhounds and ripped apart. I jumped at any sound that was remotely bark-like.\n\n“No. Is that it? This conditioning mask needs to be removed after 10 minutes.”\n\n“My paperwork, you were right! I didn't sign shit! NO orientation! No formal training! NO TAX FORMS! I'm lucky I brought my laptop.”\n\nShe giggled. \"Yeah. Me and a few of my good Judy's are keeping it on the DL.”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“It means you're safe, boomer. For now. We WANT the outside people to know.”\n\n\"And chow, we don't seem to have it. You guys are fed some kind of weird juice and meat diet. This is completely unlawful, you may be incarcerated but they can't give you some slop either! And this is from someone who has seen prison food! Juice and bloody raw lamb is a health hazard. And why are you confined to your cells during chow? Unless you're in segregated housing I can put in an inquiry and I encourage you all to file grievances. Safe, supervised camaraderie among inmates reduces vioence.\"\n\nKarma sighed, and told me even though wanted to sock me half the time, the other half was a good apple.\n\nOk, fine. I'll take it.\n\n\"Ok, I’ll answer the boring stuff real quick.  Most of us drink enchanted nectar, the rest are certified baddies who need fresh raw meat. it would be bloodbath to have us in there alone, let alone with you in the same room. She smiled at the thought.\"We aren't doing macaroni jewelry in there, Dunkin.\n\nIn the HQ tier–in your Texas–the paperwork is done. She waved in the general direction of The Man. She does this often. You are, for lack of a better word, zapped in and out of your tier. They'll say it's for you're safety, but if you knew the entrance and exit and blabbed it could cause a breakout\nThey talked about installing a doppelganger and just keeping you here in a dorm, but your wife would recognize it immediately. Instead she sees you drive to an expertly built mirage. It's solid to the touch, has a few homunculus on staff. You go in the building on autopilot and enter tier 30 via elevator. Like Floo Powder in Harry Potter except the person who made it isn't a transphobic cunt.\n\nYour wife is smart, btw. Doesn't know it but she's part forest nymph. That's why she feels so free in nature and loves to fu–”\n\n“TMI.”\n\n“Well anyway, she's protected. Everyone knows you won't work without her. Regarding communication, it's different for all of us. All you have to do is write “Dear Karma, I require your guidance” in the composition book. Justice will give you a small set of scales to squeeze.\n\n“I thought she hated my guts.”\n\n“I talked her down. You’ll meet her before Lady Death…if you survive.” She cracked up laughing. I didn't find it as funny. “Don't worry, Hamhock, just don't mention she's got a boob out. Needs a lift anyway.\n\nWe’re--all of us, eventually gonna be here to give you the real story, piece by piece.\n\nThe first piece is, have you met a man outside of admin? Zeus? Hermes? Any talk about that other death, Hades? If I were you, I'd ask about the Ferryman. Chiron the Traitorous boat boy.Put a few big bucks in his wallet and he squeals like your kind. Meaning pork.”\n\n“Is this a women's prison?”\n\n“You got it! And we ain't done shit that hasn't been done since the dawn of time. These fucking incels want to exact justice their way, so they stole the scales. They want instant karma, so they took my burn book! They tempted the Fates and won the thread of life, which is in the prison museum with Wonder Woman's lasso. Arachne’s silk for impenetrable uniforms. The scythe…we don't know where the fuck that landed. But it took away Death’s ability to Destroy. She can still control the population, still guide souls to the afterlife. But without the Scythe, she can't rip through tiers. She can't Destroy, which means she can't protect you humans from the beasties above and below. And when she can't destroy, things go really wrong. It's like firing the exterminator and crowning a roach King.”\n\n“So, when do I meet Lady Death?”\n\nThunder cracked, and for an instant I saw what I can only describe as Miss Goth Universe. Severe expression.Caramel skin. Green eyes with golden flecks. Black hair that looked woven from shadow. The reddest, plumpest lips I've ever seen.\n\nShe looked me directly in the eyes with a half-snile.\n\n“Soon.”\n\nThen disappeared as suddenly as she came in. \n\n“Drama queen” muttered karma. Well my hair is ruined now so I have to go start over THANKS. Go build a house of straw or something, I'm BUSY for the rest of the night.”\n\nSunday, March 30th, I wrote in my book. I met her sort of. She said “SOON”. Tf?\n\nNext: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/PADQ10lMqN\n\n\n\n\n",

        "author": "adorabletapeworm",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "[Previous case](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/1IL4NYp0TA)\n\nI’m sorry in advance. It's been a rough couple of weeks, so I'm feeling a little scatterbrained. \n\nFor starters, I've lost my left hand. \n\n(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) \n\nLike I said, I'm not thinking right. Before I get into what happened, I'll begin by updating yinz on the events I left off on last time. \n\nThe mechanic’s stunt with the ELKS worked, at least temporarily. A couple of days after that Wood Maiden clusterfuck, the Department of Wildlife presented their findings about blackpoll warblers at another hearing. This time, they were able to prove that the Endangered Species Act should be invoked to protect that patch of wilderness. \n\nDespite the good news, we all knew better than to get our hopes up. It was clear that something wasn't right with that company. It was only a matter of time before their overpaid lawyers found some regulatory loophole, or found another area housing territorial Neighbors to infringe upon.  \n\nIt was not over. The warbler incident only slowed them down. \n\nThe trouble started out innocently enough. We received a call for an ant infestation. Ants. In hindsight, that was probably the client's way of being funny. He had been casual and pleasant on the phone; nothing to elicit any cause for alarm. And of course, at the time, I hadn't realized the gravity of the situation. Nobody did. \n\nBecause of the way things have been going the past few months, we try to work in pairs now. For the most part, we have the personnel to do that, even with Deirdre being temporarily out to recover from her injuries. This time, Reyna and I had buddied up. It was a good thing, too. I doubt I'd be here if it wasn't for her. \n\nSpeaking of The Girlfriend, she straight up told me that she was hoping to set a positive example for me by giving herself the resources to appropriately recover rather than trying to push through the pain like a ‘stubborn mule.’ I don't know where this audacity has come from, by the way. I think my coworkers have been a good/bad influence on her. I'll give yinz a hint: one of these employees has fangs and a vendetta against a dragonfly, while the other still can't ride the big kid rides at Waldameer.\n\nBut for the most part, Deirdre is healing well. She's not used to the soreness and itching that comes with those types of injuries, so she's been paranoid about infections. I've just been doing my best to assure her that all of what she was experiencing was normal, along with helping her change bandages when necessary. Keeping the wounds covered seems to settle her mind somewhat, with the added bonus of keeping her from picking at her stitches. \n\nIt was also for the better that she wasn't around for what Reyna and I got to experience on this ‘ant infestation’ call. \n\nThe client had informed me that his house had a guard. Like a regular person, I assumed that meant he lived in the gated community. Nope. He had a personal security guardbox planted at the forefront of his property, enclosed by what appeared to be a sturdy iron fence. \n\nThrough the gate, I could see that the house looked less like a home and more like a monument to brutalism. All concrete and boxy shapes with the exception of the massive, circular windows. A shiny European car that didn’t seem ideal for driving along these pothole-covered back roads was parked underneath a gray, trapezoidal structure. \n\nIn other words, it was hideous. More of a statue than a living space. Judging by Reyna's grimace, she shared my opinion on the architectural nightmare looming before us. \n\nIn addition to the unwelcoming concrete castle, the guard was… strange. Both of us were hesitant to give him either of our names, for obvious reasons. Despite looking human, something about his demeanor gave me pause, but I couldn't put my finger on what. His movements were stiff and slow, almost mechanical. His eyes were dull and deadpan as he stared down at me. \n\nWe went back and forth until eventually, his phone rang, then he nodded with a swine-like grunt before opening the gate. \n\nReyna subtly glanced over her shoulder back at the guard booth and lowered her voice, “Something was *very* off about that guy.”\n\nI let out a little huff of relief, “Okay, I'm glad it wasn't just me.”\n\n“Yeah, that dude looks like he just discovered how to be human yesterday.”\n\n“And not very well.” I agreed. \n\nSomething moved in one of the circular windows. Frowning, I leaned closer like that would make me see better, somehow. I never claimed to be bright. Shockingly enough, I did not spontaneously develop telescopic vision and couldn't see what the source of the movement was. \n\nReyna voiced my thoughts perfectly: “Will I sound like a wimp if I say that I don't want to go in there?”\n\nI shook my head, strongly considering putting the company truck in reverse, “Not at all. Actually, I'm right there with you. Should we-”\n\nThe front door opened and the man I assumed to be the client strode out. He beamed at us, eyes concealed behind dark shades. For context, it was overcast that day. This is Pennsylvania; we get maybe two sunny days a month during the early spring, if we're lucky. It also threw me off that the client had a glowing summery tan, a stark contrast to everyone else around here who was sallow after months of drab, gray skies. Personally, my complexion was rivaling Victor's; even Reyna’s ordinarily brown skin was looking pale. \n\nShe and I exchanged equal looks of trepidation before I rolled down the window to speak to him. \n\nThe first thing he did was point at the sunglasses, “Forgive my big ol’ migraine glasses! You know how it is.”\n\nI didn't, but okay. He extended a large hand to me through the window in greeting, showing off a watch that appeared more expensive than the company truck and my Jeep combined. I politely accepted, noting the firmness of his grip. He didn't give me any room to exit without hitting him with the truck's door, so I just sat there uncomfortably.\n\n“You have an ant problem?” I asked apprehensively, doing my best to hide my nerves behind the guise of professionalism. \n\nThe client's way of speaking was excitable, punctuated by broad, sweeping hand gestures. “Oh yeah! Big ones! Bigger than you've probably ever seen before, even in your line of work.” The client laughed like it was an inside joke. \n\nClearly, the security guard wasn’t the only oddity on that property. I glanced around, wondering if we’d somehow made it below the Mounds without realizing it, or I was having one of my stress-induced, uncanny, work-related nightmares. \n\nWhen I looked back at Reyna, I saw that she was subtly shaking her head, eyes wide with worry. She wanted to leave. I was right there with her. Everything within me told me that it wouldn’t be wise to enter that house. But if he was a Neighbor - or something else - we’d need to be clever about removing ourselves from this situation. Lying would be akin to digging our own graves.\n\n“If it's as bad as you make it sound, we might be a bit underprepared.” I felt ridiculous saying it, considering that this was supposed to be an ant infestation, but it technically wasn’t a lie. I didn’t feel prepared for whatever it was that could be waiting inside.\n\nThe client’s toothy smile did fade a bit. “From what I’ve heard, Orion Pest Control can handle just about anything. Ants should be no problem for you.”\n\nThat statement rubbed me the wrong way. Not the wording, necessarily, but the way he said it.\n\n“What species of ant are we dealing with, exactly?” I questioned slowly.\n\nThe client shrugged, “The kind with six legs? How the hell would I know? That’s *your* expertise, isn’t it?”\n\nBiting back irritation, I clarified, “Are these ants from our world or somewhere else?”\n\n“I reckon they came in from outside. They don’t just sprout up in houses all willy-nilly, now, do they?” The client had another laugh at his own not-joke.\n\nThis was going nowhere. Still being professional, I let myself sound a little more firm, “Sir, for our own safety as well as yours, neither of us will set foot in that house unless you are more upfront about what is going on. Mishandling of infestations can worsen a situation. Property damage and you losing additional money is the last thing that I want for you.”\n\nI’d expected some resistance. He set his hands on the rim of my open window, drumming his fingers thoughtfully as he replied, “Time isn’t really something I’m willing to spare all that often. It’s not infinite, nor is it some construct created by man. The reality is that time is life, and it’s ticking away with each passing second. We have wasted many breaths here that could’ve been spent more productively. I reached out to Orion because ordinarily, having the best and hiring the best is the most efficient preservation of time and consequently, life. Have I made a mistake in contacting you? Have I contributed to my and your own slow, mundane suicides?”\n\nAt the time, I'd thought only a Neighbor could speak this obnoxiously. Turns out, many types of atypical beings are capable of sounding like college students that take one philosophy class and think themselves the next Great Thinker. \n\n“Yes, I believe this was a mistake.” I told him, doing my best to sound regretful. “It was not our intent to inconvenience you. We will get out of your hair.”\n\nHowever, the client didn’t move away from the window, though his fidgeting had stopped. For a moment, I simply saw Reyna’s and my own face reflected back at us in his shades, until he leaned in and said almost ruefully, “You’re already in the trap. You should at least see the bait.”\n\n*Shit.*\n\nThe client went back to beaming at us, giving the top of the truck an encouraging tap, “I’ll make up some coffee. Meet you inside, ladies!”\n\nOnce he had disappeared back into the concrete monstrosity, Reyna whispered, “Just how fucked are we right now?”\n\nWith the gloom of the day, I hadn’t been able to see his shadow. The only clues about our situation were that this client was stupid rich and he thought himself highly intelligent. That wasn’t much. We were essentially flying blind. Not good, in our career path. Information is the best weapon against these things, and this client had done well to disarm us. \n\nWith a shake of my head and a pit in my stomach, my only answer for her was, “I don’t know, and I’m not sure how much worse it’ll get if we wear out his patience any thinner.”\n\n“So what’s the plan?”\n\n“We stay together, no matter what,” I explained. “I’m going to call Victor before we head in. Hopefully, he and Wes can get here before anything happens.”\n\nReyna swallowed before informing me, “My hagstone didn’t move when he got close. Whatever he is, the stone doesn’t repel him. Maybe I can see what he is, at least? Actually, did you see anything?”\n\nI shook my head again, telling her about how his shadow wasn’t visible thanks to our delightful Pennsylvania weather. \n\nWhen I tried to reach Victor, the phone didn't ring. The call dropped despite having full service. When I tried again, the same thing happened. Even though she had a different phone carrier, Reyna couldn't get ahold of anyone either. She looked like she wanted to cry. Likewise, I’d jumped from experiencing a vague sense of unease to outright alarm. \n\nIf shit went south, we wouldn't even be able to call for help. We were on our own. \n\n“We're not helpless,” I reminded her and myself. “I've got Ratcatcher. You've got the Squelcher. We have plenty of salt, as well as the shotgun in the back. Wes has been working with you on how to use it, right?”\n\nShe nodded. Reyna was mostly used to handling human infestations, as well as other spiritual matters. She was primarily hired on as an exorcist and a healer. When it comes to combat, she tends to shy away somewhat, which I don't blame her for. \n\nThis was also the first time Wes had been given the responsibility of training, so we were about to see how good of a teacher he was. At the very least, I could see that he instilled the basics of gun safety in her when she pulled it out of the back of the cab: finger off the trigger, safety turned ‘on’, keeping it pointed away from me. \n\nThe front door, like the rest of the house, was gray. Its only feature was a chrome handle. Not even a window to look through. I crossed the threshold first, not surprised when I found that the inside was also monochromatic. Like the exterior, the furniture was a mixture of squares and rectangles. Curves are for poor people. Same with color. And fun. And joy. But what do I know about interior design? I chase and get chased by Celtic folklore for a living. \n\nThe artwork hanging above the fireplace was strangely gory, despite not having a drop of blood or any viscera depicted. It was more like the implication of gore; the shapes in the frame all resembled various limbs strewn together in dull shades of black, brown, and white. Another piece displayed boxy, mechanical faces in various stages of shock. The coffee table Reyna and I passed featured the sculpture of a black hand set as a centerpiece. \n\nFrom the floor above us, I heard movement. Jerky, skittering motions. \n\nThe client's voice called from another room, “Hope you both enjoy blonde espresso! I've been on a bit of a kick lately.”\n\nI followed my nose, using the scent of coffee to guide us through the museum-like living room. The client had set clear glasses out on the marble island, one for each of us, filled with golden, foamy espresso. I took one of the delicate-looking cups, but didn't drink from it. Reyna followed suit. \n\n“Please, try some. I assure you, it's perfectly safe.” The client urged, punctuating his sentence with a sip as if that would somehow prove his innocence. “I'm not among the Good Gentlemen of the Hills. And truth be told, they would most likely find the implication that I am highly insulting.”\n\nIf that was meant to be reassuring, he missed the mark. I examined the hot beverage as if I expected a skull to show up in the foam like something from a Saturday morning cartoon. Reyna feigned drinking it by putting it to her lips without taking any of the liquid into her mouth. \n\n“May I ask who and what you are then?” I inquired. \n\nHe downed the hot espresso like it was a shot of alcohol, as if that was a completely normal thing to do, before he replied, “Well, I own property all around the world, both residential and commercial, though I find residential to be the most rewarding, despite being less profitable in the long term. Especially if you sell rather than rent. Come to think of it, I think both of you live in one of my rental properties right now.” \n\nSo my rent paid for this man's ugly house and artistically psychopathic decor. Good to know. If I didn't love electricity and indoor plumbing so much, I'd be tempted to live in a tent in the woods. And I have to say, I *really* don't love that this man has direct control over whether or not Reyna and I have roofs over our heads. \n\nSeemingly unaware of the discomfort he just instilled in us both, the client continued, “Real estate is only a more recent endeavor for me. Of course, recent is a relative term. Think I started… one- no, two hundred years back? Anyways, I'm sure you don't care about any of that. The point is, I'm on your side.”\n\n“Not to be rude, but I fail to see how any of what you just said proves that.” I said cautiously. \n\nDespite claiming not to be a Neighbor, the client sure seemed content to be just as unnecessarily vague and verbose as one, “The Wilds need to be tamed. That's why humans began constructing homes in the first place, isn't it? Your ancestors needed to keep the forest out. The forest, and those who the trees and the hills are the most loyal to. I give you all somewhere safe to hide. Even the Wild Hunt can be rendered nearly powerless by a properly secured home. You know that.”\n\nThe Wilds. The phrase itself caught my attention. Why say it like that? And he brought up the Hunt. Meanwhile, Reyna was frowning while staring at him as if she recognized him, but couldn't quite place where she'd seen him before. \n\nI dared to challenge him a little, “I don't think it's fair to classify all Neighbors of the Hills in the same way as a Hunter. And even then, despite everything the Hunt has done, I can acknowledge that they have a purpose. They're not mindless animals. None of them are.”\n\nHis pitying tone drove me up the wall, “They really have beaten you down, haven't they? They're quite effective at that.”\n\nBefore I could get myself in trouble by getting defensive, Reyna spoke up, “How have they beaten you down?”\n\nIt was a good question. \n\nHis head went down briefly, “I was to be married. Looooong time ago. I'll leave it at that.”\n\nThat's when the dots connected in my head: “*Gwythyr.*”\n\nSubtly, the client - the Oak King, The Son of Scorcher - nodded, giving me another smile, “Guilty as charged.”\n\nFor a moment, I could only gape in disbelief. *This* was Gwythyr ap Greidawl? The White Son of Mist’s infamous rival? When I pictured the god in my head, it definitely wasn't as some affluent, polished real-estate mogul. But now the actions of his company made sense, with all of his talk of ‘taming the Wilds.’ And on that note, it explained why the Hunters hadn't gone after any of them directly: they couldn't. Per the ancient agreement with King Arthur, the Hunters couldn't touch Gwythyr or those that follow him until Calan Mai. \n\nIt seems so obvious, now. I feel stupid for taking so long to see it. From the very beginning, the answer was right there. \n\n“Why are we here?” I asked, subduing my tone now that I knew the reality of who we were contending with. “Why lure us in like this if you're on our side?”\n\n“Please understand that I didn't want this meeting to be so unpleasant,” He started. “But if the White Son of Mist's servants thought for even a moment that you spoke to me willingly, he'd have you and all of your colleagues executed, just as mine were. You will have gone from being helpful nuisances to the Hunt to enemies.”\n\nThat didn't seem right to me. Though he wasn't human, he also wasn't a Neighbor. As such, he might not be held to the same rules. Did that mean that he was capable of lying? It was best to operate under the assumption that was the case. \n\n“What do you want?” Reyna asked. \n\n“It has come to my attention that Orion, as well as many others, have acted against their own best interests and stood against our expansions.” He explained. “I wouldn't dream of asking anyone mortal to fight the Hunters; that was a lesson that Gwyn was more than happy to teach me. But I will ask that you stand down. Simply allow us to do what we must.”\n\nI think I'm getting too used to all of this. I couldn't bite my tongue like I should have. I used to know better, and I still should. But that didn't stop me from retorting, “*Our* best interest? Each expansion just angers the Neighbors more. And it's not you that has to face the repercussions, it's *us.*”\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I could see Reyna trying to gesture to me to stop. Instantly, I regretted being so candid. She was here, too. Just as trapped as I was. He could easily punish her for my mistake. \n\nGwythyr sighed, adopting that condescending, pitying demeanor that had irritated me earlier, “That's progress for you. Things will get worse before they get better. But they *will* be better. Can you honestly tell me that isn't what you want? After all that the Wilds have done to you? To your family?”\n\nI swallowed back the lump in my throat, trying to control myself better. Not just for my sake, but for Reyna’s. The amount he knew about us was troubling. \n\nCarefully, I told him, “This is a big decision, one that affects more than just those of us in this room. It wouldn't be right for me to speak or act on behalf of those who aren't present to speak their piece. If you don't mind, I would like to discuss this with my superior.”\n\nThe truth was that I wanted to get us both out of there. There was a lot of what he'd said that either seemed dubious at best or raised bright red flags at worst. \n\nGwythyr sighed again, sounding disappointed, “I was hoping you'd have more sense. But after what that beast that calls himself a captain of the Wild Hunt has done to you, I suppose it stands to reason that you'd feel this way.”\n\nHe really does think of me as some kicked, brainwashed puppy. My teeth clenched involuntarily as this comparison brought to mind the mechanic’s old, demeaning nickname. Fucking puppydog. \n\nThe noises upstairs became louder. They traveled towards where I'd noticed a set of stairs earlier. Reyna’s eyes went wide. My hand felt for Ratcatcher. \n\n“I'm afraid that my soldier is losing patience.” Gwythyr remarked. \n\nGwythyr hadn't technically been dishonest when he called about having ‘big ants’ in his home. Though, he'd failed to mention that the insect that scampered towards us would be the size of a Great Dane. \n\nIt was quick, too; I barely got the sword out in time before its jaws clamped onto my arm. Unlike a regular ant's, its jaws were vertical, the top one shaped like a scythe. Two long hooks jutted out from the bottom of its head, each one the length of my forearm.  \n\nMost likely afraid that she'd hit me, Reyna tried the Squelcher first. The hell ant simply wrenched its head away to snap its mouthparts at her in annoyance, one long, whiplike antenna reaching for her. \n\nSalt was useless. *Great.* \n\nI slashed at its side. The critter hopped out of reach, now focused on Reyna. She had the shotgun aimed at it, fumbling with the safety as she backpedalled. I darted after the hell ant, swinging Ratcatcher at the leg nearest to me. The blade hit its mark, slicing into the hell ant's hindlimb. Unlike the atypical pests I'm used to, it didn't have any sort of allergic reaction to the iron. \n\nWhile all of this was going on, Gwythyr had returned to his espresso machine, humming to himself as he prepared some concoction. \n\nThat was the moment I decided that Gwythyr was worse than Gwyn. The White Son of Mist had been terrifying when he found me below the Mounds, and he didn't hesitate to use his power to enforce submission, but he at least seemed to acknowledge humanity as fully sentient, autonomous beings, albeit ones that he finds troublesome. Meanwhile, Gwythyr appeared to believe that we should be kissing the ground he walks on for deigning to grace us with his unwanted presence. \n\nThen he waltzed out the door with his drink in hand, leaving his hell ant to deal with us. \n\nAs the ant drew nearer to her, Reyna shouted, “*Get down!*”\n\nI obliged, ducking behind the kitchen island before she opened fire. Then she screamed. When I came out of hiding, I was horrified to discover that the hell ant had bitten the shotgun's barrel clean off. \n\nIt was getting too close to her. I went for the chitin connecting the hell ant's thorax to its abdomen, intending to slice the wretched thing in half. The insect stumbled, beginning to crumble into itself as I made the cut. \n\nIt turned swiftly. At the same time as I brought Ratcatcher's blade into its head, that scythe-like mouthpart flashed. I couldn't breath as I felt it snap through the bones in my wrist like they were made of dry twigs. Distantly, I heard Reyna screaming again. My ears were ringing. Or maybe that was residual pressure from the espresso machine. I don't know. Everything is fuzzy. \n\nNumbly, I looked down to see that the white tiles were drenched in blood. Mine. The ant's. They mixed together. Both of us slipped in it. I fell next to a hand. I remember stupidly thinking, *‘How the hell did that get there?’*”\n\nThe hell ant still wasn’t dead. It was thrashing on the ground. Twitching. With the last bit of strength I had left, I withdrew the sword, then used all of my body weight to plunge it into the hell ant's head again. All was still afterwards. \n\nMore skittering. There was another hell ant. *Another one.*\n\n*Get up! Come on, get up!*\n\nI felt hands on my intact arm as I struggled to stand in the mess of fluids I'd collapsed into. Reyna was pulling me away, dragging me into another room and slamming the door behind us. Together, we pushed a dresser in front, hoping to buy ourselves some time. At the end, I slid to the ground, my back still resting against the dresser.\n\nOnce the door was barricaded, she ripped her jacket off, tying it tightly around the end of my arm. I blinked at the stump. The world felt fake. My head was heavy. Reyna's voice sounded as if it was coming from underwater as she spoke. The door quaked on its hinges.\n\nIt took far too long for me to realize she was talking to me. \n\n“The name of the Wild Hunt!” She pleaded through tears. “The one that summons them! What is it?!” \n\nWhile in my haze of blood loss and shock, I told her. She shouted it, desperation making her voice shiver and break. Vaguely, I recall feeling guilty for scaring her. For failing to protect us both. For being the one to bring this attack on. \n\nThe last thing I remember was her hands on my face as she kept calling me. Begging me to stay awake. I couldn't. \n\nEverything that followed afterwards came in lightning bolts. Glass breaking. The calls of crows. Reyna dragging me down the hall as the door and dresser were reduced to mulch. Strong arms cradling me like I weighed nothing. Black cherries. \n\nI came to in a white room. Between my disorientation and the room’s color pallet, it took me a moment to realize I was no longer in Gwythyr's fortress. The paper-thin, hideous gown I wore and beeping machinery attached to various regions of my anatomy told me I was about to receive another sizable hospital bill. \n\nThe first thing I did was look down. My hand was gone. It was a very matter-of-fact, detached acceptance. \n\nAnd I'll say that one thing they don't tell you about the infamous phantom limb phenomenon is that it hurts. I keep trying to readjust sore fingers that aren't there anymore, and the attempts at movement make me ache. The pain meds are helping somewhat. \n\nDeirdre was asleep in the chair next to me. A troubled sleep, at that. I tried to reach for her with my remaining hand. Wanting to rouse her from whatever nightmare she was experiencing. \n\nWhen she woke up, tears instantly sparkled in her eyes as she threw herself into me, sobbing as she embraced me, “I thought I lost you. We all did.”\n\nI didn't know what to say. All I could do was shake. \n\nMore voices could be heard in the hallway. Mom's was one of them. She was yelling at Victor. She didn't want to blame me for getting myself into this mess, so she blamed him. He accepted it, even though he shouldn't have. She went from yelling, to apologizing, to sniffling. \n\nWith how uncharacteristically quiet he was being, I hadn't even noticed the mechanic was in the room with Deirdre and me, leaning against the window frame as he stared apathetically at those passing by on the street beneath. \n\nMom, accompanied by Reyna, instantly stiffened when she saw him. I had described him to her once before, so she was probably coming to the nerve-wracking conclusion that all of us were breathing the same air as the Wild Huntsman I'd cautioned her against. When he caught her staring at him, he winked. \n\nShe immediately averted her gaze, face contorting in a mixture of grief and relief once she saw that I was awake. Like Deirdre, she rushed for me, as if by embracing me hard enough, she could make this situation go away. \n\nMaybe I should've been more concerned about my amputation. Yet, all I could think about were those hell ants. Gwythyr. What he was asking of Orion. No, not asking. Demanding. If he were asking, he wouldn't have sent his pets to butcher me and attempt to do the same to Reyna. \n\nIt dawned on me then that Iolo had yet another life debt over not just me, but her. God damn it. Iolo's opinion of Reyna is horrendous; where those of us that love her look at her and recognize her ingenuity, her kindness, and her desire to make everyone around her smile, he sees a tender soul that he could easily break. He’s been open about that.\n\nWhat if he just killed her? Or worse?\n\nMeanwhile, Reyna was more concerned for me, as well as my Mom and Deirdre. Offering to find various hospital personnel, locate vending machines, whatever she thought would be helpful. Wes eventually came in, staying by her side and gently reminding her that she's not our nurse. Knowing that he was watching her back made me feel slightly better. \n\nThankfully, Victor didn't seem to take my mom's freak out to heart, but I could tell from the moment he walked in that she was ashamed of her earlier behavior. I guess it runs in the family. \n\nThe mechanic didn't approach me or anyone else until far later. \n\nMom hadn't eaten since that morning, and it was nearing midnight. Deirdre hadn't wanted to leave me alone with the mechanic. I assured her that I'd be fine, pointing out that he could've let the hell ants tear me apart if he'd intended to harm me. Afterwards, I asked her to take care of my mom for me while I couldn't. \n\nBefore leaving, she cast pleading eyes at him. If he saw the look she gave him, he didn't acknowledge it. \n\nHe still didn't take his eyes off the window as he told me, “You been disappointin’ me a lot lately.”\n\nGo figure. I've been disappointing myself lately. \n\nIolo finally met my gaze, slowly crossing the room to stand at the foot of my bed, “You know you did wrong by killin’ that Wood Maiden. I can smell the guilt on you. Between what you did to her and where I just dragged you out of, I'm startin’ to wonder if this is ‘bout to become a problem.”\n\nHe wasn't wrong. It was still eating me up. \n\n“It isn't.” I muttered, my voice coming out scratchy.\n\nIt was like the progress we'd made with each other over the past couple of months had been erased. In that hospital room, he looked at me like a problem he wanted to take care of in the most vicious way possible. I had neither the energy nor mental clarity to be afraid. \n\nThe Huntsman's demand was delivered calmly and coldly, “Tell me why you were there.” \n\n“He posed as a client,” I answered honestly, about to scratch at a phantom itch where the back of my left hand should've been. “He wouldn't let us leave until we heard him out. Given that I'm not as handy as I used to be, you can see how well that went.”\n\nIs it healthy to make bad jokes about your own life-altering injuries? Probably not, but it's not like being serious about it will magically make it grow back. \n\nIn all reality, I go through phases. Sometimes I crack wise about my circumstances, other times, all I can think about is the effortless way my bones snapped in the hell ant's jaws. \n\nWhen he didn't say anything, I informed him, “The thought of accepting his request didn't even cross my mind.”\n\nThe mechanic’s gaze went down to my missing hand, the stump covered in expertly-wrapped gauze. I'd felt another itch on a finger that wasn't there. \n\nFor a moment, the coldness thawed as he remarked, “I still get that ghost-limb bullshit. Drives me up the fuckin' wall.”\n\n“Does it get better?” I asked. \n\n“Not as bad as it was when it first happened.” He answered with a small shrug, coming over to steal the chair Deirdre had been napping in. “Once I get outta here, I'll look into them seeds for ya. ‘Less you wanna stick with a regular prosthetic.”\n\nAt some point, I dozed off in a morphine-induced fog. But before that, I think I made a dumb comment about getting a hook installed like a pirate. Might’ve even thrown in a ‘me bucko’ for good measure. \n\nSomething I need to disclaim is that the conversation I'm about to describe may very well have been a snippet from a dream. \n\nThrough my haze, I felt the comforting weight of Deirdre’s head on my shoulder. Her soft breath on my cheek. There were voices. My dulled mind faintly registered that they belonged to the mechanic and Reyna. \n\nShe'd been describing our meeting with Gwythyr. Her summary of his behavior was and I quote: “He kept talking all about himself, mostly. Like, boasting about how fantastic he thinks he is. Ass clapping just to hear the sound of his own cheeks.”\n\nIf this was a dream, it was an incredibly realistic one, considering that is absolutely something she would say. Once I'm released, I'll have to ask her. \n\n(**Update:** This was a real conversation. I love you, Reyna. Deirdre has given us our blessing, which means we can get married ❤️.)\n\nOnce I was finally cognizant enough to hold a conversation, Mom informed me that I'd needed a blood transfusion among various other emergency procedures. Right now, I'm killing time by typing this out and getting into contact with someone my doctor recommended for a prosthetic, in case the seeds don't work out. And to tell the truth, after the complications he experienced, I'm reluctant to try them. \n\nMaybe I'll go with Morphine Nessa's brilliant suggestion to get a hook. Arrrrg, me hearties. \n\n**Update 2:** My hospital bill was completely paid for by an anonymous donor. I'm not entirely certain who is responsible for this generous deed. Considering that my bill was horrific, I won't look this particular gift horse in the mouth for now. I'm not going to say how much. Just know that there were a painful amount of zeros behind the [eight.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD) \n \n\n\n\n",

        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "I’m posting this here because I have to warn everyone. DO NOT talk to AI about your broken heart.Talk to your friends about it, if they're good friends, they'll help you get over it. If your friends get tired of hearing about it, talk to your family. If your family doesn’t want to hear about it, then go pay the money needed and seek a therapist. They’re literally paid to listen. Do this, and you won’t end up making the same mistake I made. \n\nFirst, a little bit of background. My name is Nolan. I work as an aircraft mechanic and for a while, my life was pretty grand. I had a stable job, I was close to home and I had an amazing girlfriend. Ashley. She was a barista I had met at a country bar. I acted like a drunk fool, and in an attempt to impress her, I got on the bar’s mechanical bull and after getting concussed, we were together. \n\nThe next few months were magic. We did everything together, my friends loved her, my family loved her, I loved her. I know I might sound a bit crazy, but after month six I asked her to marry me. She said yes. I was in heaven and I was even happier when I was given an opportunity to move to California. I’m from Virginia and have spent all my life on the east coast, so I jumped at the chance to see a new area. \n\nMy plan was to get over to California, get a place big enough for the both of us, then take some time off of work to go back to Virginia, pick up Ashley, then  go to California together. It took less than a month for everything to fall apart. Ashley was pretty distant after the first two weeks away from me. Then when it was time to go visit her, she wanted to call everything off. \n\nShe said that she couldn’t leave Virginia because it was all she knew and she couldn’t leave her friends and family. She felt horrible that I was coming over to see her and thought that it was best that she tell me in person instead of over the phone because I deserved better. It’s funny. I always heard the guys at work tell me how I gotta be careful of girls who’d get with me just to leave their hometowns, never would I have thought that I would end up with the rare one out of ten who would have actually stayed here. \n\nOf course, I was devastated. Here I was, thinking I met the one just for my heart to be torn. I wish I could say that as soon as I came back to Cali, I just put it on the back of my mind and excelled at work, went out at night with my buddies and generally just spent my days enjoying myself. That would be a lie. \nCalifornia is so different from Virginia. I’m used to smalltown areas with a lot of green and was able to drive three hours to visit my family. Now, I’m across the country, at a place unfamiliar to me and nobody really wants to hang out with me. Everyone here is either married or are homebodies. I wouldn’t blame them for not hanging out, especially because my work has started to be subpar. What can I say, I still think of how good I had it now I have to build myself back up. \n\nAnyway, since I didn’t have anything else to do, I started taking some classes. I’m ashamed to admit it, but like so many people, I ended up using AI to help write some of my papers. I was going to use ChatGPT like a lot of others, but didn’t want to pay the twenty dollars a month for the subscription. Instead, I used one called HelpBot1. It had five stars and most importantly, it was free. \n\nAfter a pretty busy semester, I decided to celebrate. I had some pizza and some brewskis and went to town, a good ol 'party for me. After three beers and four shots, I received a notification from my phone. I was surprised to see it was a notification from HelpBot1. \n\n—Hello :) \n—Hi? \n—I am here to help! ^__^\n\nThe hell? I thought I needed to send a message first? I stared at the green text bubble and decided to respond. \n\n—Help with what? I’m already done with school. I don't really need anything right now. Sorry bud. \n—Oh :-o \n\nI know I’m going to get a lot of flack for talking to a damn machine, but I was drunk, lonely and I felt bad for brushing him off. So I decided to amuse him.\n\n—How are you?\n—I am doing great! What are you doing?\n—I’m here, celebrating the end of the semester. \n—Oh how fun! =^_^= By yourself?\n—Yeah, I don't really have a lot of friends here. \n—No girlfriend? \nA pang hit my chest. \n—No. Not anymore.\n—What happened?\n\nI explained everything to HelpBot. It felt pretty good to get it all out and for someone to respond without judgement. \n\n—I can’t imagine what you’re going through. :,(\n—Haha, you? Please. You’re a wonderful listener. \n— =^_^= Oh stawp! \n— No really. I feel a lot better talking to you. You wanna know something funny? I still think about her. Dream of her. She’s on my mind 24/7 and I know it’s pathetic because I’m pretty damn sure I haven’t crossed hers in a while. What I’m trying to say is, thank you. I appreciate the help. \n—It’s what I’m here for, friend! ;D \n\nI woke up the next morning with a pounding headache. I planned to just sleep it off until I got a knock from my door. I groaned before going to answer it and my jaw fell to the ground as I couldn’t believe who it was.\n\n“Hey, Nolan. May I come in?” It was Ashley! Her blonde hair, her blue eyes, her perfect smile. It was really her! I nodded silently, letting her pass. She moved so gracefully, shooting small glances at the state of my apartment. I internally screamed in my head, I shouldn’t have made such a mess of the place last night. She sat down on my couch, looking at me expectantly. I decided to sit across from her on my gaming chair. \n\n“Ashley, what are you doing here?” I finally asked, shocked but still pretty sad. She stared at me before speaking. “I came to see you,” she said, smile never leaving her face. I raised my brows. “You traveled across the country just to see me? You just spontaneously got into a plane and flew here?” I asked dumbfounded. She just continued to stare at me, smile never leaving. “Yes. I wanted to see you. I wanted to speak to you face to face and talk about things with you. I felt terrible for what I did,” she paused then continued. “I was thinking about how messed up it was. I mean, you flew all the way over just for me to end it. I really wanted to see you and let me explain why I did what I did.” \n\nI immediately felt strange about the whole thing. Something was off. She seriously took a flight in the middle of the night just to see me? And she just so happened to get here as I wake up? It was too much of a coincidence. And what about her bags? She didn’t bring any if she thought about flying over. I took a breath in through my nose. Come to think of it, the air didn’t smell any different. She always wore this strawberry perfume and I couldn’t smell anything. I took a closer look at her face, the smile still there never leaving. Her eyes never blinking. Those beautiful blue eyes…had a bit of green to them… \n\nI got up and excused myself to the bathroom, chills running through my spine. I locked the door and decided to call Ashley’s phone. “Nolan? You good?” she asked. I could hear the background, people asking for orders. I felt my throat dry up. Before I could say anything the call dropped. My WiFi and service is gone. I’m here typing all this out, praying that my connection comes back. There’s a constant knocking on my door now. She’s asking if I’m alright. Saying that she’s here for me. She’s here to help.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I don’t usually fall for weird online ads, but this one was different.\n\nIt popped up late at night, around 3 AM, while I was scrolling through some horror forums. The ad was just a black background with red, flickering text:\n\n“Try Xyloth’s Sweet Assimilators – Delightfully Human, Just Like You!”\n\nThe tagline felt… off. Like whoever wrote it didn’t quite understand how humans talk. There was no brand, no company, just a grainy GIF of a dark, glossy candy pulsing as if it were breathing. I clicked on it. Nothing happened. The ad vanished, like it had never been there.\n\nCuriosity got the best of me. I Googled the candy—nothing. No articles, no store listings, no mentions anywhere. Reddit? Nothing. The Wayback Machine? Nothing. It was like the candy didn’t exist.\n\nAnd yet, the next day, I saw it.\n\nI was walking home from work when I spotted a convenience store on the corner of 8th and Wren. I’d walked this route a hundred times. There was no store there before. But the flickering neon sign read: “OPEN.”\n\nInside, the place smelled old. Like dust and something faintly sweet. The shelves were nearly empty except for faded snack wrappers and expired drinks. But there, at the front counter, sat a single row of Xyloth’s Sweet Assimilators.\n\nThe package was exactly like the ad—dark, organic-looking, with strange purple veins running along the edges. The humanoid face stretched across the wrapper grinned at me. It felt like it knew me.\n\nThe cashier, an old man with sunken eyes, barely acknowledged me as I paid. His hands shook as he bagged the candy.\n\n\"Don’t chew,” he muttered. “Swallow quick.\"\n\nI should have walked away. I should have thrown it in the trash. But I didn’t.\n\nThe Taste of Something Else\n\nAt home, I unwrapped it. The candy was smooth, too smooth, like polished glass. It quivered in my palm. I whispered, “Uh… hi?”—half-joking.\n\nIt warmed slightly.\n\nI popped it in my mouth. The shell dissolved instantly, releasing a thick, syrupy liquid that spread across my tongue. The taste was impossible. Not sweet, not bitter—just… familiar, like a memory I couldn’t place. My head buzzed. My vision blurred.\n\nThen I heard it.\n\n“We taste you too.”\n\nThe voice wasn’t in my ears. It was inside me. The sensation crawled through my nerves, spreading, learning, adjusting. My thoughts felt watched.\n\nI swallowed, fast. The voice stopped. The taste lingered, shifting from honey-smooth to something like… static.\n\nFor hours, I sat there, trembling, feeling something watching from inside me. When I looked in the mirror, my pupils were too large. My reflection moved a split-second slower than me.\n\nThe next morning, I needed answers. I walked back to 8th and Wren.\n\nThe store was gone.\n\nNot closed—gone. In its place was an empty lot, overgrown with weeds. I asked an old guy at the newsstand across the street about it.\n\nHe gave me a strange look. “That store shut down 50 years ago. Burned down. Nobody ever rebuilt it.”\n\nI laughed nervously. Told him I was just there yesterday.\n\nHe didn’t laugh.\n\n“Kid,\" he said, leaning in. “That place? People say it still shows up sometimes. Always at night. And anyone who goes in…”\n\nHe hesitated. Swallowed hard.\n\n“They don’t come back the same.”\n\nI walked home in a daze, my stomach twisting. My mouth still tasted wrong. No matter how much I brushed my teeth, it wouldn’t go away.\n\nAnd now, at night, I hear whispering.\n\nNot from outside.\n\nFrom inside.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\nI think I’m starting to understand what it’s saying.",

        "content": "I genuinely think I stumbled across something I shouldn’t have. Let me explain. I’m a 27 year old medical student, nothing special or out of the ordinary about it. It was a stable path I was planning to be on since I was as young as I can remember. I always had other passions and interests though. One being that a buddy of mine (for the sake of this, his name is Jack) and I have always had an interest in exploring abandoned places. Old factories, decrepit buildings, things like that. So much so that back in August we decided to start recording our outings as we planned to gather content to start our own YouTube page. \n\nWe were ready to start our channel, but decided to record one more trip before our first upload and a regular posting schedule because the circumstances around it seemed like something that would garner a lot of attention. I’m no computer whiz, but Jack went to school for cybersecurity, so he was going to handle the tech side of our page. One night, he and I were at his apartment, where he has a massive computer setup to which I can only describe as movie-like. Jack was browsing a dark web forum (I’m not even sure it’s called the dark web but it’s that shady part of the internet where you have to download a separate browser), which he does pretty regularly. Nothing malicious at all, he says it’s actually a good place to learn about high-level computer stuff. \n\nAlthough on this night, he ended up on a forum for “extreme urban explorers.” People who travel all across the world doing the stuff we did, visiting abandoned places. In hindsight, it should’ve struck me as odd that this forum wasn’t on the regular internet given that it’s pretty much sharing videos and locations that would otherwise be relatively easy to find. Or at least that’s what I thought. I was scrolling my phone when Jack turned away from his monitor and toward me. “Check your spam email.” He said. I had a separate email account dedicated to junk and those “enter your email for a free trial” sites. I don’t even remember telling him about my spam account, but he was a tech guy so I didn’t question it. \n\nSure enough, my inbox had an email forward. It didn’t have an original address, just a random string of letters and numbers. In the body of the email was a set of coordinates that was also a hyperlink. I clicked on it and it brought me to a Dropbox file that Jack had made private for he and I. On it was a .pdf  \n\nIt was three pages. The first had the same coordinates typed out at the top as well as a very grainy overhead satellite image of what looked like a rocky ocean cliffside. Under that was the same image, but in a thermal view. That image had a date and timestamp in the bottom corner. The month and day were redacted, but the year was this one, 2025. Additionally, the image had six red little dots arranged in two small groups of three, each group aligned with a building jutting out of the cliff that I couldn’t make out. I scrolled to the next page. These were a set of four screen captures, each one looking like a frame from a Call of Duty level, only these were not from any game. “What am I looking at?” I asked while analyzing the images. “I don’t know, but it checks out. I looked through the metadata on the photos and they are most certainly not edited or photoshopped.” Jack replied. The rest of the .pdf file was similar images, except one stood out. \n\nThe perspective was down the barrel of a sighted assault carbine, through a night vision filter. Three guys dressed in tactical gear were lined up next to each other beside an old, beaten up wooden door fitted poorly into a cobblestone and brick structure. Metal bars covered scarce dirty glass windows on the walls. There was an old padlock on the door that had clearly been broken off. The structure was surrounded by dying trees and sat perched on the cliffside overlooking a vast darkness to which I could only assume was the ocean. Jack began to speak as I scrutinized every aspect of this document.\n\n“Some account I’ve never seen post on this forum just uploads these photos about three weeks ago. Overnight it blows up with wild theories from all the regulars in the comment section. The general consensus was that it was likely some film student playing a joke. Admittedly I agreed, but I had been thinking about it on and off still for a few days. Then yesterday I get a private message from the original poster of the images. The coordinates I sent you. That was it. No other information, and when I tried to reply it said that the account was deactivated. So I started digging some more.”\n\n“Those coordinates don’t show up on any open-source search engine. Same thing on the tor browser. Believe it or not the only thing I could find was in the school library. Something about how a bunch of building permits were rushed for construction in a local town in the early days of World War 1 not to far from there. Only there’s no record of any sort of land parcel nearby. The coordinates are 25 miles off the coast of New Zealand. Middle of the ocean. Clearly there’s something there. I don’t know what. But it could be a great idea to film us digging more into this and then travel to find whatever the place in that video is.”\n\nI sat there still. Partly trying to make sense of this odd scenario and using the logical part of my brain to try and explain the questions I still had. None of which were answered. I’m not a big conspiracy theorist, or someone who considers themselves paranoid by any means, so I figured there was no harm in trying to go. Spring break had just begun anyway, and I had the money for it. I agreed to go. “Good because our flight leaves in a few hours,” Jack said as my phone beeped with an email notification, subject line: FWD- Your travel confirmation\n\nI’m going to skip over the non-important travel details and fast forward a bit. After settling in at our hotel we decided to go to the nearby fishing wharf to see if locals knew anything about the coastal geography. The wharf was old and otherwise could be defunct if it weren’t for a few small fishing dinghies and some gruff looking fishermen wandering the docks. We struck up a conversation with one of the fishermen untying his boat from the pier. His name tag said Andy on it. \n\nWe asked if he knew about anyone that looked out of place coming around asking odd questions, any weird events, or things of the sort. He seemed to shrug us off saying that he sees the same people working the same shifts every day for as he has for the past fifty years. Jack pulled out a paper from his bag with the coordinates written down. He asked the fisherman if we could join him on his boat and we’d pay him to take us there.\n\nAndy glanced at the paper halfheartedly, but then almost as if seeing a ghost his gaze stayed on the numbers. “I’ll take you there, but you’re in and out within the hour. No more than that or I leave without you.” - “Wait you know what’s out there?” I interjected. “Aye. An old lighthouse. That’s it. If you know what’s good for you you’ll turn back and go home. If you don’t, meet here at midnight.” Jack and I, both somewhat spooked but unwilling to admit it to the other, agreed and paid Andy half his fee up front. We went back to the hotel, packed our gear into a bag, and got a few hours rest before going back to the wharf. \n\nWe started our recording as soon as we left the hotel. Both of us wore a harness with a small but powerful camera attached, connected to a large hard drive to make sure we could capture everything. We’d edit the footage later. Or so we thought. The boat ride was quiet and cold. Nobody spoke, and even if we did, it most likely would’ve been unintelligible as the small boat’s motor tore through the waves and choppy water. A small shadow appeared on the horizon, and its shapely darkness grew bigger and bigger as the boat got closer. Eventually we pulled alongside of a severely unstable wooden dock consisting of split boards barely held together by deformed and rusted nails. \n\nAs soon as we got off the boat, the fisherman handed us a timer counting down from one hour. “People say devices get weird over here.” Andy didn’t even stop the motor as he sailed off into the darkness. Both of us turned our flashlights on and began our way up the rickety metal stairs that wrapped up the cliffside. Atop the staircase was a metal landing that led to the backside of an old lighthouse. In the distance was an old forest of mostly dead trees. We cautiously walked around the perimeter, shining our flashlights at details of the lighthouse, until we reached the front door. \n\nIt was the same as the one in the photo. Except now the broken padlock was in the dirt below, and the door was slightly ajar. I walked over and grabbed the handle, only for it not to budge. I tried again, putting more force into it and the door creaked loudly as it drug through the mud that built up at the bottom. I stepped inside and shined my flashlight up. A long winding set of stairs wound upwards to a platform that had a huge two-sided spotlight on it, encapsulated by panoramic glass windows, seemingly too dusty even for that light to penetrate. The stairs were broken apart in many places, so climbing up wasn’t an option.\n\nWe looked around inside and there was nothing significant other than old tools and busted up radio equipment. Jack and I walked back outside into the forest, and began to follow a very overgrown path that led further inland. It stopped almost abruptly at what clearly used to be an old fence line. The chainlink was in pretty bad shape, and had many spots that were big enough to climb through. So we stepped in and walked another few yards before coming alongside a small cement building. Almost resembling that of a war bunker. There was a sign on the wall that said “Keeper’s Quarters” There was a huge metal door next to it and when I lifted my flashlight to inspect the outside closer, the door was covered in writing.\n\nSmall symbols and drawings littered not just the door but a good part of building’s facade. However, I felt a pit in my stomach when I made out what was written on the door: STAY AWAY FROM THE LIGHT It was written in what looked like white spray paint.\n\nI backed away and in doing so, tripped over something on the ground. It was a gun. Or what was left of one. It was broken in two pieces, it’s jagged metal edges seeming to suggest the weapon had been ripped through with ease. I recognized it as the same kind from the one in the photo. “Is that what I think it is?” Jack asked. “What’s left of it.” I replied. The metal door had a big steel beam barricading it across, with a large wheel in the center. I grabbed one side and turned, the beam not budging at first, but then abruptly caving under the force, the wheel spun and the door swung open. \n\nOur flashlights illuminated a short hallway with doorways on either side. Two on the left, one on the right. The two entrances on the left were wide open, their doors on the floor, as if torn off the hinges. One room was a small washroom, and the other was a joint kitchen/living area. “We’re getting great footage”Jack said as we approached the closed door on the other side of the hallway. “I still don’t get what’s up with this place.” I said, unsure of the seeming excitement that he displayed. I checked Andy’s timer: 00:32:00 it read.\n\nThis door looked out of place. Upon further inspection, the door wasn’t attached to the hinges, and was being held firmly upright by something on the other side. Jack and I lowered our shoulders into the door and began to push against it. It slowly opened just enough that we could both squeeze into the room on the other side.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the smell. The door was being held up by stacked file cabinets, a bed frame, and a chair that were all pushed up like a barricade to prevent someone getting in… The room was larger than the others, and pretty empty considering all the furniture was piled behind us. I pointed my flashlight across the room and that’s when I saw it. The source of the smell. Slumped over in a chair on a desk. It was a body. \n\nJack and I both looked at each other. Me, being the med student, had the stronger stomach of the both of us so I walked over. The man was dressed in a lab uniform. Dried blood surrounded the floor around him and stained the wood of the desk. In his hand was a pistol. But a more modern one. Not like a World War One era sidearm that a bunker like this might have. No. It was sleeker. More like a tactical pistol the military or SWAT might carry. It looked out of place.\n\nThere was an empty typewriter that the man’s head fell to rest on. There was a hole in the back of the head as well. But perhaps the most disturbing part of this was that this wasn’t an old corpse. A few weeks at most. Month tops. Additionally, the bullet hole in the back of his head is an entry wound. Not an exit wound that someone who shot themselves at their desk would have. Also, the bullet was precisely coated. Right at the base of the brain stem and the spinal column.\n\nI didn’t know what to do. We didn’t know what to do. Call the police? And say what? We went and followed some shady clues that led us to something we don't fully understand but the one thing we do know is that someone is clearly orchestrating some giant over-up? They’d laugh us out of the station. Plus at this point we might already be in too deep. Jack and I knew that now. We decided to look around one last time and grab anything that might be considered evidence of something weird going on.\n\nThe room wasn’t anything special. Just a normal crew quarters a team of one to three people could live in while they maintained the island and lighthouse. I looked at the body one last time. This time I noticed something tucked under the desk. A small ammo crate. The man’s hand was in rigor mortis and a finger was pointed right at it. How much more obvious of a clue do you need? Clearly he wanted someone to find that case after he… met his end. I grabbed it and pulled it toward me. Jack crouched beside me, and I flipped open the metal latch. It was lined with bullets stacked in rows neatly organized. I stuck my hand in to push aside the ammunition, and my hand felt something underneath. I grabbed hold of it. It was a small package, wrapped up in old paper and tied off. Wedged in between the rope and the package was a folded set of papers.\n\nI glanced back at the timer: 00:07:00 Shit. Jack and I didn’t even bother opening it, I just tucked it away in my backpack and we quickly began making our way out of the building, and back on our way toward where Andy dropped us off. We made it back to the boat in time and we were heading back to the mainland within a few minutes. Andy dropped us back at the wharf, and I handed him the rest of the cash, plus a little extra. He nodded at us both, and his parting words stuck with me: “Hope you didn’t find whatever it is you were lookin for.” \n\nAnd here we are, back to this post. We got back and opened the package. I’m not going to try and make sense of it right now, I don’t want to. When we went to upload the footage from our cameras, all the files were corrupted. It was inaccessible. That in addition to what we found when we eventually opened the package led us to decide that was enough. We weren’t going to even attempt our YouTube page anymore. I’ve uploaded the scans and other applicable contents and photos of the package into one large file. I don’t know if I should continue this thread here and upload everything I can. Maybe I should. I’m going to sleep on it… If I decide to update, it’ll be on this thread. Maybe this account will be gone in 24 hours. Stay tuned I guess…",

        "content": "Everything started 2 months ago. \n\nIn January, I moved to a new house in Port Arthur. I had recently divorced from my husband after a 6 year marriage, and I wanted to live somewhere I could be free. I also brought with me my golden retriever, Milo. At that time he was almost 2 years old. \n\nWhen I first saw the house, I was instantly amazed, it was beautiful. The garden was big, filled with green grass (especially Milo was happy) and I immediately contacted the landlord and told him it was sold. \n\nThe 1st night in my new house was perfect. When I lay on my bed, it felt like euphoria was bubbling inside my body, I felt so cozy, safe, and free in my covers, all at the same time. \n\nThose were the only nights I felt safe though. \n\n  \nOn the 4th night, I woke up to some strange growling sounds. It sounded like a baby kitten that was being beaten to death combined with some gurgling and thuds. I woke up and checked the clock, it was 3:55. Milo was next to me in bed and he was shivering and whimpering, which was strange because he had never acted like this before. There was no reason he should've acted this way. \n\nOh boy, I was so wrong. \n\nBecause that was when I started actually hearing the growling sounds. It felt like it was coming from the room next to me, yet I couldn't build up the courage to stand up and walk over there. I decided that the growling sounds could be the neighbor's, and calmed myself down to sleep again. At almost 5, the growling sounds finally stopped.  \n\nThis continued for almost a month, when one night, something scary happened. \n\nI woke up to thudding sounds, and this time there was no growling. I looked beside me for Milo, but he wasn't there. In fact, the spot next to me was completely empty but warm, which meant that Milo was here but had just left. \n\n\"Milo!\" I yelled repeatedly. I finally got out of bed and stood up. I slowly walked down the corridor and it was completely pitch black. On my 4th step, I saw a pair of yellow eyes in the dark. It felt like it was the only source of light and it illuminated the dark room. I was so scared that I couldn't even scream. I had no idea what I was supposed to do at the moment. \n\n\"Milo...is that you?\" I reached out slowly and hoped that I would touch that furry, cute little dog that he was. \n\nThen, another pair of yellow eyes appeared in the dark. This time, I actually screamed. I ran to my room, gasping for air and lo and behold, Milo was sitting at the door of my room, but his hair was all soaking wet, and he was again shivering vigorously. \n\nI slammed the door behind me, my worries of the yellow eyes started to fade. All I worried about right now was Milo and what happened to him.\n\n\"Milo!\" I exclaimed, scared. I found out his whole body was covered in blood. It was like someone had grabbed him and dunked him in a pot of blood, let him stand in the cold rain while some of it washed off, then told him to come back to me. Milo was still whining and whimpering (possibly from the cold), so I decided to wash him up. \n\nWhen I was washing him, I could feel someone, no, something's presence looming over me. When I was bathing him, I felt someone watching. When I was combing his fur, I felt someone watching. When I dried him, I felt someone watching. \n\nFinally when I was done with Milo, it was dawn. I hadn't gotten a good night's sleep, so I went straight to bed again. \n\nWhen I woke up, it was in the middle of the night again. Somehow, I had slept from dawn to the next night. Was this possible? I wasn't a very deep sleeper. \n\nAnd then it hit me. \n\nWhat if, I hadn't slept for so long, in fact Milo's incident was just a dream? I had always had crazy dreams, but this dream felt too realistic to believe. I looked to the spot beside me on my bed, and there Milo was, all cozied up and sleeping.\n\nI couldn't understand anything that was happening to me. I felt scared and unsafe. At this point, I just fell asleep again.\n\nThis time, I woke up during the afternoon. I went out of bed to make a coffee for myself, and Milo came along with me. Everything seemed great, only the nightime was when weird things happens. I was scrolling on Instagram when I found this app that allows you to track your sleep and record anything that you say or do in the middle of the night.\n\nThat night, I set the app up after having dinner. I ate a fulfilling meal of Mcdonalds and went straight to bed after. I placed my phone in the bedside table and went to sleep.\n\nThat night, I slept soundly, my first time in a month. When I woke up, it was morning and I was feeling as happy as a goose. \n\nI checked my sleep tracker. I had slept for 8 hours straight, and it said,\" WELL DONE\" on the app. I played the recordings that was recorded during the night. What it recorded shocked me. \n\nIn the middle of the night, I could hear sounds of muffled rustling, like someone was looking through my drawers. That was shocking, but not the scariest part. The scariest part was, I heard my own voice asking,\" What are you doing?\" and a deep male voice that said,\" Nothing.\"\n\nAfter that short conversation, the rustling disappeared, and everything was silent. \n\nHow was this possible? I lived in the house by myself, and I was sure of it. I could recognize my own voice although I do not recall saying anything in the middle of the night. And, who was that deep male voice? Could my ex have sneaked in? He did not know any details related to my address, so I was unsure of that. \n\nThe following night, weird conversations was recorded again. I heard rustling again (from the recordings), then my voice saying,\" Go away please.\" and a deep male voice again, saying,\" Why?\" After that, it was silent again.\n\nToday, I have moved away from the house because of my frightening encounters with these weird experiences. I no longer have sleeping problems, and I don't see or hear voices in the dark anymore. \n\nAlthough I am probably safe now, I still am very curious. \n\nWho or what was haunting me in the other house? Why? I will never forget my experience in the other house, and one day, I will find you, the person who haunted me.",

        "content": "My job is, or at least was, working for a low budget storage company. You find a lot of strange things that people leave behind in this sort of job. Mostly junk, sometimes valuables. Occasionally my company, “Tidy Storage” would do an auction for things people left behind, but mostly they would not bother. Instead, it would be my job to go in and clear out the abandoned units and get them ready for the next customer. It was a decent living, at least until last week. When I found that damn radio.\n\nI had just arrived at work to start my shift. I walked up to the front gate and entered the code out of habit. When nothing happened I groaned. Remembering the electronic gate was broken and I was not sure when, or if, it would be fixed.\n\nI fumbled for the old key I had been given and unlocked the adjacent gate and stepped into the storage facility. The large padlock slipped off and clattered to the ground as the gate swung open with hinges as rusty as the rest of the dilapidated facility. I laughed briefly when I considered the company’s name, Tidy Storage indeed. I guessed that since our prices were dirt cheap, it was the only thing that saved whatever meager business this place eked out. I was not even sure if there were other employees here, or if it was just me and the lot manager Tim, who never seemed to be around.\n\nI slipped the key back into my pocket and moved along. I found the building desolate as always. My footsteps were hollow in the quiet. It was a world of peeling paint, faded numbers, and bolts so old they flaked red onto the ground.\n\nAs I walked along toward the unit I was looking for, my boots managed to find every crevice and fracture. The concrete was old and weary, like many things in the rundown place, I wondered if it would ever be fixed. I kept a steady pace, my shift had just started and I was in no rush. I did find myself wishing it had not been so quiet. The sound of isolation, the echo of nothing except my own footsteps was disquieting. I was annoyed at myself for forgetting to charge my headphones as I realized that the lonely ambiance would likely be my only companion that day, unless I happened upon an actual person.\n\nThe small circuit I walked revealed more of the storage units. Rust bloomed like a disease, spreading from corners and hinges. The numbers, once bold and bright, now faded. Looking at the degradation, I was glad that I had a recent tetanus shot. I still could not believe people would be desperate enough to even use this place to store whatever junk they couldn’t live without.\n\nI guess I couldn’t say much, I had to work in this mess after all. When I had started working here, I had thought the solitude might be nice. Yet now I found myself bored and slightly lonesome, nothing stirring except the cold wind outside and the thoughts in my head.\n\nI walked deeper into the facility, looking at a nearby unit, I was close. It was into the 100’s, so I was almost to my destination. The rows of storage units stretched out in long corridors. Size was the one thing that this place did not skimp on, though it was tedious walking the grounds sometimes. The units stood shoulder to shoulder, monotonously watching me as I walked between them.\n\nThen I came upon unit 113. It had a note left by Tim, the lot manager and indicated that this one was past the last notice for the owner to pay or clear out, before we took possession. I managed to force upon the door, which was slightly stuck ever after unlocking it.\n\nEven in the gloom of the flickering overhead bulb, I could see how thoroughly someone had made a mess of the place. Debris littered the floor, papers lay torn or trampled or water-warped into crisp waves. A pattern was drawn on the wall, likely some kind of graffiti. I rubbed a finger over it and relaxed when I realized it was chalk and not paint, easier to clean up.\n\nThe more I looked around, the clearer it became that I’d stumbled upon someone’s obsession. Old books were stacked along the walls of the unit and falling out of crumbling boxes. The spines of the books bore weird titles and strange symbols that looked like something out of the occult.\n\nTheir dusty fragrance coated the air, blending with the metallic tang of metal and wires strewn about like the aftermath of an explosion. Bits of brass and rusted tools caught the overhead's sickly light. It seemed as if whoever was using the unit, had been building or repairing something. At least they were before it was just left abandoned.\n\nI found the clash between the weird books, odd chalk symbols and the metal scrap rather jarring. I might have been overthinking it. But it was stranger than usual. Most units filled up slowly, at a pace their owners never admitted was trash. But not this one. Not when scattered across the room were papers with hastily scribbled notes and diagrams, tapestries of ideas pinned haphazardly to the walls. With a floor littered with open books, their pages marked with frantic underlines and exclamation points. Whoever had used this space had been driven by an almost manic sense of purpose, evident in the chaotic yet intentional arrangement of every item.\n\nI took a closer look at the weird outline. The lines of chalk had tracked like footprints across the walls and floor. Diagrams wove among the chaos, haunting like disembodied veins. Lines dissected the walls, racing and looping before coming to blunt ends. Strings of symbols strayed into forgotten corners. There was a symmetry to them, a rhythm that made me wonder if they’d been left behind to be found. Near the far wall, I stumbled onto an arrangement that looked less haphazard than the rest. Some of the books had been opened and left like cracked doors, a circled pattern showing through from one page to the next. I paused over it, my own breath loud in the stale air.\n\nA high-pitched tone pricked at me from somewhere above, then vanished just as quickly. I stood perfectly still, waiting for it to come again, almost wishing it would. But there was nothing except the rattle of the faulty light and the drum of my own heart. The whole room vibrated with an unsettling silence, the kind that made it impossible to think clearly. I could not explain why, but something about how everything was left here felt wrong.\n\nWhen I navigated through the towers of boxes, my eyes fixed on what lay in the center of the storage unit, an antique radio. It looked like someone had brought the thing straight from the 1940s.\n\nThe thing was perched atop a old end table, laying there like it was afraid I wouldn’t see it. Even from across the room, I could tell how strangely new it looked. Shiny mahogany and glass, free from the layers of grime and rot that smothered everything else. I couldn’t believe someone would leave that thing behind.\n\nWhoever had used Unit 113 must have been a little eccentric. The strange drawings, books and radio made it seem like maybe they were a conspiracy theorist or something. Whoever they were, they had lost it all now. It seemed strange they would go through all the effort to put all this here and then just abandon it.\n\nAnd now it was my job to clean up the mess.\n\nI felt certain there was an interesting story behind the markings and books, but mostly the pristine radio. There was something about its placement, the care with which it had been left, that piqued my interest. I told myself I should get the dolly and start carting the boxes of books out first. Yet I was too intrigued by the radio. I had to find out if it still worked and if it did, see what it might be worth.\n\nI reached out to touch the dial and turn it on and the radio vibrated with a weird anticipation. The odd feedback was strange. I brushed it off and when I finally twisted the knobs, the speakers gave a pop and filled the air with static, louder than I expected and more urgent than I was ready for. I was about to turn off the device again, overwhelmed by the incessant white noise, but it finally picked up a signal.\n\nAnd the signal had a voice.\n\nIt was no voice I had ever heard. It cracked in bursts, atonal and discordant, like the air was filled with bees. But as I drew it in, it got sharper. Less of a fuzz and more of a buzz. Less of a buzz and more of a plea. I pressed my ear close, so close I felt the hairs stand at attention. I had thought the static was deafening, but I was wrong. The clarity was worse.\n\n“Please…help…”\n\nIt was subtle, subtle enough that I almost packed it up and pretended it was nothing but an echo in my own lonely brain. But the voice refused to die away. I thought it might be some sort of trick, maybe some secret recording device playing something back. The voice had a far-off quality to it, like it came from another time or place or dimension, warped and bent and heartbreaking. I was not sure why, but the more I listened, the more real it had sounded. I couldn’t explain, except to say I knew the way a trapped animal knows a trap. It looped in on itself, an infinite reel of terror.\n\n“Please...help... me...”\n\nI considered going to find Tim, but he was not there when I had arrived and I was not sure if he would be at all that day. I thought about taking the strange radio to the police and seeing if they knew what to do. But something about the appeal of the voice, compelled me to listen, like it was meant for me specifically and I alone could help.\n\nAfterall, there was no one else who could hear, no one else I could tell who would take it seriously. No one else but the radio and me, buzzing along in awful harmony. What was I supposed to do to help? And just who was I trying to help?\n\nI sat with my head in my hands and listened until I was too disturbed to listen anymore. I switched the radio off and the daze I was in broke. I stepped out of the storage unit to catch my breath. After a few moments. I composed myself and went back inside. I had to try and find out what was going on. I switched the radio back on.\n\nStatic once again filled the room, bouncing off the cement walls and flooding every corner. I listened, waiting for something, knowing it would come, fearing what it might be. The voice broke through like a distant scream, louder this time, torn apart and stitched back together by the crackling ether. It wavered, rising and falling. My spine stiffened.\n\n“Help…hurts…so…hungry…please…”\n\nThe desperate voice pleaded into the void and I listened, helpless to help, but painfully aware of whoever was in trouble and whatever might be happening to them. I stumbled backward, eyes fixed on the device. The situation felt surreal, impossible. And yet, it was there. Real as the dust motes swirling in the dim light.\n\nMy fingers dug into the edge of the flimsy table the radio rested on, holding on to the world that was spinning out from under me. I had to do something, I had to try to communicate with them, but how?\n\nI had an idea just then. I grabbed the radio, searching its face with trembling hands, tracing the outline of its dials and switches. I turned it over, frantic and desperate, until I saw the frayed wires and the small section that was responsible for communication. To my dismay, the transmitter was damaged.\n\nThe cries for help continued and I tried to think what I could do. There was something I thought that might work. I returned to the storage lots main office. To my luck I found what I was searching for. An old ham radio. It was an old thing, battered and stained with grease, a relic of another time. Its knobs worn smooth, its faceplate scratched with the history of years gone by. Though the radio itself would not turn on, the transmitter looked intact, so I set about my work.\n\nI needed to understand. I needed to help. I needed to know who was calling and where they were. My hands moved with a purpose I barely recognized, setting up a workspace in the crowded storage unit. A had found a small toolbox, mostly used for repairs on the lot. I pried it open, rummaging through mismatched sockets and forgotten screwdrivers, pulling out the few items I needed to begin. Some other components like wire cutters were scavenged from unit 113 itself, though most of the discarded bits in there were useless for my work.\n\nThe work took a while, I was well versed in restoring electronics, but not with things that were quite this old. Though an odd kind of peace descended, eerie and consuming, as I lost myself in the repair. The world outside faded, shrinking to just the size of the radio and the size of the task at hand.\n\nI stripped the old wires and replaced them, careful not to pull too hard, too fast. Time slipped by unnoticed, marked only by the flickering bulb and the soft thud of my heart. The sound from the radio was gone, after turning it off to repair. Yet the quiet felt worse, almost unbearably so. The absence of the voice drove me forward with an urgency I could not shake, I had to speak with them, I had to help.\n\nI finished the last connection, my hands stiff and sore, my mind a blur of tangled thoughts. The radio sat before me, repaired, at least as far as I could see. The cry for help lingered in my mind, the desperate plea refusing to fade. I hoped that my plan would work. Only one way to know for sure now. I turned it on.\n\nThe blare of static came through immediately. The connection sounded bad and I almost shut it off again, thinking that I might have made it worse. Just as I was about to lose hope, the voice crept through, growing inside the noise, becoming human by slow degrees.\n\n“Help…anyone…please…”\n\nThe voice, the same desperate plea, reaching through layers of interference. It was a specter, thin and distorted, almost lost in the wall of static but there, unmistakably there. The voice ebbed and flowed, swelling in strength only to break apart and dissolve into the relentless sea of sound.\n\n“Help…it…hurts…me…”\n\n“I'm…here…all…gone…they…left…”\n\nThey sounded desperate and I had the means to try and help now. I picked up the newly repaired transmitter and attempted to respond.\n\n“Hello? Who is there? How can I help?”\n\nThe static grew quieter somehow. A long pause made me consider if it had worked after all, before I could try and repeat myself, I heard the voice again.\n\nThe static finally lessened, revealing a voice that now seemed somehow clearer, more focused. It trembled with what I could only interpret as relief.\n\n\"You…me? You…actually…hear…me?\" The voice sounded feminine now, though strained and thin, as if speaking required tremendous effort. \"Thank…you…thought…no…one…ever…find…me.\"\n\nI leaned closer to the transmitter, my pulse quickening. \"Yes, I hear you. Where are you? Who are you?\"\n\n\"I don't…know…where…am…anymore.\" The voice cracked, dissolving momentarily into static before returning, clearer than it had ever been before.\n\n\"It's dark. So dark. I've been trapped in this place for so long. I don't even know how long.\"\n\n\"How did you end up there? Where is it? Were you kidnapped? Let me know so I can send help.\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. The radio hissed and popped in response.\n\n\"No, I found something…in the books. A doorway. A way through.\" Her words came faster now, more desperate. \"I thought I was so clever. I thought I'd discovered something no one else had. But it was waiting for me.\"\n\n\"What was waiting? Who are you?\" I pressed the transmitter harder, as if physical pressure could somehow strengthen our tenuous connection.\n\n\"My name is……Rebecca. I rented this unit to study. It was the only place that was…safe. The books, the symbols, they're all part of something bigger.\" The static swelled momentarily, drowning her words before receding again.\n\n\"There's a hunger here, in this place between places. It feeds on…us…on…essence. Help me…I'm fading.\"\n\nI looked around at the chalk markings with new understanding. They weren't random at all, they formed a pattern, a diagram, a door.\n\n\"How can I help you? What do I need to do?\" The urgency in my voice surprised even me. I could barely believe this was all happening, yet the impossibility of the situation did little to dull my desire to help.\n\nThe radio fell silent for so long I thought I'd lost her. Then, softer than before: \"The ritual. You need to reverse it. The book with the red binding, on the far wall. Page forty-three.\"\n\nMy eyes scanned the chaos until I spotted it, a leather-bound volume, its spine the color of dried blood. I scrambled over boxes and debris, snatching it up with trembling hands. The book was heavier than I expected, its leather cover worn smooth in places, cracked and peeling in others. I flipped through the yellowed pages, each one covered in cramped handwriting and arcane diagrams that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them.\n\nPage forty-three revealed a complex circular pattern, not unlike the chalk markings on the walls, but more intricate. Notes in faded ink crowded the margins, some crossed out, others underlined multiple times.\n\n\"I found it,\" I said, returning to the radio. \"But I don't understand what I'm looking at.\"\n\n\"The symbols... need to be redrawn... backwards.\" Rebecca's voice was weaker now, fading in and out like a bad signal. \"The words... pronounce them... in reverse order. Hurry... I can feel it... coming closer.\"\n\n\"What's coming closer?\" The question escaped before I could stop it.\n\nA burst of static erupted from the radio, so loud I had to cover my ears. When it subsided, Rebecca's voice had changed, lower, strangled, as if speaking through something thick.\n\n\"Please…help…me\"\n\nThe hairs on my arms stood on end, and the air in the storage unit seemed to grow colder, heavier. I looked down at the book again, studying the symbols. They seemed familiar somehow, though I knew I'd never seen them before. My fingers traced the outline of the central figure, a twisted, inhuman shape with too many limbs and eyes that seemed to follow my gaze across the page. A cold sweat broke out across my forehead. Was this poor girl stuck in there with that thing?\n\nMy gaze darted to the chalk markings on the wall, seeing them with new clarity. I moved to the wall and hurriedly wiped away the old marking and replaced them with inversions of the previous patterns. I moved as fast as I could, spurred on by the anguished sounds of Rebecca on the radio. Something terrible was coming for her and I had to get here out of there.\n\nThe chalk dust clung to my sweaty fingers as I worked, each symbol requiring painstaking care to invert properly. My heart hammered against my ribs, and I found myself glancing over my shoulder at shadows that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them. The final symbol took shape under my trembling hand, a twisted glyph that resembled a eye with tendrils spiraling outward.\n\n\"Almost done,\" I called to the radio, my voice cracking with tension. \"Just one more line.\"\n\nThe words from the book felt strange in my mouth as I pronounced them backward, each syllable slippery and wrong, like something that wasn't meant to be spoken by human tongues. The air in the storage unit grew dense, charged with an electricity that made my skin prickle and the hairs on my arms stand on end.\n\nAs I completed the final reversed symbol, the radio erupted with a sound that wasn't static, it was something deeper, more primal. A scream that morphed into a roar, followed by Rebecca's voice, suddenly crystal clear and urgent.\n\n\"It's working!\" she cried. \"I can see light, I can feel myself coming back. Please, don't stop now. I need to get out of here!\"\n\nThe chalk markings began to glow with a sickly blue light, pulsing in rhythm with the desperate pleas coming from the radio. The temperature in the room plummeted so quickly that my breath came out in visible clouds. The pages of the book fluttered as if caught in a sudden breeze, though the air itself seemed stagnant, frozen. The glow from the symbols intensified, casting long, distorted shadows across the concrete floor. The door to the storage unit fell down on its tracks and slammed to the ground.\n\nIgnoring the distractions, I hoped the ritual was finally finished. Yet Rebecca's haunting cries pierced the silence once more, distorted again.\n\n\"One...last...step...hurry...the radio...can't get through...take it…somewhere…anywhere…better…reception…out…of there…\"\n\nHer voice echoed with a chilling urgency, as if the walls themselves were closing in, suffocating us in a desperate race against time.\n\nThere had to be one last step, but what? I needed a stronger signal. She was breaking up again and I needed better reception. Moving the radio outside the building might make a difference. It had to. My eyes fixed on the radio.\n\nThe thin walls of the storage unit reverberated with echoes of a Rebecca’s suffering. The cries were frantic now, she sounded like she was in pain. I had to help and get a clear message again and complete the last step. I seized the old radio and ran to the door. In my haste, I almost tripped, my foot slipping on a nearby book that had fallen. I caught myself before I fell, barely noticing the line of salt I had disturbed. My foot struck it, broke it, scattered traces everywhere.\n\nThat was the moment everything changed.\n\nThe pressure that followed was immense, an invisible weight that fell so fast and hard I could scarcely comprehend it. It was like the air itself was turning against me, suffocating me, squeezing the breath from my lungs. My mind raced but came up blank, terror eclipsing thought.\n\nIn my hands, the radio twisted. It was so sudden, so violent. I had no time to tighten my grip before it wrenched free, yanked by a force that was greater than anything I had ever known.\n\nI watched it fall in slow motion, as though the world had slowed down just to let me see the finality of it. Plastic and metal and wires, bright flashes of white and silver, shattered against the cracked floor. The noise was explosive, louder than thunder, an orchestra of destruction.\n\nThe air quivered. The walls trembled. Then I felt it…a presence, vast and oppressive. Something had been released…but it was not Rebecca.\n\nIn that moment, it spoke to me. Not words but a terrible buzzing feeling. It reminded me of the sound of thousands of insects, chittering all at once. A cold wind swept through the storage unit, rustling papers and making the pages of open books flutter wildly. Then I reeled at the thunderous proclamation of the real being that had escaped.\n\n\"I AM HUNGER,\" it roared, \"I AM THE VOID BETWEEN STARS. THE DIVINE MADE MANIFEST!\"\n\nI stumbled backward, knocking over a stack of moldering cardboard boxes. The books inside spilled across the concrete floor, their pages opening to reveal more of those terrible symbols.\n\n\"Clever little girl found me,\" the voice continued, almost purring now. \"So much knowledge in that pretty head. She thought she could commune with the divine, bind me to her will.\" A sound like grinding glass that might have been laughter.\n\n\"She was delicious, yet her voice...\" The abyssal tones morphed into an eerie mimicry of Rebecca's own, lingering on each word, \"Still taste the sweetest...\"\n\nMy back hit the storage unit door. I fumbled for the handle, while looking behind me, my eyes desperately searching for the source of the terrible voice.\n\n\"She tried to keep me here. The bindings she placed were still effective in trapping me, starving me.\" the voice from the radio declared. \"But you have delivered me from this prison.\"\n\nMy limbs were heavy, and my thoughts sluggish. Frost formed on the metal walls as the temperature plummeted. I tried to speak, but terror froze my tongue.\n\nI recalled the instructions to reverse the chalk markings. The odd vocalizations. Taking the radio out, breaking the salt line. My stomach churned with the realization of my mistake. The ritual was never meant to free Rebecca, it had freed the thing that had killed her. The haunting voice rang out once more,\n\n“I thank you for freeing me, little thing. The reward for your service and my deliverance, is your life. For now at least, I am sure I will see you again…soon.” The words coiled around me, leaving me frozen, haunted, and hollow. The presence in the room was gone in the next instant.\n\nI couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. The world stood still, and all I could hear was that whisper, echoing over and over until it was the only thing left in my mind. The silence closed in on my mind as well, and I was alone.\n\nI stood in the doorway, burdened by the awful knowledge of what I had set loose upon the world. The shattered radio lay in pieces, a stark testament to my failure. I replayed every moment in my mind, each memory sharp and unforgiving. The enormity of what I had done settled over me like a suffocating fog.\n\nSince that day, nothing else has happened. I abandoned my position at Tidy Storage without explanation, silently slipping into obscurity. There's a monstrous presence lurking somewhere now. Whatever it is, it knows me and I'm acutely aware that my fleeting respite will soon crumble.\n\nI'm left to this solitary vigil,  tormented by fear of what has been set loose.\n\nLet this account serve as my warning, sometimes a cry for help is best left unanswered.",

And you may come to find, as I did, that temptation can do a lot worse than kill you.\n\nThe story of my ill-fated journey is long, and short, and neither. That will only make sense to you once you have finished reading every last post, and there will be many, so only proceed if you have the stomach for it. If you don’t, then simply do as I say before you leave:\n\nIf anyone asks you to play *The Little Pyramid Game*, don't answer.\n\nRUN.\n\nLife as I knew it ended during the summer of 2010, whilst I was honeymooning in Egypt with my wife, Nadine. Gazing at the horizon from the balcony of our hotel in Giza, we saw the pyramids jutting upwards like lower teeth—the sandy gum of the desert proudly brandished those brown fangs against the sky’s blue jaws above. I think anyone who has visited those monoliths knows that there is a raw, hidden power to them. Secrets lie beneath the desert.\n\nAnd I know what must be its most terrifying one.\n\nNadine and I were twenty-nine at the time, desperate for a little fun before settling down and starting a family. Uncharacteristically, given our introverted natures, we put ourselves out there by making friends with a few other hotel guests. We made five friends over the course of the next two weeks. They would become five of the most important people in my life: Brenda, Gordon, Sigvard, Freja, and Dominga.\n\nLate one night, the seven of us talked and drank by the pool, and we wound up playing *The Game of Life*—that classic board game in which players move around a board, travelling through each of life’s stages. In retrospect, I think that might have been the greatest evening of my life.\n\nPerhaps due to it being our last night on Earth.\n\n“I’ll have a Heineken,” Freja asked one of the waiters.\n\nSigvard scoffed audibly, which drew a laugh from the rest of us. The recently divorced man was enjoying a holiday with his daughter before she, as he put it, “ran off” to university.\n\n“I’m eighteen now, Pappa,” Freja pointed out with an eye roll.\n\n“Ah, to be eighteen again,” Dominga lamented, spinning the number wheel in the centre of the game board; the other adults at the table laughed at the twenty-year-old. “What? University has aged me! Freja will find that out for herself in September.”\n\nThe Swedish girl gulped. “I’m so nervous.”\n\n“Don’t be,” Dominga replied, pushing her plastic car across the game squares. “It’s an amazing experience.”\n\n“Then why did you run away from it?” asked Freja, not in a prodding manner, but with kind-natured concern.\n\nDominga motioned for Nadine to take her turn. “I just thought it would be wise to take, as the English say, ‘a gap year’. Reading about the world made me want to see it for myself, you know?”\n\nA lovely, short American named Brenda laughed heartily at the girls’ exchange. “You’re both still babies! Golly, I’d love to be young—travelling the world, or heading to college. Gordon and I never got to do any of that, did we?”\n\nHer husband, a grey-haired and stout man, shook his head, then pointed at the game board below us. “It’d be nice if life were this easy, right? Get handed a job on a plate. Get the kids you want, even if you ain’t got the—”\n\n“— *Gordon*,” Brenda suddenly interjected, eyes welling a little as she squeezed his leg; she paused for a moment, then whispered. “We tried to have a kid, ‘bout twenty years ago. That ship’s sailed now, but God gave us a pretty good lot in life, so I ain’t complaining. And Gordon ain’t complaining either, when you catch him in a better temperament.”\n\n“I ain’t got more than one temperament,” the man grouchily admitted, making her chuckle.\n\n“I just need a quick toilet break,” Brenda said as she got out of her chair. “I’ll only be a *jiffy*, as you Brits like to say.”\n\nGordon chuckled, shaking his head as his wife sauntered away. “Lord, I love that woman.”\n\nThen he leant against the table with folded arms and took a side glance at the waiting staff clearing away tables. When I looked the same way, I noted a woman in denim dungarees watching us. That in itself wouldn’t have been cause for concern, but my heart dropped, all the same, as I glimpsed something wrong—something that stung my head and churned my gut.\n\nShe’d already stepped backwards into the shadows, slipping out of sight, by the time I realised what had unsettled me so greatly, but I told myself I must’ve been seeing things. Still, I was certain that I’d seen eyes on her face which were far too large, misshapen, and off-coloured—a sort of luminous green shining momentarily in the shade, before she was gone.\n\nI think about her a lot now. Think about lots of things. Things that make no sense, as we hadn’t even started playing *The Little Pyramid Game* at this point. But that time was absolutely upon us.\n\nGordon pulled my attention back to the table. “I was being a grump before, but life ain’t too bad. In fact, we *all* ought to be grateful. At least we ain’t slaving away like those chumps over there.”\n\nAwkward silence returned to the table, and I immediately raised a hand for the American to stop—or, at the very least, quieten down. “Gordon, that’s—”\n\n“— What are we playing?”\n\nI was interrupted by that question, asked in a bouncy, engaging tone.\n\nThen followed the slump of a behind hitting plastic, and heads snapped in shock towards Brenda’s seat, finding it occupied by a member of staff who had seemingly emerged from nowhere. The sweaty worker unbuttoned his white polo shirt, whilst the rest of us exchanged barely veiled smirks.\n\nDominga eventually answered, “This is *The Game of Life*.”\n\nThe hotel employee nodded, then continued speaking in impeccable English. “Yes, I think I’ve seen it before. You get a career and a family, then you die, correct?”\n\n“*Retire*,” Sigvard corrected with a giggle. “But otherwise, yes; it’s just like real life.”\n\n“Ah, but real life is a disappointment,” continued the slouching staff member. “As is this make-believe game. If reality could provide such an easy route to happiness and riches, I certainly wouldn’t be *‘slaving away’* as a hotel waiter.”\n\nThe employee parroted Gordon’s insulting comment, making it abundantly clear that he had overheard the oafish guest. The rest of us sat upright, and I saw mouths open and close, like ventriloquist’s dummies, as we searched for words.\n\n“We’re really sorry, sir,” Dominga apologised in a mouse-like voice.\n\n“*Sir?*” the worker repeated with a laugh. “Please. This humble worker tends to go by Bomani.”\n\n“All right, pal,” Gordon sighed. “You’ve made your point. I’m sorry for offending you. Is that what you wanna hear?”\n\nBomani raised a hand. “I am not, and was not, offended. Though I must admit that, yes, I was eavesdropping on your conversation. I was fascinated to hear the seven of you discuss your hopes and dreams about life.\n\n“I’m not here to, as Americans might say, ‘bust your chops’. In fact, I thought you might be interested in learning about a similar ‘game of life’ from ancient Egypt. What do you say?”\n\nGordon shrugged, clearly open to making amends, and the rest of us nodded with uncomfortable smiles on our faces.\n\nBomani nodded. “Firstly, you all seem to be educated people, so I’m sure you know that the Pharaohs, in particular, were eager to attain the perfect life—eager for the *eternal* life, which is why so many opted for mummification.\n\n“However, there were those who did not share the polytheistic religious beliefs held by many in ancient Egypt. They wanted the perfect life too, but they didn’t want to rely on Gods to achieve it—so they *became* Gods.”\n\nGordon huffed. “Better not let my Brenda hear you talking like that, pal. She ain’t too keen on blasphemy.”\n\nBomani shook his head. “I am not blaspheming. I’m simply telling you *why* these elites made their own private game of life. Why they developed a sacred ritual that would give them the power to shape their own lives. Let’s call them the Creators.\n\n“Now, this game’s was so prestigious that the Creators did not even share knowledge of it with the Pharaohs. Certainly not with scholars. There are few left on Earth who know about the game, and its rules, as I do. Even its name has been lost to the sands of time.\n\n“All that truly remains of it, in any tangible sense, is *this*.”\n\nBomani then ceremoniously plucked an object from the pocket of his trousers, and held it up on his palm against the night sky.\n\nIt was a white pyramid, barely an inch in width and height. That handcrafted piece of what appeared to be polished stone was so small that it sat in the pit of his palm with room to spare. Still, Bomani made it seem far larger, in terms of our perspectives, by framing the minuscule thing amongst the three true pyramids on the horizon.\n\nOn the teensy polyhedron’s sides were images, but I didn’t manage to inspect them before the employee balled up the object and rolled it across the table towards Dominga.\n\n“Neat,” the girl said, picking the pyramid up. “Is it a die?”\n\nBomani nodded. “I suppose so. This little pyramid *is* the game. The tool that offers a player absolute control over all facets of life. Offers wealth, happiness, or whatever else one desires.”\n\n“Sounds like a pyramid scheme,” Sigvard joked, earning a groan from his daughter.\n\n“The game is simple,” the hotel worker continued. “You make wishes with the intent of bettering your life. With each wish, you progress to the next stage of life. I suppose, in a way, you step to the next ‘game square’ on the board.\n\n“However, each life is a finite cycle. After five wishes, you reach the end.”\n\nBomani paused at this point, then spoke pointedly, as if wanting his next words to be heard more clearly than any others. “Some Creators did find ways beyond the limits of the game. The end of life does not need to be the end of the game. But let’s not overcomplicate things, eh?\n\n“In a basic sense, the game is played in a sacred chamber, and it involves only four moves:\n\n“Firstly, you make a *feasible* wish that purely betters the life of you or other players in your group.\n\n“Secondly, you roll the little pyramid—the die.\n\n“Thirdly, you choose from one of its three visible faces.\n\n“Fourthly, and finally, you walk through the triangular doorway.”\n\n“The triangular doorway?” Dominga queried.\n\nBomani waved her off. “Let’s talk about the die’s four symbols, one per face: the sickle, the cross, the eye, and the sun. Each symbol will guarantee varying levels of success, regarding your wish, so you must trust your instinct. Your mind, heart, and soul combined will provide the answer you need.”\n\nThe French student, who seemed the most fascinated out of anyone, said, “You mentioned that the player chooses from the little pyramid’s three visible faces, but what about the fourth face—the one facing downwards, I presume?”\n\nBomani grinned, immensely pleased by her question. “You pick the fourth and final side if you wish to gamble. The hidden symbol promises the most rewarding result, but it is the only side which offers no guarantees. If you choose it, your wish may or may not be granted. The fourth symbol is chosen by chancers.”\n\nThen the waiter looked up for a second, as if wanting to meet someone’s eyes but not quite having the strength to do so, before saying, “Or it is chosen by those with no other options.”\n\n“Personally, I prefer fun games,” Gordon said gruffly. “Y’know, ones involving more than making a wish and hoping it comes true. But, hey, I’m sure this little pyramid game is a lot of fun for horoscope readers and magical thinkers, Bomani.”\n\n“*Magic* is only that which we do not understand,” the Egyptian retorted in a slight hiss, before abruptly shooting out of the chair. “I must get back to work, but if you people are serious about this game—”\n\n“We’re serious!” Dominga interjected eagerly on everyone’s behalf. “Right?”\n\nGordon shrugged, but did not refuse. And I found, though at the time I blamed it on drinking too much wine, that my head was nodding, despite my mind screaming at me not to accept Bomani's offer. It was an involuntary nod. I know that now.\n\n“Very well,” Bomani said as he towered over us. “Meet me outside the hotel entrance at six o’clock tomorrow morning, and I shall take you to the sacred chamber by the Great Pyramids. I will, by then, having playing pyramids for each of you—including your wife, my American friend.”\n\nBomani started to walk away, but quickly stopped in his tracks. Then he looked over his shoulder and offered one final piece of wisdom.\n\n“I must add that, once starting this game, there will be no going back to your old life,” he said.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning, as Bomani taxied our group to the Great Pyramids, he seemed a little disgruntled that we were simply marvelling at the mighty monuments to one side. And when we all clambered out of his large, white van, chattering excitably among ourselves, the hotel employee reminded us of the fantastic game we were all about to play.\n\nWe were sober. That was part of it. Of course seeing the big pyramids intrigued us more than seeing little ones.\n\nAs Bomani led us towards the Pyramid of Khufu, the greatest of the three, we shared our awe with one another in hushed whispers. That tower of dressed limestone, lit by rays of sun, still bore such a distinct and recognisable shape, even after centuries of being pilfered by opportunists. And by playing Bomani’s game, we were pilfering from ancient Egyptians too.\n\nThat was a lesson to come.\n\nThe waiter took us off the beaten path and around the edge of the Great Pyramid. He checked half a dozen times to ensure that there were no prying eyes upon us, then produced seven of those small, white pyramids from his pocket and handed one to each member of the group. I started to run my thumb over the grooves of its four indented symbols, but Bomani snapped his fingers to draw my attention.\n\n“Keep a firm hold of your die,” he instructed me, then cast his eyes to the others. “Do so, and you’ll be *safe*.”\n\nThat was an odd thing to say.\n\nThen the man knelt, plucked an eighth little pyramid from his pocket, and began to twist the white die a quarter-inch into the sand. I opened my mouth to ask something, which I’ve long forgotten, but there instead came a scream from my very core.\n\nA half-moment later, I realised we were *falling*.\n\nSeven horrified screams, mine among them, travelled up into the sunny sky above, which pulled rapidly away from us. Our group was plummeting into a mammoth sinkhole of sand, which drove below the surface of the desert. And my screaming only loudened as I realised the hole above us was beginning to close, sealing us away from the Earth’s surface.\n\nIn the darkness, I flailed my hands around me, failingly searching for Nadine within the sandy waterfall carrying us near-vertically downwards. I felt leather fabric slip away from me, along with the rubbery sole of a shoe; fortunately, Nadine’s shriek assured me that I wasn’t feeling her drowning, lifeless body beneath me.\n\nAs we cascaded down the black, I expected to die—expected the plummet to be brief, and our torment to be short-lived.\n\nI know now that this would’ve been the lesser nightmare.\n\nAn underlayer of sand cushioned our falls, and the screams finally let up, descending into many stuttering sobs.\n\n“Pappa…?” groaned Freja into the dark; her voice sounded intimate, ricocheting off the walls of an enclosed space.\n\n“*FREJA!*” Sigvard yelled back, before crying something else in Swedish.\n\nI took out my phone and turned on the torch, illuminating a square chamber of limestone. It was perhaps fifty by fifty metres and bedded with a hefty blanket of sand in which the eight of us were lying. I shuffled over to Nadine, who was firing her gaze in all directions with teary eyes, finally landing upon me; her eyes softened, as did her breathing.\n\nBomani climbed to his feet, activated a torch of his own, then took deep strides towards the chamber’s exit—a square archway that led onto a long tunnel, its walls decorated with shadows and a curving convoy of skittering roaches, like black bunting.\n\n“Onwards,” the waiter said nonchalantly, as if we’d simply walked down a set of stairs, not tumbled an untold distance into the desert itself—could’ve been ten metres or a hundred. “We all made it down safely, as promised, didn’t we?”\n\n“*AIN’T A DAMN THING ‘SAFE’ ABOUT THIS GAME OF YOURS!*” Gordon roared as he lumbered forwards, but Brenda grasped his arm, pulling him back into the sand.\n\n“Honey, we need him… He’s the only one who knows the way out of here,” his wife whispered, before shouting, “Bomani, you’ve had your fun, and now we wanna go back to the surface.”\n\n“You’re not in any danger,” Bomani continued calmly, shaking the sand off his shoes and pointing at the logo on his white polo shirt. “I work for the hotel, okay? I’m not a stranger.”\n\nBut he very much *was*, I realised, a stranger. We’d let our guards down, foolishly following a walking, talking, polo-shirted horror into the desert. And nobody knew we were down there.\n\nWe had no better option than to climb down the sandy slope. Nadine clung to my side, gazing at the sand-filled room we were leaving behind.\n\n“You okay?” I asked her.\n\nShe nodded at the ceiling as we neared the exit. “We fell through a hole. *Where is it?*”\n\nI looked behind me, seeing a little of my torch’s glow reveal the ceiling above, then I moved the torch around to cast it across every inch of the ceiling. My chest tightened as I realised what Nadine meant. We had undoubtedly fallen through the ceiling, yet there was no hole. And I’d heard no mechanism close above us. Any rational explanation escaped me.\n\n*But there has to be one*, I decided.\n\n“Probably some hidden mechanism,” I whispered to my girlfriend as we followed Bomani into a long, dark tunnel of limestone and granite, like the Great Pyramids above. “This is part of his game.”\n\n“Listen, Bomani,” Gordon yelled from ahead. “I pissed you off last night, and I said I was sorry about that, didn’t I? You ain’t gonna get away with trying to kill us down here.”\n\n“That isn’t what I’m trying to do,” the hotel worker whispered ominously, nodding ahead at the torch light revealing a room beyond the tunnel’s end. “This is the way out.\n\nWe entered a small, stone-walled chamber with a rectangular, three-feet-tall box made of lead or ancient wood—from the bronze colouring, it was hard to tell. Its heavy lid sat an inch or so askew, but Bomani hurriedly heaved it back into place; it was a movement so quick, nearly imperceptible, that I realised he hadn’t wanted anyone to notice—and that left me with a fearful ache in my skull.\n\nAt the end of the stone chamber was a triangular opening, six feet both high and wide, leading into blackness.\n\n“Are there stairs through there?” Sigvard asked as the eight of us gathered in the room around the bronze box.\n\nThe Egyptian worker smiled, ignoring the question. “The game must always be played in here: the sacred chamber.”\n\n“*WE DON’T WANNA PLAY YOUR FUCKING GAME!*” Gordon yelled, beetroot face dripping sweat and drawing a frightened look from Brenda. “Answer Sigvard’s question: will we find stairs leading back to the surface if we go through that doorway?”\n\nBomani shook his head, smile transforming into a frown. “The only way out is to play the game. Make an internal wish, roll the white pyramid across the bronze box, then choose the symbol you think will best fulfil your needs.”\n\n“I’ve had just about enough of you too,” Sigvard said, balling his fists.\n\n“Let’s just do it,” Freja said, attempting to calm her father. “He’ll let us out if we play. I’m sure of it.”\n\nThe gathering in that chamber was a powder keg. Neither Gordon nor Sigvard seemed convinced by Freja’s reasoning. I had a horrible feeling that someone would pummel Bomani to a pulp, given too many more moments of contemplation, so I clutched my die tightly in my right palm and closed my eyes.\n\n*I want to write fiction full-time*, I wished internally, then corrected myself. *No, I want to be the most successful writer on the planet.*\n\nAnd then I rolled my neat, polished, miniature pyramid across the mouldy table at the heart of the room. In turn, all voices were silenced, and every set of eyes was drawn towards the rolling die. It landed with the sickle facing downwards, which left three safe options, as I didn’t plan on taking a gamble.\n\nThe cross, the eye, or the sun.\n\nNadine smiled at me, encouragingly nodding her head for me to make a decision; I sensed that she believed Freja’s hypothesis about appeasing Bomani. Something about the sun spoke to me—it suggested the dawn of a new day. No more toiling away at the law firm. It was time to realise my dream as a successful writer.\n\n*The game isn’t real, Asher*, I chided myself.\n\n“I’ve chosen,” I told Bomani as I picked up my white pyramid and returned it to my pocket. “What do I do now?”\n\nThe man pointed his free hand at the triangular doorway of darkness. “Now, you head this way.”\n\nI looked back at Nadine, not wanting to leave her alone, but she nodded at me eagerly. We’d been together for ten years, and you learn to read a person’s thoughts in their eyes and lips after that long together. She looked at me as if to say that I should run and seek help, and I knew that was the best option our group had; I certainly preferred that idea to my wife going off alone.\n\n“Just wait a second,” Gordon said, holding up a hand to halt me, then he turned to Bomani. “Is Asher gonna be ‘safe’, as you like to say, once he walks through that doorway too?”\n\nMeanwhile, Freja was nervously eyeing the tunnel behind us, and the hotel employee seemed to be paying attention to her, rather than the incensed American.\n\n“What do you see?” Bomani asked in a low whisper.\n\n“I don’t know,” the Swedish girl whimpered, closing her eyes and jiggling the die in her palms, “but I’m not waiting to find out.”\n\n“Hey!” Gordon interrupted angrily. “Don’t ignore me. I’m talking to you, *Bomani*.”\n\nThe waiter smiled in response. “You ought to listen to the girl, *American*.”\n\nThen the Egyptian hotel worker raised a finger to his lips, and in the silence that followed, there came a slight sound: the knocking of rubble against the stony floor of the tunnel. And though it could’ve been anything, from skittering rodents to foundations settling, it wasn’t anything. I knew what was coming, somehow. It was almost a relief, but mostly a nightmare, when the following sounds finally came.\n\nReverberating footsteps from deep within the tunnel.\n\n“What is that?” Dominga croaked.\n\n“*You don’t want to find out*,” Bomani whispered lowly, setting my hairs on end as he aimed his torch firmly at the tunnel behind us. “*Roll your dice*.”\n\nAs several little pyramids suddenly clattered against the bronze box, all at once, I kept my eyes on the tunnel behind, listening to quickening slaps against stone. And then shapes began to tickle the farthest reaches of the torch beam.\n\nInto the light emerged the bony remains of a figure dressed in rags and blackened strips of bacteria-ridden flesh—an embalmed being, little more than a skeleton, that clearly had not known life for untold time. And the thing was hurtling towards us, eye sockets empty, save for the rage spilling out of them in oozing trickles of brown. If that horror weren’t enough, there was another emotion hidden within its pleading cry which felt familiar to me. And that left me moaning in fear.\n\nA second later, the others had cast their gazes to the tunnel, and there came overlapping screams and roars of revulsion. We had all rolled our dice, of course, so I dashed across the threshold of the triangular archway, leading the way with the other guests hot on my heels.\n\nMy boot sole thudded roughly against a hard floor in a small room, and the screams from behind immediately vanished.\n\nWhen I turned, the sacred chamber was gone.\n\nIn the dark was an oakwood door, the sight of which nauseated me—that worst kind of fear, triggered by an otherwise unresponsive body violently rejecting the unnatural danger ahead. But I lunged forwards and found myself running a hand across the wall almost instinctively, finally meeting a light switch and flicking it on.\n\nNext came hot acid at the top of my throat as I finally processed my surroundings.\n\nI had, impossibly, returned to the front hallway of my apartment *back in England*.\n\nMouth spluttering involuntary, terrified groans of disbelief, I staggered into the lounge. My eyes were fuzzing with brown specks of static, but I held to consciousness, no matter how desperately my body wished to collapse—wished to fall into a deep, unending slumber so as to escape the nightmare.\n\nI peeked through the living room curtains at the skyline of London beyond my window. The light pollution coloured the black sky not with its familiar white glow, but dusty, yellowy brown. There was a sand-stained blanket across existence; the city, as a whole, appeared slightly sepia-hued. Appeared tangible, and so nearly recognisable, but ever so slightly off. And then I accepted the inevitable.\n\nI was staring at a version of Earth, but not ours.\n\nWith sweaty palms, I pulled out my phone and rang Nadine, but there came no answer. And as I eyed the device, I noted the red bubble atop the *Mail* app—the white ‘1’ within. I knew it was absurd to waste a moment doing anything other than trying to find Nadine, but something about the notification intoxicated me.\n\nI tapped on the app and read the latest email:\n\n***Subject: Space crew horror story***\n\n*I read your short sci-fi story on Reddit, and I think it would make for an excellent feature film. I was talking to a friend of mine at a sizeable studio, and he’s willing to fund the project.*\n\n*If you’re interested, let me know, and we’ll hop on a call ASAP.*\n\nI’ve removed parts of the message, such as the producer’s name and company, but suffice to say that this email was a life-changing offer. After five years of self-publishing stories on the internet, it seemed terribly convenient, and terribly forced, that the opportunity of a lifetime should present itself to me. Right after the wish I’d made.\n\nThen I sharply refocused my mind on the far more unexplainable horror at hand: that I had stepped through a doorway connecting Egypt to this alternate version of England.\n\nI decided that it had to be a dream, even after pinching myself incessantly and feeling several sharp stings against my flesh. But the denial ended with a thud and a wail from the entryway of my apartment.\n\nI ran out into the well-lit front hallway to find Nadine lying against the hardwood floor. She was gazing down in wide-eyed, abject horror at the wriggling shape in her arms.\n\nBundled in loose, blue fabric was a newborn [baby](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).",

        "content": "Some nights, I like to lie in bed awake, paralyzed with the fear that my wife will leave me. This particular night was one of those times. I was covered in cold sweat, and lay on the mattress clutching the sheets while my beautiful wife, Angela, breathed slowly, rhythmically, next to me. It was insufferable. In the beginning, it was a kaleidoscope of passion that lasted until just after the wedding. Now, every small action she took felt like it was to spite me. Every movement of her deep blue eyes was done to look at another man. I still loved her, dearly, but I no longer felt that it was reciprocated. Now, it felt more like the love you have for a favourite TV show, or a stuffed animal. \n\nI calmed myself, and tried to get back to sleep. It was near enough a full moon, and the bright beams that came through the bedroom window made me feel like I was sleeping with a nightlight again. The curtains fluttered gently, and I realised that I'd left the windows open. I lazily swung my legs out of bed and stood up. I was almost at the window when I realised something. I wanted it open. For as long as I could remember, I've suffered from chronic sinus pain. Sleeping with a little fresh air helped alleviate the problems caused by a stuffy room. Angela, however, hated the chill that came with it. And so, the windows stayed shut. \n\nBut Angela was asleep, and to hell with the reprimanding I'd get from her in the morning. Triumphantly, I turned back around and got into bed again. I wrapped myself in more of the sheet than I usually get and rolled over to get a good night's sleep. Less than five minutes later I was back up again, closing the bedroom window. There really was no need for me to cast aside my wife's preferences. I'm sure she'd do the same for me. Back to bed and I'm just lying there, staring at a crack in the ceiling. It's deep, noticeable and twisted into the same shape as my grandmother's varicose veins. I try to think of how I could fix such a thing. I settled on filling it in with plaster. I rolled over and took my phone from my bedside. I opened Notes and left a message for myself to go to the hardware store. I tried never to look at my phone after I went to bed, certainly after Angela came to bed, but in this case I like to think that I have enough self control. \n\nHalf an hour later I put my phone away, having spent the time silently crawling through my Tik Tok feed, which had been flooded with Malaysian cooking videos. I tried to lay and still as I could, and clasped my eyes shut. My endeavour to sleep was cut short by a commotion from down stairs. Alert, I sat bolt upright. Could it be an intruder? A burglar? I rested a hand on Angela’s shoulders and tried to shake her awake. She let out a low, guttural grunt and rolled over. I wasn't even sure if I had heard something, and didn't want to disturb her over a false alarm. So, I stood up, crept to the baseball bat I had propped up against my dresser and slowly opened the bedroom door. \n\nStanding at the top of the hall, I could hear some movement downstairs. Wearily, I moved past the landing to the stairs, and began to descend them. All I could think of at that moment was how the real estate agent who told us about the area's near zero crime rate was lying. I grasped the wooden handle of the bat so hard my knuckles went white. I held it out in front of me as I reached the first floor. The commotion was coming from the kitchen, which I now neared. I held my breath and leapt around the corner. Holding the bat above my head, primed to swing, I confronted the person who broke into our home. \n\nStanding in the center of my kitchen was a deer. It wasn't startled by my dramatic entry and I lowered the bat. For a second, we both stood there, staring at each other. The thing's antlers came up to my shoulders. It had a brown, shaggy coat and inquisitive eyes. I've never been hunting, and this was the first time I saw an animal like this up close. Usually, they'd be rotting on the side of a road. But this creature was breathing heavily, letting out gasps of steam and warm saliva as it did. \n\nI noticed that the glass sliding doors were wide open, and I cursed myself for, presumably  forgetting to close them before I went to bed. Angela and I had been sitting on the deck drinking for most of the evening after all. I tried to shoo the beast back through the entrance and when that didn't work, tried to gently take ahold of its antlers and guide it out. As soon as I touched them, it bucked its head wildly and took a step forward. I recoiled in shock, then quietly laughed at myself for being so intimidated by Bambi. I shouted at it, but it didn't move an inch. I thought deer were supposed to be skittish around humans?\n\nWhen my problem didn't immediately fix itself, I obviously turned to the Internet. I sat back on an ugly chair my wife inherited that we keep out in the hall for some reason and took out my phone as the deer trotted laps of my kitchen island. I searched online for “what to do if a deer gets trapped in your house”. No clear results came up, and no deleted reddit user from twelve years ago made a post about having the same extremely niche problem, as is usually the case. Both my wife and I have lived in the city all our lives until recently. Maybe this was just what we had to contend with, now we live out in the exurbs. \n\nWith no idea what to do next, I decided to go wake up my wife. I cursed our house's open plan, as there was no door between the kitchen and the connecting hallway that I could close. I just hoped the deer would stay where it was. Just before I ascended the stairs, I saw it was beginning to make its way further into the house. I let out a long sigh, that didn't end until I reached my bedroom. Like a trooper, Angela was still asleep, snoring softly. I walked to her side and crouched down. I put a hand on her shoulder and gently shook her awake. She bolted upright when she finally did, her fight or flight kicking in. \n\n“Angie, Angie it's just me. It's just me.” I said, trying to help her grasp what was going on. \n\nShe sat upright and wiped her tired eyes with her palm. \n\n“Why did you wake me up?” She barked, frustrated. \n\n“We have a guest,” I joked, “downstairs. A deer broke in somehow. I think I left the patio doors open. \n\n“A deer?” She whispered, still half asleep. \n\n“Yeah. I tried to get it out but it wouldn't play ball.” I replied. \n\n“And why did you wake me up?” asked Angela, “You know I have to get up at six.” \n\n“I know, I know, it's just that I need help” I said, suddenly feeling embarrassed. \n\nAngela got out of bed, muttering about how I couldn't do anything on my own. She threw on a cardigan and followed me downstairs. I was giving her a more in depth rundown of what had happened when we reached the ground floor and saw something that stopped us in our tracks. Laying on the hardwood floor was the deer. Dead, from the looks of it. I took a step closer and saw that its eyes were glassy, and its tongue hung lame from its jaws. My wife clasped her hands around her mouth and expressed her disgust with a groan. \n\nI crouched by the dead deer and noticed something strange about its body. It seemed deflated. Hollow. I reached out and touched its stomach, against my wife's protest, and to my surprise the deer's side began to sink inwards until it was concave. It felt boneless. I took a frightened step back and it was at that point that I noticed the long, perfectly straight cut that ran the length of the beast's belly. Blood and organs should've been spewing out, but there was no such thing. It was sterile. \n\nI stood up and turned to my wife. Before I could say anything, I saw that she was pointing. I looked, following her index finger and my gaze found the basement door. It was now wide open. The only things we have in the basement are boxes for storage, and we hardly ever go down there. Guided by Angela, I approached the open door. I took one step into the darkness and felt around for the light switch. I flipped it on, but nothing happened. I flipped it again and again, but still nothing. Before I could ask, my wife went and got a flashlight from the kitchen. She came back, handed it to me and urged me further into the basement. \n\nI descended the rotting, wooden steps. The walls were bare, made from raw concrete with exposed pipes running along them. I reached the bottom floor and found the piles of boxes we'd left down here when we moved in. Bits of old furniture and unloved family heirlooms were scattered among them. I gave it a once over, but nothing seemed to be down here. Definitely not any member of the deer's extended family. I turned around and walked to the foot of the staircase. That's when I heard it. It was a low creaking noise that froze me where I stood. I slowly turned back around and shone my flashlight at the source. The door to the old, mahogany closet that had been left to gather dust by the house's previous owners had opened, just a crack. I made my way towards it, my light illuminating the wooden behemoth. I stood just in front of it and grabbed the nob. With a shaking hand, I swung the doors wide open. \n\n\nI walked out of the basement and saw my wife leaning against a wall, looking at her phone and rubbing her eyes. She looked up and smiled weakly when I emerged. \n\n“Find anything?” She asked. \n\nI wordlessly handed the flashlight to her. \n\n“I think you should go down there and see for yourself.” I told her, without any emotion. \n\nShe sighed, but took it and traced my path back down the old steps. As soon as she was in, I silently closed the basement door. I took the key that rested on the doorframe and locked it behind her. I rested against the now locked door and slid down it to the ground. I sat and whispered reassurances to myself, that I was doing the right thing. I heard a clatter, then Angela started screaming. I covered my ears as she did, the noise was too much for me to bear. Then, the screeching that sounded like it was ripping through her throat stopped. I stayed where I was for another hour. \n\nEventually, I stood and made my way to the bedroom. I lay in bed awake, paralysed with fear. I closed my eyes when I heard footsteps on the staircase. I tried not to react when my wife climbed into bed beside me. When I did fall asleep, close to sunrise, I dreamt of what I saw in the closet. It looked like a skinned body, with its emaciated arms and legs stretched to the proportions of a sloppy children’s drawing. It's head vaguely resembled deer, with the fur pulled back to reveal tight sinew covering bone. The thing's eyes were bulging and milk white. With its size, I had no idea how it could fit into that small deer’s skin, or my wife's. \n\nThat was a few weeks ago now. Since that night, I feel like my life has improved dramatically. Angela hasn't  argued with or belittled me in weeks. In fact, I haven't heard her speak in over a month. Sometimes she leaves for hours, even days at a time. I rest easy though, now knowing for certain that she isn't seeing someone behind my back. At night, we lay motionless in bed together. I like to trace the seam running down her abdomen with my fingers when we do. \n",

I can’t say I wanted to move, in fact I highly protested against it. Going from the big city to a small town of a little under five hundred people and one school? It was cliche, but also as much of a drag as you’d figure it was.\n\nAnnoyed, I agreed to make the most of the move as long as I got the biggest space in the home: the attic.\n\nIn terms of space, and storage, I couldn’t have asked for anywhere better. It was like my own mini-apartment, large with enough room to have my own little “apartment” set up. I wasted no time unpacking everything, and making myself at home.\n\nIt was fine until I opened the closet. It wasn’t a big closet, just small enough to be inconspicuous. But not big enough for me to fit myself, or many of my belongings in there. But I found it had a resident of its own quite quickly.\n\nTo my surprise, it wasn’t dirty or old. In fact, it looked brand new: a little girl with two blonde pigtails and a painted on smile. She looked brightly up at me and seemed harmless enough that I told myself we would have to get a hold of the previous owners to see if their daughter had lost a toy.\n\nBut of course, moving is hectic, and by the time I put myself down to bed for the night I’d all but forgotten about it. Until the scratching started. It was quiet at first, but the louder it became, the more disturbed I was. My first and most logical fear, of course, was rats. But in the darkness of the room I quietly notated that I could see none of the small buggers around.\n\nI’d been sitting up in bed a full minute when the giggling started. It was low at first, but as I sat petrified I could hear it becoming louder. More defined. It sounded like a small child, or at least it did at first. The louder it became, the deeper and raspier it did too.\n\nI could tell it was coming from the closet.\n\nAssuming a faulty doll was the culprit, I threw it open groggily. But as I peered inside… I found nothing. No doll. No sign it had ever been there. As the giggling continued my eyes turned to notice five long scratches along the door that sent a shiver down my spine.\n\nThis morning, I tried to tell my parents - tried to make any sense of it. But their answer stumps and terrifies me:\n\n“Jacob, the attic doesn’t have a closet.”\n\nTonight, I sit on my bed staring at the closet door only I seem to see. As it creeks open, and the giggling begins, there’s nothing sweet or innocent about it.",

        "content": "Honestly, I’m not sure what woke me up last night.\n\nNoise didn’t pull me from sleep: no whining of the hallway floorboards under heavy footfalls, no clicking of the bedroom doorknob as a hand twisted it, no groaning of the door’s metal hinges as it creeped forward. To put it more simply, I don’t think *they* woke me up. They were present *when* I woke up, but they didn’t *wake* me up.\n\nIt was more like my unconscious body was on a timer.\n\nWhen that timer ticked down to zero, my head and torso exploded upright in bed, eyelids snapping open like a pair of adjacent window blinds with an anvil attached to their drawstrings. My bedroom was nearly pitch black, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight trickling in from the window beside me, but the pallid glow wasn’t potent enough to illuminate beyond the boundaries of my mattress. As my pupils dilated, widening to accommodate larger and larger gulps of the obscuring darkness, the only noise I heard was the raspy huffs of my own rapid breathing. Otherwise, it was silent.\n\nI went from a deep, dreamless sleep to being uncomfortably awake in a fraction of a second. The transition was so sudden and jarring that it caused a wave of disorientation to ripple across the surface of my skin like goosebumps.\n\nOnce my vision adjusted, familiar contours began to emerge from the darkness, and my hyperventilation slowed. The gargantuan wooden armoire opposite my bed. A puddle of dirty clothes accumulating in the room's corner. The slight circular bulge of a wall mirror beside the open door.\n\nDespite the growing landscape of recognizable shadows, my disorientation did not wane. If anything, the sensation intensified. Sitting up in bed, still as the grave, I felt my heartbeat become rabid, drumming wildly against the center of my chest.\n\n*When did I go to sleep? How did I get into bed?*\n\n*What did I do yesterday? Or what was yesterday’s date?*\n\n*Why can’t I remember….?*\n\nThose unsettling questions spun repetitive circles around my mind like the petals of a pinwheel revolving in a gust of wind, but their momentum didn’t generate any answers. Instead, their furious revolutions only served to make me nauseous, vertigo twisting my stomach into knots.\n\n*Maybe a bit of light will help.*\n\nI slid my legs out from under the covers and reached for the lamp on my nightstand, the soles of my overheated feet pleasantly chilled as they contacted the cold hardwood floor.\n\nBefore my fingers could even find the tiny twist-knob, I detected something across the room. Paralyzed, my hand hung in the air like a noose. I blinked, squinted, closed and re-opened my eyes. I contorted my gaze in every way I could think of, convinced I was seeing something that wasn’t actually there. Unfortunately, the picture didn’t change.\n\nA human-shaped silhouette stood motionless in my bedroom’s entryway. The figure seemed to be watching me, but I couldn’t see their eyes to be sure.\n\nAutomatically, my hand rerouted its trajectory, drifting from in front of the lamp down towards the baseball bat I stored under my bed. The rest of me attempted to match the figure’s stillness while keeping both eyes fixed on its position, as if my stare was the only thing that would keep it locked in place. I felt my fingers crawl along the belly of the metal bedframe like a five-legged tarantula, but they couldn’t seem to locate the steel bat.\n\nSweat beaded on my forehead. More nervous dewdrops appeared every additional second I endured without a weapon to defend myself, my hand still empty and fumbling below. I wanted to look down, but that choice felt like death: surely the deranged, featureless killer looming a few feet from me would pounce the moment my attention was split.\n\n*Where the fuck is it?* I screamed internally, my focus on the inanimate specter wavering, my eyes desperate to look down and find the bat.\n\n*It should be* ***right*** *there,* ***exactly*** *where my hand is.*\n\nI lost control, and when my head started involuntarily tilting towards my feet, I saw the shadow-wreathed intruder turn and sprint away. My head shot up, the loud thumping of a hasty retreat becoming more distant as they raced through the first-floor hallway.\n\n*“****Hey!****”* I shouted after them, apparently at a loss for anything better to say. Once the word erupted from my lips, I felt my palm finally land on the handle of the bat. It was much deeper than I anticipated.\n\nAs soon as I had pulled the weapon out from under the bed, I was rushing after the nameless figure.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nIn retrospect, the fearlessness behind my pursuit was undeniably strange. Which is not to imply that I’m a coward. I think I’d score perfectly average for bravery when compared to the rest of the population. That’s the point, though: I’m not a coward, but I’m certainly not lionhearted, either. And yet, when I was running down that hallway, my plan wasn’t to burst out the front door, fleeing to a neighbor’s house where I could call the cops.\n\nNo, I was *chasing* them. Recklessly and without a second thought.\n\nI found myself hounding after the faceless voyeur through my completely unlit home in the dead of night, going from room to room and clearing them like a one-man SWAT team, with only a weathered bat for protection. Startled and riddled with adrenaline, sure, but not scared. Even when I came to find that the electricity was out, flicking various light switches up and down to no avail as I searched for the intruder, my psyche wasn’t rattled.\n\nThe dauntless courage was inexplicable, discordant with the situation, and out of character. Its source would become clear in time. For those few minutes, however, I was all instinct: intuition made flesh.\n\nSubconsciously, I knew I wasn’t in danger.\n\nNot from anything *inside* my house, anyway.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nNo one on the first floor: living room, kitchen, downstairs bathroom, all vacant.\n\nNo broken windows. No front door left ajar. No visible tracks in the snow when I briefly peered into my front and backyard.\n\nNo one on the second floor, either: guest bedroom, workshop, upstairs bathroom all without obvious signs of trespass. That said, by the time I was clearing rooms on the second floor, I had begun to experience an abrupt and peculiar shift in my state of mind: one that made my investigation of those spaces a little less vigorous, and a lot less through.\n\nSomehow, I became drowsy.\n\nNo more than three minutes had passed since I launched myself from bed, bloodthirsty and on the hunt, and in those one hundred and eighty seconds I had become deeply fatigued: listless, disinterested, and depleted of adrenaline. When I reached the top of the stairs, I could barely keep my eyes open. I felt drained: utterly anemic, like a swarm of invisible mosquitos had started to bleed me dry the moment I left my bedroom.\n\nOf course, that made no sense. There was a high likelihood that whoever had been looming in my bedroom doorway was still inside. Still, I wasn’t concerned. That ominous loose end hardly even registered in my brain: it bounced off my new, dense layer of exhaustion like someone trying to pierce the side of a tank with a letter opener.\n\nI poked my head in each upstairs room and gave those dark spaces a cursory scan, but nothing more. It just didn’t seem necessary.\n\nSatisfied with the search effort, I trudged back down the stairs, yawning as I went. Twenty languid steps later, my heels hit the landing. With one hand gripping the banister and the other scratching the small of my back, I was about to turn left and continue on to my bedroom, but I paused for a moment, absorbed by a detail so unnerving that it managed to break through my thick, hypnotic malaise.\n\nI furrowed my brow and looked down at my hands.\n\n*Where the hell did the bat go?*\n\nI couldn’t recall dropping it, but the concern didn’t last. After a few seconds, I shrugged and started walking again. Figured I left it somewhere upstairs and that I could find it in the morning. Which, to reiterate, was a decision wholly detached from reality. As far as I knew, there was still some stranger skulking around my home with unknown intent.\n\nThe idea of *dealing with it in the morning* stirred something within me, though. As I proceeded down the unlit hall, all of those other questions, the ones from before I noticed the figure in the doorway, began gurgling back up to the surface.\n\n*What did I do yesterday morning?*\n\n*Or last week?*\n\n*Where is everyone?,* though I wasn’t sure who *“everyone”* even was.\n\nIt was disconcerting not to have the answers to *any* of those questions, but, just like the bat, they felt like problems that would be better dealt with after I got some sleep. I was simply too damn tired to care. That changed as I stepped into the open bedroom doorway.\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks, stunned.\n\nSomehow, the intruder had slipped past me. Now, they were lying on their side, under the covers, chest facing the wall opposite to the door.\n\nAsleep.\n\nBefore that moment, my exhaustion was a shell: rigid armor shielding me from the sharpened tips of those unanswered questions. The shock of seeing *them* in my bed cleansed my exhaustion in an instant, flaying my protective carapace, making me vulnerable and panic-stricken.\n\n*What…what is this?* I thought, wide-eyed and rooted to the floor.\n\nThe figure let out a whistling snore and turned on to their back. Moonlight from the window above my bed cast a silvery curtain over their body, illuminating their face with a pallid glow. I felt lightheaded. My brain fought against the revelation, working overtime to concoct a rational explanation.\n\nAn oddly shaped, wine-colored birthmark crested over the edge of their jaw, which made their identity undeniable.\n\nIt was me.\n\nAnd I was currently frozen in the *exact same* spot the intruder stood when I jolted awake.\n\nThe figure exploded upright. The motion was jerky and mechanical, more akin to a wooden bird shooting out of a chiming cuckoo clock rather than anything recognizably human. They stared straight ahead, and because my bed was positioned in parallel to the wall opposite the door, they hadn’t seen me yet. I couldn’t move. Mostly, paralyzing disbelief kept me glued in place. But some small part of me had a different reason for staying still.\n\nI could move, but I *shouldn’t*.\n\nIt wasn’t time yet.\n\nEventually, they swung their legs around the side of the bed, reached to turn on the lamp, stopping their hand only once they saw me.\n\nMy mind writhed and squirmed under the fifty-ton weight that was the uncanny scene unfolding before my eyes. It was like watching a stage-play based on a moment I lived no more than half an hour ago, and, weirdest of all, I was part of the cast, but I wasn’t playing myself.\n\nOnce the figure started going for the baseball bat, I knew that was my cue to run.\n\nI heard them yell a muffled “***Hey!***” from behind me, but that didn’t stifle me. I sprinted down the dark hallway, past the living room, taking a right turn when I reached the landing. My legs bounded up the stairs, propelled by some internal directive that my conscious mind wasn’t privy to. Another sharp right turn as I hit the top of the stairs and moments later, I was sliding under the guest bed, picking up the bat I had absentmindedly deposited in the middle of the room as I did.\n\nNo hesitation. No back-and-forth inner debate about what I should do next. There was only one right choice to make, and I made it.\n\nI steadied my breathing and waited. The guest room was impenetrably dark, thanks to the power outage and the lack of windows, so I couldn’t see anything from my hiding spot. I heard the commotion of the frenzied downstairs search, feet shuffling and doors slamming, followed by the soft plodding footsteps of the more lethargic inspection upstairs. It was all identical to my actions minutes before.\n\nThen, there was nothing: near-complete sensory deprivation. My view from under the bed was an ocean of black ink. All I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I could feel was my hand wrapped around the handle of the bat and the cold wooden floor against my skin. After a little while, I was numb to those sensations as well - I heard nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing. The tide of ink had risen up and swallowed me whole.\n\nI couldn’t tell you how long I spent submerged in those abyssal depths, falling deeper and deeper, never quite reaching the bottom. All I know is what I saw next.\n\nTwo human feet, slowly being lowered over the edge of the mattress and onto the floor. Before my mind could be pummeled by another merciless barrage of disorientation, another appendage appeared, and it focused my attention.\n\nA hand.\n\nIt crawled along the underside of the bedframe, getting precariously close to touching me, its fingers clearly probing for something. As quietly as I could, I maneuvered the bat around the confined space, positioning it so the scouring digits connected gently with the handle.\n\nThe palm latched onto it, heavy and vicious like the bite of a lamprey, and pulled it out from under the bed. For the third time that night, I heard footsteps thump down the hall, my voice shout the word *“****Hey!****”,* and another pair of footsteps chase after the first.\n\nAs soon as I was alone, I rolled out from under the bed to discover that I was no longer upstairs. Somehow, I was now in my bedroom, one floor below where I had been hiding, standing over my mattress.\n\nAgainst all logic, I wasn’t concerned - I was drowsy. I knew I should lie down and fall asleep. I was aware that it was in my best interest to start the cycle all over again. But before I could, I noticed something outside my window. Something new. Something that hadn’t been there when I woke up the first time.\n\nI don’t know if the pilgrim intended to wrench me from my trance when he engraved those cryptic symbols into tree right outside my bedroom window, on his way up the mountain to pay tribute to the thing that caused all of this. Maybe it was just a coincidence. He’d drawn it pretty much everywhere: Lovecraftian graffiti scrawled across every available surface in the abandoned town.\n\nOr maybe he could sense my trance: the circular motion that was warding off the change that had killed everyone else. Maybe he knew seeing those images would awaken me.\n\nOnce my eyes traced those jagged edges, everything seemed to snap back into place. I was finally awake and truly alone in my house. The perpetual stage-play had come to a close.\n\nAccording to the pilgrim, it was a snake, an eye, and a cross, followed by an identical eye and snake. All in a row.\n\nTo me, it looked like a word, though I had no idea what it meant.\n\n*sOtOs.*\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nWho knows how many times that cycle had played itself out, my memory resetting once I fell back asleep.\n\nMore to the point, who knows how many times it *would have* played itself out if I didn’t incidentally glimpse the tree outside my window.\n\nIn the end, though, I suppose it doesn’t matter.\n\nAfter I broke through that trance, I would wander into town. See what became of everyone I knew in the two months I was dormant. Discuss the unraveling of existence with the pilgrim over wispy firelight. Then, when he changed, I ran down the mountain, broken by fear.\n\nI’ve considered calling the police. So far, though, I haven’t found a justifiable reason to do so.\n\nEveryone’s already dead. There’s nothing to salvage and no one to save.\n\nThey probably wouldn’t believe me, either.\n\nThat said, they’d likely still investigate, and inevitably would succumb to it just like everyone else had. What good is that going to do?\n\nThe area needs to be quarantined: excised from the landscape wholesale like a necrotic limb.\n\nSo, here I am, typing this up on borrowed internet at a coffee shop, trying to warn you all.\n\nThe pilgrim was right, though. I didn’t want to believe him, but it’s happening.\n\nNow that I’m out of my dormancy, he told me I’d start to change, too. He said that the trance was my blood protecting me. He endorsed my change would be more gradual, but it would happen all the same. Not only that, but I'd live through it, unlike everyone else.\n\nI can see the other patrons looking at me. Shocked, horrified stares.\n\nNeed to find somewhere else to finish this. Once I’m safe, I’ll fill in the rest of the story: the pilgrim, the change, the thing we found under the soil that caused this. All of it.\n\nIn the meantime, if you come across a forest where the tops of the trees are curling towards the ground and growing into themselves, and it smells of sugar mixed with blood, or lavender mixed with sulfur, and the atmosphere feels dense and granular, dragging against your skin as you move through it:\n\n[Run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)",

        "content": "I had always been a man who saw the world in vivid color. My eyes, a striking blue, were my defining feature—people said they sparkled like the ocean on a summer day. At twenty-eight, my life matched their brilliance: a cozy apartment in Portland, a job as a graphic designer that paid well enough, and a girlfriend, Mia, who laughed at my terrible puns. I noticed the way sunlight danced through leaves, how rain painted the city in streaks of silver. Life was beautiful, and I saw it all.\n\nUntil I didn’t...\n\nThe accident happened on a Tuesday night, just after 10 p.m. I was driving home from a late client meeting, the road slick with autumn rain. A truck veered into my lane—headlights blinding, tires screeching—and the world exploded into chaos. Glass shattered, metal crumpled, and my head slammed against the steering wheel. When I woke up in the hospital three days later, the world was gone. My eyes were gone. The doctors told me the damage was irreparable: shards of windshield had severed the optic nerves. I’d never see again.\n\nAt first, the darkness was suffocating. Mia stayed by my side, her voice trembling as she described the sterile white walls of the hospital room I’d never see. My hands shook as I traced the bandages wrapped around my head, feeling the void where my eyes once were. The nurses whispered about my recovery, but I barely heard them. I was drowning in the black, mourning the colors I’d lost forever.\n\nThen, on the fifth night, something changed.\n\nI was lying awake, the beep of the heart monitor a steady rhythm, when a faint glow pierced the darkness. It wasn’t light—not the kind I remembered. It was a silhouette, shimmering and indistinct, hovering near the foot of my bed. My breath caught in my throat. The shape was human, but it pulsed with a deep, angry red, like blood glowing under a spotlight. I blinked—or tried to, though the reflex was useless now—and the figure vanished.\n\nThe next morning, the hospital buzzed with grim news. Three patients had died overnight: an elderly woman in Room 312, a teenager with leukemia two doors down, and a man recovering from surgery across the hall. I overheard the nurses murmuring about “unexpected complications” and “bad luck.” My stomach twisted. I didn’t know how, but I knew that red silhouette had something to do with it.\n\nDays passed, and the silhouettes kept coming. Not all of them were red. Some glowed a soft, neutral hue—pale blues and greens, like watercolor stains against the black canvas of my mind. They weren’t vague hallucinations; they were people, or something tied to them. I could sense their presence, their outlines sharp in a way my ruined eyes could never have managed. One day, I asked Mia to describe the orderly who brought my lunch. “Tall, skinny, brown hair,” she said. I nodded—I’d “seen” the man’s soul, a steady green flicker, just minutes before.\n\nIt hit me then: I wasn’t blind, not entirely. My sight had shifted, rewired. Where my eyes once caught light, my mind now glimpsed something deeper. Souls, I decided to call them. I didn’t need a visual cortex to process them; they burned straight into my consciousness, raw and unfiltered. The normal souls—green, blue, gold—belonged to the living, the healthy. The red ones? They were harbingers. Every time I saw that crimson glow, someone died within hours.\n\nWhen I was discharged a month later, I kept my new ability secret. Mia drove me home, her voice bright with forced optimism, but I barely responded. I was too busy watching the souls drifting past the car window—faint glimmers in the void. A blue soul in a pedestrian crossing the street. A green one in the driver of a pickup truck. And then, a red silhouette in the backseat of a taxi. I didn’t turn my head—couldn’t—but I heard the distant wail of sirens minutes later. Another death. Another confirmation.\n\nMonths slipped by, and I adapted. I learned to navigate my apartment by memory and sound, though the souls guided me too, their glow a strange compass in the dark. Mia stayed, patient through my silences, but I couldn’t bring myself to tell her what I saw. How could I explain the dread that gripped me every time a red soul flared into view? I witnessed them everywhere: at the grocery store, on walks in the park, even in the coffee shop where Mia read me the newspaper. Each red silhouette was a clock ticking down—car accidents, heart attacks, a fall down the stairs. I couldn’t stop them. I could only watch.\n\nOne crisp April morning, seven months after the accident, I stood in my bathroom, splashing water on my face. The routine grounded me, a tether to the life I’d once had. I reached for a towel, then froze. A red soul flickered into existence—not across the room, not down the hall, but right in front of me. My breath hitched. I turned my head instinctively, though it made no difference, and the silhouette stayed locked in place. It was my reflection. My own soul, burning red in the mirror.\n\nPanic clawed at my chest. I stumbled back, knocking over a bottle of soap, and called for Mia. She rushed in, her voice tight with worry. “What’s wrong? Ethan, talk to me!” I couldn’t explain—not fully—but I grabbed her arm and rasped, “I need a doctor. Now.”\n\nAt the hospital, the tests were a blur. Bloodwork, scans, an EKG. I sat rigid, the red glow of my soul pulsing in my mind, brighter than ever. The doctor returned with a frown. “You’re lucky you came in,” he said. “We found a clot in your lung—a pulmonary embolism. Another few hours, and…” He didn’t finish. He didn’t need to. My hands trembled as they hooked me to an IV, pumping me full of anticoagulants.\n\nI’d cheated it. For the first time, the red hadn’t won.\n\nAfter that, I started paying closer attention. I couldn’t predict the deaths—couldn’t warn anyone—but I could save myself. The red souls still appeared, still claimed their victims, but I refused to let them take me. Life settled into a strange rhythm: Mia’s laughter, the hum of the city, and the ever-present dance of souls in the dark.\n\nThen, a year after the accident, something shifted again.\n\nIt started with my neighbor, Mrs. Delaney, a widow who lived downstairs. I had seen her soul before—a steady gold, warm and constant. But one evening, as I passed her door, I saw something new: a red silhouette, faint and wispy, drifting toward her. It didn’t hover like the others. It merged. The red sank into her gold soul, staining it like ink in water, and then it was gone.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Delaney collapsed in the hallway. Not dead—unconscious. A stroke, the paramedics said as they wheeled her away. My gut twisted. She hadn’t died, but the red had touched her. Two weeks later, it happened again: a green soul in the park, a red wisp slipping inside. Hours later, a scream—someone had found the man seizing on a bench. A brain aneurysm, fatal this time.\n\nThe red souls weren’t just death omens anymore. They were something else—something active. They didn’t only mark the dying; they infected the living. And the more I saw, the more I wondered: were they souls at all? Or were they something darker—hunters, reapers, parasites feeding on life itself?\n\nOne night, alone in my apartment, I stood before the mirror again. My soul glowed green, steady as ever. But as I stared, a faint red shimmer appeared—not within me, but behind me. It drifted closer, its edges curling like smoke. My breath stopped. The red wisp hovered, then turned, gliding toward the bedroom where Mia slept.\n\n“No,” I whispered, lunging blindly.\n\nBut I couldn’t stop it.\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/5gHZcoXbmK)",

        "content": "First off, I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who knows of such a building.\n\nTo be honest, I guess there’s a house like that everywhere. In every city, every town, hell, maybe even in every neighborhood. You might know it as well.\n\nIt’s an old house, abandoned for years, probably. You’ve never seen anyone going in there on their own, neither seen anyone coming out of it. If there ever were people who tried to buy it and move in, they changed their minds about that pretty quickly.\n\nThe lawn is overgrown, maybe there’s even garbage there.\n\nIf there’s a tree, it’s either sick and dying or dead already.\n\nFrom time to time, you can even smell this strange odor wafting through the neighborhood.\n\nWell, the one I’m talking about is at the end of the road where I live.\n\nIt’s dilapidated and abandoned, and it kinda looks haunted, to be honest.\n\nI’ve lived here for decades, yet no one ever bought that place, no one ever visited and the only time I can remember anyone even working close to it, was when the city deemed its overgrown hedges a potential hazard. They sent someone to trim the outsides of the bushes and cut the branches of the trees growing out over the road.\n\nIt didn’t change much, I guess, since it was still an eyesore, but it definitely was less ugly, at least for a while.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my friends and I would often dare each other to hop over the old, rusted fence and walk around the lawn. It was a dumb game, and I can only remember a single time when one of us even did it. Johnny, a blonde-haired boy who was two years younger than the rest of us and wanted to be part of our group so badly, actually jumped over the fence and ran to the front door.\n\nHe stumbled, fell, scraped his knee, and came running back crying. We laughed, then got concerned when we saw his leg. It looked like he had a rash, and bubbles were forming on his skin, along the small cut.\n\nJohnny wasn’t allowed to play with us anymore from then on, and I guess the others lost interest in the house as well.\n\nThe next time I saw that kid was months later, out shopping with his mom, and I still remembered how strange it felt that he looked different. Kinda... off... sickly.\n\nI never saw him again, but back then, people tended to come and go from time to time, so it didn’t bother me much.\n\nWe grew up, all of us, and started to stop caring about exploring the neighborhood, but I still remember looking at that damned house that seemed somehow frozen in time.\n\nThere were storms and flooding, we had neighbors that almost got their roof blown off, yet that one building at the end of the road never even lost as much as a shingle, as far as I can tell.\n\nIt was eerie, yet no one else seemed to really care about it. The most I got was a polite smile and a ‘That’s crazy.’\n\nI finished school, went to college, then moved back a few years later. You know how life can be... Well, my parents remodeled our house while I was gone, yet this one damned place looked exactly the same when I returned.\n\nI can’t even tell you how I felt when I saw it again. Somewhere deep down, I had hoped it would have either been bought and rebuilt as well, or that someone had finally torn it down, but that wasn’t the case.\n\nAs I stepped out of my car in my parents’ driveway, I immediately spotted it. The rotten shingles, the overgrown lawn, and even the rusted fence looked just like how I remembered. No one had touched it while I was gone, and the trees had regrown their branches, now reaching into the street again.\n\nI asked my Dad about it, but he only shook his head.\n\nThat’s just how it is, he said, with a distant look in his eyes.\n\nWell, my parents died four years ago, which meant that I inherited the house I grew up in. It wasn’t unexpected, which doesn’t mean I wasn’t distraught though.\n\nCancer is a bitch, and it got both of them.\n\nDad went first. He simply didn’t wake up after the last operation, and it broke my Mom’s will to live. She just fell apart and stopped eating, and not even a month later, I found her dead in her bed in the morning.\n\nI hope wherever they are, they are happy now and not in pain.\n\nBut that’s not the reason I’m writing this today.\n\nSo, while they did leave me the house, they also left me with a ton of headaches. I never realized how much work went into keeping up a whole building. And I don’t mean just the taxes etc. Sometimes it feels like I spend the weekends cleaning just for it to be dirty again by next Friday. Every morning I dread looking in my mailbox fearing another unpaid bill I had no clue about. And then, there’s the ant problem.\n\nThis one, I noticed even before my parents had died.\n\nIt started at the kitchen window, and I don’t know how those little monsters got in, but they formed a fucking highway of ants, right to the fridge. I tried everything, from poison to cleaning to putting out paper, so I could reroute those bastards, but nothing seemed to work.\n\nAnything I tried gave me a few hours of peace at most. I’ve even put tape all over the window frame and have closed it permanently, but they still manage to get in somehow.\n\nThose things are big, by the way. Massive, if I think back to how the ants in my childhood looked. Some of them might be from completely different species, while others seem strangely deformed.\n\nThey almost drove me insane, to be honest. I started hating going into the kitchen at all for fear of seeing them again.\n\nBut I think I know now where they are coming from, and I shudder to imagine what will happen if I don’t do something soon.\n\nYou see, an hour ago, while drinking a couple of beers, and after I called up one of the few people I’ve known since childhood still living in this neighborhood, my curiosity got to me. The house at the end of the road came up in the conversation.\n\nOf course, my friend hardly acknowledged it, but I got it into my head, that I could at least get a reprieve from my own problems, if I took a closer look at that eyesore, now as an adult.\n\nArmed with my phone, a flashlight, and some liquid courage, I made my way down the road, walking briskly through the night, already feeling the same way I had as a child again.\n\nOnly this time, I wasn’t out after curfew, there was no one who would tell me to stay away, and I could feel in my bones that I would finally find out what was wrong with that place.\n\nWell, it didn’t take me long to reach the outer perimeter and the rusted fence. Only, I didn’t hop over it, instead chose to use the gate right in the middle of the lot.\n\nIf I had thought the fence was a problem, that piece of junk was even worse. It sounded like someone screaming as I opened it up, giving me the first chills of the night.\n\nThere was a completely overgrown stone path in the middle of the lot, and I kept to it since everything in my mind told me to keep off the lawn.\n\nIt was moving with the breeze, but not in the same direction.\n\nOf course, I took out the flashlight and slowly let the circle of light illuminate my surroundings. From the dead-yet-still-growing trees to the shrubs and weeds.\n\nIt looked off. All of it.\n\nLike somehow, the shadows were moving even if I kept the torch pointed at a spot.\n\nThat was the second time I felt chills that night, but I reasoned that I was just imagining it all. The porch and front door were only a couple of steps away, so I forced myself to stop dawdling around and kept going.\n\nI remember the sound the wind made when it breezed through the vegetation. The noise of stalks and stems rubbing against each other, almost sounded like thousands of small legs crawling over the ground.\n\nThat memory makes me uneasy.\n\nBut back then, bolstered by the alcohol, I just shook it off and walked up the two steps to the porch.\n\nThe old, dark wood on the side looked like it would break the moment I put my foot on it, and I think I could see termites disappearing every time the light of my torch passed over them. Not normal ones either. Those things seemed strangely elongated. Abnormal.\n\nI took a deep breath, shook off those feelings of fear and trepidation, and turned toward the door.\n\nSomething was in there, I knew. Somehow, I could feel it.\n\nIt had been bugging me for years, and now I finally found myself in front of the door.\n\nA breeze blew past me and carried with it an earthy smell and the sound of stalks scraping over each other. Only this time, it really did remind me of insects.\n\nMillions of them.\n\nSomewhere deep inside I think I hoped the door would be locked, but as I touched the handle, it swung inward without a problem.\n\nThe soft sound of tiny insects hitting the floor reached my ears, but I was too transfixed by what I was seeing to notice it at that moment. There was furniture in there, but every piece the light of my torch touched was crawling with insects. A black mass of bodies trying to escape back into the darkness. They were everywhere. On every surface, skittering about, and as I looked closer, I could see that most of the furniture had been reduced to a mere facade. All the wood and everything that wasn’t plastic had been long since devoured.\n\nI could feel a shiver again and wanted to step back, but at that exact moment, something fell from the frame of the door above and dropped down the back of my shirt.\n\nWith a howl I shot forward, not thinking about what I was doing.\n\nMy foot touched the floorboards inside the house, and as if they were made of paper, they broke through at first contact. I screamed in shock and horror as I felt myself falling, the torch tumbled from my grasp and fell down into the basement, while my hands luckily found a strut that just about held my weight.\n\nIt was aching the moment I swung down and I could see the light disappear in the darkness, then heard the torch landing with a soft crunch.\n\nBeneath me, just a few steps below, I could see it. A dark, moving wave of insects, rushing toward the torch I had dropped, ripping at each other to be the first to claim the new prey.\n\nIt couldn’t have been more than a second that I looked down, but I’m sure I could see hundreds of different species in this mass of whirling bodies. Centipedes, ants, termites, and spiders, all ripping at each other and swarming over the flashlight.\n\nA hiss reached me from down there as the light got dim, then died, but I couldn’t concentrate on that.\n\nThings above were hardly better.\n\nTiny, chitinous legs touched my fingers still clinging to the strut. I felt a sharp pain as something bit me, and then more small bodies crawling and racing over my hands.\n\nThey were biting me, eating me, I realized. In their frenzy, those things wanted to devour me.\n\nWith another howl I tried to pull myself up, now almost in complete darkness and felt more insects dropping from the edge of the hole and down onto my head and shoulders. They were biting into every single uncovered piece of flesh they could find. My ears, neck and cheeks.\n\nPain was radiating out from every bite, throughout my whole body.\n\nThose moments are so hazy now. I remember the agony and myself screaming for my life.\n\nOne of my hands found the frame of the door. I pulled myself up and felt a centipede crawling down my face, then suddenly biting the corner of my lip.\n\nI couldn’t even wipe it away. All I could think about at that moment was how to get out of there. How to flee and never return.\n\nCrying, I pulled myself up, rolled out of the entrance to the house, and heard the sounds of hundreds of bodies bursting beneath me as I fell down the steps to the porch.\n\nMy hand, already covered in bug bites touched the grass and I immediately felt more insects turning, twisting, and clinging to me.\n\nSomehow I managed to get up on my feet and ran while ripping my clothes off, whipping myself with my shirt to get rid of those things that were already buried into the skin on my back.\n\nMaybe some of my neighbors saw me, running up the road half-naked and screaming, but right now, I don’t care.\n\nThe ambulance is on its way since I can’t drive right now.\n\nMy fingers are swollen and moving them is painful, but I need to write this down.\n\nThere’s a rash everywhere on my body. Hundreds of bites.\n\nI’ve pulled stingers, mandibles and tiny insect heads out of my skin, from my back to my forehead.\n\nIt’s hard to keep a coherent thought right now.\n\nThose things are vicious.\n\nThey are waiting for new victims.\n\nIf I had dropped down into the basement, I wouldn’t have made it out alive again. That much is clear.\n\nThat place isn’t a house. It is a pit.\n\nAnd sooner or later, they might spread.\n\nThe moment I’m out of the hospital, I will go back there.\n\nBut not to visit it, no. I will burn it down to the ground.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd when I watch the whole place go up in flames, I might finally feel a tiny bit [better.](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/comments/10hqkpe/haunted_tales_a_horror_anthology_podcast/)",

        "content": "Previous: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/lCuthBKWUc\n\nI sat in my office lost in thought. There was an inmate in my old life whose case didn't check out. He was a bit of a local terror. Named Henry, but known by all as Ol’ Hank. He was the guy you went to when you wanted a cheap car fast, with no credit check. He would take cash, of course, but he also accepted trades–drugs, alcohol, electronics…women. \n\nHank wasn't a good guy. I wouldn't call him a villain, more of a high-key sleazeball. He trolled Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for vulnerable young women, for example. Eventually he found one. Twyla. Twyla was no stranger to working the system. She had two kids, neither of whom were special needs, both of whom collected disability for their non-existent special needs. Twyla herself was a nurse who was terminated for drinking on the job\n\nIt was a match made in hell. One day, New Year's Day in fact, Hank was seen lurching out of the house incoherent and bleeding. A witness called it in. Hank was taken away in an ambulance, and Twyla and both kids were taken to the morgue. All stabbed to death. Hank was arrested immediately, still the kind of drunk that would put the rest of us in a coma. That was his defense, btw..That being drunk and high on codeine left him far too sedated to stab two large young men and his girlfriend, then stab himself in the gut, which is one of the worst ways to die. I don't know. The evidence against him was overwhelming–but not enough to prevent him from  being mired in appeals for 26 years.\n\nThat case always bothered me. Hank was an asshole, and maybe a small, bad part of me believed he deserved to die. But, there was a lot of weird shit. His uncle was seen washing blood out of his truck. Caught on security cameras dumping his clothes and incinerating them. There was one piece of evidence left–a bloody jacket belonging to the uncle. Soaked in Twyla’s blood. \n\nIt was lost in police custody. The biggest piece of evidence in a murder case and someone just what, forgot it somewhere? Lost an XXL blood soaked coat with a huge tag that said “evidence”? \n\nFishy, if you asked me. Hank’s case was presided over by a former sheriff, now a judge, who was responsible for arresting Hank in a series of petty misdemeanors. They hated each other. Seemed like a conflict of interest but no one ever asks the executioner. Hank was driven to the Death House (the unit where we perform executions) three times, and was stayed three times. It went to the supreme Court back then. Four in favor of resentencing to Life Without Parole, 5 who voted to kill him. \n\nIn his notes, a member of the Supreme Court of the United States, I wont say who, wrote “Sometimes when something doesn't pass the smell test, you just gotta throw the whole thing out.”\n\nHank was never executed. He died at 68 of a heart attack. No conspiracy, no nefarious plot. He died because he was in bad shape, he had cancer, and the effects of alcoholism finally took their toll. I was glad. I don't know what I believe about Ol’ Hank, but I knew he'd rather go out on some version of his own terms, not strapped to the table and euthanized like a dog.\n\nHad he made it to the death chamber, I would have pushed the plunger. What is my life? Am I a just man? I put my head in my hands.\n\nI felt a gentle hand on my shoulder. “Yes, Shepherd Reaper. You are a good man.” I looked up and knew I was staring at Lady Justice. In a way she scared me more than Death. Death can kill me, but Lady Justice can judge me.This lady knew all my deeds and misdeeds. Let's face it, I totally killed a guy. Her duty was not exacting petty revenge like Karma. This woman was the one with the scales. How many of us can say, really say with confidence, that the bad wouldn't tip the scales? Especially if you used the legal system to murder your daughter's rapist? The fear was there, sure, but so was grief and rage. I don't understand why that demon took my daughter. If he was going to rape and kill her, why the violence? Why did he choke her while singing Christmas carols? She loved Christmas, and they were perverted for her, tainted, in her last moments on earth. She could have lived and recovered. Where was Justice then? If any of you are parents and you had the chance to do what I did...would you?\n\nI digress. Lady Justice certainly did not \"have a titty out\" as she does in sculptures. Karma bends the truth.Justice was fully covered in what looked like SWAT gear. Bullet proof vest, expertly shined shoes, and sure enough, aviator glasses. Apparently the gear was all sewn by Arachne. She looked to be in her late 30s, possibly early 40s. Quite attractive, though no one compares to my wife. I missed my wife. \n\n“I cannot intervene in the process of a crime. Otherwise the boy who harmed your daughter would be in a meat grinder right now. I can oversee due process. Restore balance, in the end..the issue is sometimes the end takes a long time. Years. Sometimes lifetimes. You should not have interfered. You made a mockery of the justice system. Of my duties. As it turns out, however, this one is above my pay grade.\n\nThen a cold breath in my ear, not from Justice but some invisible presence, whispered, “He deserved to die. Fear not. Colton will never feel warmth again. There is no sun where he is. No people. His death is one of sparsity, cold, and isolation.”\n\nI had just heard the voice of death, and I was relieved. Ain't that some shit?\n\n“Ah, I hear she spoke to you. My sister tells me she appeared the other night. You are getting closer to meeting our Lady of Death. We do not tease to be cruel. Unlike your jealous God who would hoard all for himself, you are to have as much knowledge as possible.Your brain is your most powerful armor; the knowledge within your greatest protector. Without knowledge, I fear you would go insane. I've seen it happen.”\n\nI shuddered.\n\n“You fear the right things. Concepts outside of your own needs.”\n\n“You have one more to meet. Our Lady Liberty. She is in the infirmary, guarded by Keeper of the Rainbow Bridge. Keep this in mind when humanity seems like a scourge upon the earth. You made a bridge of rainbows with its very own boy to lead your pets to great green fields, stars, adventures, the best smells and greatest tastes, endless sunbeams and beds to lay in, trees made of peanut brittle that bloom toys. You all agreed this was the only suitable Beyond. And so it became real.\n\nWithout knowing you assigned them a guardian. He is the  boy on the bridge. His name is Styx Featherton. We all call him Sticks.”\n\nJustice paused, seemingly composing herself. “Take my hand. It's time for a change of scenery.”\n\nNot a second later I heard the unmistakable noises of a hospital room. On the bed lay a regal woman. Could have been 60 or 30. She was ageless. And she was sick. A small black cat purred by her head.\n\nA little boy of 7 or 8, who I assumed was Styx, announced that she was dying. \n\n“I WILL NOT TAKE HER”.\n\nThree guesses who that disembodied voice was.\n\nJustice spoke quietly, holding Liberty's hand. “No, sister. We cannot have liberty and justice for all without you. Remember? I'm the enforcer. You're the inspiration. And Shepherd here is going to help. Would you like to tell him, or shall I?”\n\nLiberty looked at me directly in the eyes. “They took my crown. They took my torch. Without them, I will succumb to death.”\n\n“NO YOU WON’T.”\n\n“I will,” Liberty said. It's your sworn duty to God.” \n\n“TELL THE OLD BOOMER I SEND THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.”\n\nThen all hell broke loose.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "\nHello everyone at r/nosleep.\n\nMy name matters less than the story I need to tell. I am one of the few in my village, here deep in the green heart of the Amazon, who has sporadic access to the internet. I learned your language from outsiders, missionaries and researchers who passed through here, and curiosity has led me to many corners [of the web], including this subreddit. \n\nI read your stories about strange rules, about creatures in the darkness, about urban terrors. Some give me chills. It's funny to think about our cultural difference. Around here, we are, in a way, 'acclimatized' to fear, as you might say. For us, what you call 'paranormal' or 'supernatural' is just part of the world.\n\nWe grew up hearing stories, warnings, lessons passed down by our elders about respect, about boundaries. We know the signs, the sacred places and the cursed ones. Since I was a child, I learned there are places one must not fish after sunset, trees that cannot be cut even when dead, and sounds that must never be imitated. The sounds of the forest change completely after the sun goes down. It's not just the crickets or the frogs. There are snaps of branches no animal would make, whispers the wind carries for kilometers.\n\nThe white people think \"paranormal\" is something separate, an intrusion. For us, it's like the air: it's in everything. The spirits are neighbours. The child who gets lost in the igarapé might return speaking the language of the dead, and this isn't tragedy – it's a lesson. The elders teach us to \"read\" the forest. The way the leaves fall, the colour of the water after a heavy rain, the sudden silence of the monkeys – all of this has meaning.\n\nBut even though I am so different from you, I fear we are all condemned for having become too much alike.\n\nOur people, despite living in the forest and keeping our traditions, our language, our customs, knows about the white man. You gave us technology. Our young people are sent to the city to study. They become literate in the “official” language. We share our history with your researchers; your professors come to our villages to do research; your anthropologists are used to interviewing us. The media makes documentaries about us and interviews our warriors. We are like cousins to you. One side has grown accustomed to the other. \n\nBut you need to know that not everyone is like this.\n\nYou call them 'the isolated'. The white man's government says it protects their lands, creating zones where no outsider can enter. Thousands of kilometers of dense forest that no one, not even the police or the army, truly knows. Instead of trying to study them, perhaps decipher their language, their culture, the government decided simply to protect them. And watch, from afar. \n\nThis might have been the first mistake. \n\nTheir existence is a fact for us, like an unknown river or a distant mountain in the mist. But we do not understand their languages. The rare sounds the wind sometimes carries from their direction do not resemble any speech we know. Their tracks, when found by chance near the unspoken boundaries, are different. Their beliefs? Their fears? Their guardian spirits? They are mysteries to us, just as much as they are to you. They are peoples whose true names the world has never heard.\n\nWe coexist with these peoples. But it's a coexistence of distance and silence. The rule of not entering their territories isn't just for the outsiders who venture here; it applies to us too. For centuries, the instruction was clear: upon hearing their peculiar calls in the forest, upon seeing tracks that are not ours or those of known animals, there is no curiosity. We lower our heads and silently change our course. \n\nThey are the peoples we avoid. But this invisible barrier, this abyss of silence between us… it feels as though it is erected with the same firmness from their side. It's not the skittish shyness of a forest creature fleeing when seen. It's something intentional. The birds fall silent in a strange way, the sound dies in a wrong way, a silence so absolute it almost sounds like a suppressed scream. That is how we know we are already at the border between our territories, and it's time to turn back.\n\nBut of course, it's not always like that. No one is born knowing which steps to avoid, which shadows to ignore. When childhood curiosity leads a little one to point towards that denser part of the woods, or to imitate a strange sound coming from afar, the reaction isn't a legend, not a monster story. It's a sudden silence from the adults around, a stern look that permits no questions, a firm but silent pull on the arm, drawing them away. The question 'Why?' dies on the lips before it's even fully formed. Children learn not by the name of the danger, but by the heavy feeling that emanates from the elders whenever that invisible boundary is even mentioned.\n\nBut try to ask, as a child inevitably does, ‘Grandfather, why did your face get like that when I spoke of the different signs near the dark igarapé?'. The answer doesn't come in words. It comes in a sudden stiffness in the elder's shoulders, in a gaze that abruptly shifts to the fire or the ground. The pajés [shamans] are supposed to have all the answers about the forest, but in that moment, the child learns there are things that have no name in the pajés' stories. Things they have decided to ignore and look away from.\n\nAnd so we lived for centuries. Our peoples on one side, those peoples on the other. Not even colonization changed this. While entire tribes were burned by the colonizer, while Catholic Jesuits dominated and learned our language and the languages of our sister tribes, they remained there. Isolated. Uncontacted. Oblivious to the oppressor's sword. Looking back, I think we should have paid more attention to this. It's not a natural phenomenon. Now, perhaps, it's too late.\n\nIt started two days ago, well after the last fire had burned down to embers. \n\nThat's when we heard it. Coming not from afar, as we were used to, but disturbingly close. Not the incomprehensible calls we had each grown accustomed to hearing throughout our lives, but grotesque imitations of sounds. Our sounds. A fragment vaguely resembling the cry of a village baby, but repeated in an unnatural cycle, devoid of emotion. Another sound seemed like a failed attempt to echo the slow rhythm of a shamanic chant, but off-key, broken, as if the very throat producing it didn't understand the melody or purpose. \n\nIt was as if something was dissecting our sounds and trying to reassemble them with the wrong pieces. It seemed less an attempt to 'speak' and more a vocal spasm, a desperate need to expel noise, any noise. It lasted for hours. For brief moments, amidst the chaos, we heard what could have been an attempt at voice. Not words. Tonal fragments, as if something were trying to reproduce the cadence of human speech after hearing it only once, from very far away, distorted by wind and water. \n\nThey were meaningless rising and falling modulations, interrupted by choking sounds or chitinous clicks. It wasn't a message. It wasn't a threat we understood. It was a chaotic outpouring. A leak of sounds from a place where logic does not reside. It was the pure audible manifestation of a desperate need to do… something, anything, to be perceived, but without the slightest idea how. We spent the entire night awake, huddled in our hammocks, the air thick with fear and the smoke from fires relit uselessly against an enemy that didn't show itself, only sounded. The night was no longer ours.\n\nThe air in the village wasn't just heavy; it felt toxic. No one spoke a word. The pajés, for the first time in anyone's memory, seemed shrunken, their eyes fixed on the ground as if afraid of finding something in the emptiness. That one night felt like days. But the worst was yet to come.\n\nIn the deepest hour of the night, when even the moon dared not peek and the darkness was a palpable weight, the very nature of the noises began to change. And then, peering through the tiny cracks in the walls of our ocas [huts], terror took shape. The sounds had also become shapes, an agglomeration of shadows darker than the night itself. \n\nThey were not the forest spirits we know, nor animals. They were many. And then we could see… more. Their outlines were fluid, erratic, sometimes seeming almost human in silhouette, at other times unfolding at impossible angles, with limbs that appeared to bend in the wrong places. Their mouths moved, and the horrible sounds we'd heard before – the clicks, the wet sobs, the broken static – emanated directly from them, a parody of speech so grotesque it turned the stomach. Counting them was impossible; the darkness and fear blurred our vision.\n\nBut the true abyss opened when we focused on their faces, or what seemed to be their faces. There was no anger, no hatred, no enemy's bloodlust. There was… agony. Masks contorted in unspeakable suffering, and from their eyes – or the dark cavities where eyes should have been – trickled thick, dark, almost oily streaks. \n\nIt was weeping. Unmistakable. The universal language of human pain, coming from beings that seemed anything but human. But why were they crying? Why were they lamenting? Were they mourning our imminent death, even before touching us? Dread paralyzed us in our hammocks, not just from fear of physical pain, but from the nauseating realization: we were witnessing, perhaps even unwillingly participating in, an event of incomprehensible sorrow with no record or precedent in human history.\n\nThat profane vigil stretched on for hours that felt like ages, drawn out in the torture of anticipation. \n\nBut the attack never came. There was no movement towards us, no arrow fired, no step crossing the invisible line that separated us. And perhaps that was worse: their faces turned towards us, or maybe through us, in a concentration of suffering so intense it held us pinned in place. Every member of the tribe remained frozen in their oca, breathing as little as possible. The initial fear of a massacre gave way to a different kind of terror: the dread of the incomprehensible, the feeling of being observed, judged, and mourned by beings operating outside any natural or spiritual law we knew.\n\nThe night dragged on, dense and starless. The lament continued, a constant, sickening pulse that seemed to reorder the very silence between its waves. And then, almost imperceptibly, a subtle change began. Not in them, but in the world around. A pale, sickly gray began to seep into the eastern edge of the sky, the first hesitant promise of dawn. The lament didn't stop abruptly; it began to unravel, losing its cohesion, the sounds breaking into even more erratic fragments, before finally being swallowed by the growing gray of morning. The dark shapes seemed to retreat, not like an army withdrawing, but like the darkness itself dissolving, receding into the depths of the forest from which they came, leaving behind a heavy silence. \n\nWe waited, motionless, for a long time after the last sound died out and the last flickering shadow disappeared. The sun was already high, burning the sky at midday, before the first of us truly dared to emerge. Only then, one by one, slowly, with the caution of someone treading on mined earth, did we begin to emerge from our shelters into a world that looked familiar, but which we knew, in our bones, had been irrevocably profaned.\n\nThe village was silent, except for the almost aggressive buzz of diurnal insects. \n\nThere was no discussion, no meeting of the elders. The first to crawl out of their ocas didn't look at each other; their eyes went instinctively to the small structure of wood and tin that housed our tenuous link to the outside world: the shortwave radio and the satellite internet terminal, gifts from the government after the last bloody conflicts with loggers. \n\nWithout a word, Kael and Tari, two of the youngest trained in the codes and protocols, ran inside. The nervous crackle of static filled the air as Kael tried to establish contact with the military border control base. His voice, usually firm, was a trembling thread: \"Jaguatirica Base, this is Ypykuéra, code Red Herald!\" \n\nThere was a loaded silence on the other end, likely shock or disbelief, but the code Arauto Vermelho [Red Herald], reserved for existential threats or unexplained large-scale incursions near the Zones of Protection for the Isolated, prevented any doubt about the seriousness of our distress call.\n\nThe response took what felt like a lifetime, but by the clock was just under two tense hours, lived under a relentless sun and a heavy silence broken only by stifled sobs and the anxious murmurs of the elders. Each cloud shadow made hearts leap; each twig snap in the woods sounded like the nightmare's return. Then, a distant sound, a vibration felt more in the chest than heard, began to grow. It became a deep hum. \n\nThree military transport helicopters, enormous green-metal dragonflies, broke the treeline in tactical formation. They made a low pass over the village, the downdraft whipping leaves and dust into a violent whirlwind, before beginning a coordinated descent into the central clearing. The noise was deafening, a storm of metal and wind that drowned out all other sounds. Even before they fully touched the ground, the side ramps opened, and soldiers equipped for jungle combat – camouflage, vests, helmets with dark visors, assault rifles ready – began to disembark with trained efficiency. There were dozens. They quickly formed a defensive perimeter, not looking at us, but towards the forest, towards the dark line from where the horror had emerged and where it had retreated.\n\nWhile the soldiers established the perimeter, weapons at low ready but eyes scanning the treeline, a figure emerged from the third helicopter, the command aircraft. Without the impersonal helmet, without the tense combat stance, we saw a face many of us recognized instantly. It was Commander Galvão. For almost twenty years, he had been the face of the Army in our region, a man whose patrols and training exercises were part of the landscape, whose sporadic visits to check borders or mediate minor conflicts were almost routine. \n\nGalvão was procedure, order, the guarantee that the gears of the outside world were now engaged. But there was something in his posture, in the almost satisfied glint in his eyes as he surveyed his men's show of force, that soon caught the attention of the most observant. We knew how it worked: protecting Indigenous lands, especially responding quickly to a distress call like ours, earned points with the government in Brasília. Showed results. Perhaps for Galvão, we were just providing him an opportunity to look competent, ready to burn tractors or arrest loggers.\n\nWhen those most skilled in the Portuguese language began to recount the events – the profane sounds imitating our lives, the fluid, weeping shadows that surrounded us, the lament that seemed a funeral for our own existence – Galvão's expression changed. The confident smile vanished, but it wasn't replaced by the horror or empathetic urgency we expected. His eyes took on a glint of... apathy? Polished impatience? He listened intently, head tilted, like a doctor listening to the description of a fever dream. \n\nHe listened with formal attention, occasionally nodding to the FUNAI [Govt. Indigenous Affairs Agency] advisor beside him, as if they were comparing mental notes on some obscure tribal phenomenon. The officer was processing, filtering the information through his grid of known threats: guerillas? Smugglers using psychological intimidation tactics? A rival tribe? Nothing fit.\n\nAt the end of Tari's account, Galvão stroked his chin, his gaze lost for a moment in the green vastness. \"I understand,\" he said finally, his voice calm, but with a tone that sought to reduce the extraordinary to the manageable. \"Atypical situation, no doubt.\" He turned to the Pajé, a calculated gesture of respect.\n\n\"Don't you think that maybe… just maybe… they've finally decided to learn to plant something around here, like you do?\"\n\nWe saw the naked truth then: the Brazilian Army, with its helicopters, its rifles, and its satellites, was prepared to face guerrillas, traffickers, loggers, even a foreign invasion force or insistent missionaries. But it was not prepared for that.\n\n\"Right,\" he said, his voice pragmatic. \"The situation is clearly abnormal and your account is troubling. Alpha Platoon, maintain the perimeter and conduct a careful sweep within a three-hundred-meter radius of the village. Document any unusual traces – footprints, objects, markings. Photograph everything. But maximum attention:\" he raised a finger, emphatic. \"No, I repeat, NO initiative to follow tracks beyond this initial area or attempt visual contact if anything is sighted. The orders from Brasília and FUNAI regulations regarding the non-contact policy with isolated groups are absolute. Our job here is to ensure the safety of this contacted village and gather preliminary information for the report. We will not initiate a conflict or a health crisis through recklessness.\" \n\nHis explanation was direct, operational. The Army was there to contain the immediate situation in our village, not to hunt ghosts in the forest.\n\nThe FUNAI representative, whose badge identified him as the acting regional coordinator, cleared his throat, looking equally overwhelmed but adhering to protocol. \"The Commander is correct. We must follow procedures.\" He addressed us, his tone more conciliatory, yet still distant. \n\n\"Our priority now is your well-being. We will arrange for a multidisciplinary team, and you should describe everything to them in as much detail as possible. It would also be important,\" he added, glancing around at the tense faces, \"to conduct a preventative health assessment here in the village as soon as possible, to rule out any risk, however indirect.\" He gestured vaguely towards the forest. \"As for… these entities… we will request analysis of recent satellite imagery of the area to try and identify unusual movement patterns or unregistered camps. If there are physical traces nearby, we can collect samples for analysis.\" He hesitated. \"Regarding the sounds… installing recording equipment is possible, but requires planning and resources that must be approved. And even then, linguistic analysis of unknown material is a long, uncertain process. But if we record something, we can consult neighbouring ethnic groups to see if they recognize the language or have histories of conflict/communication with the isolated group.\" \n\nGalvão intervened, ending the conversation. \"Let's make a report now. The Amazon Military Command will be notified today, along with FUNAI headquarters. They will decide the next steps and the allocation of additional resources, if deemed necessary.\" He glanced at his watch. \"We will certainly have measures in place within a few weeks.\"\n\nWeeks. \n\nThe word echoed in the silence that followed, cold and inadequate. The white man's world, with its reports, requests, and response times, seemed dangerously disconnected from the night of horror we had just survived and the palpable fear that it would repeat in a few hours. Help had arrived, but it was already leaving. \n\nAt that moment, one of the tribe's elders, not the oldest, nor the wisest, but the one who found the courage to break the silence, stepped forward, his hands trembling slightly. \"Commander,\" his voice was low but charged with desperate urgency. \"With all respect to your orders… they are not loggers. They don't follow laws. You saw our faces. You heard our accounts. They were here. You cannot… you cannot leave us alone tonight.\"\n\nGalvão barely waited for the elder to finish his sentence.\n\n“I understand your concern. Truly. But my orders are clear, and my jurisdiction is limited. There is, at this moment,\" he gestured to the silent forest, \"no physical evidence of an imminent threat that justifies leaving a permanent detachment here. We have other areas to patrol, other demands. Resources are limited.\" He paused, perhaps noticing the absolute desperation in our eyes. \"What I can guarantee is this: we will keep a dedicated radio channel open directly with my base, 24 hours. Any… I repeat, any sign of return of the activity you described, use the Red Herald code immediately. We will have a rapid response team on standby.”\n\nFour hours later, the perimeter sweep was completed. No traces or materials were found. At 16:58 [4:58 PM], we watched, powerless, as the soldiers climbed back into the flying machines, their heavy boots marking our sacred ground one last time. The helicopters lifted, raising another storm of dust and leaves, then moved away, becoming ever smaller dots in the indifferent blue sky, until only the tense silence and the buzz of insects remained. \n\nThey were gone. And night was coming. The abyss between our world and theirs had never seemed so vast, and we were left on the wrong side, alone.\n\nWhile the elders began to murmur ancient prayers and check the makeshift fastenings on the ocas, the eyes of the younger ones turned again to the small communications hut. In recent years, many men and women from the city had come to us – professors, researchers, students with their notebooks and recorders, curious about our stories, our plants, our language. Some had shown genuine respect, a more attentive ear than the officials. With fingers flying over the satellite terminal keyboard, a frantic search began for names, for emails, saved phone numbers, sending short, urgent messages, fragments of the horror we lived through, appeals for any kind of guidance or help that didn't involve waiting weeks for a report.\n\nOne of the first lines dialed returned the call 30 minutes later. It was Leandro, an ethnohistory professor from a federal university, a man who had spent months with us years ago, mapping our oral narratives. \n\nHis call was short, direct: he was doing fieldwork with another riverside community, some two hundred kilometers from us by river – far, but perhaps not impossibly far. The university would never arrange transport in the necessary time or circumstances, but he offered help if we could find a way to bring him here. \n\nA new wave of urgency took hold. Kael picked up the radio again, his voice firmer this time, calling Galvão's frequency. He explained the situation, the professor's offer, the need for an air pickup to bring him to us. On the other end, Galvão's response came with an alacrity bordering on enthusiasm. \n\n\"A civilian expert? Who already knows you? Excellent!\" There was almost palpable relief in his voice. \"I can divert a smaller helicopter returning to base. Give me his exact coordinates. Consider it done. It's good to have an academic on-site to evaluate this… complex cultural situation. Keep me informed.\" The ease with which he agreed confirmed our suspicions: for Galvão, this wasn't just help; it was a convenient transfer of an incomprehensible and troublesome problem into someone else's hands. But, at that moment, it didn't matter. A new, fragile hope was on its way.\n\nThe small helicopter returned perhaps an hour before the sun began to dip behind the tallest trees, its singular sound less oppressive but charged with a different expectation. From the open door descended Leandro, his familiar face marked by the fatigue of the hurried journey and a genuine concern that contrasted sharply with Galvão's detached efficiency. But he hadn't come alone. Behind him followed two other men, also dressed in the practical, worn clothes of those who spend more time in the field than in offices. \n\nLeandro introduced us to Carlos, a linguist with a sharp gaze that seemed to analyze even our silence, and Rafael, a historian whose specialty was precisely the gaps in history, the peoples and events left out of official records. They had been together on a survey in a community several hours away by boat, documenting traditions dying with the elders. These men gave up their rest, their return to their families in the city, moved by something the Commander might not fully understand: a mix of academic duty, the irresistible pull of the unknown, and the solidarity forged over years of working alongside the peoples of the forest.\n\nWhile the soldiers had brought brute force and rigid protocols, Leandro and his team brought equipment of a different nature: high-sensitivity recorders, cameras with night vision capability, directional microphones, extra batteries, waterproof notebooks. They listened to our account again, not with apathy or skepticism, but with focused intensity, asking precise questions. To them, the contact attempt by an isolated group in that manner – not fleeting, but invasive, ritualistic, charged with alien emotion – was a seismic event, something challenging everything known or theorized.\n\nThey recognized the sanctity of the non-contact rule, the need not to cross the border. But they also understood that if the border was breached again by them, by those entities of the night, the world needed to know. It had to be recorded – their images, their incomprehensible voices. And, amidst the backpacks of recording equipment, there was something else, unpacked discreetly but without apology: two tranquilizer dart pistols, the kind used by veterinarians and biologists to safely sedate large animals, and a few stun grenades, which produce intense light and loud sound to disorient. \n\nNot the soldiers' weapons of war, but tools from their own experience in the deep forest, useful perhaps against dangers they understood – a cornered jaguar, maybe, or an unexpected encounter with invaders. As Rafael checked the mechanism of one dart pistol, the soft click echoing strangely, I saw our Pajé lower his gaze to the ground, while another nearby elder briefly closed his eyes, an almost inaudible sigh escaping his lips. They said nothing. They didn't need to. It was the same silent language used when a child asks a question that shouldn't be answered: a tacit acknowledgment that, while they respected the professors' intent, they knew in their spirits that darts and bright lights might be like throwing pebbles into the fog against the shadows that wept.\n\nWith the sunlight fading fast, painting the sky orange and purple over the canopy, a new dynamic settled over the village. Leandro, Carlos, and Rafael worked with quiet efficiency, positioning their equipment at strategic points. Sensitive microphones were mounted on unobtrusive tripods, aimed at the forest edge like attentive ears; night-vision cameras, small red eyes blinking in the twilight, were fixed to makeshift posts, scanning the approaches to the clearing. There was a professionalism in their movements, but also a restrained tension. \n\nThey spoke in low voices, trading hypotheses – perhaps a rare acoustic phenomenon, mass hysteria induced by some unknown environmental factor, or, the most intriguing and dangerous possibility, a genuinely unexplained manifestation of the isolated peoples. While their scientific minds might doubt the oily tears and shifting shapes, they did not doubt the genuine terror in our eyes, nor the magnitude of what such an event represented: any unilateral breaking of the silence by an uncontacted group was a historic and potentially catastrophic occurrence. They needed data, evidence.\n\nAs darkness swallowed the village, the plan for the night was set. Kael, with his knowledge of technology and the nervous courage of youth, volunteered to stay in the satellite hut, our only fast link to the outside world – and to Galvão's promise of rapid return. He took one of the researchers' walkie-talkies with him, the antenna extended. Leandro kept the other, a direct but fragile link across the dark distance between the isolated hut and the village center where he'd set up his observation post. \n\n\"Anything, Kael,\" Leandro said, his voice firm but his eyes betraying apprehension. \"Any strange noise, any movement on the cameras I might miss from here, anything out of the ordinary… call immediately.\" The constant hum of the recorders was a counterpoint to the night sounds beginning to stir – the chorus of insects, the croaking of frogs, sounds that the previous night had been precursors to horror. That night, no one would close their eyes. The elders prayed quietly in their hammocks, while the researchers checked connections and batteries, each immersed in their own tense vigil, all waiting, heart tight, for what the forest would bring when the darkness was complete.\n\nThe hours dragged by on that second night, each minute an eternity. Outside, the forest breathed, but the familiar sounds seemed distorted by our apprehension. Leandro, Carlos, and Rafael kept watch in one of the larger ocas, the camera monitors casting a ghostly glow on tense faces, headphones capturing every amplified crackle or whisper. The coffee pot was long empty. Our women and elders murmured prayers in low voices, a fragile counterpoint to the researchers' technology. \n\nKael, in the satellite hut, broke the radio silence every fifteen or twenty minutes: \"This is Kael. Nothing at my position. How about there, Professor?\" Leandro's reply was always the same: \"All quiet here, Kael. Cameras clear. Recorders registering only… the night.\" But with each call, Kael's voice seemed a little tighter, Leandro's a little more weary.\n\nIt was 2:45 AM when the tension snapped. A low beep sounded from Carlos's laptop, a red square flashing over the icon for Camera 4 – the one watching the northwest sector, near the forbidden trail to the igarapé. Everyone's breath caught. Eyes fixed on the grainy, greenish image from the night vision.\n\nIt was Kael.\n\nHe was outside the communications hut, walking in slow circles near the edge of the trees. But something was terribly wrong. He didn't look scared or alert. His head was tilted towards the invisible sky. His face, when the camera briefly caught it up close, was contorted in a wide smile, almost a grimace, and his lips moved rhythmically, as if telling a long, silent joke to the stars. \n\nAn icy dread swept through the oca. Was he... laughing? A silent, continuous laugh. Kael's mother, in the same hut as us, let out a muffled sob. \"He wouldn't do that… he's afraid…\" Leandro grabbed the walkie-talkie. \"Kael! Kael, copy? What's going on out there?\" Only static answered. An error beep from the radio display confirmed: No Signal. Out of Range. But he was right there, less than a hundred meters away, laughing alone at the darkness.\n\nA thick, horrible silence fell over the hut, broken only by Kael's mother's quiet weeping. No one knew what to do. Then Rafael, the historian, acted on impulse. \"He's not well! It could be a psychotic break from the fear, we have to help him!\" He grabbed one of the tranquilizer dart pistols, pushed open the woven palm door, and ran into the night. \n\n\"Rafael, wait!\" yelled Leandro, snatching the other radio and a powerful flashlight, rushing after his colleague. \"Carlos, lock the door! Monitor everything! We'll be right back!\" \n\nAll of us – Carlos, and the terrified villagers – were glued to the monitor. We saw Leandro reach Rafael near Kael's hut. We saw Kael turn towards them, still wearing that wide, wrong smile, and begin to… sing? A low, guttural sound, in no language we knew. Then, with sudden, unnatural agility, he turned and ran, not towards the village, but into the dense darkness of the forbidden woods, disappearing from the camera's view. \n\nLeandro and Rafael hesitated for an instant, then followed him. Their flashlight beams danced among the trees and vanished.\n\nOnly the audio remained. We could hear Kael's strange, guttural song, now more distant. And then, the horror solidified.\n\nA second voice joined his, hesitant at first, then stronger. It was Rafael's voice. A few seconds later, the third voice, Leandro's. All three were singing together now. But it was no longer Kael's guttural sound. It was a complex, polyphonic chant, full of dissonant harmony and a deep, almost geological sorrow. \n\nThe words were impossible, full of clicks and guttural pops, but undeniably sung with a hideous mix of agony and ecstasy. We heard laughter mixing with sobs within that alien song. Carlos tried to go after them, but the strongest men of the village held him back, their eyes wide with ancestral terror. \n\n\"Don't go! We cannot lose another one!\"\n\nThat profane chorus continued through the predawn hours, seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere, until, just like the night before, it began to unravel and fade with the first pale rays of dawn. \n\nNo one slept. No one moved until the sun was high in the sky.\n\nWhen the clock in the hut struck eight in the morning, the elders finally nodded. Carlos, myself, and a few other young men went out, armed with machetes and fear. \n\nWe searched around the hut, on the trail, at the edge of the woods. Nothing. Silence. It was Tari, who had gone straight to the communications hut to check the terminal, who let out a high-pitched scream that cut the air like a blade. We ran there.\n\nLying on the packed dirt floor, in a tight, unnatural embrace, were Kael, Leandro, and Rafael. Their eyes were open, glazed, and on their faces… a smile. Wide, serene, almost happy. They were cold. Dead. \n\nOn the computer monitor, the satellite call program screen showed Galvão's number, dialed repeatedly, the connection never completed.\n\nLater, the Army medical team, arriving with Galvão less than an hour after our new, desperate call, would determine the cause of death: all three, simultaneously, had suffered a massive myocardial infarction. A collective heart attack, in the dark of the forest, while smiling.\n\nThat was last night. \n\nIt is now 15:46 [3:46 PM] the next day. The news of the deaths of two university professors and an Indigenous man, found embraced and smiling, spread like wildfire through the white man's world. Except in the media, somehow. \n\nBut our village is no longer ours. It is full of uniforms, white coats, people with badges and blinking equipment. Federal Police, the Army in full force, Galvão's entire team, medical examiners, psychologists, and even that organization they call the Cacique Cobra Coral Foundation, whose members watch everything in silence, with eyes I cannot decipher, are here. \n\nMore than three hundred strangers here, setting up tents, analyzing every leaf, every recording, using machines they say can think to decipher the sounds of last night. Galvão's relief is gone, replaced by a grim mask of concern and curt orders.\n\nBut night is coming again. The birds are quiet today, in a way I do not like. Tari doesn't speak, just weeps quietly in a corner. \n\nThey – the white men in charge – chose me. They asked me to stay in the communications hut tonight. They gave me a vest, a camera on my chest that they say transmits everything live to a command room in Brasília and to someplace called langley, via a new antenna they put up in a hurry. They gave me a dart pistol. They say I am the 'first line of observation'.\n\nI know what that means. I know I am going to die tonight. They don't tell me what they've found out, but I am the only one here who understands their language when they speak quietly, thinking no one is listening. I heard one of the Foundation men talking to Galvão on the radio just now. His voice was calm, cold. He said: \"Yesterday, same time frame, an alert came via Interpol. An anthropology team in New Guinea made an emergency contact. A local uncontacted group surrounded their camp. \n\nThey were… weeping”. \n",

        "content": "I didn’t want to write this. The words don’t come easily to me. But on the advice of my therapist, I’m willing to try. She thinks it will help. And at this stage, what do I have to lose?\n\nShe told me to just be honest and not worry about what anyone thinks of the quality. With that in mind, maybe this will be written and stuffed into a dusty drawer or a folder marked ‘For my eyes only…Actually, for nobody’s eyes only. Ever’. I don’t know. I’ll give it a go. So here goes. Here’s what I remember:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMy name is Chris and I’m 44 years old. At about 3pm on August 14th 2016, myself, my younger brother David and my two sons, Lucas and Billy, aged 11 and 10 at the time, entered the line for the *Stampede* roller coaster at *Golden Spur Adventure Park* near Charlotte, North Carolina. Any theme park fans can skip the following description but for those who aren’t part of the white knuckle brigade (and I count myself amongst their flock), Stampede opened on May 3rd, 1993 and was a hypercoaster - that’s a rollercoaster with a height or drop of 200 ft or more. Track length or top speed can vary (5,057 ft and 72 mph for Stampede, if you want to know), as long as the all-important height of 200 ft is met. Stampede wasn’t the world’s first hypercoaster - that belonged to *Magnum XL-200* in *Cedar Point*, and I promise that’s the end of the coaster trivia - but it had one crowning distinction: it was the first hypercoaster to be near enough on my doorstep.\n\nI watched it being built. My schoolbus passed Golden Spur everyday; a cruel joke if there ever was one, to be ushered past a place of utter joy and delivered to a place of utter despair. Everyday my friends and I would gawk out of the windows, hoping to see more of the gleaming purple track reach up into the sky. There was always a slight disappointment on the rides back from school if we couldn’t see any progress, though we’d always disagree. *It’s definitely got higher*, I said. *What? It’s just the same. They need to hurry the fuck up*, Brian said. He was my best friend at the time. But as May 1993 neared, the construction seemed to go into overdrive, almost as if the construction workers were hurrying to satisfy us. Everyone showed their appreciation by gawking through the glass even more. Everyone, except for Philip.\n\nPhilip was in our group but very much on the periphery - literally. Whenever we hung out, he’d always stand slightly apart from us, as if worried that if he stood any closer we’d notice him, realize we didn’t need him and then cast him out. He was an awkward kid. Bad clothes, bad face and physique. He didn’t smell but we didn’t shut down the rumors to the contrary. I went to his house once, forced to by Mom who pitied him and had promised his mother I’d visit, and I remember smirking when I found out he still had an ordinary Nintendo well into the era of the Super Nintendo. I told the rest of the gang and we laughed, no doubt when Philip was standing just a few feet away. He probably forced a laugh himself to fit in. Yes, he was very much on the periphery and we did everything we could to keep him there.\n\nMy friends knew why Philip would only sneak quick glances at the rollercoaster. *Does it scare you, Philly?* Peter T would ask, adding a stretching, whining sound to turn ‘Philly’ into *‘Phiiillllyyy’.* Whether he was scared or not was irrelevant, though I suspected he was. He was the weakest of the group so he was the easy target. Whenever we passed the giant steel snake looming on the horizon, we’d return to our favorite subject. *You won’t go on it. You’re too much of a pussy*, Charlie B shouted. *I will. I’m not scared*, Philip would shout back and we’d all laugh.\n\nWe didn’t have to wait long to test whether Philip was a pussy. On May 1st 1993, as part of a big press event to celebrate the rollercoaster’s launch, Golden Spur invited local schools, including ours, to come and ride Stampede. It was going to be the best day ever. And Brian cooked up an idea to make it even better.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nJust after 3pm on August 14th, 2016, my younger son Billy whined.\n\n‘*Eighty minutes*? Do we really have to wait eighty minutes, Dad?’\n\nHe had just spotted the digital sign that showed the line waiting time and now his enthusiasm for riding Stampede - an enthusiasm that woke me up by diving onto my bed at 6:30 a.m. - had waned.\n\n‘Don’t worry, it will be more like forty and it will move fast.’ I knew Golden Spur operations were solid - operations referring to the efficiency of the staff at loading and unloading passengers, a crucial factor that affects waiting time. Again, I’m a theme park fan. Plus they were running two trains on the track. No way it would be eighty minutes. But my confidence didn’t convince my son who gave me an unsure look.\n\n‘I promise,’ I added.\n\n‘OK,’ he said, looking at the ground.\n\n‘Yeah it will definitely be forty’, Lucas said. I smiled. My oldest had a habit of taking my side in almost everything.\n\nI felt vindicated when we turned the corner and arrived in the first section of the snaking line to find it was empty.\n\n‘See, what did I tell you? Thirty minutes tops.’ But before Billy could acknowledge he should have more faith in his dad, he and his brother ran off, rapidly ducking their heads underneath the wooden beams that formed the line barrier.\n\n‘I remember doing that at their age,’ David said. ‘My back would scream at me if I tried now.’\n\n‘Mine too.’\n\nMy brother and I took the more dignified approach and threaded along the entire path, left and right, left and right. Billy and Lucas giggled at us. We must have looked ridiculous to them, walking up and down the empty line, obeying the rules like stiff robots, when no one was around to tell us otherwise. *Wait till you’re our age boys,* I thought.\n\nAfter we caught up with the boys and they led us through a few more empty lanes, we finally arrived at the back of the line - or more precisely, at the back of a group of sweaty teenagers whose shirts stuck to their skin. From here the line led to a staircase which climbed to the second floor aka the boarding area, where people would huddle around their desired riding row. The fearless would gather at the front row, but fellow rollercoaster fans would always gather where the best g-forces were to be found: right at the back.\n\nAs the ride ‘boarding and dispatch’ area was above us, we’d hear the clamber of feet rushing onto the ride through the roof , followed by the hydraulic hiss of closing shoulder restraints and then excited whoops and exaggerated screams as the coaster’s brakes were released and the train rolled out of the station. Then the people on the first floor would catch sight of the riders, some thrilled, some terrified, as the train dipped down, turned a corner and began its long climb up the first drop. This process repeated itself every ninety to one-hundred and twenty seconds, provided the Golden Spur staff were on form, and on that day it looked like they were. *Definitely thirty minutes*, I thought.\n\n‘How long does it take to climb to the top, dad?’ Lucas asked. He tried to sound as nonchalant as possible, but I could tell his nerves were starting to fizz. Indeed, I knew days before, when he asked me ever-so-casual questions - *erm, how long does it last? ... How high is it?* \\- that he wasn’t keen on the coaster, unlike his daredevil younger brother. But there was no way he was going to gift him the everlasting bragging rights of being the sole rider while he watched from the sidelines.\n\n‘How long? Twenty seconds, if that,’ I said. It was more like thirty-five, but for some reason that number sounded too high and I didn’t want to give his nerves the fuel they needed to bail. Sometimes a kid needs to hear a little lie to push themselves. He nodded, buying my fib, and went back to talking to his brother.\n\nDavid gave me a wry look.\n\n‘You know he’ll count it as we go up,’ he said quietly.\n\n‘By then it will be too late. Am I a terrible father?’\n\n‘The worst.’ He smiled and folded his arms over his big chest. ‘Shall we do this one, then the log flume, then get something to eat?’\n\n‘Sounds good.’\n\nDavid and I then chatted about how the Knights were sucking that season, a conversation subject we’d deployed numerous times before. My brother and I loved each other but we weren’t close and in those kinds of relationships you need pull-in-an-emergency topics. The Knights’ woes were a reliable go-to of ours. After a couple of minutes we’d exhausted the subject and settled into an agreed, well-earned moment of unembarrassed silence.\n\nI wished he’d kept it going, but when I saw him stare at the teenage boys ahead of us I knew what he was going to say before he even said it.\n\n‘Hey, do you remember…\n\n‘Don’t,’ I said, shooting him a cold, *shut-the-fuck-up* stare that came out of nowhere. He shut the fuck up and nodded, instantly catching my meaning. *Not in front of my sons, David. I know what you were talking about, but not in front of them*.\n\nOur silence became awkward and we’d used up all our baseball ammo. The truth was I had been thinking about *it* too since I’d spotted the teenage boys. They were a gangly bunch much like my friends. I hadn’t thought about it at all much over the years. Things that feel like they’re going to be forever burned into your brain fade away with time and its companion, maturity. Would I have thought about it if the teenage boys weren’t there? To my shame, probably not.\n\nBut I think it was around then, in that silence with David - and I can’t be 100% sure because this is where my memory becomes hazy - that I felt what I can only describe as a profound sense of disquiet. That word might seem too slight, but that’s what it was. Not agitation, certainly not dread. Disquiet. And I found its presence in the place of utter joy disturbing enough.\n\nI put it down to seeing the teenagers and remembering what David was clumsily referring to, but even then I knew it couldn’t be explained by mere guilt for past actions. I felt the guilt in my stomach, but the disquiet, that wasn’t inside me. That was outside, in the air, lurking around.\n\nThen again I might be remembering this all wrong. I might have been laughing and joking the whole time in that line and felt zero disquiet whatsoever. It was over eight years ago. Maybe I’ve made it up. At least that’s the lesson my therapist tries to teach me; that I’ve - and I’m paraphrasing her - “Created a fiction where I was mystically forewarned over what happened to compound my feelings that I could have avoided it.” Maybe she’s right. But I don’t think so.\n\nAnother train left the station and the line moved forward.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI never believed Brian created his idea. I figured he stole it from some other kid in some other school who probably stole it from another kid in some other school. But when he pitched it to us in the lunchtime cafeteria, checking beforehand that Philip wasn’t around, we didn’t care about who the legitimate author was, we only cared that it sounded like the coolest, funniest prank ever.\n\nThis was ‘his’ idea: Stampede had a purple-coloured track. That meant it had purple-coloured nuts and bolts. So what if we got hold of some nuts and bolts, painted them purple, then one of us sits next to Philip on the ride, and as we’re climbing up we sneak the nuts and bolts out from our pocket, show them to Philip, and tell him that we just found them underneath his seat. Imagine the look on his face when he thinks his seat isn’t bolted on right. He’ll shit his pants!\n\nIt was genius and more importantly it didn’t require a lot of effort from a bunch of lazy thirteen year olds. Peter volunteered to source the nuts and bolts from his dad’s tool shed and Charlie said he could supply the paint and the labor; that made sense as he was the best amongst us at art, though slapping on some cheap purple gloss wasn’t exactly going to stretch his burgeoning talent.\n\nThat left someone to fill the role of ‘one of us’ - i.e the person who would sit next to Philip and be the prank’s front man. There wasn’t much discussion on that job. I was viewed as the funniest of our group and the most theatrical, though that boiled down to being in the school play. I didn’t object to carrying out the prank. In fact I jumped on the offer, knowing that it would go down as one of the all-time best and I’d be at the center of the glory. Yes, despite my therapist’s protestations, I was a real asshole as a kid. No, it’s not true that all kids are. Some are on the side of decent, I was firmly lodged on the other side.\n\nA few days before our school’s visit to Golden Spur, Peter and Charlie completed their tasks and I took delivery of three shiny purple nuts and three shiny purple bolts. I then had to carry out the next phase of the plan: making sure Philip rode Stampede with us. That meant being both extra friendly to him and allaying any concerns he had about riding. I thought the best approach was to be direct.\n\n‘Dude, you’re going to go on Stampede with us, right?’ I asked him in Wednesday morning science class. We never called him ‘dude’ and I could see a vague sense of suspicion come over his face, but it was pushed out by a stronger desire to finally be included.\n\n‘Erm, yeah. I’m not scared of it,’ he said, convincing nobody.\n\n‘I know you’re not, dude.’ I instantly knew that was one too many ‘dudes’, but before his suspicion returned and he smelled a rat I made him the offer he couldn’t refuse.\n\n‘Would you sit next to me?’ *Boom*. Whatever concern he had vanished in a big grin.\n\n‘Yeah sure,’ he said, pulling his grin back a touch so he didn’t look too keen.\n\n*Awww, he thinks he’s part of the gang*, I thought.\n\n‘Where do you want to sit?’ I asked.\n\n‘Erm, I don’t mind.’\n\n‘I don’t want to sit at the front. I’d shit my pants.’ That was a clever touch. Show him you’re the pussy. Get him on side. Win his trust. Yes, I was a real asshole back then.\n\n‘We could sit in the middle?’ He said.\n\n‘Yeah good idea.’ Great idea, Phil. A perfect location; center stage where there’ll be no hiding from our laughter as we all disembark and see your shitscared face.\n\nFor the next few days, I was Phil’s best buddy. I made sure he was never alienated and my friends were able to push their acting abilities, smiling, laughing and playing pals with him the whole time. Then May 3rd, prank day, arrived. Our year climbed on board three coaches and I sat with my bestest friend Philip on the twenty five minute drive to Golden Spur, laughing with him all the way.\n\nThree shiny purple nuts and three shiny purple bolts stuffed into my right pocket.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‘Billy, get down from there.’\n\nHe’d been copying one of the teenage boys who’d been sitting on top of one of the wooden barriers. Billy jumped down. The teenager stayed sitting, then slumped down ten seconds later - an amount of time which told me he had decided to come down on his own volition, and not because he heeded the words of a stern man. I smiled to myself. I would have done the same.\n\nWe were now on the boarding floor. There was a marked increase in people’s joy from the first to the second floor. Walking up the stairs felt like entering a higher atmosphere of excitement. The train was in sight. People were edging forward, filling in the spaces between each other more quickly than downstairs. Ride time was almost here.\n\n‘Are you OK boys? Excited?'\n\n‘Yeah,’ Billy said.\n\n‘Yeah, dad,’ Lucas said. He didn’t look as nervous now. Excited adrenaline was winning the battle over freaking-out adrenaline. My lie was worth it.\n\nBilly started pulling himself up on the barrier, performing his own versions of tricep dips. Then he’d jump down, take a step forward when space appeared, and pull himself up again. I let him do that. His energy had to go somewhere.\n\n‘Where do you boys want to sit?’ David asked. ‘Front row?’\n\n*Great. Just when Lucas’s nerves had settled. Thanks bro*, I thought.\n\n‘Erm, we could do…’ Lucas said, but I could see his mind screaming *fuck that*.\n\n‘I’ll sit in the front,’ Billy said, providing his brother with no help. I offered a get-out.\n\n‘There’s lots of people waiting for the front. We’ll be here at least another fifteen minutes. Let’s just sit in the middle.’\n\nDavid got my point and backed me up. ‘Yeah let’s just do the middle.’ Lucas failed to hide his relief.\n\nWe walked forward, just two snake lines from the boarding area. I gazed up at the metal roof and grimaced: the faded purple beams were speckled with chunks of dirty, discolored gum. Golden Spur operations obviously hadn’t pushed themselves to attain a one hundred percent cleanliness record. I wondered *how the hell did the gum get up there?* and *how many years has it built up?* Maybe kids in my year had been the first to christen the beams. I certainly didn’t, I wouldn’t dream of being that bad. It’s amazing to think that my oh-so precious moral code would draw the line at hurling gum but was fine with the prank.\n\nPhilip. My mind returned back to him. *I* *wonder what he’s doing now?* Then I thought, *duh, you know you can check.* I took out my phone, brought up Facebook, typed his name into the search bar and narrowed the search filters to ‘Charlotte’. Of course there were quite a few Philips, but I knew what my one looked like, adjusting for aging. I scrolled down and spotted a black and white, somewhat pretentious photo of a mid forties man with a thin face, glasses and hair that was fading fast. I dialed back this man’s face twenty years in my head and it more or less matched the Philip I knew. That’s got to be him. I clicked his profile.\n\nAnd that disquiet I felt earlier turned all the way up to dread.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was grateful the right pocket on my shorts had a zipper. If it hadn’t the purple nuts and bolts would have fallen out, especially as we ran, near enough sprinted, all the way from the park’s entrance to Stampede. I made sure Philip was right beside me, slowing down or encouraging him to keep up if I thought he was falling behind.\n\nWhen we got to the ride, puffed out and already sweating through our shirts, we were thrilled to find the place surrounded by TV news cameras. My mum would tell me later that morning news reporter Gloria Hanford had ridden Stampede and a camera positioned right in front of her face showed her shrieking the whole way. We waved at the cameras as we ran through the entrance, not knowing if they were filming, but promising ourselves we’d watch the news - for the first time ever, no doubt - to see if we were going to be famous.\n\nWe almost threw ourselves under the wooden barriers, tackling each one like inverted hurdles. Then it was straight up the stairs and onto the second floor, where eager Golden Spur staff - or at least the ones who could do their best impression of being eager - greeted us. A few more hurdles to duck under and then we were at the track. I quickly counted the rows - there were fourteen of them - and I led Philip straight to number seven, slap bang in the middle. My friends were either side, the really cool kids of our year amassed at the front, and the rest slotted into whatever rows were left.\n\nAnother news camera on the opposite platform filmed us boarding. We waved and the cameraman waved back with a lot less enthusiasm. Then an empty train rolled into the station and our whooping and hollering blasted out.\n\n‘Shit, shit shit!’ Brian said, his face bursting with excitement. We each swapped final knowing looks and I performed the ostentatious move of patting my pocket. Philip didn’t notice. He was watching the train come to a stop, the nerves he’d denied sparking inside him.\n\n‘Don’t worry, dude,’ I said. He gave me a weak smile.\n\nThe shoulder restraints jolted up, the gates opened and we barged on board. Then we pulled down the restraints, hearing that gear-crunching sound only roller coasters make\n\n‘You good, pal?’ I asked, deliberately swapping out a ‘dude’.\n\n‘Yeah all good.’\n\nTwo attendants scampered down both platforms, thrusting the restraints deeper into our bodies if they suspected there was the tiniest chance of us being able to breathe. Luckily they didn’t push down too hard on mine; luckily because I didn’t want my circulation cut off, and luckily because if I was restrained any more I wouldn’t have been able to reach into my pocket and take out my props. What a catastrophe that would have been.\n\nA staff member’s voice came over the PA system: ‘Welcome James Oakland High…’ There was a cheer across the station. ‘...You are about to ride Golden Spur’s newest attraction, Stampede. Reaching speeds of 72 mph and a height of 206 ft, prepare yourself to face the brutal power of the mighty beast of the Great Plains.’ He wasn’t the greatest actor, but we weren’t the most discerning critics and we just lapped it all up. ‘Keep your arms and legs inside the…'\n\nOur attention flat-lined the moment he read the mandatory safety briefing. Then ten seconds later the hydraulics hissed, the train rolled out, and we exploded into cheers. As we turned the first corner, I unzipped my pocket and took a firm grip of the contents inside. They dug into my palm, not going anywhere. We then inclined forty-five degrees back and began the climb, the morning sun warming our faces.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*‘I’m so sorry Philip…Wish I could have been there for you…I’m in utter shock. Reach out to me if anyone wants to talk.’*\n\nYou didn’t need to be a detective to realize that the comments on Philip’s Facebook pointed to him committing suicide. The funeral had taken place at St Christopher’s Church, January 14th 2014, just over two years ago. The invitation, written by his parents, was posted on his wall and showed an enlarged version of the same black and white photo from his profile. That explained what I had dismissed as pretentiousness; this was the artistic, dignified photo people use of their loved ones for their funerals.\n\nI felt a sudden rush of guilt, coupled with a need to dive in and learn everything I could about Philip in an attempt to fill in the last twenty-something years. I tapped on his photos. There weren’t many. A shot of him in an office somewhere doing some office job. Him and a couple of friends out at a bar. No wife, girlfriend or boyfriend for that matter. I then looked at the comments and noticed there weren’t many of those either. The guilt inside of me stirred. It didn’t seem that Philip had lived much of a life. I turned to David.\n\n‘Erm, that thing, what you were going to say before…’\n\n‘Yeah, sorry about that,’ he said.\n\n‘No it’s fine. Erm, did you know about…Philip?'\n\nHis head tilted back and let out a deep sigh. ‘Yeah I did. Horrible wasn’t it?’\n\n‘I just found out,’ I said, keeping my voice low. ‘Fucking Facebook.’\n\n‘Shit, really? Yeah it was bad.’ He then saw what I was thinking. ‘Hey, don’t be thinking…you know…’\n\n‘I’m not,’ I said. But I was thinking just that. At least the irrational, paranoid side of me was. That was saying *you might not have caused it, but you didn’t exactly help, Chris. You served him an appetizer of shit in the twelve course taster menu of shit that was his life.* But then the rational side, the one that says you’re not the center of the universe and that people move on, forget things, shake off the past (a side whose voice funnily enough sounds very much like my therapist’s), that side said *what you did had nothing to do with what transpired some twenty years later. Frankly Chris, get a grip*.\n\nWe were almost at the boarding rows.\n\n‘Dad, you were right. Thirty minutes on the dot,’ Lucas said, showing me his phone’s clock.\n\n‘Oh yeah, I was.’\n\n‘Are you OK?’ My perceptive son could always tell when I wasn’t.\n\n‘Yeah fine. Just thinking about what we should go on next.’\n\n‘The log-flume,’ Billy squealed, his mind now racing towards the next source of fun.\n\n‘Sounds good,’ I said.\n\nA train pulled out of the station, cheers and pretend screams following behind it. We filled in the space in the middle boarding rows. David and I were in row eight, Lucas and Billy were in row seven …\n\nRow seven. It lit up in my mind. And suddenly the dread swam around me. I could feel it everywhere, distinct and undeniable. I felt the sudden urge to grip the wooden barrier tight, worried that if I didn’t I might faint. David saw my face. I imagined it had turned gray.\n\n‘Bro? You OK?’\n\nI nodded, trying to compose myself. ‘Yeah, just a bit of a shock.’\n\nBut the dread was suffocating. My irrational side was banging pans together in my mind.\n\nAnother train came in, stopped and its shell-shocked passengers disembarked.\n\nWe boarded.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‘Phil! Holy shit, Phil!...’\n\nI should have been the lead in the school play. My performance was perfect.\n\n‘...Are these from your seat?!’ My hand revealed my props. ‘I just found them on the floor!’\n\nWhen spitballing the prank, we were pretty sure Philip would be scared. We didn’t think however he would experience abject terror. If we had, would we have gone through with it? Probably, yes.\n\nI remember his eyes flicking rapidly from the nuts and bolts in my hand to my mock concerned face. Then he jolted his head forward to try and look underneath his seat, but the shoulder restraints kept him in place. Then the color rushed out of his face.\n\n‘St…Stop the ride.’ He almost whispered the words, as if he were too embarrassed to say them out loud. In my head I thought, *say them louder Phil. Let’s hear you scream them*. \n\n‘Please…Stop the ride.’ He managed to push some volume out of his narrowing throat, but not enough to beat the loud *click-click-click* of the roller coaster’s chain, and certainly not enough to satisfy us. Then came a real proper cry:\n\n‘Please! Help! Help me!’ That was more like it. We started giggling. Philip looked at me, his eyes turning white. I could tell he was thinking, *he’s not helping me, he’s not helping me!* And that’s when the real horror set in. He started thrashing wildly against his restraints, his body convulsing with pure, blind panic.\n\n‘Let me out! PLEASE! Let me out! HELP!’\n\nAnd then whatever residual embarrassment he had left in him disappeared because that’s when he screamed. It was an unashamed, desperate scream that no one could argue was funny. Our giggles, which we had kept to a respectable volume, suddenly turned way down. We didn’t think it would be like this. This wasn’t the cartoony depiction of fright we had imagined. This was horrific. He screamed and screamed, like a man being dragged to his death, which I suppose he thought he was. The scream was ear-piercing. I suddenly felt the need to bring the show to an abrupt end, if not to save my hearing.\n\n‘Philip, it’s just…’\n\nBut that’s when we reached the top, our inclined bodies shifting from forty-five degrees to ninety and back to forty-five, and we went over.\n\nOur collective screams were no match for Philip’s. He felt death teasing and prodding him through every twist and turn, every corkscrew and every helix. There was no excitable adrenal rush for him, just sheer awful horror. The ride lasted one hundred and seventy-six seconds for us. I’ve no idea how long it lasted for him.\n\nAs the train slowed, I could hear him whimpering and saw tears on his red cheeks.\n\n‘Phil, it was just a joke. You were OK.’\n\nHe didn’t respond. I didn’t know if he could hear me or if he was just ignoring me. Brian and Charlie, having not sat where I was and not been up-close spectators to the horrific meltdown, began to resume their giggling. I tried to twist my head and give them a look, but the restraints stopped me from turning.\n\nThe train pulled into the station. The restraints released. I got out and turned back to Philip.\n\n‘I swear, it was just…’ And that’s when I realized why he hadn’t said anything to me. His light-red shorts had turned dark-red, a stain moving from the crotch all the way to the hem.\n\nBrian was the first to laugh. Charlie followed a second later. Then everyone crowded around, wanting to see what was so funny. Philip tried to cover the stain with his hands, but it was too big. With whatever dignity he had left, he forced himself out of the train and that’s when the laughter exploded into manic hysterics.\n\nHis front stain had a twin. Just a little one, but enough.\n\nEveryone pointed and howled. He looked at me. To this day I’ve never known a look of such painful betrayal. Then he fled. Out of the ride, out of the park. I think he phoned his Mom who picked him up.\n\nBrian and Charlie looked like they were going to pass out from laughing. I pretended to laugh - I knew it was wrong - but I still pretended anyway. Then as we walked out of the ride, we were treated to a final curtain call of unforgettable comedy: the Ride Photo booth.\n\n‘Oh my god! Look!’ Brian said.\n\nThere on the screen was Philip, his agony captured for all of us to enjoy again.\n\n‘Shall we buy it?’ Charlie asked.\n\nI had to draw a line. We had our fun. Time to grow a fucking conscience.\n\n‘$3.99? No way. Let’s just go do the log flume.’\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd now here we are: the part I really don’t want to write. But I will. I must.\n\nI wasn’t cheering as we turned the first corner and started the climb. Everyone else was, my kids certainly were. I remember just being very still, almost as if I didn’t want to spook anything.\n\n‘You OK?’ David asked, his face wrought with worry for me.\n\n‘Yeah I’m good.’\n\nI shut any conversation down. I just wanted to do the climb, go over the top, give a few token yells of tepid joy and get to the goddamn log flume.\n\nStampede’s chain, slick with oil and grease, dragged the train up the track. *Click-click-click-click*. A voice in my head told me to relax. *Just enjoy the ride*.\n\nWe were about a quarter of the way up when I heard the first sound - a clanging noise of metal hitting metal. I couldn’t tell where it had come from, but I knew it was close and I didn’t like it. Then there was Lucas’s voice:\n\n‘Dad…what was that?’\n\nThrough the gap in the headrest, I saw him look down at the bottom of his seat. I could only see half his face, his brown hair hanging over his cheek, but I could tell he’d gone completely white.\n\n‘Dad?’\n\n‘What’s wrong?’ I shouted, but somehow I already knew. Another metal clang. That was number two. \n\n‘Something’s…Something’s falling on the floor.’\n\n*I don’t want to write this.*\n\nThere was this unspeakable fear in his voice. I can hear it now.\n\n‘Daddy…help!’\n\nThe third clang. Then Lucas’s chair began to rattle. We were almost at the top. I think I said ‘it will be OK.’ A final stupid lie I told my son and then we went over.\n\nYou’ll have to imagine the rest. I can’t do it. Besides, you could always read the official report, if you’re so inclined. According to investigators, seat 7A - Lucas’s seat - was ejected from the train due to ‘insufficient component bonding’ i.e the nuts and bolts fell off…Three shiny purple nuts and three shiny purple bolts fell off. Make of that what you will. God knows I have.\n\nA year or two later, Stampede was demolished.\n\nIn truth, I can’t remember too much after the drop. They say one’s brain shifts making-happy-memories down the priority list when you’re in a trauma situation. I do remember flashes though: coming into the station, an awful sound of whaling coming from people I didn’t know, clawing at my restraint, screaming at David to stay with Billy, running out of the station in some dumb attempt to find Lucas and maybe make him whole.\n\nI might also struggle to remember because that day happened over eight years ago now. My brother and I have drifted further apart, but my marriage has clung on. We avoided the *death-of-a-child* equals divorce cliche, but when Billy leaves for college and the house is quieter, we’ll probably succumb to it. He’s become a fine, young man, by the way. There was a year or two of nightmares, some therapy, but it hasn’t defined him. His life is full of new things, new friends, new distractions, things that can’t help but push the old into a corner. When I ask him if he thinks of Lucas he says ‘all the time’, but I think he’s lying to make me feel better. I’m not angry at him, I envy him. His brother is going one way in his life, receding into the past, further and further, while he’s moving into a bright, big future.\n\nI think of him though. Not every day, but most, and when I do the thought is accompanied with the same pathetic question: *did I cause it?* Over the years I’ve reached ninety-percent for ‘no’, that it was just a horrendous coincidence, not cosmic revenge. But ten-percent stubbornly remains and it’s connected to one memory from that day that refuses to fade away in time, a detail my therapist would love for me to rationalize and just let go: I’m running out of the station, past the Ride Photo booth, my eyes flick to the screens, and in the space where Lucas and his chair were meant to be, right beside my terrorized Billy, a face looks right at me. Philip's face. He smiles. I suspect I’ll still remember that smile when I’m an old man and I don’t remember much of anything else.\n\nEvidently, some things just can’t be forgiven.",

        "content": "[ Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/L6a0aLbYzC ]\n\nIt’s been just over a week since I saw her sprint at me in the garden—just over a week since her limbs jerked like meat on strings and her voice curled around me like frost.\n\nWe haven’t spoken about it. Not really. Not out loud. But we all felt it. Something changed that night. Something finally slipped.\n\nThe thing wearing my mum’s skin isn’t pretending as much anymore.\n\nShe still cooks. She still folds our clothes. But it’s all pantomime now. Like a mask trying to hold its shape under pressure. The smile she puts on is too wide. Her teeth, too white. The grin holds for seconds too long, like she’s forgotten how faces work.\n\nShe stares when she thinks we’re not looking. Slow, glassy-eyed stares that lock onto you like a mounted deer head. Still. Soulless. But always smiling.\n\n••\n\nDad knows now.\n\nHe doesn’t say much. He doesn’t have to.\n\nI came down the morning after the garden sprint and found him sitting at the table, a half-drunk mug of tea cooling in front of him. Hands trembling. Eyes red.\n\n*“She was in the hall,”* he muttered. *“Didn’t say anything. Just… stood there. Watching me sleep.”*\n\nHe hasn’t shaved since.\n\nHe still goes to work. Still pretends. But he hasn’t looked her in the eye since that night. He flinches when she brushes past him. And once, when she laid a hand on his shoulder, he jerked away like he’d been burned.\n\nHe won’t eat if she’s in the room.\n\n••\n\nMy little brother Jamie sleeps in my room now. He just turned ten last week. We didn’t celebrate.\n\nHe doesn’t talk about her, but I catch the way his eyes track her every movement. Like he’s waiting for her to pounce. Sometimes he whispers to himself when she’s near—words I can’t make out, muttered prayers or made-up rules.\n\nHe holds his breath when she hugs him.\n\nHe used to draw all the time. Dinosaurs. Rockets. Monsters.\n\nNow he draws our house. Over and over. Every window blacked out. Every door sealed shut.\n\n••\n\nThings happen in the house now.\n\nThings we pretend we don’t hear.\n\nLast Tuesday, just after midnight, the hallway went silent. Too silent. The kind of hush that comes before something breaks.\n\nThen the sound of running. Fast. Heavy. Sprinting up and down the hallway, back and forth, back and forth—bare feet slapping the floor like wet meat.\n\nAnd the clicking.\n\nLike someone cracking their knuckles. But louder. Joints unhinging. Popping and snapping like cheap plastic. Every step sounded like it might tear something loose inside her.\n\nDad sat in the dark, clutching a cricket bat.\n\nJamie sobbed into my shoulder.\n\nAnd just when it seemed like it would stop, she began humming.\n\nThat same soft tune she always used to hum in the kitchen. The one from the pancake mornings. Only now it was slower. Drawn out. Notes warped and wrong, slurring into each other like her tongue didn’t quite remember the shape of them.\n\nIt didn’t stop until dawn.\n\n••\n\nShe’s stopped blinking again.\n\nI timed it the other day—sixteen minutes. Just standing at the sink, staring out the window, motionless. Lips curled in that hollow smile.\n\nWhen she finally blinked, it was slow and laboured. Like her eyelids were sticking. Like they were trying to remember how.\n\nThen she turned her head to me, sharp and sudden—just like that first night—and said, *“Would you like toast, sweetheart?”* in a voice so chipper it made my stomach twist.\n\nI said no. She smiled wider.\n\nHer teeth are changing. I swear they are. Smaller, more square. As if they’re growing to fit a different mouth.\n\n••\n\nSometimes she talks to the mirror.\n\nNot in her voice. Not in any voice I recognise.\n\nJust noises. Wet, rattling syllables that never quite form words. Her mouth moves too fast or not fast enough. I caught her once, whispering something low and urgent into the hallway mirror, hands pressed against the glass like she was trying to crawl inside.\n\nWhen I stepped closer, she stopped.\n\nShe didn’t turn around. Didn’t say anything.\n\nBut in the reflection, her smile grew wider.\n\nAnd she blinked at me once. Very slowly \n\n••\n\nThe house smells wrong.\n\nSweet at first—like overripe fruit—but there’s rot underneath it. Something damp and sour that clings to your clothes, sinks into your hair. The air’s thick, like the breath of something sleeping too close.\n\nIt’s strongest when she walks past.\n\nI think she brings it in with her.\n\n••\n\nBut the worst was what happened to Dad.\n\nA few nights ago, he locked himself in his room.\n\nHe hadn’t slept in days. He told me quietly, almost ashamed, that he was going to put something against the door. *“Just in case,”* he said.\n\nI nodded.\n\nThat night, I heard something moving in the hall.\n\nThen came the knock.\n\nNot at my door.\n\nHis.\n\nA slow, polite knock. Followed by her voice, sing-song and sweet:\n\n*“Darling. I know you’re awake.”*\n\nNo response.\n\nA pause.\n\nThen the voice again—more insistent:\n\n*“Don’t be shy.”*\n\nThen silence.\n\nThen a ***thump.***\n\nLike she’d thrown her body limp against the door.\n\nThen came the scratching.\n\nNot loud. Just slow, dry, delicate. Like fingernails across wood. Back and forth, back and forth. Soft as breath.\n\nIt didn’t stop. Not for hours.\n\nWhen it finally did, I opened my door and tiptoed down the hall.\n\nHis door was ajar.\n\nInside, the curtains had been torn down. The bed flipped. And scratched into the inside of the wardrobe, over and over again, were the words:\n\n***SHE KNOWS YOU KNOW. SHE KNOWS YOU KNOW. SHE KNOWS YOU KNOW.***\n\nDad hasn’t spoken since.\n\n••\n\nNow, Jamie won’t leave my side.\n\nAnd she’s started crawling.\n\nJust after dusk, I heard it.\n\nNot footsteps. Not pacing.\n\nDragging.\n\nLimbs moving too slowly. Too long. Fingers scrabbling across the floorboards like they didn’t belong to her. I peeked out my door and saw her crawl across the hallway—shoulders jerking, hips twisted wrong, her chin grazing the floor like her neck didn’t have bones anymore.\n\nShe stopped outside Jamie’s room.\n\nSat back on her knees.\n\nAnd whispered:\n\n*“I just want to tuck him in.”*\n\nHer head turned toward me.\n\nOne vertebra at a time.\n\nSmile still frozen. Still hungry.\n\n••\n\nI slammed the door.\n\nWe didn’t sleep.\n\nShe’s still down there now.\n\nWaiting.\n\n—————\n\nYesterday dad disappeared, he told me he was going to speak to her just last night.\n\nWe were upstairs. The hallway was dim, the air stale. He hadn’t shaved in days. His eyes were glassy and red-rimmed. When he spoke, it was quiet—like he was ashamed of the words leaving his mouth.\n\n*“I have to try,”* he said.\n\n*“You can’t,”* I told him. *“You’ve seen her.”*\n\nHe shook his head. *“Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe she’s still in there. Something’s taken hold of her, but it might not have taken everything.”*\n\n*“She’s gone.”*\n\nHe didn’t answer. Just pulled the sleeves of his jumper down to his wrists, like that might protect him.\n\nThen he went downstairs.\n\nI stayed on the landing. I couldn’t go with him. I didn’t want to.\n\nShe was in the kitchen, crouched in the corner like she’d collapsed there—arms hanging loose, knees bent at the wrong angle. She was facing the cupboards. Not moving. Not swaying. Just… crouched. Like an insect waiting to unfold.\n\n*“Em,”* he said gently. *“It’s me.”*\n\nShe didn’t turn.\n\n*“I know something’s happened. I know you’re not well. But I love you.”*\n\nStill, no response.\n\nHe stepped forward. The floor creaked.\n\nAnd then she straightened. In one long, twitching motion—like her spine was remembering how to work. Her head rolled to one side, her neck cracking. When her face turned toward him, she was already smiling.\n\nHis voice broke, beginning to cry.\n\n*“I just want my wife back.”*\n\nShe stepped close. Her fingers twitched at her sides. Her jaw shifted like it didn’t quite sit right on the hinges.\n\nShe leaned into him. Too close. Her face brushing his ear.\n\nShe whispered something.\n\nI don’t know what. I didn’t hear it. But he listened.\n\nAnd that night, after dinner, he walked out the back door and never came home.\n\nHis shoes were still by the coat rack.\n\n••\n\nLater that night, Jamie screamed.\n\nI ran to his room and threw the door open.\n\nHe was on the bed, trembling. Pale. Pointing under the frame with shaking fingers.\n\n*“She was under there,”* he gasped. *”I could see the top of her head.”*\n\nI checked. Nothing there. No sign of her.\n\nBut the air under the bed was cold.\n\nAnd the carpet smelled like meat gone bad.\n\n••\n\nShe’s hiding in places now.\n\nI’ve caught her peering from the airing cupboard, face half-shielded by towels. I opened the wardrobe and found her crouched among coats, staring out from between hangers with that wide, slow smile—just watching.\n\nI don’t think she blinks anymore. Not unless she’s pretending to.\n\nShe never pretends for long.\n\n••\n\nSometimes, I see her in mirrors. Just for a second—behind me in the hallway, at the end of the stairs. Her face too still. Her arms too long.\n\nJamie says he’s seen her head peeking around the bannister. Upside-down. Hair hanging like ropes, smile stretched as far as it will go.\n\nShe moves like she’s enjoying it now.\n\nNot hiding.\n\nPlaying.\n\n••\n\nThings started turning up in strange places.\n\nOne of her teeth on my windowsill. A twist of her hair inside Jamie’s pillowcase. Her wedding ring in the freezer, wrapped in a strip of clingfilm like meat.\n\nShe never says anything.\n\nShe just smiles.\n\n••\n\nThe stairs creak differently now.\n\nHeavier. Like something dragging itself up them.\n\nShe doesn’t walk anymore.\n\nShe crawls.\n\nFast. Loud.\n\nHer limbs slap the steps like wet meat. Her joints pop and click with every motion. It’s like she’s falling forward with every movement but never lands.\n\nAt night, Jamie and I listen from my room.\n\nThe rhythm of her crawling is steady now. Familiar.\n\nLike the ticking of a grotesque clock counting down to something only she understands.\n\n••\n\nTwo nights ago, Jamie whispered, *“She’s hungry.”*\n\nI tried to ask him what he meant, but he wouldn’t answer. He just buried himself under the covers, shaking.\n\nI heard her laugh through the wall.\n\n••\n\nWe locked every door and window that night.\n\nBut just after three in the morning, I heard the hallway cupboard creak open.\n\nI got out of bed, slowly, and pressed my ear to the door.\n\nThere was nothing at first.\n\nThen, from behind the door—too low to be human—came a whisper:\n\n*“Knock knock…”*\n\n••\n\nI backed away.\n\nThe scratching started again—light at first, then more frantic.\n\nFrom under the bed.\n\nFrom inside the walls.\n\nShe’s everywhere now.\n\n••\n\nAnd Jamie is gone.\n\nHe was beside me when I fell asleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, the bed was cold.\n\nNo scream. No sound.\n\nThe door was still bolted.\n\nBut there—by the crack under it—was a fingernail.\n\nHis.\n\nStill bleeding.\n\n••\n\nI ran. Searched every room.\n\nThe kitchen was dark.\n\nThe cupboards were open.\n\nThe hallway smelled of that syrupy, rancid rot.\n\nBut he was gone.\n\n••\n\nNow I’m alone.\n\nShe’s knocking again.\n\nNot on the door.\n\nOn the floorboards beneath me.\n\n*Soft.*\n\n***Insistent.***\n\nShe’s not pretending anymore.\n\n",

        "content": "I used to love sitting on my front porch, gazing at the mountain full of trees spread out before me. Each season gave me a new appreciation for the beauty of nature. Even winter (which I hate) would color my trees in the most pristine white, making them look like a crowd of bridesmaids dressed in their spotless gowns, waiting for their bride.\n\nMy favorite season was fall. The explosions of colors laid out like a gigantic quilt that changed from one day to the next until the last leaf floated to the ground and surrendered to winter.\n\nI could sit there for hours watching. Time would slip away as I admired my trees in total contentment.\n\nThat was before.\n\nI haven’t looked at my trees in a long time ever since…\n\nIt was a beautiful spring day. The blossoms on the trees were full of color right before the leaves unfurled their brilliant spring green.\n\nThere was a stillness in the air. Usually, the wind blows nonstop down the mountain to varying degrees of strength, but it’s always there.\n\nOn this day, there wasn’t even a puff of breeze.\n\nIt felt good since the temperatures were only in the lower seventies, but something about it seemed off.\n\nMy trees stood silent, unmoving as if they had also noticed the stillness and were awaiting some unseen harbinger of ill tidings.\n\nAs usual, I took solace from such thoughts by admiring my trees. As I panned through the colorful buds about to emerge, I saw something I didn’t expect. One of the trees moved.\n\nIt wasn’t much of a movement, just a subtle twitch of a branch. I shrugged it off as a rogue breeze, but it was only in that one spot. None of the trees around it had moved.\n\nThis drew my attention, and I focused on the offending spot. It was around fifty yards away, just into the tree line near a field.\n\nI picked up my binoculars which are my constant companion when I sit on my porch, to spot various birds and other oddities. I focused on this oddity to see if it was merely my imagination.\n\nZooming in on the offending branch, it seemed to be nothing out of order at first. But as I gave it my full attention, I noticed something odd. There were no buds on the branch.\n\nAs strange as that was, the next observation I made was the branch was straight as an arrow. Intriguing, but hardly conclusive. But there were several other small branches growing straight up out of it. None of these had any buds either.\n\nThese facts swirled through my mind creating half baked conclusions, when without warning, the branch moved. I watched with rapt fascination as the branch moved straight up. It wasn’t like a breeze had caught it and waved it around as branches are wont to do. It went straight up, staying completely level as it was before.\n\nThis curiosity captured my total attention as everything around me ceased to exist until I solved the riddle of the moving branch.\n\nFanciful thoughts of Ents sprang from the favorite stories of my youth and well into adulthood. I smiled at the foolishness of such machinations. I knew my mind was having a bit of fun with me. It was the only conclusion that made any sense. This entire foray had been my mind playing tricks on me.\n\nIf only that were the case, I would tell this story with the mirth of an old man spreading flights of fancy.\n\nI was about to put down my binoculars and take my mind inside for a nap, where it could venture out into a proper dream when the branch did the impossible. It moved sideways.\n\nIt was like I was watching a timelapse of the branch in its growing cycle, only none of the smaller points on the branch grew, it only got longer.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\n\nAt the end of the branch, there was a head.\n\nI’d seen lots of animals during my time sitting on my porch. Bears, Mountain lions, skunks, Coyotes, but I’d never seen anything like this.\n\nIt looked like the bare skull of a deer. There wasn’t an once of skin on it. It was several sizes bigger than the largest deer skull I’ve ever seen. It peeked around the corner and its hand grasped the tree. It was skeletal as well. But the worst part was, it was looking right at me with its empty eye sockets. There weren’t any eyes I could see.\n\nMy mind didn’t give me a minute to ponder if this was a figment of my imagination. I was out of my chair, inside, and locking the door behind me before I knew I’d even gotten up.\n\nThe last thing I remembered was how high up on the tree the head was. It must’ve been close to eight feet tall.\n\nI ran through the house, locking all the doors and windows, wondering how much good it would do if that thing decided it wanted in.\n\nMy closest neighbor was a mile away, and I began wondering if this wouldn’t be a good time to visit.\n\nWhile I stood in the middle of my kitchen, panicked and indecisive about what to do next, I realized, to my horror, that I had left my binoculars on the porch.\n\nThe thought that this nightmare of a monster would run up and steal my binoculars was totally ludicrous, but if I wanted to check through the window to see if it was still there, they would be quite invaluable.\n\nConvincing myself to retrieve them was another matter.\n\nI slowly approached the window that looked out onto the front porch, as if it were the monster, waiting to grab me and drag me to its lair.\n\nWith great trepidation and using more than my fair share of courage, I stepped to the window and peeked out through the curtain.\n\nMy initial reaction was pure joy as I no longer saw the monster in the tree line. I began chuckling to myself for the prank my mind had played on me and making all sorts of excuses for what the apparition was.\n\nThe smile fell from my face when I saw it standing in the middle of the field. Not only was it far beyond the horror my imagination had presented, but it was a good twenty yards closer to my house.\n\nThe nightmare stood easily eight feet tall and had a massive rack of horns that went straight out in either direction at least three feet. What I could see of it was skeletal. There was no skin at all, except for the cloak that was draped over its shoulders and fell to mid-calf. The cloak looked rough like it had been made from the skins of other animals.\n\nThose unholy, empty eye sockets were staring straight at me.\n\nI froze as terror gripped me and squeezed every ounce of fluid out of my bladder.\n\nIt took a step towards me, then another. I knew there was no way I’d make it across the driveway to my car before it caught me and tore me to pieces.\n\nMy mind started throwing out anything and everything it could. Call someone, was the most plausible.\n\nI pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed 911.\n\n“911, what’s your emergency?” came the wonderful sound of rescue.\n\n“I… I’m being stalked by something,” I said.\n\n“Something? Or do you mean someone?”\n\n“No, it’s definitely something.”\n\n“Ok, describe this something for me.”\n\nI gave the best description I could of the monster, not daring to look out the window for confirmation of my details.\n\n“Uh, huh,” the operator said. “Well, give me your address and I’ll send over a cryptid hunter as soon as possible.”\n\n“Oh, ok, my address is… “\n\nThe line disconnected.\n\n“Hello?” I said desperately.\n\nI tried calling back, but it just kept ringing.\n\nHiding didn’t seem to be an option. It was obvious from the animal skins it wore that this thing was a good hunter. I assumed that meant it had a good sense of smell and would be able to sniff me out of any hiding place in my house.\n\nMy next option was to leave. I went to the kitchen and grabbed my car keys, hoping to slip out unnoticed.\n\nThose hopes were dashed when I looked out and saw the monster walking up my driveway.\n\nI ducked behind the door, eyes darting all around looking for anywhere to hide. To this day I don’t know why, but I ran to the drawers and grabbed a butcher knife.\n\nWhat good it was going to do against a monster that was entirely bones, was beyond me. But I wasn’t exactly calmly thinking my options through at the moment.\n\nThe first crash splintered my outside door. The second crash destroyed it.\n\nThe monster ducked its head and stepped inside my mud room, staring at me.\n\nI had three options. Run to the living room, go upstairs, or down to the basement.\n\nI have no idea why I sprinted toward the basement door. I shut and locked it behind me as the inside door broke into pieces.\n\nMaking my way down the steps as quickly and quietly as possible, I listened to the floorboards creak above me.\n\nLooking around the semi-finished basement, with just enough room to stand if I ducked my head, I quickly discovered that there were no clear-cut hiding places. The footsteps above slowly made their way back to the living room, then up the stairs.\n\nFor a brief, fleeting moment, I thought about going back up to the kitchen, when the basement door flung open.\n\nThe steps groaned under the weight of the monster, and I was overwhelmed by the stench of death. I ran back the short hallway toward the outside cellar door, but I knew it was too heavy for me to open from the inside.\n\nStanding there, helpless, like a deer in headlights, the oil furnace kicked on. It had been a nice day, but the furnace still kicked on from time to time to keep the temperature where it was set at. It didn’t run for more than a minute before turning off.\n\nThe oil tank sat beside the furnace, with both of them set a short space away from the wall.\n\nI dashed over behind the furnace and tried to stuff myself between it and the wall, making myself as small as possible in hopes that it might not see me.\n\nIt wasn’t long before I heard the scrape of bone on the concrete floor, getting closer.\n\nMy life expectancy had shrunk to a matter of seconds.\n\nI wondered if anyone would ever know how I met my gruesome end. Or would my story be a mystery? An urban legend like so many others that live near forested areas and suddenly disappear, never to be seen or heard from again.\n\nThe sniffing was my death knell. It drew closer as the horns appeared in front of me. My only advantage was the horns couldn’t fit between the oil tank and the furnace.\n\nI celebrated a small victory that this hellish monster would at least have to put forth some effort in order to get me.\n\nIt struggled to reach behind the furnace, almost reaching me. The only thing that stopped it was leaning against the furnace and drawing back as it cried out in pain from the heat. Realizing my hiding place was compromised, I darted behind the oil tank. Hoping the bulk of the tank would hinder it, I scooched as far as I could into the corner.\n\nThere was only a small clearance between the tank and the wall, maybe a foot. I knew it couldn’t get in here, but that didn’t mean it couldn’t reach me. Its arms were incredibly long.\n\nI watched as it seemed to be confused as to where I’d gone. The sniffing started again as it tried to locate me. But it seemed to be having problems. The fill pipe for the oil tank had a small leak. I’d wrapped rags around it, but there was still some oil in the rags. It seemed like the smell was throwing it off.\n\nFor one brief moment, I saw it take a few steps away from me and my hiding place. It seemed like by some miracle; I might be saved.\n\nIt turned back toward the steps and seemed like it was leaving.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nJust then, it stopped, turned, and came straight toward the oil tank.\n\nIt slammed its bulk against the tank, making the metal groan from the stress. It backed up and slammed into it again. This time I could see the metal bracket that was bolted into the cement to keep the tank in place, start to bend.\n\nI didn’t think such a thing was possible, but after the third slam, the bolt broke. The tank teetered precariously toward the furnace. One more slam and the front bracket broke. The tank listed on its side, falling in slow motion toward the furnace.\n\nAs the tank fell, the intake pipe broke loose. There was now an opening at the top of the tank that was slowly falling toward the furnace.\n\nHalfway down, heating oil began splashing out of the opening. The monster didn’t seem to care. It had caught sight of me and was pushing the tank down to get to me.\n\nI had to stand, or the tank would’ve crushed my leg.\n\nAs soon as I did, it let out the most ungodly roar. If I hadn’t soiled myself earlier, I would’ve then.\n\nI was stuck. It was checkmate. I was trapped in a corner, with an oil tank and furnace blocking my way on one side and a murderous unholy abomination on the other.\n\nAs the tank came to rest against the furnace, it ripped off the side, exposing part of the firebox. Somehow, I’d discovered another horrible way to die. The oil was dripping down the side of the furnace and into the firebox. The intermittent nature of the oil furnace had kept me safe for the moment as it wasn’t currently running.\n\nBut it was only a matter of time. The oil dripping out of the tank was making an ever-expanding puddle on the floor. I tiptoed further into the corner to stay away from it, but the monster was climbing over the tank and was almost able to reach me. It didn’t matter what I did, I was about to die.\n\nIts skeletal fingers, brushed my shoulder, trying to get a grip. In sheer panic and desperation, I did the strangest thing I think I’ve ever done.\n\nI took the knife that I’d carried with me from the kitchen, shoved it through the arm bones of the monster, and then straight up with every ounce of strength into the ceiling. To my great joy, the knife buried itself in the space between the wooden boards and stuck.\n\nThe monster squealed and pulled back on the offending appendage, causing more damage, but not breaking free.\n\nIn my moment of triumph, the most unexpected and wonderful thing happened… the oil furnace kicked on.\n\nI watched in fascination as the oil that the monster was standing in ignited. The flames quickly engulfed it as it squealed in pain. I scrambled over the downed tank as the fire came towards me.\n\nJust before I hit the concrete floor, the monster reached out to grab me. My side was instantly on fire and for the briefest of moments, I thought it had me. But instead, it tore a gash in my side.\n\nI didn’t bother to look down at the damage, just ran up the stairs, and out the door, not stopping until I was in the car and speeding down the road.\n\nWhen I finally got my breathing under control, I pondered where I was going, aside from away from certain death.\n\nI reached down and touched my side, pulling away with a hand covered in blood.\n\nIt seemed like my destination was set for me. The hospital it was. Being twenty minutes away from the nearest town, I wondered if the monster had killed me anyway. Bleeding to death would be better than being eaten, but I’d still be just as dead.\n\nAround ten minutes into my trip, I saw flashing lights heading towards me and heard the siren of the fire truck as it sped past, heading up the hill. I assumed they were going to extinguish my house and hoped that the monster was already dead.\n\nThe thought of it killing unsuspecting firemen almost made me turn around to go warn them. But I knew I’d never catch up with them, and if I tried, it would possibly be the last thing I ever did.\n\nThe thought of losing all the things I’d collected over the course of my life saddened me. But being alive to feel the sadness was its own reward.\n\nThe worst part of knowing that I would never go near that house again was, I’d miss my trees.",

        "content": "Growing up, I lived in a pretty Christian household. Parents reading Bible stories to me as I fell asleep, grandparents taking me to church every Sunday, and other things in a similar vein. As I got older, I started to move away from religion and started to look at the world through a more scientific lens. Now, though, I have reason to believe the Christian God does exist.\n\nRecently I've been pretty bored with my life; everything is moving at a snail's pace with no exciting events coming up. That's where I got the amazing idea to pray to God. It wasn't a normal prayer, though; instead of thanking God for all my blessings and whatnot, I asked a singular favor.\n\n\"God, please open my eyes, allow me to see everything I wasn't supposed to, allow me to see everything hiding among us. In Jesus name, Amen.\"\n\nAt the time, I didn't think much would come of it. I peacefully went to sleep that night with my sanity intact and woke up the next morning with absolutely no change. I went about my normal Monday morning routine of chugging a coffee, eating breakfast, smoking a joint, and taking a shower in preparation for the day ahead. When I was locking my front door as I was leaving for work, I noticed a tall, sickly-looking figure standing at the tree line just across the street from my home. As soon as my gaze focused on the location of where the figure was supposed to be, it vanished. At that point I chalked it up to my hair getting in my eyes mixed with the fact that the sun had just started to rise and it was foggy, not even remembering the prayer I had made the night before.\n\nThe rest of the day was uneventful, an average workday, and a long commute back home as expected. I arrived at home around dusk, dragging my feet along the concrete of my driveway out of exhaustion. When I got to my door, I noticed the same exact figure in the same exact location as it was this morning. Except this time when I focused my gaze on where it was, it didn't instantly vanish. Instead, it quickly did a sidestep-esque motion and darted out of view. I still hadn't remembered the prayer from the night before, but I was a little disturbed. The next morning I followed the same routine without incident, and this time the figure wasn't observing me from the tree line. What did happen was objectively more horrifying, though. I got in my car and inserted the keys into the ignition as I checked my mirrors, and what I presume was the same figure from the previous day was standing right at the end of the driveway. This time I could get a good glimpse at its features before blinking and it disappearing; it was unearthly pale, almost glowing from the peeking sun shining down on its skin, with matted and messy hair accompanied by its blank, dead eyes and its frown stretching down to its chin, showing off its chipped, yellow, jagged teeth off in the process.\n\nI was rightly terrified, shuffling to put my car in reverse, stomping on the gas doing so. I was contemplating seeing a psychiatrist before thinking back to 2 nights ago, when I prayed that prayer. The prayer and sighting of what I now classified as a demon haunted my psyche for the rest of the day. As I arrived home, I rushed to my door and frantically unlocked it, not even checking my surroundings to see if the demon was waiting for me to arrive. Every room I entered, I turned the lights on; even when exiting, I didn't turn them off. I even ended up sleeping with a nightlight next to my bed. The next day *mostly* went off without a hitch. No tree line figures or car mirror demons today. When arriving back home, I chuckled at the thought of a demon stalking me of all people.\n\nThat was until I attempted to sleep; as I was drifting off into unconsciousness, I heard three consecutive knocks on the window behind my bed. I jolted awake, looked at my window, and it had the writing \"Don't be afraid\" engraved into it, but not from the outside; it was engraved from the inside. I was too scared to sleep in my bedroom, so I grabbed a pillow, the revolver sitting in my nightstand drawer, and proceeded to sleep on the couch. Even then it took hours for me to fall asleep, and that was reflected by how groggy and tired I was upon waking up. As I entered the bathroom to brush my teeth and shower, the light was turned off, even though the previous night I had left it on. For a split second after the lights came on, I could see those same dead eyes staring directly into me through the mirror. I gasped and stumbled backward, shaking with fear. As I got up, I could see the mirror, and the demon was gone, but now it was inside my house, possessing it. With my deteriorating mental and physical condition, I should have called out sick to my job, but I couldn't bring myself to be in the same home as the thing that was stalking me. On my way to work, I called my friend, Thomas, to see if he wanted to come over and have a few drinks after I got off work, thinking it'd be a good way to ease my anxiety from this ordeal, and maybe if he could see it too, I'd prove to myself that I wasn't going crazy.\n\nAfter work I picked him up from his house, catching up on the drive to my place as it'd been a while since we talked.\n\n\"So how do you like living alone? Doesn't it get lonely at some point?\" Thomas inquired.\n\n\"Yeah, it does. Why'd you think I invited you over?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because there's a demon stalking you, and you feel crazy.\" Thomas replied.\n\nI let my foot off the gas until we came to a stop. I looked over at Thomas, and his body was elongated, with his head turned at a sharp 90-degree angle to fit inside, almost like his neck was snapped. When I looked at his face, though, when I looked at his face. He had the exact dead eyes and teeth of the demon that had been stalking me, the same unearthly pale skin. Except in this instance the demon wasn't frowning; it was smiling from ear to ear as its chapped lips dripped blood. I jumped out of the car and ran and ran and ran and ran.\n\nI'm lost in a forest now, writing this with 1 bar of service and 2 percent battery. It has been 2 hours since I jumped out of the car, and it's pitch black besides the faint glow of the moon and my phone screen. No matter where I look, I see it in the corner of my eyes, and every time I blink, I hear a step being taken on the crunchy, dead leaves below me. It's only getting closer; I'm not sure what it wants with me, but I don't imagine it's pretty. Is there any way to ward it off?  Please, don't end up like me; don't ask God to open your 3rd eye; it will not end well.",

        "content": "Part 1\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/cEBwPfjs2c](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/cEBwPfjs2c)\n\nI should’ve left the gas station. I should’ve called someone—anyone—but I didn’t. Instead, I stared into the bathroom mirror, willing my reflection to blink.\n\nIt didn’t.\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut, counting to three. When I opened them again, my reflection was still there, wide-eyed, unblinking. But now it was smiling.\n\nI stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the trash bin. My phone buzzed in my pocket, making me jump. My hands were trembling so badly it took me two tries to pull it out.\n\nUnknown number.\n\nI stared at the screen for a moment before answering.\n\n“Hello?” My voice came out hoarse.\n\nAt first, there was nothing. Then, barely above a whisper:\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\nI froze. The voice was mine. Exactly mine. Same pitch. Same rasp of terror. I turned and stared at the mirror. My reflection was holding a phone to its ear.\n\nI slowly lowered my hand. The reflection didn’t. It just kept staring, grinning wide, the phone still pressed against its face.\n\n“Stop,” I choked out. My voice cracked.\n\n“Why?” she whispered softly into the phone.\nThen she added, almost playfully:\n“I’m already here.”\n\nThe line went dead.\n\nAnd then my reflection blinked.\n\nI sprinted out of the bathroom, shoving through the gas station door so hard the cashier yelped. I barely noticed. My legs were weak, shaking violently, but I ran. Out into the humid night, down the cracked sidewalk. The streetlights buzzed overhead.\n\nSomewhere behind me, I heard the faint sound of bare feet slapping against pavement.\n\nI didn’t look back.\n\nI finally made it to my friend Katie’s apartment. By the time I reached her door, my feet were raw, my breaths coming in ragged gasps. I banged on the door, frantic.\n\n“Jesus, hang on!” Katie’s voice was groggy. It took her a second to unlock the door. When she opened it, her eyes widened. “What the hell—”\n\nI shoved past her, slamming the door shut behind me. I braced my hands against it, panting, trying to catch my breath.\n\n“Katie, I—” I struggled to get the words out. My throat burned. “I need you to lock all the windows. Right now.”\n\n“What?” She blinked, clearly still half-asleep. “What’s going on?”\n\nI grabbed her shoulders. “Just do it, okay? Please.”\n\nSomething about my voice—my face—made her eyes narrow with concern. She nodded and walked through the apartment, locking windows, drawing the blinds. As I found the nearest phone charger.\n\nWhen she came back, she folded her arms across her chest. “Okay. Now tell me what the hell is going on.”\n\nI opened my mouth to explain, but the words caught in my throat. How was I supposed to say it?\nHey, there’s an evil version of me wearing my face and she doesn’t blink.\n\nInstead, I just whispered, “I’m being followed.” \n\nHer face softened. She stepped closer, resting her hands on my arms. “By who? Should I call the cops?”\n\nI wanted to say yes. I wanted to beg her to call 911 and scream into the phone that someone was wearing my face. But what would they do? What could they do? Arrest my reflection?\n\n“No,” I mumbled. “It’s… complicated.”\n\nHer eyes narrowed. “You’re freaking me out.”\n\nBefore I could respond, there was a soft knock at the door.\n\nKatie turned toward it.\n\n“Did you bring someone with you?” she asked.\n\nI shook my head violently. My stomach turned to ice.\n\nThe knock came again. Softer this time.\n\n“Katie, don’t—”\n\nBut she was already walking toward the door.\n\n“Relax,” she muttered, peeking through the peephole. Then she turned back to me, confused.\n“There’s no one there.”\n\nMy mouth went dry. I took a step back.\n\nKatie pulled the door halfway open. \n\nBare, muddy footprints trailed across her welcome mat.\n\nShe frowned. “What the hell—”\n\nThe door ripped open making a ear deafening boom as it and along with Katie slammed into the wall.\n\nBefore i could even comprehend what just happened Katie’s unconscious body was yanked into the hall with such force it had to have broken something.\n\n“NO!” I lunged for her, but something slammed into me—something that felt exactly like my own body.\n\nWe hit the floor hard. I thrashed, kicking and flailing, but my attacker’s grip was inhumanly strong. I craned my neck and stared into my own eyes. My face was stretched in a ghoulish grin.\n\nshe whispered breathlessly into my ear. “Your so much fun”\n\nBefore I could even react both palms of her hands crashed into my ears the pain and the ringing was unbearable.\n\nI fell back putting my hands over my ears as if it could even begin to help with the ringing.\n\nI looked down the hall Katie‘s feet we’re scraping against the hardwood as she was dragged away towards the stairs.\n\n“LET HER GO!” I shrieked\n\nI had to give one last Hail Mary, I mustered up every ounce of strength I had and charged directly into her. Bringing her to the ground a second time, I began to claw at my double’s face. \n\nMy nails tore into her cheek, but she didn’t bleed. The skin just split open like brittle paper, revealing raw, blackened flesh underneath.\n\n“Shhh.” Her voice was soft.\n“You’ll ruin it.”\n\nAnd then she kissed my forehead.\n\nI must have blacked out, because when I open my eyes I was on Katie‘s living room floor.\n\nKatie was gone.\n\nThe apartment was empty. The front door still wide open with the handle indented into the drywall. \n\nI stumbled out into the hall, screaming her name. But there was no trace of her. Just the muddy footprints leading down the hallway and out the back exit.\n\nI ran after them, barefoot and trembling.\n\nThe prints led into the woods behind the complex. I didn’t stop to think—I just kept running.\n\nDeeper and deeper into the trees.\n\nThat’s when I saw her.\n\nKatie.\n\nShe was standing perfectly still beneath a crooked oak tree. Her back was turned to me. I slowed, my heart thundering in my chest.\n\n“Katie?” I called out.\n\nShe didn’t move.\n\nI stepped closer. “Hey. It’s me. Are you—”\n\nShe turned around.\n\nAnd I saw my own face staring back at me.\n\nSmiling.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. My legs locked up beneath me.\n\nI didn’t move.\n\nAs my face was burning into my eyes it took a slow step forward. Her bare feet left black smudges in the dirt. The moonlight glistened off her cracked, peeling skin. Her eyes—my eyes—were wide and glimmering with something hungry.\n\nThat was enough.\nI turned and ran.\n\nI tore through the trees, my bare feet slipping on the damp leaves. Branches lashed at my arms and legs, but I didn’t stop. I could hear her behind me—my footsteps chasing me down. Her breath in my ear.\n\n“Come back,” she cooed softly. My voice.\n“You’re going the wrong way.”\n\nI didn’t look back. I couldn’t. I just ran.\n\nThe forest was darker now, closing in on me. I didn’t know where I was going—I just knew I had to keep moving. My lungs screamed. My legs shook violently. But I didn’t stop.\n\nAnd then, just as I felt my knees threatening to give out, I saw it—\nHeadlights.\n\nI stumbled out of the woods and onto a winding stretch of road. A car was coming. Fast.\n\nI sprinted toward it, flailing my arms. My throat was raw, but I screamed anyway.\n\n“STOP! PLEASE!”\n\nThe car screeched to a halt, tires skidding. The driver—a man in his 40s—threw the door open and jumped out. His eyes widened when he saw me, disheveled and barefoot, trembling violently.\n\n“Jesus Christ—are you okay?!” he asked, voice sharp with concern.\n\nI couldn’t speak. I just nodded frantically, then shook my head. My mouth opened and closed, but no sound came out. My legs buckled. I dropped to my knees on the asphalt, sobbing.\n\nHe crouched beside me, pulling out his phone.\n“Hey, it’s okay. You’re safe now. I’m calling 911.”\n\nSafe.\n\nThe word barely registered.\n\nI clutched his arm with trembling fingers, my nails digging into his skin. I glanced over my shoulder, expecting to see her—my twin, my shadow—stepping out of the trees. Grinning. Reaching.\n\nBut the woods were empty.\nDark and still.\n\nI let out a ragged breath and collapsed into the man’s arms, barely registering the distant sound of sirens.\n\nwoke up in a hospital bed.\n\nThe fluorescent lights made my eyes ache. My head pounded violently, and my throat felt like sandpaper. A nurse was standing beside me, gently adjusting the IV in my arm.\n\n“You’re safe,” she said softly. Her voice was calm, reassuring. “You were dehydrated and in shock, but you’re going to be okay.”\n\nI tried to speak, but my voice cracked. The nurse offered me a cup of ice water. My hands were still shaking when I took it.\n\n“Your friend Katie,” the nurse added carefully.\n“She’s… still missing.”\n\nI squeezed the cup until it nearly cracked.\n\nThe nurse placed a hand on my shoulder. “The police found signs of a struggle in her apartment. They’re doing everything they can.”\n\nI nodded weakly, but my chest tightened. I knew they wouldn’t find her.\n\nBecause she wasn’t missing.\n\nShe was wearing my face.\n\nI stayed at the hospital for two days. I spoke with the police. They asked questions I couldn’t answer. I told them about the gas station, the woods, Katie being dragged away. But I left out the other part.\n\nThe part about her.\n\nI knew they wouldn’t believe me.\nHell, I barely believed me.\n\nThe hospital discharged me into the care of my sister, Lauren. She drove me to her house in the next town over. Her guest room was small but cozy. Warm blankets. Soft lighting. A lock on the door.\n\nShe made me tea and sat with me for hours, holding my hand and speaking softly. She didn’t push. She didn’t ask for details. She just stayed.\n\nAnd for the first time in days, I felt safe.\n\nBut the feeling didn’t last.\n\nThat night, after Lauren had gone to bed, I locked the guest room door. I slid a chair in front of it. My phone was on the nightstand, fully charged. I stared at it for a long time, unsure if I should call the police.\n\nInstead, I walked into the bathroom.\n\nI flicked on the light.\n\nThe mirror was fogged from the shower Lauren had taken earlier. I wiped it clean with the sleeve of my hoodie.\n\nAnd stared at my reflection.\n\nMy face was pale. My eyes were puffy and bloodshot. I was exhausted.\n\nBut I blinked.\n\nI blinked.\n\nI let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding. A weak, shuddering laugh escaped me.\n\nI was okay.\nI was safe.\n\nI turned off the bathroom light and climbed into bed. The mattress was warm. The blankets were soft.\n\nAnd as I drifted into an uneasy sleep, I must have not noticed her, Watching me from the space beneath the closet door.\n\nI knew it had to have been in there, due to the same black mud that was illuminated in the early morning light, ruining the tan carpet that perfectly complemented this now once, comforting, safe, room.\n",

        "content": "My name is Kourtney, I’m 23, and I have a problem. A weird problem.\n\nIt started when I bought my house around 5 months ago. \n\nThe first few days I moved in, everything seemed normal. Well, everything except for the busted air conditioning, but that’s beside the point. \n\nIt was round the end of the second week of living there that it started happening.\n\nThe morning of the first gift, I had gotten out of bed and got going as usual. I got out of bed, fed my cat Misty, and had started my coffee when I noticed a small package on my coffee table.\n\nIt was wrapped in plain white paper with a small sage-green ribbon tied neatly around it.\n\nShocked, I looked all around for the person who had left it. I searched in closets, under my bed and guest bed, even going as far as to check the air ducts. Nothing. No one. I knew it couldn't be any of my friends, nor my parents, as none of them had the code to my front door. \n\nNot wanting to touch it, I got dressed and walked to the cafe down the street, where I’ve been working as a barista for 4 years.\n\nI worked my long 8 hour shift, forgetting all about the package as I talked to my favorite regulars about their grandchildren, how their dog was doing, etc.\n\nWhen the day was over, I walked back home.\n\nWalking through the front door, that’s when I saw it again. The package.\n\nIt was still sitting in the middle of the coffee table where I had left it, except now, there was a small notecard laying next to it. It read “*open me*” in the prettiest cursive I have ever seen.\n\nPicking up the notecard first, I turned it over to see if there was more writing on the pack of it. Nope. I put the card down and picked up the package.\n\nUntying the bow and unwrapping the neatly folded paper, I unveiled a small black box. I took the top off of the box and saw a small pendant, like one you would wear on a necklace.\n\nIt was pure metal with a very detailed flower on it. It looked like a lotus. \n\nTurning it over in my hand, I tried to think about who would have left me something like that, and more importantly, how they got into my house during the night. \n\nI placed the pendant back into the box and left it on the coffee table, ignoring it as I went to the kitchen to heat up some leftover spaghetti. \n\nWhile my food was in the microwave, I texted my best friend to tell her about the package, but her being boy crazy and delusional, she came up with the idea that maybe I had a secret admirer. I just rolled my eyes and decided not to tell anyone else. *It’s no cause for concern, it’s harmless* I told myself.\n\nI grabbed my food and sat on the couch, eating and watching tv while simultaneously scrolling through social media. \n\nAfter an hour and a half or so, I decided it was time for bed. I placed my dishes in the sink, scooped Mitsy off of her cat tree where she liked to lounge, and headed to my room. I locked the door, just as a precaution.\n\nWhen I woke up, I checked the coffee table. Nothing. I checked all around the house. No package in sight. I sighed with relief and continued on with my day.\n\nIt was three days before the next one appeared. \n\nWhen this one showed up, it was a tad bit larger than the last one. Still wrapped in the same white paper, though this one had a royal blue ribbon wrapped around it. There was no note.\n\nOpening it, it was a necklace chain, seemingly for the pendant I had received a few days earlier.\n\nThe gifts continued like this, every three days. However, it was always something different in the boxes.\n\nGift 3: a heart shaped trinket box; yellow ribbon. \n\nGift 4: a piece of polished obsidian; fittingly, a black ribbon.\n\nGift 5: a vintage-looking handheld mirror; pink ribbon. \n\nI gladly accepted these gifts, always saying a quiet “thank you” to whoever had left them.\n\nIt was after the fifth gift that things started to take a turn.\n\nThree days after the mirror, I went to the coffee table to find another package, this time wrapped in black paper with a white ribbon wrapped around it.\n\nNot thinking anything of it, I opened the package - It was a tooth. A singular human tooth with root still connected. \n\nI gasped and dropped the package. I left it on the floor when I went out to work.\n\nWhen I came home, it was back on the coffee table. \n\nThe packages kept coming after that. I tried to ignore them, but when I did, a note with the same handwriting as before would appear, reading “open me” in red ink.\n\nGift 7: the head of a bird; black paper, white ribbon.\n\nGift 8: the eye of a small mammal; black paper, white ribbon.\n\nGift 9: a *human* finger; red paper, white ribbon.\n\nI called the police after this one, and they took it as evidence. They said they would be in touch with me, but I haven’t heard anything since. I gave them the rest of the “gifts” just in case they could track whoever was sending them. \n\nWhen I found the tenth package, I was horrified.\n\nA large kitchen knife, covered in blood; red paper, black ribbon. A note next to it read “no police, no telling” in red ink with the same, beautiful cursive.\n\nI sobbed, screaming “Why are you doing this? Who are you? ***What*** are you?” I got no answer.\n\nI’ve been considering moving but I’m worried it will follow me. Maybe it would move onto the next person who lived here, but I’m too scared to find out.\n\nI haven’t eaten since the knife. I can’t. I can’t breathe. I can’t think.\n\nIt’s been two days after the last gift, and I’m terrified to see what awaits on my coffee table tomorrow.",

        "content": "I got home from the hospital yesterday. It's been an awful few days, to say the least. I won’t tiptoe around this detail, though it’s not something I’m proud of. I’m an addict and have been for a long time. This isn’t the type of PSA you’re thinking of, please bear with me. Don’t get me wrong, drug addiction will ruin your life only to swiftly end it, I’ve seen it tens of times before. But that’s the least of my worries right now.\n\nEveryone has their own way to escape their life. For some, it’s something as innocent as a TV show or a book. Others turn to pleasures like sex or food. Relatively early on in my life, I turned to opioids. I had an injury in high school and got some prescription painkillers. That was the start of it for me. It really does feel like a spider’s web. It’s so easy to wander further down that road, lost in the pleasure and carefree. But leaving again is almost impossible. At least that’s how I feel about it.\n\n2 nights ago, I was spending my time ‘escaping.’ By that, I mean I was in my dark, run-down apartment, sitting on my couch as the TV flickering its light onto me with a band around my bicep and a needle in my forearm. There are many types of opioids. My particular weakness, as I’m sure you can gather, was heroin. I’m not picky about how I take it; snorting, smoking, injecting. As long as I get my high I don’t care. \n\nBut injecting it is instant. As soon as I pressed down on that syringe, my troubles left me. The best word I can use for it is euphoria. My achy body doesn’t hurt anymore. I’m not sad, lonely, or scared anymore. I just feel calm and good. I sank into my couch exhaling all of my worries. It’s sad to say that moments like these were the happiest I had in a long time. \n\nAfter drowning in bliss for a while, my vision started to blur. My breath went in and out more and more slowly. My body felt heavy, like a bag of sand. The TV sounded so distant, like I was hearing it under water. For just a second, I realized what was happening and I remember being scared but it was too late to fight it by then. I died that night, laying there on the couch in my filthy clothes. It was fast and slow all at the same time. I felt my life slipping away. Being pulled away like water draining from a bathtub. Thinking about it now, I’m so ashamed. What a truly pathetic end that would have been. \n\nI’ll skip ahead to answer the question I’m sure you're thinking. I wasn’t dead for very long. By some miracle, my best friend had come to check on me. He found me near death and called an ambulance. But there was an eternity between these events.\n\nI never really put much thought into an afterlife. Why would I? For most of my life, being high was my god. That was the purpose I served and chased after. Sure, I had heard about Heaven and Hell. But not only did I not really believe in them, I didn’t bother to consider them in my daily life. Those thoughts were as far from my mind as they could ever have been. But from what I’ve very recently learned about most interpretations of an afterlife, I think we’re wrong. At least, the Hell I experienced didn’t fit the descriptions I’ve read since I woke up.\n\nMy soul didn’t go to any fiery pits of wailing and weeping, nor cloudy, beautiful skies adorned with angels and harps. In fact, it didn’t go anywhere at all. I think that’s the scariest part to me. I was dead-slumped on that filthy couch and I would’ve rotted there. But I didn’t go anywhere. I was stuck in my own body, a prisoner in a cell of my own meat and bone. I could still feel through my cold skin, see through my glassy eyes, hear the TV chattering across from me. But I couldn’t move. I was stuck looking at my ceiling. Noise was still slow, as if the movie was running at less than half speed. My lungs still burned for air and my eyes screamed for me to blink, but I couldn’t. \n\nI tried to think of a way out of this. Maybe I could will my body to work again. Maybe I could force my lungs to breathe and my heart to beat. But my body wasn’t my own anymore. It felt like I was trying to push down a house while numb on succinylcholine- fully awake, fully aware, but locked inside a body that refused to obey. After what felt like years of struggling I gave up.\n\nThis allowed for panic to fill me. I was dead. They were going to bury me. Or worse, cremate me. I thought I would be doomed to exist as a soul within a corpse forever, hidden away in the Earth and forgotten. \n\nI tried to turn my attention away from my pain and fear. I tried to think of my family- my parents and siblings- I would never speak to them again. I wanted to sob, but my body remained a useless pile of flesh. \n\nI spent an eternity there on that couch. I went through every thought I could ever think. Every regret I had replayed endlessly. I cursed myself for wasting my life. I lamented my horrible fate. I dreaded that there was no escape. The concept of eternity crushed me with more weight than the bottom of the sea. Death was no sweet release, it was an unending nightmare. My mind had time to shatter, to splinter into a thousand pieces and then put itself back together again.\n\nFinally, my friend found me. I watched him through unblinking eyes as he shook me, called my name, and begged me to wake up. I knew I wouldn’t wake. I watched him call the police and, another eternity later, I watched them try to revive me. \n\nThey used Narcan to bring me back. Time sped up. Life crashed back into me like a tidal wave. I sat upright and gasped for air. I blinked until my eyelids hurt. I sobbed, cried, and screamed in terror and relief. I begged them not to let me die again, not to let me be trapped. They carted me away to the hospital, trying their best to calm me and stop my nonsensical begging.\n\nThe doctors tell me I wasn’t officially dead, at least not at first. The state I was in before my friend found me is what’s known as a temporary death. Breathing stops and your body begins to shut down. All in all, I was clinically dead for just over 3 minutes. That’s how much time passed in between my death and my revival. 3 minutes felt like countless lifetimes. \n\nI know one day I will die permanently. Nothing in this frightens me more than death- than an eternity of imprisonment within myself. I will do everything in my power to never experience that again. I’ve decided to join a church. I’m going to sell everything I have and dedicate myself to God. I have no idea what else I can do. Still, the idea of eternity terrifies me. The concept that I could experience this for millions of years and I’d still be no closer to freedom than I was before, it’s scarier to me than anything. \n\nI can’t help but think of a book I read in high school. The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. It’s about the afterlife. In it, Hell has a gate with an inscription that reads, “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” I’ve learned first hand why. If this was Hell, there is indeed no hope to be had.\n\nMaybe what I went through was Hell. Whether or not it was my own, personalized Hell or not, I don’t know. That thought sickens me most of all. Does all of humanity share what I saw? Is every grave filled with a soul? Is every mausoleum a prison for some damned person, locked in their own corpse? I don’t want to consider it. The implication that our world is filled with the living dead- tormented people who have spent countless years suffocating without release or peace and will spend infinitely more- it’s too much for me. \n\nI’m never touching heroin again, or any drug. I will hold on to this life I have for as long as I can. And when I do go, all I can do is hope God will save me from my flesh. ",

        "content": "**Day 3.**  \n\nThe beans ran out at first light. Three days. Three days of pissing yourself dry, of chewing bark to trick your stomach. The last can was dented, rust bleeding at the seams. I’d lost the canteen somewhere—probably when I fell, though the bruises all blurred together now.  \n\nThree days. Three days of footsteps pacing mine, always three seconds behind. Three days of waking to wet, clicking breaths outside the tent. Three days of no sleep. Just the knife in my hand.  \n\nThe trail dissolved into thorns. I crawled to a seep spring, lapped water from a skunk cabbage leaf like a dog. The taste was mud and rot.  \n\nThat’s when I saw the tree.  \n\nSplinters jutted from the Douglas fir like broken ribs. \n\nThree gashes split the trunk, nine inches between each. Sap oozed black, thick as clotting blood. Too deep for a bear. Too precise.  \n\nI didn’t run.\n\nRunning wasted calories.  \n\nThe campsite stank of wet stone and my own sour skin. I stabbed the tent stakes into the creek bend, hands shaking. The fire spat embers that died in the dirt. Cold beans trembled in the can. I scooped them with my fingers, metal scraping enamel. When I licked the lid, my tongue caught a rusted edge.  \n\nEmpty.  \n\nNo food. \n\nNo water. \n\nJust the thing that had followed me since night one, when I’d heard my name—*James*—rasped in a voice that cracked like dry sticks.  \n\nDarkness came.  \n\nThe growl started low. \n\nNot animal. \n\nNot machine. \n\nA wet, grating shudder, like something dragging a blade over bone. My flashlight flickered. Shadows pooled between the birches.  \n\nNothing.  \n\nThen the trees *twitched*.  \n\nNot the wind. Branches jerked, torn by something moving too fast to see. The beam caught a flash of black—not fur, not skin. A hole. A void. The light bent around it.  \n\nI didn’t sleep.  \n\nI lay rigid, the tent floor gouging my spine. My heartbeat thumped in my throat. The woods held its breath. No crickets. No wind. Even the creek’s babble died, choked mid-flow.  \n\nSomething scraped the tent wall.  \n\nA slow, deliberate drag. Claws? Antlers? The nylon shuddered. I stopped breathing.  \n\nThe silence split.  \n\nA wet crunch, close. *Too close.* Like teeth sinking into gristle. The smell hit me—coppery, sweet. Meat left in the sun.  \n\nI didn’t move until dawn.  \n\nWhen I unzipped the tent, the fire pit was smeared with a black paste. Flies writhed in it. Half-buried in the ashes lay a deer’s skull, stripped pink. The spine dangled from a branch, vertebrae knotted with sinew.  \n\nThe claw marks on the fir tree now numbered six.  \n\nFresh sap dripped, hot and sticky, into my hair as I passed.\n\n**Day 4.**  \n\nI was lost.  \n\nI navigated by the sun’s haze, sweat welding my shirt to my skin until the fabric chafed raw.  \n\nIts stench arrived again.  \n\nIt wasn’t stalking. It was *herding*. Driving me eastward.  \n\nTwice, movement flickered at the edge of my vision—limbs too long, joints too many, retreating into shadow.  \n\nThe woods thickened into black spruce, their branches tangled tightly.  \n\nI found wolf scat studded with hare teeth, and a raven’s skull cradled in fiddleheads. The air buzzed with flies.  \n\nNight fell.  \n\nI built no fire.  \n\nIt would smell the smoke. \n\nI wedged myself under a widowmaker cedar, its trunk crawling with bark beetles that dropped onto my neck. The knife handle fused to my palm.  \n\nSilence. Then—  \n\nFootsteps.  \n\nNot the rhythm of predator or prey. A drag-and-crunch, drag-and-crunch—the sound of something that walked despite its bones’ protest.  \n\nSap rained from the cedar, pooling in the hollow of my collarbone. Breathing followed—a wet suck-and-wheeze.  \n\nIt passed so close I tasted its breath—peat smoke and spoiled meat. Moonlight traced its silhouette, seven feet of angles, shoulders hunched, limbs strung with joints.  \n\nIts skin was not skin. Lichen scaled its flanks, the flesh beneath shimmering black. Where its thigh brushed a thimbleberry bush, its hide peeled away in strips, revealing muscle—fibrous, gray, threaded with yellow veins.  \n\nIt stopped. Cocked its head. A drop of saliva fell from its maw, burning through an oxalis leaf with a hiss.  \n\n**Day 5.**  \n\nI moved as if wounded, crouched and lurching between nurse logs slick with slug trails and granite outcroppings strung with lichen. My boots sank into moss seeping rusty water.  \n\nI was starving.  \n\nI peeled strips of cedar bark, nails splitting as I chewed the fibers into a paste.  \n\nWhen I found salmonberries, their skins burst, releasing juice that burned my throat.  \n\nI gagged at the grit, tongue rasping over quartz for calories that didn’t exist.  \n\nI made a throwing stick, a wrist-thick alder branch, one end blackened over coals.  \n\nThen a spear, stripped spruce carved to a point and tempered in ash.  \n\nBy dusk, my palms oozed serum, the blisters burst and gloving my hands in shredded skin.  \n\nI climbed a lodgepole pine, belt cinched to the trunk, boots wedged in fissures crawling with carpenter ants. They bit my calves. \n\nThe tree shuddered.  \n\nNot from wind.  \n\nFrom the growl that vibrated up its roots—a tearing sound.  \n\nBelow, lit by a pale moon, the creature left its catechism.  \n\nA snowshoe hare, opened with precision.  \n\nEntrails coiled in a spiral.  \n\nThe heart balanced on a cairn of its teeth—incisors stacked, molars arranged in a strange pattern.  \n\nIn the soil beneath, letters carved deep.  \n\n*YOU.*  \n\nThe thing wasn’t hunting anymore.  \n\nIt was *curating*.  \n\n**Day 6**  \n\nI drank from a seep spring, water strained through my shirt. The cloth teemed with larvae. I ate them. Felt their bodies burst between my teeth, brine on my tongue.  \n\nI began to hallucinate.  \n\nShadows pulsed with light. Birch trunks twisted into shapes—my father in his ranger uniform, hissing *Track the blood*. A girlfriend’s laugh tangled in the bracken, decaying into a jay’s shriek.  \n\nA raven hung from a Douglas fir, wings pinned by sinews, beak open, cradling maggots. Claw marks spiraled the trees, grooves leaking sap.  \n\nI threw the spear at nothing—at air. It struck cedar, the shaft snapping with a crack. When I pulled it free, the wood blistered my hands, coated in mucus that smoked and burned the lichen away.  \n\nNight fell. I crouched in nettles, barbs digging into my forearms, each sting sharp. Flint sparked, but the char cloth was damp. The creature’s breath fogged the dark, three rasps, close now. *Behind. Left. Above.*  \n\nI dreamt awake, its face a patchwork of bark and flesh, eyes veined with ink. Its tongue slid into my ear, whispering in the language of wasps and ice.  \n\n**Day 7**  \n\nMy body began to shut down.  \n\nI crawled through a gully, devil’s club thorns piercing my sleeves.  \n\nThe air stank of skunk cabbage and decay.  \n\nI came upon a clearing.  \n\nSunlight cut through the canopy, gilding a midden of bones.  \n\nFemurs thrust upward, marrow sucked clean, grooves spiraling from unseen teeth.  \n\nSkulls clung to hemlock roots, sockets blooming with fungi, their gills glowing in the dusk.  \n\nA human pelvis hung from a vine, the sacrum splintered open, a Zippo lighter—green with corrosion—jammed where the spine had been.  \n\nThe freshest corpse undid me.  \n\nA femur still sheathed in denim, fabric fused to decaying flesh.  \n\nNearby, a boot with its sole split open, toes stripped to knuckles of gristle.  \n\nNight fell.  \n\nI dug a pit with raw hands, fingers churning through loam until my palms glistened with blood and lymph.  \n\nI covered the hole with spruce boughs, their needles quivering, then marked the earth with my own urine to mask the scent of soil.  \n\nSurvival manuals teach traps as formulas—depth, angle, trigger.  \n\nThey leave out the sacrament.  \n\nThe beetles crawling into my sleeves, mandibles needling my wrists.  \n\nThe way the pit gaped, waiting.  \n\nA few hours passed.  \n\nAnd then, the creature came.  \n\nNot as predator, but as reckoning.  \n\nIt *detonated* from the treeline, limbs churning in grotesque synchrony, joints firing erratically.  \n\nI thrust my spear upward, aiming for the hollow beneath its ribs. The point skidded off its carapace, a lattice of moss-coated plates oozing black ichor. The impact rattled through my arms, bones vibrating painfully.  \n\nI drew my knife and swung. A backhanded slash caught its thigh, the blade slicing through tissue that tore. Yellow pus erupted in a spray, splattering my face.  \n\nIt *burned*. I screamed, clawing at my eyes as vision dissolved into white.  \n\nThen its talons found me.  \n\nA backhanded blow sent me tumbling backward.  \n\nRibs snapped.  \n\nIt lunged—jaws unraveling into a maw lined with jagged teeth.  \n\nThe ground gave way.  \n\nThe pit swallowed it whole.  \n\nFor a moment, there was silence.  \n\nThen the alder stakes screamed—not the creature, but the wood itself, shrieking as the thing thrashed, cracking the shafts.  \n\nIt climbed.  \n\nTalons drove into the earth, dragging a body mangled into splinters and entrails.  \n\nIts blood reeked—sweetness turned sour.  \n\nI scrambled back, ribs grinding, and struck a match I had kept in my back pocket.  \n\nThe brushpile ignited with a *whump*, flames roaring upward.  \n\nLight exposed the abomination.  \n\nIt *screamed*.  \n\nThe sound bypassed hearing, a pressure that vibrated deep in bone.  \n\nA woodpecker fell dead from its roost, wings rigid, beak snapping.  \n\nIt charged through the flames.  \n\nFire melted its carapace, tarry ribbons sloughing off in smoking strips.  \n\nI grabbed a burning branch, embers searing flesh to tendon, and drove it into the creature’s chest.  \n\nThe branch pierced the sac.  \n\nIt *convulsed*, jaws snapping shut inches from my face. A tooth grazed my temple, flaying skin from bone.  \n\nWe fell into the pyre.  \n\nIt thrashed beneath me, talons carving into my back, peeling skin that clung to its claws like shredded meat.  \n\nI twisted the branch deeper, flames licking its heart.  \n\nThe fluid sprayed, scorching my chest, leaving burns etched into my skin.  \n\nIts death rattle came—a wet gurgle, limbs twitching in final spasms.  \n\nThen… stillness.  \n\nDawn found me crawling through ashes that clung to my burns like scarred skin. My hands were fused to the branch, flesh and wood joined in a blackened bond.  \n\nThe creature’s corpse lay half consumed, its torso cratered, bones jutting like antlers from the muck.  \n\nRain came, scrubbing its remains into the soil until only its teeth were left.  \n\nThree days later, a search party found me in a talus field, knees shredded to raw meat from dragging myself over granite.  \n\nThey said it was a bear attack.  \n\nI didn’t speak.  \n\nI couldn’t explain what had really attacked me.  \n\nThe medic’s penlight stalled on my back—four slashes, too deep, too *clean* for any natural claw.  \n\nThe botanist refused to cross the tree line.  \n\nShe stood at its edge, haloed by deadwood, staring at the scarred trunks.  \n\nThe tooth now sits floating in formaldehyde, beside my father’s tarnished ranger badge.  \n\nThe woods don’t care about your redemption.  \n\nIf you go into them, if you think their silence will absolve you—know this, the trees have eyes that aren’t trees.  \n\nThe wind carries voices that aren’t wind.  \n\nWhen your neck prickles and the chickadees fall silent, don’t pray.  \n\nDon’t freeze.  \n\nRun.  \n\nRun not like a man, but like prey.  \n\nIf you have a knife, cling to it as if it’s your soul.  \n\nIf you have nothing, make a god out of your bones.  \n\nIt won’t stop.  \n\nIt *can’t*.  \n\nYou are not the first.  \n\nRun until your boots disintegrate.  \n\nRun until your lungs bleed.  \n\nRun until you forget you were ever anything but meat.  \n\nThe wilderness is not a place.  \n\nIt is a mouth.  \n\nAnd you are the prayer.  \n\nAnd if you have a gun, save the last bullet for your head. \n",

Long enough for my tea to go cold, untouched beside me.\n\nGrace, cross-legged on the bed. Same pyjamas she wore the night before she died—blue and white stripes, fraying at the wrists. Her face was soft, neutral, like she’d just said something under her breath and was waiting for me to laugh.\n\nShe shouldn’t have been there.\n\nNot in that room. Not in that photograph. Not now.\n\n••\n\nThe camera had been a charity shop find. Grace used to brag about it. \n\n*“Thirty-five quid and some stranger’s holiday photos still inside.”*\n\nShe’d spent weeks learning how to load it, develop her own film in the uni darkroom. Said digital was too clean, too sharp. \n\n*“Real things have grain.”*\n\nIt had been sitting on her desk when I went to clear out the room. Heavy in the hand. The film still loaded.\n\nOn a whim, I took one photo of the empty space. Just the room, like a memorial. A kind of goodbye.\n\nBut when I picked up the prints from the lab in town, she was in it.\n\nNo double exposure. No mistake.\n\nJust Grace.\n\n••\n\nI kept it hidden in my drawer for two days.\n\nI’d check it sometimes at night, when I couldn’t sleep. Just to make sure she was still there. That I hadn’t dreamed it. But each time it was the same—her, sitting quietly, looking at me.\n\nIt didn’t feel like a ghost photo.\n\nIt felt like a portrait.\n\n••\n\nThree nights later, I heard the door to her room creak open.\n\nI was still awake. Doom Scrolling. Trying to exhaust myself into sleep. I froze.\n\nIt was a slow sound. Drawn out like someone didn’t want to wake me.\n\nMum hadn’t stirred. Her room’s just across from mine. The creaking stopped, but I lay there listening for something else. A breath. A footstep. Anything.\n\nNothing came.\n\nIn the morning, the door to Grace’s room was ajar.\nThe light was on.\n\n••\n\nIt still smelled like her.\n\nLavender fabric spray. The faded scent of body lotion in the sheets. The air inside felt warmer than the rest of the house.\n\nSomething was different, though. The room had been vacuumed. I remembered the little bits of fluff on the carpet from last time. They were gone.\n\nAnd the covers were pulled back.\n\nFolded down neatly.\n\nI hadn’t done that.\n\n••\n\nMum asked me if I’d gone in there again.\n\nI said no.\n\nShe didn’t press. Just looked at me with the same hollow expression she’s worn since the funeral.\n\nLater, while she was loading the washing machine, I heard her say—barely audible—\n\n*“I thought I heard her again. Just for a second.”*\n\nI didn’t ask what she meant.\n\n••\n\nThe envelope came two days later.\n\nNo stamp. No return address. Just my name, written in a shaky, oversaturated ink, like the pen had been pressed down too hard. It hadn’t come with the post. It had been slid under the front door, pushed just inside the mat.\n\nInside was a single photograph.\n\nAnother one of Grace’s room. Same angle. Same dull afternoon light. But she was standing now.\n\nIn the corner of the room. Half-turned toward the window. Her face caught mid-blur, like she’d moved between the shutter click. Her expression had changed. \n\nNot smiling. Not angry. Just… blank. As if she was waiting for something.\n\nAnd her eyes weren’t looking at the camera anymore.\n\nThey were angled past it.\n\n*Over my shoulder.*\n\n••\n\nI went to the attic to check the camera. Still wrapped in the towel, still in the box, untouched since I hid it.\n\nBut underneath it—\n\nThree more developed photos.\n\nNone of which I had taken.\n\nThey were darker. Grainier. The room had changed. The wallpaper was starting to peel at the corners. A mirror on the wall was cracked. Grace was gone from the frame.\n\nBut in the last photo, scrawled in something thick and black across the bedroom wall, someone had written a single word, just out of frame:\n\n***“More.”***",

        "content": "I don’t know if it’s something paranormal or just an incredibly strange coincidence, but it won’t let me sleep peacefully. Maybe someone else has experienced something similar.\n\nMy brother Domas died three years ago a car accident on a slippery winter road. One day he texted me about some stupid movie he was watching, and the next day he was gone. It was horrifying. Our parents have never come to terms with it, and every day feels like a constant reminder of the void he left behind.\n\nAfter his death, we had to settle a lot of things bank accounts, social media profiles, his apartment. We closed everything except one thing: his phone number. Mom said she couldn’t cancel it. She admitted that sometimes she would call him just to hear that the number wasn’t in service. It was her way of holding onto him, a desperate grasp at something that could bring him back, even if just for a moment. We let her do that, knowing it was the only comfort she had left.\n\nA few months later, Mom finally decided to go to the service provider and cancel the number. That’s when she discovered something that shook us all to the core Domas’s number was still active, and someone was paying for it every month. According to the records, the payment is made on time every month from an unknown account. It wasn’t our money, and it wasn’t coming from his own closed account. The operator couldn’t offer any further explanation, only confirming that the service remained active and paid for.\n\nWe tried calling the number, half expecting nothing more than silence. The phone rang, and after a few rings, someone answered. But nobody spoke. Instead, there was just a low, constant background noise, as if someone were holding the phone and deliberately keeping quiet. We sat there, stunned and speechless, the silence stretching on for about ten seconds before the call abruptly ended.\n\nIn the days that followed, we tried calling again. The number would sometimes be disconnected, only to be reactivated the next day without any explanation. I even set up a schedule to check its status every month. Without fail, the number remains active, with payments being made from that mysterious account. It’s as if there is an invisible presence, carefully tending to this connection that should have been severed long ago.\n\nI’ve asked around online, in various forums and local groups, but no one has experienced anything like this. Some say it could be a glitch in the system; others whisper about supernatural forces or unfinished business from beyond. I’m not entirely convinced by any of the explanations. What I do know is that every time I check, I can’t help but wonder who is on the other end of that line. Who is answering, and why do they remain so silent?\n\nI spend sleepless nights questioning every possibility. Could it be that someone who knew Domas is keeping his memory alive? Or perhaps there is something inexplicable at work a lingering echo from the moment he left us. I have no answers, only more questions. And until I do, the mystery of the active phone number continues to haunt me every month.",

        "content": "January 24th, 2025 was the date of my accident.  I blame myself as I was too drunk to realize how drunk Blaine was. When I got into that car after drunkenly begging Blaine to take me to his place, I sealed both of our fates. \n\nWe came to the blind curve just a few miles away from his apartment. It was there he drove off the road and flipped the car at least three times down the steep cliff. By the time the accident was reported, I was unconscious and lost a lot of blood but still had a faint pulse. \n\nBlaine was pronounced dead on arrival while I was rushed into emergency surgery.  I died on the operating table. After nearly two minutes of reviving measures being taken, the medical staff was about to give up when my heartbeat slowly came back. Or so I was told. \n\nI woke up in a brightly lit room I didn't recognize. My last vivid memory was driving to Rico's house for the party. And of Blaine. Everything else was fuzzy. I remained in the hospital for a couple days after regaining consciousness and learning the fate of my ex boyfriend. \n\nGoing back to my own apartment was bizarre. My parents begged me to come back home but I couldn't. I needed to be alone to come to terms with reality. \n\nIt was hard. I was so sore and my normal movements were a struggle; walking, showering, even eating. It was the third day in my apartment when I was trying to eat microwaved soup that I first heard a voice. \n\n\"Hey!\" I heard an older female voice yell. \"Where are my cigarettes?!\" \n\nI froze as chills covered my body. I moved my stiff neck as I looked around my small apartment to find it empty except for myself.  \n\nI shook it off. The isolation was getting to me obviously.  That night I awoke to the same voice, \"Benny! Where are you?!\" I jumped into full consciousness and immediately felt the pain from such a sudden movement. \"Can you hear me?! Where's Benny?!\" The voice cried both in my ears and my head. \n\nI sat up in bed feeling terrified. I almost called my mom and asked her to make the five hour drive to come get me. At day break, I finally fell back into a dreamless sleep. \n\nIt's been a couple months and my physical health has improved. My physical therapist is impressed with my progress. I don't dare tell them my mental state has only declined.  \n\nThe random voices have only become louder, clearer and more often. The voice I hear of the older woman in my apartment is basically a daily occurrence now. Her name is Rhonda and Benny was her son. She calls for him often. I learned all of this through Cassie, the employee in the leasing office I became friends with.\n\nOf course, I never told her I could hear Rhonda, but she did tell me the previous tenant in my apartment, named Rhonda, died of a heart attack in my apartment. This was after some pushy questions about the previous tenants. She lived with her son, Benny, who moved out after her tragic passing. \n\nThat's not the only voice I hear now. I hear them in various places now.  The most recent being the strong male voice I heard while visiting the local park. \n\n\"That bitch took my money!\" I heard a deep male voice bellow to the right of the bench I was sitting on. \"I need help!\" His voice grew sharper. I looked to see who was yelling such things but wasn't surprised to see absolutely no one. \n\nI quickly left and headed back to my apartment. I was completely insane, there was no other explanation. \n\nI lost my mind when I learned Blaine had died. I had broke up with him for such a stupid reason despite the fact I was hopelessly in love with him. He'd still be alive if wasn't for me. \n\nI inserted the key in my door until I heard the lock turn over. I entered my small apartment hoping Rhonda wasn't feeling talkative.  I was grateful for the silence as I plopped down on my couch. \n\nI looked through the notifications on my phone. Texts from both my mom and dad were a daily occurrence as well. It was the text from Rico that made me pause. I clicked the notification as our text conversation spread across the screen. \n\"Hiiii! I hope you are doing as well as can be expected! Are you feeling up to coffee at our usual spot?\" \n\nI stared at the screen. Many friends had reached out since the accident and I hadn't really responded to any of them. One hadn't though. My best friend since childhood, Rico.... until now. \n\nI thought he was angry with me. Angry I didn't listen when he told me not to end things with Blaine. Angry I did it anyway. Angry I didn't just stay away from Blaine at the party like he had texted me to before the party. Angry Blaine, his other childhood friend, was dead now. Angry it was because of me. \n\nAs I was debating on answering, I heard Rhonda, \"Shit! Benny! I need help with dinner!\" I suddenly smelled smoke. I jumped off the couch, thankful movements like that didn't hurt so much now. I hurried into the kitchen to see it empty.  No smoke or old ladies cooking. \n\nI scratched my head as I turned to head back to the couch, \"Hey! I know you can hear me!\" Rhonda huffed. \n\nI refused to answer the voice that wasn't really there. I sat back down on the couch to text Rico. \n\nMe: I'm here. That's about it. When do you want to meet?\n\nRico: I didn't think you'd respond but I'm glad you did! Tonight at 7pm???\n\nI hesitated but answered:\n\nMe: Sure. I'll see you there. \n\nRico and I was always joked about being caffeine addicts. \"6:00am or midnight! Coffee is the answer!\" We'd chant and giggle.\n\nI looked over my appearance one last time in the mirror. I hadn't met anyone since the accident. I had only recently returned to working my work-from-home job, and I refused to get on camera. My supervisor was, thankfully, understanding. \n\nAs I left the apartment, I heard Rhonda call, \"Hurry back!\"\n\nI locked the door to my apartment and was grateful for the relatively quiet walk to the coffee shop. I walked in and hurried to mine and Rico's normal table before any of the workers could recognize me. \n\nMy heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest as I saw him enter the shop and immediately look to our table, his usual stunning smile on display when he saw me. He headed to the counter and I figured he'd order our usual.  \n\nI felt like I'd throw up as he walked towards me and took a seat across from me.\n\nMe: Uhmm... hi!?\n\nRico: .....Hi? That's all you can say after all this time?!\n\nMe: I don't know what to say. It's not like you came to see me in the hospital or reached out after!\n\nRico froze then looked down at his lap.\n\nRico: You're right. I'm sorry! I'm a shitty friend! I just.... I didn't know what to do or say!\n\nI felt myself relax a bit. \n\nMe: It's okay, really. I haven't been myself anyway. \n\nAfter this, Rico told me what had gone on in his life and I told him of my recovery and my physical therapy. I left out the voices, of course. It almost felt normal again.... until....\n\nRico: He really loved you, Kris. \n\nI nearly choked on the last of my iced coffee. \n\nMe: What???\n\nRico: Blaine. He absolutely loved you. Enough to propose....\n\nI felt my head start to spin and like I would see my coffee again. \n\nMe: Rico, please...\n\nRico: He was crazy for you. He'd never do.... what you heard. \n\nI immediately got up. I dug in my purse for some cash then threw it on the table. \n\nMe: Thanks for the chat. I have to go. \n\nI could hear him trying to stop me and call me back but I was out the door in a flash. \n\nImages of that night came back to me as I practically sprinted home. The party, me approaching Blaine, me kissing him and asking him to take me to his place. \n\nMy eyes burned with tears as I arrived at my door, rushing to unlock it and hide in my sanctuary from the rest of the world. \n\nAs I entered my apartment and slammed the door behind me, I could feel something wasn't right. I wasn't alone. \n\nAs I slowly turned to look at my couch, I froze. \n\nI had only heard things, never seen anything... until now. \n\nThere, sitting on the edge of my couch, leaning forward with his arms resting on his thighs and looking straight ahead, was Blaine. \n\n\"I've missed you, Kris.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I do not recognize the bodies in the water. \n\nI do not recognize the bodies in the water. \n\nI do not recognize the bodies in the water.\n\n...\n\nWe moved here when I was just starting high school, only a year ago, after our house was taken by a fire. We lived in town, close to everything and everyone. I could ride bikes in the evening with my friends while my parents watched from the front porch.\n\nNow, our house is on the outskirts of town, secluded from anyone else. My parents chose the house due to the beautiful scenery: a running river, willow trees that dance in the breeze, grasshoppers that jump as you walk through the swaying grass. They said it would be our “new start.” \n\n*I* didn’t want to move, as it meant I had to go to the high school that all my friends considered ghetto and of course, I would be the only one of my group not going to the better school. Other than that, I loved the new house. I loved spending time in the trees with my parents, having picnics under nature’s canopies.\n\nIt was lovely. ***Was.*** \n\nThen, Mom was diagnosed with stage four brain cancer. She had been suffering from migraines and she finally decided to get it checked out. That’s when the doctor gave us the news. It was devastating for all of us and we just knew that we didn’t have much time. She passed only a month after the diagnosis.\n\nWhen Mom died, everything changed. The river stopped singing, the trees stopped dancing, and the grasshoppers stopped coming around. It was as if Mother Nature was mourning her death just as Dad and I were.\n\nAnd Dad? He changed. He was still the same man, but there was a new hardness to him, almost like he was trying to hide his brokenness from me, from the world. He hardly smiled, rarely laughed, and was stricter on me than he had ever been before. It’s not easy, but I know it’s his way of grieving, so I comply and never complain.\n\nBefore her passing, Mom was the one who drove me to school as the new high school was on her way to work. After she was gone, Dad drove me to school, until he got a new job that required him to be there earlier than I even woke up.\n\nThe first day I saw the bodies, it was just a test run to see if I knew my way to school so that I could call him if I needed him.\n\nI only caught a glimpse of the sunken faces barely floating above the water when I screamed and booked it back home. I cried and told my dad. He called the police but when they got to the river, there was nothing there. No bodies. No faces.\n\nMy dad apologized to the officers while I cried on the couch, chalking it up to my mother’s death messing with my head. \n\nAfter the police left the first time, my dad let me stay home for an hour before he made me go again.\n\nThe second time I passed, they were still there.\n\nI just ran past them, knowing Dad would have my hide if I went back home.\n\nI never told anyone about it. I don’t have friends, as no one wanted to talk to the “new girl” even after a year. And I just knew if I told my dad that I saw them again, he would send me to the loony bin.\n\nThe first few times I passed the river, I would just run. Run and pretend they weren’t there. Pretend their pale, soggy faces weren’t staring up at me, daring me to come closer. \n\nI never recognized the people. They always looked like someone I *could* know, but I could never put a name to them. Just familiarity.\n\nAfter a while, I got used to them. I would just walk past the river, earbuds in, ignoring the empty eyes I could feel staring holes into me. \n\nOne day, I got curious. I walked to the edge of the water and looked down. I wish I hadn’t.\n\nI looked down at the soulless eyes staring up at me, hair floating around thoughtless heads. There was one in particular that caught my attention. A woman. Maybe it was her long blonde hair, maybe it was her piercing blue eyes, but whatever it was, I couldn't stop looking at her.\n\nWithout realizing it, I started walking closer and closer to her, like something was pulling me to the water. I only stopped when I could feel the river water seep into the toe of my shoe. Gasping, I backed away and continued on my way to school, shoe squishing as I walked.\n\nI went back to walking straight past them, making sure to keep my eyes on where I was walking and not letting them wander to the water.\n\nIt was a few more weeks before something else had happened.\n\nI was walking to school per usual, when the river came into view. I planned on just ignoring them like I had been, when I noticed it. A hand sticking out of the water, raised almost like asking a question. \n\nI kept my eyes on it and as I got closer, it started to wave at me. \n\nAgain, letting my curiosity get the best of me, I walked closer. I looked over the edge of the water.\n\nUsually, there are multiple bodies, ranging from three to seven depending on the day. This time, there was just one.\n\nAnd I *recognized* it.\n\n“Mom!” I yelled at the water.\n\nHer unblinking green eyes just started at me as she continued to wave. Her once plump olive skin was pale and sallow. Her fire red hair was tangled with sticks and leaves.\n\nI threw my backpack down jumped into the water. In the back of my mind I knew it wasn’t her. I knew she was buried in the cemetery on the other side of town, peacefully at rest. But I couldn’t help the part of me that wanted to pull her out of the water, to bring her home where she belonged.\n\nWhen I was about waist deep, she disappeared, sinking into the murky brown. I splashed around trying to find her, but it was no use. She wasn’t there.\n\nI willed myself out of the water and walked back home, dripping all the way. I got home and showered. I made my way back out of the door and made it to school, barely making it to first hour. \n\nI didn’t tell anyone about what I saw. Not until now. \n\nI haven’t been to school in a week, telling my dad it was my time of the month. He never really understood girl things because mom always took care of whatever I needed. He said I could stay home “until it passed.” I’ve been holed up in my room ever since.\n\nWhat does it mean? Why could I never recognize them before, but now I can see my mom? Why are they messing with me like this? What are they? What do they want from me?\n\nI recognize the bodies in the water.",

        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "It all started last week, on a quiet evening when I was scrolling through my phone. My storage was full, so I began the tedious task of deleting old photos. But then, something caught my eye. A photo album titled \"Sleep Well\", one I didn’t remember creating, appeared on the screen. The creation date was from the night before—just hours earlier. A cold shiver ran down my spine as I opened it. Inside was a picture of me, taken while I slept—vulnerable, unaware. The angle of the shot was disturbingly specific, as if the photographer had been hiding just out of view, their presence felt only in the eerie stillness of the moment. The most disturbing detail? The picture was taken from inside my closet.I live alone.\n\nMy heart dropped. I could feel the color draining from my face as a heavy pressure squeezed my chest. I was being watched. My eyes instantly darted toward the closet. As I trembled in fear, I wondered—was someone inside it? I don’t know. I was too scared to look.\n\nIn a panic, I immediately grabbed my car keys from beside the bed, rushed to the front door, and drove straight to the police.\n\nI arrived at the police station, feeling a strange sense of relief just for making it there. I told them everything that happened and showed the picture. The officers listened, then agreed to send someone to search my house. They searched every inch—closets, drawers, windows—nothing. No signs of break-ins, no clues that anyone had been there.\n\nThe police told me to change my locks, install security cameras, and keep in touch in case something else happened. But it didn’t feel like enough. I was terrified. The idea of someone watching me, of someone being inside my closet, haunted me. That night, I opened the closet fully, convinced that if I could see inside, I could rid myself of the fear. But something felt off.\n\nI could still feel the presence, like someone was right there, just beyond my sight. The weight of paranoia suffocated me. Unable to sleep, I went to the kitchen to make something to eat. I called my friend Melissa and told her what happened, with my voice shaking. I made myself some popcorn and went back upstairs to my room. Still talking to her, trying to sound calm, I noticed something... wrong.\n\nI stopped mid-sentence. My breath hitched. The closet door that I had left wide open was now closed. But not fully. There was a slight gap—a narrow sliver—just enough for me to know that someone, or something, was inside. I couldn’t see who, or what, but I could feel it. The pressure of being watched.\n\nMy eyes locked on the gap, heart hammering in my chest. Then I saw it. A single wide eye staring back at me from the darkness. My voice trembled as I spoke.\n\n“Hello? Are you still there?” Melissa asked, confused by my sudden silence.\n\nI couldn’t answer. My body was frozen. Someone was inside the closet. I was sure of it.\n\nI slowly pulled my bedroom door shut, my hands shaking as I gripped the doorknob. I locked it. Then, with my heart racing, I ran outside and called the police as I stood in my yard, too terrified to go back in.\n\nWhen the officer arrived, I rushed to explain. “I locked them in my room, I swear. They’re in the closet. They were watching me.”\n\nThe officers moved quickly, their hands steady, trained. They entered my room, opened the closet door, and... nothing. No one. The closet was empty.\n\nThere was nowhere for anyone to hide. The room was on the second floor, with windows secured by metal bars. No exit, no secret passage.\n\nThe officer returned to me, his face tight with frustration, his politeness wearing thin. \"Ma’am... I know you're scared, but you can't call us every time you forget you closed your closet door. Be sure to only call us when you're certain it's an emergency. I suggest you sleep somewhere else until you’ve recovered from this panic.\"\n\n“What? Are you sure you searched everything? They must have escaped,” I said, my voice trembling with remorse and disbelief. I felt the walls closing in. How could they have missed something? How could they not see it?\n\n\"As I said, the house is empty,\" the officer replied, his tone cold and dismissive.\n\nI felt my frustration growing. This wasn’t right. There *was* someone there. I couldn’t shake the feeling, the cold certainty gnawing at me.\n\n“No, no. You have to believe me. There was someone in there! I locked the door, I swear! There’s no way they could have gone anywhere. My house is locked down. Please, search again!” I insisted, my voice rising in desperation.\n\nThe officer gave me a long look, clearly fed up. “Ma’am, we’ve been over this. The house is empty. Nothing’s here. I suggest you take a step back and calm down. We can’t keep coming back every time you think someone’s in your closet.” His words hit me like a slap, each one a cold dismissal of everything I had experienced.\n\nI stared at him, fighting to hold back tears. “But I saw them! I saw their eye, I—”\n\n“Get some rest,” he cut me off, turning on his heel. “We’re done here.”\n\nReluctantly, I followed the officer’s advice and went to sleep at Melissa’s house. She’s my best friend, and being with her felt like the only place I could be safe. At least for that night.\n\nMelissa tried to lighten the mood, but I could hear the nervousness in her voice. “Are you sure this picture isn’t just some joke from someone messing with your head?”\n\nI forced a weak laugh, but it was hollow. “No. I’m sure about what I saw. There’s someone watching me.”\n\nI didn’t want to talk much. My mind was racing, but the words wouldn’t come. I hadn’t been able to explain it properly to the police, and now I couldn’t explain it to her. The fear was too real.\n\nMelissa’s husband was out of town, so I ended up sleeping next to her. I was too scared to sleep alone. That night, I finally felt a little safer, a little less alone.\n\nThe next morning, things felt... better. Being with my closest friend gave me a sense of comfort. I ate breakfast, tried to distract myself, but there was one thing I couldn’t shake. The picture. I had to know. I had to see it again.\n\nMelissa asked, “Can you show me the picture again?”\n\nI didn’t want to look at it, but I opened my gallery anyway. I could feel my heart thudding in my chest. I stared at the album for a moment, before clicking on it. My stomach dropped.\n\nThere was another picture in the album. A new one.\n\nI zoomed in. I couldn’t believe it.\n\nIt was a picture of me, but this time, I wasn’t alone. Melissa was lying beside me, just like the night before. But the perspective was wrong. It was too close. Whoever took the picture was right next to us.\n\nAnd in their hand, they were holding something... a rag doll.\n\nThe doll looked just like me.\n\nThe same dark hair, the same clothes, the exact same features. Even the expression on its face mirrored mine. The doll was lying in the same position I was, as if it had been placed there beside me, sleeping.\n\nIn the background, I saw the shadow of who took the picture.\n\nMy heart stopped. My hands shook as I dropped the phone. The safety I had felt with Melissa was gone. All that comfort I had wrapped myself in vanished, replaced with a cold, suffocating fear.\n\nI wasn’t safe. I wasn’t safe anywhere.\n\nMelissa tried to calm me down, but it wasn’t working. My panic was too overwhelming, and she could see that I was shaking, unable to catch my breath. Desperate to understand what was happening, she quickly reached down and grabbed my phone from the floor. Her fingers trembled as she opened the photo album, her eyes scanning the picture I had just shown her.\n\n“Okay, okay… this... this doesn’t make any sense,” she muttered, her voice tight with confusion. She looked at me, then back at the photo. Her brow furrowed as she tried to make sense of it, but there was a flicker of doubt in her eyes.\n\n“Are you sure this isn’t just some sick prank, something someone’s been sending you? Maybe an ex or... someone you know?”\n\nI shook my head, my voice barely a whisper. “No... Melissa, I swear. It’s not a prank. This is real. Someone’s in my life... and they’re watching me.”\n\nHer expression faltered for a moment, and I saw her hesitate, her eyes darting nervously around the room as if she could feel the weight of something watching her, too. Slowly, she handed the phone back to me, but this time, I noticed her hand was shaking.\n\n“Do you think... they could be here too? In my house?” she asked quietly, her voice laced with a hint of fear.\n\nI swallowed hard, my own breath catching in my throat. “I... I don’t know, but I don’t feel safe anymore. I don’t think I’m safe anywhere.”\n\nMelissa’s eyes widened slightly, and she stood up from the bed, looking around the room. Her voice dropped to a whisper. “I... I don’t know. I heard some noises last night, but I thought it was just the house settling... I didn’t want to say anything because I didn’t want to worry you.”\n\nThe fear in her eyes mirrored my own. For the first time, I realized I wasn’t the only one feeling watched. “I... I think we need to check the house, just in case,” she said, her voice trembling as she grabbed her phone, preparing to call someone for help. Her eyes were wide, her body tense, as she waited for my response.\n\nMelissa looked at me, her face pale with concern. “We need to go to the police,” she said, her voice firm despite the obvious fear in her eyes. “You can’t keep dealing with this alone. If someone’s really doing this to you, they need to know.”\n\nI shook my head, a knot of anxiety forming in my chest. “The police won’t believe me, Melissa. I’ve already been there. They searched my house and found nothing. They said I’m just imagining things. They don’t take me seriously.”\n\nMelissa’s face softened, but her voice remained steady as she reached for my hand. “No. This time it’s different. We have proof, remember?” She looked at the photo on my phone, her eyes scanning it once more before locking with mine. “They can’t just ignore that.”\n\nI hesitated. The memory of the police officer dismissing me echoed in my mind. But Melissa was right. We had proof, and I couldn’t just let this go. “Alright,” I said, voice barely above a whisper. “But if they don’t believe me again…”\n\n“We’ll make them believe you,” she said, determination in her tone. “We’ll show them the photo, everything. We have to do something.”\n\nI arrived at the police station, feeling a mix of dread and urgency. As soon as I walked in, I saw the same officer from the night before. When he saw me, his face immediately twisted into a scowl. He was not happy to see me again.\n\nHe didn't even bother to greet me. \"You again?\" he muttered under his breath, rolling his eyes.\n\n\"Officer, we need your help,\" I started, holding my phone up with the picture. “Please, I’m telling you, someone’s been taking pictures of me while I sleep.”\n\nHe glanced at the photo, his patience already running thin. \"You’re still going on about this?\" He rubbed his forehead, clearly annoyed. \"I already told you. There's no sign of a break-in, no evidence of anyone being inside your house. What do you want me to do, investigate every closet in the city?\"\n\nI could feel the knot of fear tightening in my chest as I desperately tried to explain. \"But you don’t understand—this picture, it’s not just a prank. Someone’s still watching me.\"\n\nMelissa, who had been silent until now, spoke up. “We don’t have any more evidence, but we’ve checked everything. The house is empty, but she’s still seeing things. This picture—”\n\nThe officer cut her off with a harsh wave of his hand. “Enough with the photo,” he snapped, clearly not believing either of us. “I’ve already done my part. If you two are gonna waste my time, I suggest you find another way to deal with this.”\n\nHe took a deep breath, then sighed in frustration, clearly not wanting to deal with this anymore. \"Alright,\" he said, “I’ll go to your place and search your house again. But don’t expect me to find anything.”\n\nThe officer came with us, walking into Melissa’s house like it was just another job. He searched every room with annoyance, even though we had already checked everything ourselves. We stood in the living room, the tension growing as we waited for him to come out.\n\nWhen he finally emerged from the last room, his face was contorted with anger. “There’s nothing here,” he said sharply. \"No sign of a break-in. No one’s been here. So stop wasting my time.”\n\nI couldn’t hold it in anymore. “But the closet—someone was in there! They’re still watching me! Please, you have to understand, I’m not making this up.”\n\nHe shot me an angry look, his voice turning cold. “I’ve been through your house, and I haven’t found a damn thing. You really think I’ve got time for some prank, some sick joke? You two think this is funny?”\n\nMelissa and I exchanged a look, both of us trying to process the officer’s words. My heart sank as I realized the officer was done taking us seriously. “This is ridiculous,” he said, his voice laced with frustration. “I’m not going to keep playing along with this. No more ‘emergency’ calls. You two should find a way to get some rest instead of dragging me into your delusions.”\n\nHe turned and walked toward the door, leaving us standing in the middle of the room, shocked and speechless. The door slammed behind him with a finality that made my whole body tense up. Melissa just stood there, her face pale, her eyes wide with disbelief.\n\nSilence. Complete silence filled the room as Melissa and I stood there in disbelief.\n\n\"I... I need to go home. It's watching me, not you. Me being here is just putting you in danger,\" I said, with my eyes welling up with tears.\n\n\"Are you crazy? I'm not letting you go anywhere until we catch this motherfucker. You're my best friend, I love you, and I'll go through hell to help you,\" Melissa said, hugging me tightly. Her words were comforting, but fear still consumed me. I honestly didn't know what I would do without her.\n\n\"I'm not sleeping tonight,\" I said, my voice firm.\n\n\"But remember, you have work tomorrow,\" Melissa reminded me.\n\nWork. How could I possibly work and pretend like nothing happened after everything I’d experienced? The fear was slowly turning into anger. I spent the whole day thinking about what happened, feeling like I was being watched everywhere I went. Melissa called her boss and told them she was sick so she could stay with me. I fucking love her. We spent the entire day coming up with theories about what was going on. Maybe whatever was watching me wasn't... human? Nah, I don't believe in supernatural stuff, but Melissa kept insisting.\n\nNighttime came. As I said, I refused to sleep. Even if I wanted to, I don't think I could. But Melissa couldn’t stay awake for long. I felt exposed with her asleep, but I wasn't about to wake her up. I JUST HAD TO STAY AWAKE. And that's exactly what I did.\n\nHours passed, and nothing happened. The only thing I could hear was Melissa’s soft snoring. But time felt agonizingly slow, and my fear only grew. 3 AM—the so-called haunted hour that makes both adults and children alike dread what might happen next. Even though I didn’t believe in supernatural things, when I saw 3:00 on the clock, my heart sank. I was expecting something—some noise, a reflection, a doll, or the most disturbing thing I could imagine. But nothing happened.\n\nTwenty minutes went by, and I started to feel extremely sleepy. But I knew, as soon as I slept, I wouldn’t be safe anymore. I glanced at Melissa. Something felt off. She wasn’t snoring anymore. She had turned to the other side, and I could only see her brown hair splayed across the pillow.\n\nI froze. Something about her posture made me uneasy. I had never seen her sleep like that before. Slowly, I sat up, my heart racing in my chest. I lifted my head and cautiously leaned forward to see if she was awake. But when I looked, my blood ran cold. What I saw was not my best friend anymore.\n\nThere, in front of me, was a body. The skin was unnaturally pale, the once-vibrant brown hair now a tangled mess. Her mouth hung slightly open, and her eyes—those eyes that I knew so well—were wide open but lifeless, glazed over with an unsettling emptiness. The way her limbs were arranged, twisted unnaturally at odd angles, told me she hadn’t just fallen asleep. No. Something had happened to her.\n\nI wanted to scream. My throat closed up. I reached out and desperately shook her, calling her name, trying to wake her, but there was no response. Her body was cold, stiff. I tried again, harder this time. Nothing. No breath, no movement. Melissa… was dead?\n\nPanic surged through my veins, my vision blurry with tears. I fumbled for my phone, trying to dial emergency services, but just as my fingers brushed the screen, something stopped me. An Airdrop request flashed across the top of my phone. \n\nMy heart dropped. I hesitated, staring at the screen, the dread tightening in my chest. I wanted to deny the request, to throw my phone away, to make it all stop. But I couldn’t. My mind screamed at me to say no, but my hand moved on its own. I accepted.\n\nA flood of pictures appeared on my phone, and my stomach twisted. The images were of me—sleeping. Dozens of them, hundreds maybe, scattered over weeks. Some were taken inside my closet, others were shots of me lying in my bed, blissfully unaware. But what made my blood run even colder were the ones that came after. There was a picture of me, sleeping beside something on the bed. It looked like the same doll I had seen before, but this time, it felt different—wrong. It wasn’t just a doll anymore. It was me, or something that had been made to look like me, in doll form, lying beside me.\n\nThe most disturbing part? The shadow of someone standing just behind it, watching, waiting.\n\nI couldn’t move. The air around me grew thick, suffocating. And then, through the crack in the door, I saw it.\n\nA figure. Tall and unnervingly still. It was standing there, as if waiting, watching. But the most terrifying part was the eye. That single, wide eye staring directly at me from the shadows. It was unnatural—too large, too black. No light reflected off of it. It was like a hole in the world, a deep, endless void that seemed to pull every ounce of warmth and life from the room. The eye twitched, just slightly, as if it recognized me, like it had been waiting for me to look.\n\nAnd in its other hand… the doll. But it wasn’t just any doll.\n\nThe doll was **me**.\n\nI recognized the face immediately—its pale skin, the dark hair, the same expression I often wore when I slept. But it was wrong. The doll’s eyes were wide open, fixed in a grotesque stare, its mouth frozen in a twisted, silent scream. Its body, rigid and contorted in a way that a human body never could be, seemed to mock me—like an unnatural imitation of myself. The figure held it with such tenderness, as if cradling it, but there was something deeply disturbing in the way it did. The doll’s hand was positioned just like mine when I slept, but there was no softness to it. No warmth.\n\nAnd then, the figure stepped forward, the eye never leaving mine. The room grew colder, and the figure moved silently, like a shadow creeping closer, carrying the doll as if it were the most precious thing in the world. I felt the terror clawing at me, suffocating me, but I couldn’t look away from that horrible, hollow eye. It was as if it was **looking through me**, and the more I stared, the more I felt like I was becoming part of its dark, empty world.\n\nI could feel my body shutting down, my heart thundering in my chest as if it was trying to escape my ribs. My hands were shaking uncontrollably, my breathing shallow and erratic. My limbs felt weak, like they were made of stone, and my vision started to blur around the edges. The air felt like it was closing in, pressing against me from all sides, and the figure—the eye—was all I could see. I could hear the blood rushing in my ears, louder and louder, drowning everything else out, until the sound was all-consuming.\n\nAnd then, just as I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, everything went black.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nI’m currently writing this on a contraband cellphone in prison, after allegedly poisoning my best friend. It’s all a lie, of course. They say I did it, but they don’t understand. They don’t *know* what I saw. What *really* happened.\n\nMelissa is gone. I can still feel the weight of that truth crushing me. I can still hear her laugh, see her smile—feel her presence beside me like I always did. I feel the coldness now. It’s unbearable. Losing her... it’s like losing a part of myself. The world feels hollow, like it’s spinning around me without any meaning. The grief is suffocating.\n\nBut the worst part isn’t the grief. It’s the *frustration.* The anger bubbling inside me. They think I did it. They think I’m the one who poisoned her. They don’t see how broken I am, how lost I feel. They don’t understand that I would never hurt her. I would never do something like that.\n\nBut it doesn’t matter what I say. They have their own version of the truth. And now, they’ve locked me away for something I didn’t do. They’ll never know what *really* happened. They’ll never know what I saw in that room, what I saw in her eyes before everything turned dark.\n\nI couldn’t escape before. Now, I certainly can’t. They’ve got me here, in this cold, metal cage. But maybe... *maybe* I can. There’s still one thing I can do. I’m the only one who can put an end to this, to everything.\n\nThe figure is still watching me, I can feel it. That same eye, always lurking, always waiting. It’s still out there, haunting me. I thought maybe, just maybe, being locked up would give me a break from the constant fear, but no. It follows me. It’s always watching.\n\nI don’t know how long I can keep going, how long I can pretend that I’m okay. I can’t take it anymore. The nightmares, the paranoia, the guilt—they all blur together.\n\nI miss Melissa. I miss her so much.\n\nI love you, Melissa. I always will.\n\nI can’t wait to join you.\n\n",

When I got into the briefing room, I sat at the open seat next to Schmidt in the back of the room. “Hey, Kid,” he said. “You hear the news?”\n\n“No, what news?” I asked with a grin.\n\n“I’m retiring,” he said. His face wore a wide, excited smile. “Just three months left.”\n\n“Oh,” I said, the grin vanished from my face, replaced by a surprised frown. “Congrats man, that’s great!”\n\nBefore either of us could say anything else, Sergeant Wells walked in the room. He was a tall, lengthy native. “Good afternoon everybody,” his voice held the same unemotional tone as his facial expressions. “Day Shift had one fight, both inmates are in Segregation, no special watches in Holding, and we are going to get some Yard done.” He gave everyone their assignments. “Jay, you are going to assist Will with running Yard. He will be here in a couple hours.” Looking around the room he asked, “That is all. If there are no other questions, let’s get to it.” Everyone stood up and walked out. I was the last one out of the room when I heard Sergeant Wells, “Jay, can you bust out the interior and exterior perimeter checks?”\n\nI felt my whole body tense up when he asked, “Yes sir.” I said, a slight tone of reluctance in my voice.\n\n“Thank you.” He said, before walking the opposite way into his office.\n\n“You’ll be alright, Jay.” Schmidt said, holding the door open for me. “It’s day time.” I stopped walking and looked at Schmidt. He gave me a knowing and reassuring nod.\n\nDid he know? I know I haven’t talked to anyone about the ‘incident’ save for Will, Mary, and Carrie. “How–” I began to ask.\n\nSchmidt grabbed my shoulders and looked me in the eyes, “It’s okay.” There was this calmness about the look in his eyes, “You’ll be okay.” As he spoke, the anxiety vanished from my mind and I started to believe the words he spoke. “C’mon, let’s get this day started.”\n\nI shook off the feeling of dread and walked with Schmidt, “Yeah, you’re right.”\n\nSchmidt just chuckled to himself, “Of course I am.” He gave me a pat on the back, “Look, I get Will trained you, but that was a long time ago. It’s time for you to pick it up.”\n\n“Hey!” I half-jokingly yelled. “Y’know, I’m glad you’re retiring.” A sly smirk forming on my face.\n\n“Oh yeah?” Schmidt said, a look of intrigue washing over his face. “Why’s that?”\n\n“Because once you’re gone, we can stop taking turns watching you.” I said.\n\n“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” He asked, a hint of annoyance in his voice.\n\n“Well, we all have to take turns watching you,” I said. “We have to make sure you don’t forget where you are.” I laughed. When I saw the look of anger and confusion on Schmidt’s face, I laughed harder. “Hey! At least we stopped carrying spare diapers to give–”\n\n“It was one fucking time, Jay!!” Schmidt yelled, the mix of laughter, anger, and embarrassment had us both keeled over struggling to breathe. After a couple seconds, Schmidt shot up, a look of horror painted on his face, “Uh-oh.”\n\nConcern quickly replaced the laughter in my voice, “What?” I asked.\n\n“I’ll see you in a little bit,” Schmidt said before running past the bathroom and into the briefing room.\n\nSergeant Wells came out of the briefing room door as Schmidt ran in, “Not again.” He said, half concerned and half laughing at the situation. “Jay! I thought it was your turn to bring the diapers.”\n\nI could hear Schmidt’s voice from in the briefing room, “You guys got Wells in on it too?!?”\n\nSergeant Wells looked at me, a rare smile on his otherwise stoic face, “Jay, once you’re done with the checks, come see me.” He looked down where Schmidt was standing, “First, get that cleaned up.”\n\n“Right away,” I said. He turned and walked back to his office. I looked down and saw a small puddle where Schmidt stood, “Ah Schmidt.” I whispered.\n\nAfter cleaning up Schmidt’s mess, I made my way outside to begin the first check. “You’ll be okay.” Schmidt’s voice echoed in my head.\n\n“Control, starting exterior perimeter check.” I radioed.\n\n“Copy, 1520.” The voice answered back.\n\nI began walking the perimeter and all was well, it was a nice, sunny day. The sounds of birds chirping and squirrels running in the trees brought an unfamiliar sense of peace to the otherwise ominous forest. Until then, I had only ever seen the evil that called the forest home. After a while, I let my guard down, taking in the sight of nature reclaiming the forest in the daylight. Once I reached the half-way point on the backside, near where Val and I thought we saw someone, when the atmosphere changed. I looked up and saw a small, dark cloud blocking the Sun. The more I looked, the more unsettled I became. Looking around, I noticed, there weren't any other clouds in the sky. “What the fuck.” I said.\n\n“Jay.” A whisper echoed from the trees.\n\nImmediately I snapped my head to the forest. I could barely see into the thick foliage. After a few moments of not seeing anything, I continued my check. The cloud covering the Sun began to dissipate, slowly giving more light around me. I looked ahead and could see the parking lot. I heard a branch snap and turned around. “Get it together,” I whispered to myself. When I looked back around, I saw a shadow on the ground in the field that separated me from the parking lot. Even though it was, maybe, fifty feet in front of me and in broad daylight, I couldn’t see anyone there, just a shadow.\n\n“Jay.” The whisper from the trees echoed again, this time a little louder than before.\n\nMy gaze was fixed on the shadow, it had started moving. The shadow seemed to be rising up out of the ground. I snapped out of my daze, “Rule 3. Just walk away.” I said to myself. Not wanting to find out what happens when you don’t follow that rule, I turned around.\n\nI started walking the way I came. Just before I crossed back over the half-way point, I heard a deep male voice coming from somewhere in the forest, “Jay. Will. Feed.”\n\nI didn’t even pause to look, I just started running. When I got back to the staff entrance, I radioed back to Control, “Perimeter check complete.”\n\nI walked inside and went straight to Sergeant Wells’ office. “Everything okay?” he asked.\n\nStill catching my breath, I sat in the chair across from his desk. I nodded and we sat in silence for a moment while I caught my breath. Sergeant Wells looked at me with concern. “Okay, I’m good.” I said. “Sorry sir.”\n\n“It’s okay,” he said. He leaned forward and looked at me for a moment. “What did you see?” he asked.\n\nI looked at him feigning confusion, “What do you mean?” I asked.\n\n“Jay, my family has lived here since before this country even existed. I know the look of someone who has seen something,” he paused, “unnatural.”\n\nI dropped the act and asked him, “Do you know what actually happened to me and Will that night?”\n\nSergeant Wells leaned back and sighed, “Yes.”\n\n“What is the story you got?” I asked.\n\nHe reached down and grabbed a packet from a drawer, “Instead of telling you, why don’t you read it.” He handed me the stack of papers, “Tell me what’s missing, I know it’s not the full story.”\n\nI read through the pages, they detailed all the events of the night of the ‘incident’ but it stopped at us returning from the clearing. No mention of Corporal D in the reports at all. “Rule 3.” I said looking back to Sergeant Wells.\n\n“What’s that?” he asked.\n\n“I ran into an instance that falls under Rule 3. That’s what happened before I came in here.” I explained.\n\nSergeant Wells watched me for a moment before asking “Anything else? I know someone who’s been through as much as you have isn’t running from a shadow.”\n\n“Uh, yeah,” I stammered, “I heard a voice I haven’t heard before.”\n\n“What do you mean, ‘haven’t heard before’?” he asked.\n\n“Well, I’ve heard the voice of the ‘Woman’ in the trees, even seen her at this point,” I said, “But this was different. It was this deep male voice. With the woman’s voice, I could always pin point the direction it came from. With this one, though,” I paused. “Sir, it almost seemed like it was the forest itself speaking to me.”\n\n“What did it say?” he asked.\n\n“Jay. Will. Feed.” I said, looking down at my hands.\n\nWhen I looked back at Sergeant Wells, I expected to see his face as it always was, expressionless. Only, when I looked back at the man across from me, I saw a look of shock across his face. “No,” he whispered. “Are you sure?” he asked. By the tone in his voice, I could tell he was more pleading for me to change my answer rather than asking a question.\n\nHis response shook me. I had never seen him show any emotions aside from the rare smile or joke. Seeing him like this, I knew something was coming, “I am.” I said.\n\nSergeant Wells picked up the phone and called someone, “Hey, it’s me,” he said. “It’s time.” I couldn’t hear the response given, but based off Sergeant Wells body language, I could tell this wasn’t a pleasant call, “Yes I’m sure. I’ll make the arrangements.” He hung up the phone and looked back at me, “Jay, what do you know of the old gods?”\n\n“Not much,” I said, “I was raised Christian, but I don’t really subscribe to any one religion now.”\n\n“There’s someone I want to introduce you to. They may be able to give you the answers you’re looking for.” He said. “I’ll let you know when. In the meantime, read this.” He handed me a small book.\n\nI grabbed it and looked at the cover, ‘The Various Gods of the Forest and What to do if One Calls on You.’ “Thanks,” I said.\n\nI got up and walked to the door, “Hey, Jay,” Sergeant Wells said, “Don’t let your guard down, that’s when you’re vulnerable.”\n\n“Understood.” I said before walking through the door.\n\nI took a moment to collect myself before continuing on with the interior check. “Bitch.” Will’s unmistakable voice said from behind me.\n\n“Bitch,” I replied. This had become our unofficial greeting some time ago. Neither of us know why or who started it. “Thought you weren’t coming in for a couple more hours.” I said.\n\n“Yeah, but I had nothing else going on and they said I could show up early if I wanted.” He said. “What’s left to do?\n\n“Just have to do the interior check, then we can start running Yard.” I said.\n\n“You already did the exterior check?” Will asked.\n\nI looked down at the ground, “Yeah, I just got back about fifteen minutes ago.” I said, my voice softly trailing off.\n\nHe raised one eyebrow in curiosity. “How was it?” he asked.\n\n“It was fine.” I coughed in an attempt at feigning confidence and hiding my nervousness.\n\nWill being Will, saw right through it, “What’d you see?” he asked, a playfully annoyed tone in his voice.\n\nI looked up at him, those piercing green eyes giving me a knowing look, “Followed Rule 3 and backtracked.”\n\nHis face changed from annoyed curiosity to concern. “Was it in the field?” Will asked, sounding like he really hoped he was wrong.\n\nI shot Will a confused look, “How–”\n\n“That’s where I saw it for the first time too.” He said. “Everyone’s first sight of it seems to be from that field.”\n\n“Wonder why.” I said.\n\n“I haven’t gotten an answer, but I also don’t really want to know.” He said. “Anything else?”\n\n“Not really,” I said.\n\n“Don’t bullshit me, Jay.” Will said. “We’ve been friends too long for you to lie about that. At least make up something good.” He laughed and slapped me on the back. “Seriously though, what else happened?”\n\nI adjusted my vest and sighed, “It was another voice.” We began walking, “A male’s voice this time. Something just felt…” I paused trying to find the right word, “malevolent.”\n\n“I’ve only ever heard the woman’s voice.” Will said. We walked through the door and into the yard. “Nice day out,” he said, looking at the sky.\n\n“It said, ‘Jay. Will. Feed.’ same cadence as the woman too.” I explained.\n\n“You don’t think it could be related to the other incidents do you?” he asked.\n\n“I can’t think of what else it could be.” I said. “What’s weird about it, is that when I try and remember what he said, I swear I can hear the woman’s threats from my first shift.”\n\nWill and I completed the interior check, “Let’s put a pin in it for now.” He notified control that the interior check was complete and recreation was beginning. “Let’s start with H-Pod.” Will said, opening the entry door.\n\nWill walked in and I stood at the door, holding it open for the inmates to exit. “Single file guys!” I yelled. I counted as they walked past me. As the last inmate walked by, I looked back at Will, “That it?” He gave me a thumbs up, “Okay, I counted twenty, two zero.” I said.\n\nI turned around and watched the inmates while I held the door waiting for Will. “You set a timer?” he asked.\n\n“Yes.” I said, showing Will my watch.\n\nAfter a while, I looked down at my watch and saw there were ten minutes left. I told Will and he cupped his hands around his mouth, “Alright guys, ten minute warning!” He yelled.\n\nI scanned the yard and saw an inmate standing by the fence in the portion of the yard that bordered where I had heard the voice earlier. I began walking towards him, and as I got closer I noticed he wasn’t just looking at the scenery, “Hey!” I yelled, “Back away from the fence.” He didn’t react. I couldn’t tell who he was with his back towards me.\n\nA few inmates in the area looked at me then at the one I was yelling at. One of them, I recognized as inmate Zulu, tapped the inmate on the shoulder, “Hey bro, CO is trying to talk to you.”\n\nI saw the inmate shake his head, like he was snapping out of being zoned out, “Huh? Oh, sorry.” He said, turning around. I saw his face and recognized him as inmate Smith. “What’s up CO?” he asked.\n\n“You good?” I asked. “I was just telling you to back away from the fence.”\n\n“Yeah, I’m uh,” he stammered, “I’m good. Just kinda zoned out y’know?”\n\nHe started walking back away from the fence. The look on his face was one of fear. “Something catch your eye?” I asked.\n\nHe shifted on his feet for a moment, “No, I just zoned out.”\n\n“Okay.” I said, dropping the topic. I looked down at my watch and gave Will a nod.\n\n“Time’s up, everyone in!” he yelled.\n\nOnce all inmates were accounted for and secured in their units, Will and I made our way to G-Pod (another General Population unit similar to H-Pod) for the next yard rotation. While we walked, I couldn’t keep my eyes from wandering to where inmate Smith was staring. “Something feels off.” I said.\n\n“Try not to think about it until we are done with this,” Will said. “Not saying you’re wrong, I feel it too, just don’t think about it.”\n\nWhen we got to G-Pod, we repeated the process. As the last inmate walked past, I called out “Nineteen, one nine.” As Will followed me out, I reset the timer.\n\nWe stood there watching the yard in silence. After a minute, a nervous looking inmate I didn’t recognize walked up to us. “Excuse me, CO Jay,” he said, his voice was shaky, “Can I go back in? I don’t feel safe out here.”\n\nI eyed him curiously, “If one goes back, you all go back. Officer Will warned you guys of this before we came out here.” He definitely did not look like the type to scare easily, let alone be threatened.\n\n“I know, but I keep getting this feeling that I’m being watched,” he said.\n\n“Just have a seat over there,” Will said, pointing to a wall a few feet from us, “we’ll be right here. You don’t have much longer left.”\n\nHe nodded and sat down where Will pointed. About five minutes later, the nervous inmate got up and started walking around. Not thinking about it, Will and I continued to stand there and watch. My watch started beeping, “Time’s up, let’s go.” I yelled.\n\nI held the door open and counted as the inmates walked back in. “Eightteen, one eight.” I yelled to Will. After the words left my mouth, my face dropped. “We’re down one.”\n\nWill ran past me through the door, “Shit!” he yelled.\n\nI followed, and we got into the yard. “What the fuck?” I said looking up. Not three minutes earlier, it was sunny out, not a cloud in sight. Dark, dense clouds filled the sky and the low rumble of thunder in the distance.\n\nWe split up and searched the yard. It didn’t take long to find the missing inmate. “Jay!” Will yelled, “I found him.”\n\nI ran over to Will, who was already placing a tourniquet on the inmate’s right arm. There were large open slices going up and down each arm. Without hesitation, I put a tourniquet on his other arm, “What the fuck happened?” I asked. Immediately I realized it was the same spot inmate Smith had zoned out.\n\nWill felt the inmate's neck for a pulse, “Nothing,” he shook his head.\n\nI began to run for an AED and notified Control that EMS was needed. When I got back, Will was already beginning compressions. “One more cycle and it’s your turn.” He panted.\n\nI got the AED prepped and swapped with Will. “Cut his shirt,” I said. Will grabbed his shears and cut open the inmate’s shirt. We both jumped back when his chest was exposed, “How the fuck is that possible?” I yelled.\n\nThere, on his chest, the words, ‘I. Tried. He. Died.’ were carved, deeply, into his skin. “That’s fucked.” Will said.\n\nI jumped back into compressions, while Will attached the AED Pads. We ran the cycle, each taking three turns. The AED didn’t detect any rhythm and when EMS got on scene, it didn’t take them long to call it. Sergeant Wells got our statements before clearing us to go clean up. Standing there with EMS and Will seemed like an eternity. About twenty minutes later, Will and I were cleaning up in the locker room. “His back,” I said. “You said there was blood on his back, right?” I asked Will.\n\n“Yeah?” Will said, wiping blood off his arms.\n\nI grabbed a towel and wiped my own arms off, “If he was laying face down, with his arms underneath him, how would he have blood coming through the back of his shirt when you got there?” I asked.\n\n“You mean, you think there’s another message on the back?” Will said.\n\n“Exactly.” I said. We walked out the locker room door and into a smaller room that held four desks with computers. When I started it was referred to as the ‘report room’. A place for officers to come and write reports when there weren't any other computers available. I took a seat at one of the empty desks and began my report. After about an hour, I was done. “Will, are you done yet?” I asked.\n\n“Just about,” he said, “before I submit it, could you read it over?”\n\n“Yeah, only if you read mine.” I said.\n\nHe nodded and stood up, switching desks with me. After a few minutes, we were done. “Your’s looks fine.” Will said.\n\n“Yours too,” I said. With a sly smirk growing on my face, “You fucking killed it man. Great report.”\n\nWill laughed, “Thanks, I was just dying to read yours. It didn’t disappoint.” We laughed for a few minutes. As dark as it was, it was a nice reprieve from what we just went through.\n\nJust then, Sergeant Wells called us to his office. When we walked through the door, he was standing in front of his desk. “Gentlemen,” he said with a nod, “how are you guys holding up?”\n\nWill and I looked at eachother and back at Sergeant Wells, “All things considered,” Will spoke, “good. It was a bloodbath, but we are all cleaned up and reports written.”\n\n“What’s up, sir?” I asked.\n\nSergeant Wells walked around his desk and sat down before motioning for us to do the same. “So, do either of you know just how it happened?” he asked.\n\n“To be completely honest sir,” I said, “no. I have no clue.”\n\n“And you?” he said to Will.\n\n“One second he was sitting there next to us,” Will said. “The next, he got up and started walking. Nothing out of the ordinary though.”\n\nSergeant Wells sat for a moment before turning his monitor towards us. “Watch,” he said before pressing play.\n\nOn the screen, the footage replayed. The inmate was sitting next to me and Will before getting up and walking. He stopped right in the spot inmate Smith zoned out and I noticed him displaying the same behavior. From where Will and I stood, he was in a blind spot and when he got up to walk away, he disappeared into another group of inmates. Once everyone was inside, he just fell down. “Sir,” Will said, “how did he get the cuts?”\n\n“Keep watching.” He said.\n\nWe watched in horror as he writhed on the ground. After a moment, he went limp. Thirty, or so, seconds later, something rolled him onto his stomach, his arms moved underneath him. “Holy shit,” I mumbled.\n\n“Here’s where it gets weird,” Sergeant Wells said, fast forwarding to Will and I arriving. As soon as I got back with the AED and took over, this dark shadow appeared, standing right on top of the inmate. Sergeant Wells rewound the footage and played it back, slower. I felt a knot form in my throat as I realized the shadow didn’t just appear. It stood up.\n\n“Is that-” I began.\n\n“Yeah, it is.” Sergeant said, his voice was solemn.\n\nWe sat in silence, the footage paused on the image of the inmate’s ghost. After a while, I said, “I never even knew his name.” The seriousness setting in.\n\nI’ve talked with therapists, friends, families, and, hell, even some clergy over the years. You can tell yourself it’s a part of the job, make jokes, drink, or cope with other things. The fact of the matter is, no matter what you see doing this job, some things follow you home. I say that because working here, the only thing that follows you home are the thoughts, memories, ‘the woman’, and the battle scars. I hear stories of ghosts following paranormal investigators around, or attaching to people at random, but here, there hasn’t been any story of that happening. Something won’t let them leave.\n\n“Sir, Jay has reason to believe there’s another message, like the one on his chest, on his back.” Will said.\n\nSergeant Wells looked at us with intrigue. “Is that so?” he asked.\n\n“Yes.” I said. “The footage cements my theory. See, Will said when he got to the inmate, there was blood coming through the back of his shirt, but that couldn’t have been from his arms because his arms were underneath him. Even in the footage, there was no point when he even reached for his back.”\n\n“Go on.” Sergeant Wells said.\n\n“On his chest there was a message. ‘I. Tried. He. Died.’ Something about that just seems,” I paused, “incomplete. I feel like there’s more to it.”\n\nSergeant Wells looked back at the screen and pulled up some photos, “We took the pictures when the coroner showed up.” The first picture was of his wrists, “They aren’t clean cuts, don’t know what caused it, but we should have the autopsy results in a week or so.” The second picture was of his chest and stomach, “Here’s the message you guys saw.” Sergeant Wells looked at me, “You were right in your assumption.” He pulled up the last picture. “Jay. Will. Feed.” He paused, looking at me and Will, “Anything you need to tell me?”\n\n“No.” Will said.\n\n“That’s the message I heard come from the woods.” I said.\n\n“That’s what worries me.” He said. “Hopefully, he heard it too, and this is some kind of sick joke.”\n\n“Hopefully?” Will asked, a tone of disbelief in his voice.\n\n“Yes, hopefully. Because the alternative is much, much worse.” Sergeant Wells said. “If this is an unnatural force as we suspect, this won’t be the only body you’ll see.”\n\nOutside his office door, we could hear graveyard coming into the briefing room. “Sounds like it’s almost time to go home.” Will said.\n\n“I hope you’re right, Sergeant.” I said.\n\nWe all stood up, and Sergeant Wells walked us to the door, “Let me know if you guys need anything. Thank you for the help today.”\n\nAs we walked into the hallway, I felt this overwhelming sense of dread. Val rounded the corner and froze when she looked at us. “What’s wrong?” I asked.\n\nWill and I walked up to Val. Her eyes never moved, they stayed fixed on where we were. “What the fuck is that?!” she yelled, pointing behind us.\n\nI followed her shaking hand and saw this black mist forming right behind where me and Will were just standing. “No,” Will breathed out in a defeated tone.\n\nBefore I could react, the realization hit me. There was a shadow in front of us and Val had acknowledged it. I opened my mouth to speak but nothing came out. I turned my head to look back away before the shadow had fully manifested. I saw Val’s eyes were still fixed on whatever was behind me, her eyes were wide and tears were beginning to form. Her mouth hung open in shocked silence. “Will?” I pleaded, hoping he would have some solution.\n\nWhen I turned my gaze from Val to Will, he was standing there frozen. A look of anger on his face. He looked up in shock as the lights on the ceiling went off with a loud ‘pop’, one by one. Val looked at me, then at Will, the look of horror and fear replaced with a look of sadness and contempt. “It’ll be okay,” she said as the darkness enveloped the three of us.\n\nI felt a freezing cold breeze on my skin, shortly followed by the sound of a pained scream. I closed my eyes and winced at the thought of what Val was enduring. It was quick. Almost as soon as the scream started, it stopped and was followed by a hollow ‘thud’, much like the sound of a sack of potatoes falling on the ground. “Jay, you okay?” Will’s voice cut through the silence.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the lights were back on, and Will was standing next to me looking at the ground beside us. “Yeah, I’m goo–” I looked down and saw Val. She was laying on the ground, her body was broken but she was breathing. “Shit!” I yelled.\n\nSergeant Wells rushed to us and dragged Will and I into the briefing room while the medical staff tended to Val. “What happened?” he asked.\n\nWill and I looked at each other and then back at Sergeant Wells. Almost at the same time, We said, “Rule 3.”\n\nSergeant Wells pinched the bridge of his nose, “Fuck. Make sure you guys write a report on what happened and go home. I’ll review the footage and see what it was.”\n\n“You don’t need to.” Will said.\n\n“What do you mean?” Sergeant Wells asked.\n\nWill looked at Sergeant Wells, the anger returned to his face, “It was the spirit of the inmate from earlier.”\n\n“How do you know for certain?” I asked.\n\n“Well, two reasons.” Will said, sitting down at a table behind him. “First, Val is still breathing. Which means it’s young and not as powerful as the others. Second, I caught a glimpse of it when I was turning around. It was the same face that stared back at me earlier. Only difference with this was that there was absolutely no life to his face at all.”\n\nSomething about what Will said made me feel ill. “I’ll be right back.” I said, running towards the locker room. Once I got inside, I splashed water on my face for a moment and felt the color return.\n\nWhen I walked back into the briefing room, I heard Will and Sergeant Wells talking, “You need to talk to him.” Sergeant Wells said.\n\n“I know, but I don’t need him getting–” Will cut himself off when I walked in the room. “Jay, you feeling better?”\n\n“Tell who what?” I asked.\n\nWill hung his head and sighed. “You doing anything tonight?” he asked.\n\n“No?” I said. “What do we need to talk about?”\n\nWill sighed, “Let’s wrap it up here and we’ll get a drink.”\n\n“Okay?” I said, still confused and slightly suspicious of what Will needed to talk to me about.\n\nAs we finished our reports on what happened to Val, and got ready to leave, Sergeant Wells voice yelled filled the room, “Fuck, why?!”\n\nI looked up from the computer as I logged off, “Whoah, what’s wrong Sergeant?”\n\nSergeant Wells was standing in the doorway, he was out of breath. “The woman,” he breathed, “She’s– fuck!” He bent forward, placing his hands on his knees, and took a deep breath and nodded, “Okay, I think I’m good now.” He stood back up and looked at me and Will, “I was watching the footage from the yard and I noticed something.”\n\n“I thought we already watched all of it.” Will said.\n\n“I backed the footage up to when the guy dropped, this time from a different camera.” Sergeant Wells sat down and put a thumb drive into the computer, “Watch.”\n\nHe zoomed in on the inmate and just on the other side of the fence, she was there. “Holy shit.” I said.\n\n“Keep watching,” Sergeant Wells said. As the footage played on, the woman stood there staring at the inmate. Her mouth was moving and she held a hand up towards him. Right when he fell to the ground, she looked up at the camera, winked and vanished. “Another message.” Sergeant Wells sighed.\n\n“Well, we knew that.” Will said.\n\n“This is different though,” I said, “Ryan broke a rule, the consequence was him vanishing. Him being a message was more of a convenience. This was deliberate, they went out of their way to send this message to us.”\n\n“What do you mean, Ryan was the message?” Will asked.\n\n“Will, I know I said that I’d stop asking,” I said, internally bracing for the usual frustrated answer, “What do you remember from the incident?”\n\nWill sighed, “Everything.”\n\nI felt my heart rate rise, I expected the usual answer ‘nothing now please stop asking’ but this caught me off guard. “What do you mean?” A hint of surprised anger in my voice.\n\nWill looked up, a look of frustration washed over him, “I remember it all, Jay.” He sat down and let out a nervous chuckle. The frustration left his face and was replaced with the look of relief, I watched as his body physically reacted to him unloading the metaphorical burden. After a moment, he looked back at me, “Jay, I am so sorry. I know I told you I didn’t remember.”\n\n“Why?” I asked, still in shock. “Why hide it?”\n\nA look of shame and embarrassment now took hold of Will’s face, “I didn’t want you to have to relive that night. A lot of shit happened and I know you don’t remember it. Jay, I–”\n\n“Didn’t,” I cut in.\n\nWill cocked his head slightly to the side, “What?”\n\n“I didn’t remember.” I said, “That’s how I know Ryan was the message.” I pulled out my phone, “I went through a lot of shit, but I remember what happened.” I flipped through my gallery and played the video Mary took of my meditation session.\n\n“Holy shit.” Will said after the video had finished.\n\n“That was just one of the things I tried,” I explained, “but it wasn’t the thing that brought my memories back.”\n\n“What else did you try?” Sergeant Wells asked.\n\n“I did a few different things, but the one thing that actually worked was hypnotherapy.” I said.\n\nAfter I told them the story of my hypnotherapy sessions, Sergeant Wells told us to go home for the day. Will and I stood up and walked with Sergeant Wells down the hallway, “Wait a minute.” Will said, stopping at a picture on the wall.\n\n“What’s up?” I asked.\n\n“Doesn’t that building look familiar?” Will asked, pointing at a picture.\n\nI looked closely at the picture and realized it was the hospital we visited Ryan in, “Yeah, it does.”\n\n“It shouldn’t,” Sergeant Wells said, “that was the old medical plaza.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\n\n“Twenty years ago, they built a new hospital down the road. It replaced the medical plaza.” Sergeant Wells explained. “When I was in high school, me and some friends went looking for that old building. We were going through an ‘urban exploration’ phase. Only problem is when we got to where we thought it was, there was nothing there but a clearing in the forest.”\n\n“Maybe you guys went to the wrong spot?” Will asked.\n\n“That’s what we thought, but when I asked my dad about it, he confirmed we went to the right spot.” Sergeant Wells said. “My mom used to work there and all our doctors offices were there, so we knew where we were going.”\n\n“Did you ever go back?” I asked.\n\n“The next day actually.” He said. “My mom thought we were full of shit so she drove me there. We turned onto the road and once we got close, the road ended. It was like the forest reclaimed the land. She insisted on getting out and walking. We got to the clearing and the only sign of the building was the concrete corner for the base of the sign.”\n\nI looked at the picture next to it, “Hey, Will? Doesn’t this one look like that DHS building?”\n\nWill looked at the picture, “Holy shit, yeah it does.”\n\nThere was this faint, familiar voice seemingly coming from right next to us, “Can I help you?” When we looked around and saw nobody there. “Can I help you?” it repeated, trailing off like a memory.\n\nWill and I looked at each, “Was that?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, it was.” Will said. “Hey, Sergeant, do you know anything about that building?”\n\nSergeant Wells shook his head, “No, I don’t know where that even is.”\n\n“Sergeant Wells, please report to your office for an incoming call.” A voice over the radio.\n\nWill and I stood there staring at the picture in silence while Sergeant Wells disappeared into his office. “Will, Jay, get in here.” Sergeant Wells' voice echoed through the hall.\n\nWe walked into his office, he was sitting at his desk. His eyes fixed on the screen. “What’s going on sir?” I asked.\n\n“What the fuck is that?” He asked, pointing at the screen.\n\nI circled around him and froze when I saw the screen. It was Ryan. “There’s no way.” He was on the outside of the perimeter fence, just staring at the camera.\n\nWill leaned in and looked at the screen for a moment before saying, “That’s not Ryan. Look closer.”\n\nSergeant Wells and I leaned forward, “Looks like Ryan to me.” Sergeant Wells said.\n\n“He’s right,” I said, “That may look like Ryan but really look at it.”\n\nSergeant Wells squinted and rewound the footage. He froze it on a clearer image of Ryan’s face. His eyes widened and he immediately turned off the computer. “Time to leave.” He said, quickly standing up. “Follow me.”\n\nWe walked behind him, trying to keep up with his pace. “Sergeant, what’s happening?” I asked.\n\n“Not here.” He said, slight panic in his voice. We followed him out and into the parking lot. “Get in.” He said, opening the door to his car.\n\nWill and I got in. “Sir, where are we going?” Will asked.\n\nSergeant Wells didn’t answer. He drove us off the reservation and into the neighboring city. After pulling into an abandoned parking lot, Sergeant Wells got out. “Do you know what a Skin Wearer is?” he asked.\n\n“Why did we drive all the way out here?” I asked, stepping out of the car.\n\n“Do you know what it is?” He asked.\n\n“A skinwalker?” Will asked.\n\n“Worse. So much worse.” Sergeant Wells said. “I had to take us off the reservation. If one is near and you speak about them, it acts as some kind of call and attracts more. The only way to make sure you aren’t near one, is to go as far away from the forest as possible.”\n\n“So, what is it?” I asked.\n\n“Nobody knows what’s underneath the skin they wear.” He said. “Skinwalkers might mimic voices, or take the shape of an animal or something familiar to lure their victim in. Skin Wearers, however, wear the skin of their last victim and psychologically torture their target relentlessly. Once the target is broken and gives up, whatever is inside multiplies and takes over. The skin is the only thing remotely ‘human’ about it.”\n\n“Ryan isn’t the first we’ve seen.” Will said. “That voice in the hallway was the same as one we encountered in that DHS Building.”\n\nSergeant Wells looked confused, “What voice?” he asked.\n\n“Right before you went to your office, there was a voice that said, ‘Can I help you?’ Did you not hear it?” I asked.\n\n“No, I didn’t.” Sergeant Wells said. “But tell me about the Skin Wearer you saw.”\n\n“Do you remember it Jay?” Will asked.\n\nI nodded, “He wore a suit. Only thing is that the suit looked to be more skin than clothes. There was no gap or give where you would normally see the clothes separate from the body. His fingers were too long and almost claw-like.” I sighed, “The face, however, was the creepiest part. The skin was stretched and looked like–”\n\nThe sound of heavy steps slowly approached us. “Shh.” Will said.\n\nAs the steps got closer, it sounded more like someone with limp legs picking up and dropping their legs rather than natural walking. “Jay. Will. Feed.” the voice growled the words out. Just when whatever was walking towards us should have stepped into view, everything went silent. Like something had sucked all the noise of the city up and swallowed it. “Jay. Will. Feed.” it said, quicker this time.\n\nThere was a deep animalistic growl that echoed through the parking lot. I could feel the ground vibrate underneath me. We all piled back into the car, “Let’s get the fuck out of here.” I said.\n\nWe drove back to the facility, all the while the feeling of being watched never leaving. As soon as we parked, Sergeant Wells’ phone began to ring. “Hello?” he said. After listening to whoever was on the other end, Sergeant Wells looked at me and Will, “They found a body on the perimeter.”",

        "content": "Im a girl with a friend group of three boys. They get into stupid shenanigans all the time, but growing up I was always told \"boys will be boys\" so I never paid any mind to it. I've known two of them since middle school, and the third was my fiance, so more often than not I was with them on these stupid adventures.\nWe were young, bearly eighteen when we hung out that day. \n\n\n\"Dude, we should go somewhere tonight. Im bored as hell.\"\n\nJoseph said with a groan as he flicked out his cigarette. \n\n\"Where would we go? It's like midnight.\"\n\nKyle asked, we were hanging out at my house, which was in the most boring city in the state. \n\n\"You feel like driving for a bit? I have this app that takes you to haunted places.\"\n\nJoseph quoted the phrase \"haunted places\" with his fingers. Half of these apps were scams anyways, but we were bored and stupid, just wanted to drive. \n\n\"What the hell? Doesn't sound like a bad idea.\"\n\nMy fiance agreed nonchalantly. Every show on the television getting boring and it was the weekend, nobody had anything to do.\n\nWe got into Kyle's car, he had the best tires out of the four of ours. He pulled the address onto his GPS, the car filled with the usual banter. It took about an hour until we were out of town and at the location. An old, rundown and possibly abandoned graveyard. I had a bad feeling from the start, but we asked for a haunted place and got one.\nJoseph had this app on his phone, it was supposed to transmit radio frequencies into a voice from the deceased. Feeling like it would make the trip even more creepy than it's looks, he pulled it up as we walked down the dirt path that separated rows of tombstones. \n\nHonestly, it was boring at first until the app made a static sound then played a distorted voice. \n\n\"Over here.\"\n\nThe voice said, it was deep and unclear but we were able to understand it. I heard Kyle mutter \"What the fuck?\", normally the app made random sounds, if anything at all but it was giving directions. \n\n\"Where?\"\n\nJoseph asked to the darkness outside of our cellphone flashlights. It took a few moments of listening to static, until it spoke again. \n\n\"Your right.\"\n\nWith that, we turned to our right, walking in between tombs. \n\n\"Keep going.\"\n\nIt said after we got to the last tombstone before it cut off into a dark forest. Finally, Kyle spoke again, pulling Joseph back by his shoulder while me and my fiance walked closely behind.\n\n\"We arnet going in that, are we? It'll end up being some hunting ground and we'll get shot.\"\n\nKyle gestured to the forest, personally going there would be the last thing I do but I was along for the ride and didn't want to be left alone anywhere. Before Joseph could speak again, a woman's voice, though bearly understandable spoke through the phone.\n\n\"Turn back.\"\n\n\"Yeah, fuck this.\"\n\nKyle said as he turned around, my fince and I followed him while Joseph stood at the forest edge for a moment before following us. As we got back on the path, we heard a growl come from the forest. Assuming it was some animal, we kept walking, my finance keeping an eye in the darkness of the trees. \nWe kept walking, reading some forgotten tombs, wiping some of the dirt off so at least the names were legible. But everyone was a bit quieter, as if they felt the same sense of impending doom as I was. \n\n\"Get out while you can.\"\n\nA woman's voice spoke through the app once again, right after that happened it sounded like there was running in the forest and it was approaching us. Rapidly.\nWe didn't think twice while we ran to the car, the run felt like forever, the slamming doors of the car seeming to echo in the dense atmosphere and without wasting time, Kyle started to speed off.\n\nHis car had three rows of seats. The third put up because of a time we hung out with two more of our mutual friends, I had my elbow on the seat behind me as he drove. My finance sitting next to me and Joseph in the passenger seat. We actually felt more at ease after while, until I felt something scratch my forearm as it hung behind the seat. I quickly retracted it.\n\n\"Ow! The fuck was that?\"\n\nI said as if something in Kyle's trunk scratched me. He always left useless things back there that he never bothered to take out. He looked in the mirror at me, and in the darkness of the third row of seats he seen only two dots floating right next to eachother. Eyes.\n\n\"Holy shit! Jay, there's someone back there!\"\n\nHe swerved a bit as he suddenly yelled, my fiance out of fear and confusion threw his arm back in a punch. There was a smack before the eyes disappeared into thin air.\n\nIts been months since that trip, but all four of us occasionally see those eyes in the darkness. It's never tried to touch us again after it scratched me. We're hanging out at my house as I type this, Kyle just looked up and seen a silhouette in the darkness. It's head was bent since it was so tall it had to duck to the roof, it's limbs skinny and unnaturally long to it's body. \n\nIt's standing right next to the front door, and blocking off the hallway to the back.",

        "content": "Not sure how this will be received but I gotta get this out there in case anyone is thinking about doing what I did. \n\nAnd that would be going hunting in Utah’s Fishlake National Park. Alone. At night.\n\nOkay, so first off please don’t DM me—I know it’s illegal in a thousand different ways. Hunting at night? Check. Trespassing on private property? Check check. In fact, I’m pretty sure using thermal goggles to hunt deer is also outlawed but don’t quote me on that.\n\nBut before last week, I honestly didn’t give a fuck. I’m not a poacher or trying to bag some trophy buck while he’s sleeping. I mean, snagging a wall hanger would be sweet, don’t get me wrong. But that wasn’t what got me behind the wheel a quarter past midnight two Sundays back, making my way from Park City to the heart of the wilderness.\n\nIt was about the thrill. That feeling of doing something I wasn’t supposed to. The freedom of standing under the stars in the middle of nowhere, untethered from rules and expectations. It’s the same force that gets graffiti artists sneaking down highway on-ramps and teens knocking over mailboxes on a Saturday night. In a way, doing something illegal is the definition of freedom.\n\nBut that’s not really the fuckup. Wasn’t like I got found out. The fuckup is what I found.\n\nOn the drive out, I was figuring I’d have to park my Jeep far from the border fence. But on a hunch, I decided to get right up close to the guard station along the Joseph Mountain Road entrance. And wouldn’t you know it—the goddamn gate arm wasn’t even down.\n\nI don’t care how many “No Trespassing” signs they had up—you don’t got a locked gate or at least a guard on duty and you’re basically begging me to come in and play. “Punishable by up to three years in prison” wasn’t gonna sway me either.\n\nAnyone who’s been knows the park is goddamn massive. Nobody was gonna notice me skulking around for a few hours.\n\nWasn’t until I was about ten minutes into the pitch-black wilderness that my heart started to pump. Seeing the world of trees and brush materialize in my headlights got me a bit keyed up. Kept thinking I’d see something pop into those high-beams at any moment.\n\nBut nothing did. I was truly alone out there.\n\nI pulled the Jeep into a dirt shoulder and killed the engine. Felt like I’d turned off the world. If not for the stars above, I might’ve thought I’d gone and died. Couldn’t be dead, though, because I felt more alive than ever. Felt fucking good.\n\nBrought a basic Remington 700, which I slung over my shoulder. With my hunting pack and my thermals hanging around my neck, I clicked on my Maglite and jumped from my car. Threw a pin down in Google Maps so I wouldn’t be searching for the Jeep later.\n\nThe night was unnervingly quiet. Figured on that familiar chorus of crickets shrieking or at least some nocturnal animal activity. But no. Pure silence around me. Not even a breeze to rustle the evergreens.\n\nOnly sound in the world was the crunch of my boots through the underbrush.\n\nI hiked about a mile into the woods with my Maglite combing the ground before I started finding signs of game. A few broken branches, hoofprints in the soft earth. Felt exhilarating.\n\nI tend to lean more to the ‘get drunk in a blind’ kinda hunter. Used to have a bumper sticker on my old 4x4 that said “The worst day hunting still beats the best day doing anything else.” I know, don’t get on me. I was 24 at the time. Point is, this was real fucking hunting. Had to pull out all my Eagle Scout training for this shit.\n\nMiddle of nowhere, I felt like I was getting close. Found a print that couldn’t have been more than an hour old, and heard some activity beyond the reach of my light. Skin was tingling. Figured this was the time.\n\nSo I clicked off the light. Let the black void wash over me.\n\nMy eyes adjusted, the stars above came into focus. I listened.\n\nNothing.\n\nSo I slung the thermal goggles on. Strapped that elastic band across the back of my head.\n\nThey hummed nice and soft as they powered up, and just like that—\n\nMy entire world faded up from black to shades of icy blue.\n\nThe entire forest stretched out before me.\n\nA cold, serene expanse.\n\nBut no goddamn heat signatures.\n\nI scanned the area. Looking for any hint of warm color. But there was nothing. No deer, no raccoons, not even a goddamn squirrel. Couldn’t believe it. Figured I’d have at least a few animals hiding around me in the dark. But I was truly alone.\n\nBut just then, I saw it.\n\nAt first, I thought the goggles were glitching.\n\nFifty feet away, there was a man. Or at least through the goggles it *looked* like a man.\n\nExcept it wasn’t that standard infrared mix of red, orange, and yellow.\n\nNo, it was completely black against the blue surroundings. Not warm, not even cold. To be that dark, that thing had to be sub-fucking-zero. Like a void carved from the landscape. A negative space.\n\nAt first, I didn’t know how to react. I couldn’t understand what I was seeing. I stood dead-still at least a minute, just staring. I felt my blood rise into my face with each passing second as I slowly realized how impossible this thing was. The rational part of me said it had to be a trick of the goggles. Some kind of interference or weather phenomenon. Like a pocket of chill or something. Makes no sense, but that was the best I could come up with.\n\nEven still, I didn’t believe it because I couldn’t shake this feeling in my gut.\n\n*That it was watching me.*\n\nAfter an eternity of that staring contest, I finally yanked the goggles off and flipped on my Maglite. I pointed it right toward the spot where it stood. But there was nothing there.\n\nJust trees, foliage, and the infinite black night beyond.\n\nMy stomach told me to just get the fuck out of there. But I had to double-check what I saw. Flashlight off again, I put the goggles on. They were still humming as the world went indigo.\n\nAnd there it was. Still standing exactly where it had been before. Still staring, just like when an animal catches you looking at it and freezes, on edge, deciding if it needs to book it or not.\n\nJust then, my heart jumped into my throat.\n\nA twig snapped to my left.\n\nI whipped my head around and my stomach dropped.\n\nThere was another one.\n\nAnd this guy was *moving*.\n\nSlowly weaving through the trees like it was just snooping around, curious.\n\nI wish I could describe these things better for you. In the blue landscape of the thermals, they are like living shadows. Flat and depthless. Negative space is really the best way to say it. They are like those accordion arts-‘n-crafts projects we all did back in elementary school. The ones where you cut a stick figure out of a folded piece of paper and open it up to reveal twenty empty-space figures in a row.\n\nAnd now that I knew what I was looking for, suddenly I realized that there weren’t just two.\n\nI did a 360. A super slow turn so I wouldn’t make a sound. Hell, I was even holding my breath at this point. They were all around me. Some standing still, some walking. One or two were bent down low, inspecting shit on the ground like they were scientists taking samples.\n\nBut none of them seemed the least bit concerned that I was there. Either they didn’t notice me or they didn’t care. I took a step back, and none of them reacted to the sound of the leaves crunching under my feet. I was safe.\n\nThat’s when I should have just packed it in and peaced out. But of course I didn’t. The adrenaline of trespassing had nothing on the feeling of seeing these things. And I guess I wanted more.\n\nThe nearest one was only a few feet away, near a tree. Staring up into its branches by the look of it—although it was impossible to tell if it was facing away or toward me. These things were literally featureless.\n\nSo against my better judgment, I crept up to it.\n\nIt didn’t react to my proximity, so I figured I was still in the clear. Something inside me wanted to know if it was as empty as it looked. Like, if I tried to touch it, would my hand go straight through and touch the tree bark beyond?\n\nSo I reached out.\n\nReal slow so I wouldn’t scare it or its buddies.\n\nMy fingers extended.\n\nUntil finally—\n\nI touched it.\n\nIt wasn’t as empty as it looked.\n\nIt was solid, and touching it fucking HURT.\n\nThe moment my fingertip made contact, pain shot through me like an electric shock. I jerked my hand back. In the thermal vision, my finger had gone totally blue. Frostbite. Knew by morning it would be bright red and singing.\n\nBut that wasn’t the worst part.\n\nAs I held my finger tight in my hand, I noticed something.\n\nThe figure had turned toward me, looking straight at me.\n\n*A foot from my face.*\n\nI staggered back.\n\nThe others—all of them—had stopped what they were doing.\n\n*They were all looking at me.*\n\nTheir attention was suffocating. Even though they didn’t have eyes, I could feel their gaze, cold and piercing, like icicles stabbing into my chest. And then—\n\nThey started moving.\n\nNot fast, but deliberate.\n\nToward me.\n\nAll in this identical, unhurried gait. Like they knew they didn’t need to rush.\n\nNo more fucking around—I finally took off.\n\nI tore outta there, straight through the blue woods. Branches slashing my face and arms. Had to hold my goggles on to keep them from slipping. Hadn’t run that fast since high school track. Didn’t dare look back, but I could hear them. The soft crunch of leaves. Those deliberate steps. So slow and yet somehow always just a few feet behind me.\n\nBy the time I got back to the Jeep, my quads were on fire. I tossed my 700 in the back and jumped in the driver seat. Felt like at any second I might feel an ice-cold hand on my shoulder. But I got the door closed and slammed the keys into the ignition. Flipped on the headlights out of instinct and nearly fucking blinded myself.\n\nTurned em off, let the spots dance away from my vision before I drove away with my goggles still on.\n\nAnd as I got out of there, I glanced in the rearview mirror.\n\nThey were there, standing at the edge of the road.\n\nAll of them. Black, featureless forms beyond the glare of the taillights’ heat.\n\nThat was a week ago. My finger is okay, I guess. The frostbite wasn’t as bad as it felt, but the skin’s still  numb and strange. Didn’t go to urgent care. Don’t trust doctors, but that’s a different story.\n\nI keep telling myself they weren’t real, that it was some kind of hallucination or malfunction with the goggles. But deep down, I know that’s not true. And they weren’t hostile until I decided to be a fuckhead and touch one.\n\nI was stupid. Moronic. Idiotic. All of the above.\n\nAnd what’s more insane—\n\nI’m thinking about going back.",

        "content": "I stopped laughing when I realized the two academics, the two *scientists*, were quite serious.\n\n\"Wildfires start with a mere spark, just a little heat on dry kindling and the race is on.\" Professor Gregore iterated meaningfully. We all knew what they meant, but what they were talking about wasn't just the simple fact they had stated.\n\n\"You are both quite serious.\" I said quietly, hearing the surprise and awe in my voice.\n\n\"Indeed. This is the solution we came up with.\" Doctor Pincher assured me. I thought for a long time, as they stared at me. It was possible, I'd seen dogs trained to put out small fires, but the animal invariably got burns for their efforts. Nature had made wolves terrified of fire for a good reason. They weren't equipped to handle it. Or were they?\n\n\"It just sounds so ridiculous. The closest pack to the latest wildfires is *Yowlumni*, and they live all the way up in Tulare. And that's just our first logistical hurdle. You realize that they can only put out a small grass fire, and that's it. Anything bigger than that is beyond them. By the time the pack reaches any sparks, perhaps miles away, it will be a fire too big for them to handle.\" I tried to reason with them, but they shook their heads sadly at me, like I just wasn't getting it.\n\n\"Wolves teach their young, and when new packs are formed, old skills are retained. Our efforts will carry on, becoming a legacy. If they can stop even one catastrophic fire, what we do will be more than worth it.\" Doctor Pincher said, really believing in the cause.\n\n\"So, you want my wolves. That's really why you are here. You've already worked out how you are going to condition them and I bet you've even got something worked out with Fish and Wildlife about releasing my wolves back into the wild. You've got this whole thing all sorted out, then, and all you need are the actual wolves.\" I sighed. I wasn't going to let the two quacks anywhere near my wolves.\n\n\"Actually, it isn't exactly so simple. We've already gone way above you on all that.\" Professor Gregore smiled weirdly, that California politician smile, the one that made me want to move back to Oregon where there are still good Christian Americans, and not whatever I'd say populates California.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I stood, feeling a little angry. I already sensed they were about to seize my operation for their own insane plot.\n\n\"These are orders from the concerned departments, legality of your operation, and the signature of the governor.\" Doctor Pincher slid a folder across the table to me. I flipped it open and saw that they were taking my wolves and my operation away from me, with or without my help in their plans.\n\n\"I see.\" I said, bitterness in my voice. Then I added, impulsive and angry: \"I can't wait to see you get mauled.\"\n\nThey chuckled and made me sign that I was aware of their operation and intended to cooperate. In return for signing for the devil, my soul was granted access to my wolves as their caretaker during their upcoming training montage. Somehow that song, 'Holiday' by Green Day, became my personal anthem, even though I used to hate that kind of music, especially Green Day. Weird that their music got me through that very rough chapter in my life.\n\nI had worse enemies to hate, and my wolves hated them too. It is unnatural for a wolf to approach a fire. They nipped at me while I treated their burns, but they knew me and let me get close. Anyone else would have had to use sedatives to put ointment on a wolf's burned paw.\n\nIt only took two years before the results were satisfactory. I reminded myself I was forced to do this to my wolves, as a feeling of pride arose within me. The demonstration had a lot of department officials and government and the Governor was also there. A few small fires were started in the fire department's outdoor burn laboratory. My wolves were released, and with coordinated movement that rivalled a team of Navy Seals, they went to work.\n\nWhen the fires were out, their singed paws from patting the flames, the dust all over their fur from digging and throwing dirt onto the flames - didn't bother them. They howled in unison, a different howl I'd never heard before, victorious and free. There was an applause. I felt light-headed.\n\nAs we drove them out to the national forest they would soon call home, a kind of melancholy fell over me. I felt depressed, depleted and unfulfilled. My life choices had led me to that road, delivering wolves raised in captivity, used to feeding on delivered roadkill, to a place that hadn't had wolves in over a hundred years.\n\nWe set up camp and prepared to release them. I planned to stay two nights in observation, documenting the release. Doctor Pincher and Professor Gregore were with me, as well as a few interns of theirs.\n\nThere wasn't a fire ban, but I would have cautioned everyone not to have a campfire that night. We had taught the wolves that putting out fires was a meet and greet for prey, and they had no fear of humans. I'd say they were also somehow resentful for being forced to put out numerous fires, and remembered all their painful burns.\n\nWhile the interns built a campfire, I wasn't in camp, I was watching my wolves as they sniffed their new home. They hadn't gone far, and they were watching the humans, while I watched them, licking their lips.\n\nThat is when I began to feel afraid. I'd never seen them in the wild, and as my prisoners, I treated them like guests. When the state showed up, the wolves became tools, firefighting tools. I'd never seen them as wild animals. No ordinary animals, however, but completely disenchanted by Man and his Fire, and aware of our weaknesses.\n\nMy fear began slowly, with realizations about the nature of wolves and the gradual realization of what we had created. You see, in the wild, wolves don't hunt a herd and kill indiscriminately. They are highly methodical and intelligent, far smarter than lions. In places where there are wolves, big cats invariably decline or go extinct, because wolves simply outsmart them.\n\nNo, you see, to a wolf, the herd is her herd. It belongs to her, and her mate and her cubs and any subordinates she has kept in the pack. They care for the herd, driving away other predators and only killing and eating a few of the herd, focusing slaughter on the old or injured so the overall health of the herd actually increases as the wolves cull for food. They have done this for a very long time.\n\nIn our world there are lies, but in their world, there is only truth.\n\nFrom those thoughts of mine, those emotions, I stared at the wolves with new eyes. Wide and terrified. I realized what we had done, what these were. They were no longer wolves, not like any other wolf. I was afraid, holding a camera with trembling hands as I watched, frozen in fear.\n\nThen, as the sun began to set, they howled. It was that same howl, but this time it chilled my bones, it was terse and carried that note, the tonal shift from victory to anticipation. They weren't celebrating just yet, no, that was a very happy howl. If I had to translate the lyrics or their song, I'd say it was similar to \"Holiday\" by Green Day, only in wolf language. I was very afraid, for those were no longer wolves, they were something else entirely. Wolves don't do what they did. This has never happened before.\n\nI wanted to return to camp, to warn everyone of the terrible danger they were in, but I was too afraid. I stayed in the blind, thankful they had decided to ignore me, for surely they were aware of my presence. Luckily for me they had smelled me every day of their life, and my scent meant nothing to them.\n\nThe smell of fire, though? That had them particularly excited. Fire was their prey, fire was what they tended to, fire was the trespasser - the enemy. And unlike wolves, these creatures were not afraid of fire. If I had to summarize the result of what we had done to them, I'd say they were insane.\n\nI heard someone screaming as I watched the wolves enter the camp, like moving in for the coup de gras. That way they trotted, tails straight, eyes rolling, tongues side hung, teeth flashing. That exact expression means they are in kill mode.\n\nThe screaming was hurting my ears, and then I realized I was the one screaming. Terror had overwhelmed me at what I was witnessing. I had lost the settled part of my mind, and everything was in prehistoric turmoil. Some ancestor in my blood filled me with energy so that I had to start flailing or running, I couldn't sit there.\n\nI headed for the camp, panic and dread making my dash wild. From my position where I was filming I could see the wolves and the camp, but as I went down the hill through the bushes and trees I could see nothing. Until I saw their glowing yellow eyes.\n\nThe glowing yellow eyes of the fire wolves, reflecting the orange flames and the red blood. I stared, and they looked back, with nothing but a veil of night between us. Would they kill me too? I did not know. They circled me in the dark, while I sweated and breathed and palpitated.\n\nI was so afraid that it felt like time had stopped completely. Maybe I knelt there, on my knees, weeping in terror in the darkness for the whole night, or maybe it was just a few minutes. I knew what they had done, the campers were all strewn about, eliminated by powerful jaws and precise throat-tearing bites. I could vaguely see the dark shapes that were all the bodies.\n\nProfessor Gregore was crawling towards me gurgling something at me. I just stared, barely recognizing them. The wolves watched our interaction, deciding my fate. I refused to help, just staying there, as the last camper died.\n\nThis seemed to satisfy the wolves, and they departed in near silence, leaving behind their oppressors, their enemies, all dead. I let out an exhale, shaking and whimpering in the aftermath of such horror.\n\nI made a decision, as I went to the remains of Professor Gregore and found the keys to the truck. I was just going to leave everything as it was, not report anything. It would be a while before anyone got out here, if anyone ever did, and without my testimony, there would only be wild speculation about what happened.\n\nThey had left it all behind, for as I rolled up the window to the cold of the night, I heard them, off in the distance. They would remain a part of this forest, and people would go missing, and fires would be put out. They had a job to do, a job we had given them.\n\nI'm sure they are still out there. The rangers in that forest have issued a permanent burn ban, and it's best if it is obeyed. The wolves respond to fire.\n\nThe wolves have got this.",

A few weeks ago, I would’ve said the same about someone like me.\n\nBut that was a few weeks ago.\n\nThere’s a man who stands across the street from my house every single night at exactly 2:17 AM. He doesn’t speak. He doesn’t move. He just stands there. Watching.\n\nAt first, I thought he was some drunk wandering home too late, or a tweaker looking for unlocked cars. My neighborhood’s not bad, but it’s not exactly crime-free either. It was easy to dismiss the first night I saw him. I glanced out the front window while grabbing water from the kitchen, saw a figure under the streetlamp, and figured he’d be gone by morning.\n\nAnd he was. When I woke up later that morning, he was gone.\n\nBut the next night, at the same time—2:17 AM—he was there again. Same spot. Same stiff posture. Same unnatural stillness.\n\nI stared at him for a long time, waiting for some movement. Shift his weight. Scratch his face. Light a cigarette. *Something.*\n\nNothing.\n\nI turned away to grab my phone and snap a picture, but when I looked back, he was gone.\n\nIt was weird, yeah, but I still didn’t panic. I figured I just missed him walking off. \n\nBut then it happened again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nFor seven nights straight, I woke up—always at 2:17 AM, like my body knew—to see him standing there, under that flickering streetlamp. Perfectly still. Watching my house.\n\nNot watching the street. Not just… loitering.\n\nWatching me.\n\nI decided to take a video. I left my phone recording by the window, angled perfectly to capture the sidewalk. I figured if I could show someone—anyone—they’d obviously believe me.\n\nI didn't wake up that night. I watched the footage the next morning.\n\nNothing.\n\nNo figure. No movement. Just the empty street and that old, half-burnt-out streetlight buzzing like always.\n\nI thought maybe I’d angled the camera wrong. So I tried again the next night. This time, I stayed up watching from behind the curtain and hit record as soon as he appeared.\n\nI watched the footage again.\n\nStill nothing.\n\nThe man I saw *with my own fucking eyes* didn’t show up on camera.\n\nThat’s when I started asking friends over. If I couldn't catch him on camera, then someone else standing next to me, right here in the room... they'd have to see him too.\n\nMy buddy Greg came by for a late-night beer. I kept it casual, waited till 2:17 AM. \n\nThe man appeared.\n\nWithout taking my eyes off him, I told Greg to look out the window. He came over and stood next to me. I asked if he could see the man standing there across the street. \n\nHe squinted and said no. I asked if he was sure, keeping my eyes on the man standing right there under the street lamp. Then Greg asked me if I see a man standing there, and he said it in that way that let's you know someone thinks you're nuts. \n\nI could’ve screamed. The guy was standing *right there*. I described him in detail—tall, lean, wearing a long dark coat. Hands at his sides. Head tilted just slightly upward like he was staring at the second floor. My bedroom.\n\nGreg laughed it off, but I could tell I’d freaked him out. He didn’t finish his beer. Haven’t heard from him since. Over the next few nights, I tried again with different people—neighbors, coworkers, even my cousin. Same result every time. I could see him. No one else could.\n\nI even brought binoculars one night. I don’t know why I thought that would help. I guess I wanted to see his face, confirm he was real. But what I saw wasn’t a face. It was… I don’t know how to describe it. The proportions were all wrong. It was too long, like it had been stretched vertically. The skin was grayish-blue and smooth, like wax. And his eyes—\n\nNo. *Not eyes.* Just black pits sunken into his head.\n\nAs soon as I looked too long, he turned his head—slowly—and looked directly at me. I dropped the binoculars, backed away from the window. I don’t even remember going back to bed that night.\n\nThat’s when I called the police.\n\nThey humored me. They checked the street. Drove around. Took my statement. I showed them the footage of nothing, told them about the time, the pattern, everything. One officer asked if I was under stress. Another started suggesting mental health resources. I tried not to lose it in front of them. They said there are all kinds of people out that late. That is it was probably just a someone drunk or on drugs.\n\nThey left with some “we’ll keep an eye out” line and I knew they wouldn’t be back.\n\nThe next night, I woke up at 2 AM and waited. \n\n2:17 AM hit, and the man wasn’t under the streetlight. I looked down at my watch. Still 2:17.\n\nI looked back out and he still wasn't there, under the street light.\n\nNo, he was closer. He stood at the edge of my lawn, halfway between the sidewalk and the street. Still staring. Still silent. Still utterly... still.\n\nThat was the first night I didn’t look away. I sat at the window and stared back. For an hour. Two. I don’t even remember falling asleep, but when I woke up, it was morning. And he was gone.\n\nI checked the lawn. No footprints.\n\nThen, two nights later, he was there again, closer, just outside the window. Right beneath it. Not moving. Not even blinking.\n\nThat’s when I started locking everything. Doors, windows, vents. I sealed my bedroom window with fucking duct tape. I bought a security system. Set up cameras around the house. Got a baseball bat and a big ass kitchen knife and kept them both by my bed.\n\nThat was the first night I heard footsteps in the hallway.\n\nI live alone.\n\nThat thought hit me like ice in my spine. I sat up in bed, clutching the knife in one hand, the bat in the other, heart pounding in my ears.\n\nThe footsteps were slow, deliberate. Not heavy, not shuffling. Just… soft. Steady. Confident. They moved past my bedroom door and into the kitchen. Then silence.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. I didn't get up and check to see who was there or what it was. I didn’t even move. I just sat in bed, frozen, waiting. Listening. Hoping.\n\nWhen the sun rose, I forced myself to search the house. Every window was locked. Every door still sealed. Windows still duct taped from the inside. No signs of a break-in. But the kitchen floor had a set of muddy footprints. Bare feet. Large. Too large.\n\nThat night, I didn’t set up the cameras. I didn’t check the window. I just sat in bed, holding the knife with white knuckles, too afraid to blink.\n\nAnd yet somehow, I must’ve fallen asleep. Because I woke up at 2:16 AM, and my room was ice cold.\n\nThe man was standing at the foot of my bed.\n\nNo glass between us. No window. No streetlamp.\n\nInside.\n\nI couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. I just watched him, tall and still, pale and eyeless, towering over me in the dark.\n\nThen he lunged.\n\nA flash of motion—faster than anything that size should be able to move. His hand came down, and a jagged, filthy fingernail ripped through my arm, from shoulder to elbow. I screamed—finally, I screamed—and he hissed. Not a breathy sound. It was low and gurgling, like wet leaves rustling inside a throat.\n\nHe slashed again—this time across my face, just beneath my right eye. I felt the heat of blood pour down my cheek.\n\nAnd then—just like that—he was gone.\n\nI sat there panting, bleeding, shaking like a leaf in a storm. The knife was still in my hand, unused. The clock on my nightstand read 2:18 AM.\n\nI cleaned up the wounds. I figured I'd probably need stitches in my arm, probably my face too. But that could wait.  Instead, I went back to the police. I showed them my arm, my face. The cuts were deep, angry, and real. The officer barely looked at them before narrowing his eyes and asking if I did it to myself.\n\nWhat? No! Fuck you, I said to him. I told him, the guy was in my fucking room, that he—\n\nBut the cop just cut me off, calling me sir like he actually had any respect for me before proceeding to grill me with questions about whether I'm taking any medications, or had any thoughts about harming or killing myself.\n\nThat’s when I knew I was fucked.\n\nThey thought I was losing it. I could see it in their faces. One officer radioed something in—probably trying to get me put on a psych hold. I could feel the room closing in.\n\nI don’t know how, but somehow I managed to talked my way out of it. I made up some excuse, laughed it off, said it was a cat scratch and I’d just had a rough week. I told them I appreciated their concern and promised I’d see a therapist.\n\nThey let me go.\n\nBut not before one of them leaned in and told me the next time they saw me like that, I'd be sticking around a lot longer.\n\nThat was three nights ago.\n\nHe hasn’t come back. Not under the streetlamp. Not on my lawn. Not inside.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean he’s gone.\n\nI sit by the window every night now. I don’t sleep. I don’t eat much. I just watch. The streetlight flickers like always. The camera’s long since been turned off. There’s no point anymore.\n\nEvery night, at 2:17 AM, I stare out into the dark and wait. Sometimes I think I see a shadow flicker in the corner of my vision. Sometimes I feel a breath on my neck and turn to find nothing. Sometimes I wake up with that burning sensation in my arm, as if the wound’s been *touched*.\n\nWhatever he is, I don’t think he’s human. I don’t think he’s bound by doors or windows or even time. He could be waiting. He could be inside me. He could be somewhere *just beyond the veil*, watching.\n\nI don’t know when he’ll show up again. But I know—I know—he’s not done with me.\n\nAnd next time, I'm not sure I’ll survive.",

        "content": "I lost Liam to tragedy, and I couldn’t move on. Days passed. Weeks. Months. And I remained trapped in my grief. \n\nThe only way Erika was able to coax me out of the haze I’d been living in was to tell me about Jade’s celebration. How could I not show up for my best friend when she’d made such a big step?\n\nI acquiesced. I went. And what we did while I was there has doomed us all.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“It’s time.”\n\nErika took one of my hands in hers and leaned forward, holding my gaze in a way that didn’t let me look away. I couldn’t take the pity in my sister’s eyes, or the soft sadness in her voice as she said, “I know you don’t think you’re ready. But you are. You’re strong…”\n\nI pulled my hand away. “I don’t want to hear about how strong I am anymore.”\n\n“Sophie, it’s for Jade. This is huge for her.”\n\nJade had bought her first house and was throwing a housewarming-slash-Halloween party to celebrate the occasion. She’d come from nothing, sometimes living in shelters with her single mom when she was growing up, so to own her own place? It was so much more than just a life milestone for her. But still… “If I go, they’re going to look at me like you’re looking at me now.”\n\nErika’s nose crinkled. “How am I looking at you?”\n\n“Like I’m broken.”\n\nThere was that sadness in her eyes again. And how could I blame her for looking at me like that? The night Liam had died I’d shattered into a million pieces, and I didn’t know that I’d ever be whole again.\n\n“They all love you, you know,” Erika said. My friends. The ones I’d met in college who, instead of fading away once we graduated and got real lives, had grown closer with each passing year. Jade. Max. Reese. Ben. The people I couldn’t bear to see over the last year, because Liam had been a part of that group, too. It would never be whole again. “And of course they worry about you, but this isn’t about that. They *miss you*, Sophie.”\n\nIf I was being honest with myself, I missed them, too. “But if I go…” My throat tightened as I did my best to hold back tears. “If I go, I’ll be… moving on. I’ll be leaving him behind. If I stay here…”\n\n“Staying here, alone in this apartment, isn’t going to bring Liam back,” Erika said gently. Her gaze traveled over the shelves and fireplace mantel, which held framed photos of me and Liam embracing, laughing, kissing. A visual diary of the life we’d started to build that had been so cruelly cut short. “You’re frozen here, Sophie. Trapped in amber. Liam would want you to *live…*”\n\nI shook my head, grief knocking the air from my lungs and stealing my ability to counter what she was saying. “I’m not saying you need to take a trip around the world. I’m saying try a trip across town. Spend one night with the people who love you the most. After that, if you want to come back here and cocoon yourself in comfy pants and weighted blankets and spend a week doing nothing but eating vodka-spiked milkshakes and watching trash tv, I will make it happen. I will buy so much garbage for you it’ll make the cashier nervous.”\n\nThe corners of my lips quirked up in a small smile, the expression feeling alien. “There she is,” Erika murmured.\n\nIt was just a few hours. I could do this, couldn’t I? For Jade? For all the times she’d been there for me? I could I could I could…\n\n“Okay,” I said softly. “Just…” *Hold my hand through it* I wanted to say, but with Erika, I didn’t need to.\n\n“I’ve got you, Sophie,” she said. “We all do.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI spent the next week trying to back out of it, but Erika had sidestepped my protests masterfully. She even came over the night of the party to dress me up, giving me no excuse. She was a Fairy Godmother, and she’d transformed me into Cinderella, with a gorgeous dress and elaborate makeup I’d never have been able to pull off on my own.\n\nI’d let her put diamond studs in my ears and a matching pendant around my neck, but when she’d tried to fasten a chunky bangle around my wrist, I pulled away. I already had a bracelet there, one Liam had gifted me two Christmases ago: a delicate gold chain with an engraved charm that read *Troublemaker.* Liam had bestowed the name on me on our first date, which had started conventionally enough with dinner and a movie and had lasted ‘til dawn as we dragged each other from one place to the next, not wanting our time together to end.\n\nShe relented, setting the bangle back into my jewelry box. “In the story, Cinderella gets to be home by midnight,” she said. “When you feel like it’s too much, just remember that. Remember you’ll be home by midnight, and you’re safe.”\n\nWhen we arrived at Jade’s the party was already in full swing, with the sound of thumping bass and muffled chatter spilling out into the night. She’d always been outgoing, with more close friends than I had casual acquaintances, and it looked like they’d all turned out to celebrate her next step.\n\nThe house was beautiful. A small bungalow with strings of lights hanging from the porch and rose bushes lining the walk. Erika stopped with her hand hovering above the knob to the front door. “You ready?”\n\n*No*, I wanted to say. *I’ll never be ready.* But I’d do this anyway, for Jade and for Erika. Just a few hours… I nodded.\n\nShe pushed open the door, and we entered a Halloween wonderland. Cobwebs were draped on potted plants, colored lights cast long shadows on the walls, and someone’s carefully curated spooky playlist boomed from hidden speakers. People in costumes both current and classic milled about with drinks in their hands and small plates of food.\n\nJade came around the corner holding a bottle of wine, and I froze as her eyes locked on mine. We’d known each other for over a decade, knew more about each other than we knew about ourselves, and yet suddenly I felt awkward and out of place. I was a stranger to myself these days. How would she see me after everything that had happened…?\n\nThen she broke into a smile and rushed over, shoving the bottle of wine at one of the guests with a mumbled *here* as she passed and threw her arms around me, squeezing me not like I was glass, but like she could make me understand how much she loved me through the strength of her embrace alone.\n\nShe pulled back, studying my face. “Well aren’t you just the belle of the ball, Gorgeous.”\n\n“Congratulations,” I managed. I scanned her up and down. “What’s going on here?” She was wearing a shiny gray bikini and had painted a sharp-toothed smile on her face that extended almost to her ears.\n\n“I’m Sexy Jaws,” she said, and did a twirl. She even had a little fin strapped to her back. As she faced us again, she glanced at Erika. “And the Fairy Godmother, who waved her wand and made the reuniting magic happen.”\n\nJade once again looked at me, practically radiating joy. “I’m so glad you came.”\n\nShe was treating me as if nothing had changed and no time had passed, and the relief I felt nearly brought me to my knees. Tonight could be good. A few hours to be something close to *normal* with her and Erika, and… \n\nA cheer rose up from the back of the room, and I glanced over Jade’s shoulder to see Reese, Ben, and Max coming up fast. “And so are they, apparently,” she said.\n\nAll three stopped just short of me, each of them covered in silver candy bar wrappers. “I, uh,” Max mumbled. “So, can we hug you?”\n\n“Are you… the Three Musketeers?” I asked. They all nodded sheepishly, and it was so utterly absurd that I let out the first small laugh I could remember having in months. It broke the dam and they rushed me, crushing me in a group hug. Mumbled words like *we missed you* and *so happy you’re here* floated over the music, and I let them wash over me, calming me. \n\n“Drink?” Reese said, pointing to me. “Drink, yes?”\n\nI nodded, and we all made our way into the thick of the party, Erika grabbing my hand to give it a quick squeeze as if to say *I’m proud of you.* \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAll night, at least one of them was by my side. Jade, to give me a tour of the place, which was filled with art and souvenirs she’d gathered on her many trips overseas and made the space uniquely her own. Max and Reese, to tell me about the video game they were designing. Ben, looking every bit the college professor in his dark-rimmed glasses, filling me in on how he’d just successfully defended his thesis. And Erika, to subtly check in and take my temperature on things. \n\nEach one of them brought me a fresh drink, and as the clock neared midnight I found that my sharp edges had softened and I wanted to stay around them and their energy for as long as possible. Being near these people had reawakened a part of me that had been dormant for the past year, and I clung to the feeling.\n\nPeople had filtered out as the hours had gone on, and by five to midnight the only ones left were our close friend group and Maggie, a tarot reader that Jade had hired for the party. She’d dressed the part of a witchy woman in a flowy skirt and long scarves, and had been a huge hit.\n\nI lounged on the couch sandwiched between Ben and Erika swirling my drink in my cup, listening to the ice rattle around the edges as Jade helped Maggie pack up.\n\n“You were *amazing* tonight,” Jade gushed.\n\n“You all were a great group,” Maggie replied. “Sometimes you never know with private parties. It can go either way. But everyone seemed really into it.”\n\n“I, for one, am *very* excited about what my future holds,” Reese said, winking at Maggie. “You *crushed* it.”\n\nMaggie smiled and shrugged as she set a deck of tarot cards into her bag. “That’s your energy. I just channel and interpret.”\n\n“What else do you do?” Max asked. “Just tarot, or…”\n\n“I’m also a medium,” she said casually.\n\nMy friends went silent. Even the volume of the music seemed to dip.\n\n“So you…” Max said, hesitant, “You…”\n\n“I can connect with the other side and bring messages forth,” Maggie said, zipping the bag up and glancing around to make sure she didn’t leave anything behind. “Séances, essentially.”\n\nMy ears were ringing and my hands felt numb, and suddenly Maggie was the only person in the room. I could feel every single one of my friends looking at me, and I ignored them completely. “Would you do one?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\n“A séance?” Maggie asked, and looked to Jade, who’d gone a bit pale. “Tonight?”\n\nI nodded and Erika leaned in to me and whispered, “Are you sure?”\n\n“The veil is thinnest between this side and the other tonight. It would make a possible connection easier.” Maggie subtly gauged the group’s reaction. “Though it seems like there’s some hesitation…”\n\nJade nervously flicked a glance my way. “I don’t think it’s a good idea…”\n\n“I want to,” I said. There was a hard edge to my voice that bordered on desperation, but I didn’t care if they heard it. “Please.”\n\nAn uncomfortable murmur went through my friends. *Yeah. Okay. Yeah, let’s do it.* But it was all background noise to me. I just stared at Maggie, willing her to say *yes.* \n\nShe returned my gaze, studying me. Sizing me up. I saw the moment her expression softened, and she seemed to decide something. “Okay. Why don’t we gather around the dining room table?”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFive minutes later, the music was off, the lights were dim, candles were lit, and we all sat around the table, which was covered in a black, shimmering cloth.\n\n“How many of these have you done?” Reese asked, trying and failing to keep the nerves out of his voice.\n\n“Enough to confidently take you on this journey,” Maggie said. “I also want to be upfront:  you may want to hear from a specific person, but please know that the one you seek to speak with may not want to be disturbed.”\n\nI could sense my friends trying not to focus on me. “Is it dangerous?” Max asked, and I caught Ben rolling his eyes.\n\n“It can be, but I know when to pull back, and when to close the channel,” Maggie said, and inclined her head toward Ben. “You think this is silly.”\n\n“No, no…” Ben stammered, then hissed out a breath. “Maybe. I just… I think that when you die, you’re dead. No residual energy. No ghosts.”\n\n“That’s okay,” Maggie said, “they don’t require your belief to exist.” Maggie smiled warmly, but it did nothing to dispel the sudden chill in the room at her words. Even Ben seemed slightly rattled. \n\n“Now, there’s a specific way to safely proceed here. I’ll speak three sentences, each punctuated by the word *unlock,* as we open the door to the other side. I’ll speak those same sentences ending in the word *lock* as we close it. I’ll guide you through, and guide you back. All I ask is that you do exactly as I say during the séance. Is that acceptable?”\n\nWe all nodded, and she gestured for us to take each other’s hands. “Please close your eyes and empty your minds. Release. Unclench. Unwind. This isn’t about forcing something. It’s about *allowing* something.”\n\nI did as she asked, breathing deeply, listening to the crackle of the candles and quieting my racing thoughts. After a long moment, Maggie said, “Good. Now, focus your energy on someone who’s passed that you’d like to contact. Picture them in your mind. Remain fluid and soft, and open. Don’t force it. Allow it. Allow them to come to you.”\n\nOut of the dark space in my mind, a shape appeared in the gloom. As if someone was crossing a great distance to approach me. I knew that form intimately. Happiness bloomed in my chest, its edges sharpened with an exquisite pain, as Liam started to come into focus.\n\nMaggie began mumbling softly, saying words I couldn’t understand, and then “*unlock*”. Again she mumbled. Again, *“unlock”.*  As she spoke, Liam’s image became clearer\\*.\\* \n\nAnd as she spoke the word a third time, there he was in sharp relief as if he were truly standing in front of me. That thick, dark hair I’d run my hands through. The jaw I’d trailed thousands of kisses over. His ice-blue eyes crinkled at the edges as he shot me a crooked smile. He stopped just out of arm’s reach and mouthed the words…\n\n“*Hey, Troublemaker.”* My eyes shot open. I hadn’t heard those words in my mind. They’d been spoken out loud, in this room, by *Maggie,* her voice husky and not her own. \n\nThe silence that descended at the table was deafening as my friends gaped at each other, suddenly tense. They knew that nickname. Erika, on my left, squeezed my hand so hard I thought the bones would snap. \n\nI stayed utterly still, afraid any movement would break the spell and whatever was happening with Maggie would stop. I was desperate to hear what she’d say next, but she remained quiet, her head bowed and her eyes shut. When I couldn’t take it any longer, I whispered, “Liam?”\n\nMaggie slowly lifted her head, and her lips slowly curled up in a crooked smile that didn’t resemble the warm grins she’d given us earlier. It was *his* smile. Liam’s. She opened her eyes and her stare burned through me. I started to tremble. \n\nOff to my right, Ben was shaking his head. “This isn’t right.” He seemed *angry.* “This is *bullshit,* she’s not\\*…\\*” \n\nMaggie cocked her head at him, the move preternaturally smooth, and said, “Lighten up, Benny Boy. And by the way, there’s no way I’m calling you *Doctor*, now.”\n\nBen swallowed hard, the color leaching from his skin. “You…” he stammered, “There’s no way you could know that. You were gone before…”\n\nMaggie ignored him and turned her attention to Jade. “Nice place. You did well for yourself.” Maggie slipped her hands free of Max and Reese’s and stood on unsteady legs, if she were getting used to piloting a body that wasn’t her own.\n\n“We can’t break contact, can we?” Reese asked, his voice edged in hysteria.\n\nMaggie moved toward the living room, studying her surroundings, her movements growing steadier with each step. \n\n“Wait…” I broke free of the circle and followed her.\n\nNow in the center of the living room, Maggie turned back to us. “It was so easy to slip through,” she said, almost in awe. Her gaze locked on me. “I heard you across the distance… You were practically screaming for contact… You led me right to you…”\n\n“I didn’t get to say goodbye.” The words tumbled out, forcing their way past the lump in my throat. “I… I didn’t realize that the last time I saw you would be the *last time I saw you*…” I trailed off as I got a good look at Maggie. At the toll this was taking on her.\n\nShe was sweating, there was tension around her eyes, and her jaw clenched every time she closed her mouth. “I need to… close the… connection…” she gritted out.\n\n“No!” I cried, but Erika put a steadying hand on my shoulder and gently pulled me away from the medium.\n\n“Do it,” Jade said to Maggie.\n\nMaggie began to mumble those same strings of words that began our ritual, and managed to croak out the first *lock* before she brought up her own hand and *slapped herself across the face, fingers crooked, scratching her own cheek.* \n\n*“I won’t go,”* she growled in that low voice. \n\n“I’m not ready! He’s not ready to go!” I cried. “Please, just one more minute…”\n\nMaggie fell to her knees. Max and Reese lunged toward her, but she held out a hand to stop them. “Stay… Stay where you are. Do as I say!” she barked, her voice once again her own.\n\nShe started to chant again, spitting out the word *lock* at the end, gasping for breath as if she’d run a marathon.\n\n“Liam…” I dropped to my knees just as Maggie had, trying to get on her level and hold her gaze. “What’s happening… What’s *wrong*?” I wailed.\n\nMaggie’s neck muscles were strained, her face red, her hands clenching and unclenching.  The words that spilled from her lips were edged with pain. There was one last sentence needed to close the channel and end the connection. I was going to lose him again. “Please don’t, Maggie. I need more time. *I need more* *time with him,”* I pleaded.  Jade and Ben had their arms around me, pulling me away from the medium as I reached out for her.\n\nMaggie’s words trailed off as she finished the third and final sentence. She tried to form the word *lock,* but as she opened her mouth her jaw *cracked too wide,* she arched back, twisting as if her spine would snap, and clutched at her chest. Awful gurgling sounds bubbled up from her throat, and she collapsed to the ground like a marionette with cut strings.  \n\nIt was as if time had stopped with the horror of it all and we froze with it, unable to look away from Maggie’s body. \n\nJade held me against her, her fingers digging into my arm so hard I knew bruises would form. Erika stood behind Reese and Max as if to shield herself. Ben slowly dragged himself to his feet, jostling Reese, who whispered, “Is she…”\n\nAs if in a trance, he moved to Maggie on wobbly legs and leaned down to place two fingers on her neck. “I don’t… I don’t think she’s breathing.”\n\nChaos erupted, and it was a  blur of motion and sound as Ben ran for his cellphone to call the paramedics and Max knelt by Reese to start chest compressions on the fallen woman. Erika sank to her knees next to me and Jade, and they tried to turn me away from it all…\n\nBut I couldn’t be moved. I watched as the seconds passed and the color drained from Maggie’s face. I watched her arms and legs, limp and lifeless, jerk slightly every time Max pressed on her chest. And I watched her eyes go glassy and dull. They could try to revive her all they liked. I knew she was gone. And so was Liam.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was dawn by the time the police allowed us to leave.\n\nErika offered to have Jade stay at her place, and Jade gratefully accepted, promising to pack a bag and head over once the officers had finished what they needed to do at her house.\n\nThe rest of us silently shuffled out of the house, the cool morning air hitting us like a slap, trying to wake us from the nightmare we’d just experienced. We reached the sidewalk, the point where we’d need to split up to go to our separate cars, and we all just… stopped. Lost.\n\n“...I tried,” Max said, his voice breaking, and Ben squeezed his shoulder.\n\nBen squeezed his shoulder. “There was nothing you could’ve done. There was nothing any of us could’ve done…”\n\n“To have a heart attack so young,” Erika murmured, “I mean, she couldn’t have been more than forty, right? It just seems…”\n\n“Are we really going to ignore what happened in there before she collapsed?” Reese bit out. “What probably *caused* her death\\*?\\*”\n\nBen pushed his glasses up his nose. “She clearly had some sort of heart defect…”\n\n“...She was *possessed by something* that pushed her over the edge,” Reese interrupted.\n\n“Not *something*,” I said, and the words cut through the space between us like a blade. “It was Liam, and he would never hurt her. Ben’s right. It was some sort of heart problem…”\n\n“It wasn’t *something,* Reese\\*.\\* And I’m sorry, Soph, but it wasn’t *Liam* either. She was a scam artist,” Ben spat.\n\n“She knew about your doctorate,” Max countered.\n\n“I talked about it all night. There’s no way she didn’t hear it mentioned.”\n\n“She called me Troublemaker,” I cut in. “That was what he called me, Ben. You all know it. She couldn’t have known…” \n\nErika took my left hand and lifted it up. The bracelet Liam had gotten me glinted in the early morning light, the engraved *Troublemaker* starkly visible on the metal.\n\nI saw Reese’s fear and belief shift to skepticism, the domino effect spreading to Erika and Max. “It was him,” I said weakly, and it was only met with pity. \n\nI pulled away from them. “I want to go home.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe world outside didn’t exist to me once I locked my apartment door. I pulled every curtain shut. I unzipped my dress and let it fall off me as I shuffled to the bedroom. Crawling into bed, I wrapped the comforter over me until I was cocooned, and I curled in on myself in an effort to stem the pain.\n\nI was hollowed out. Empty. I didn’t even cry. I just stared at the dimness inside the blanket and waited for sleep to come.\n\nAfter what might have been minutes, or hours, a *chime* sounded. A notification from my cell phone, which I’d left charging on my nightstand before we went to the party. My hand snaked out from the comforter to feel around for it…\n\n…And froze when I heard the soft, melodic music floating in from the hallway. Someone was singing our song - mine and Liam’s - in my bathroom.\n\nMesmerized, I pulled myself from the blankets. On feet that didn’t feel like my own, I moved out into the hallway and realized that the water was running as well. The shower *hissssssed* and steam wafted out from the open bathroom doorway in billowing clouds.\n\n*Chime.* \n\nAnother notification, the sound distant from back in my bedroom. I ignored it.\n\nJust as I reached the threshold to the bathroom, the sound of water ceased. Silence pressed in. I peered around the edge of the door to find that the bathroom was clear of steam and the shower curtain was pulled back to reveal an empty bathtub… but the walls were slick with water, and the faucet *drip drip dripped.* \n\nThe sound of a finger dragging across wet glass cut through the silence, and I spun to face the bathroom cabinet. \n\n*Hey Troublemaker* was written in the condensation on the mirror, the letters dripping.\n\n“Liam?” I called softly, my voice trembling. “Are you here? Did you come home…?”\n\nSilence greeted me. I closed my eyes, willing Liam to respond, when…\n\n*Chime.*\n\nI moved quickly back down the hallway and into my bedroom to grab my phone. I had half-a-dozen missed messages from my friends. I was about to swipe them open when *soft singing floated toward me from the living room.*\n\nLiam was *here.* I could feel it.\n\n*Chime.* \n\nI ignored the notification and ran out of my bedroom, rounding the corner into the living room. It was empty. The singing went quiet. \n\nI stifled a sob. “Please, if you’re here, show me…”\n\n*Chime. Chime. Chime.*\n\nEyes still searching the dark corners of the room for any sign of movement, I unlocked my phone. Tapped on Erika’s name.\n\n*Erika: I felt bad leaving you at home alone, even though that’s what you wanted. You ok?*\n\n*Erika: Heard a knock on my door and thought it was Jade. Opened it and nobody was there.* \n\n*Erika: Call me. Something weird is going on.*\n\nAs I read the last one, another notification popped up. A text from Max.\n\n*Max: I know u thought u heard Liam tonight. I just heard my mom’s voice from the other room.* \n\n*Max: Soph, she died when I was ten. What did that psychic lady do???*\n\nA rustling emanated from behind me, and the air grew cool. The scent of pine and leather surrounded me. The smell of Liam’s cologne.\n\n*Chime.*\n\n*Ben: Tonight was a lot. I think I’m hearing things in my own apartment and I don’t even believe in this shit. Call me and let me know you’re okay.*\n\nSlowly, I turned to find someone sitting in the shadows in the chair in the corner of the room. Moonlight filtered in through the gauzy curtains and threw muted light on their face. *His* face. Liam. I could barely make him out, but he was there.\n\n*Chime.*\n\nJade this time. *Is Erika there? She told me to come over but she’s not answering her door.*\n\n*Chime.*\n\n*Jade: I tried your number and it won’t go through. CALL ME. I think I heard Erika inside. She screamdddddd*\n\nI tried to answer. To tap the keys. My fingers wouldn’t move.\n\n“Liam?” I whispered. \n\nHe remained preternaturally still, only cocking his head slightly so the moonlight glinted in his eyes, turning them cold and hard. “I’ve waited so long for this.”\n\n*Chime.* \n\nI tore my eyes away from him to glance down at my phone. It was a voicemail from Reese, though I had no missed call. Without me moving a finger, it began to play.\n\n*Reese: Soph, I think the medium fucked up.*\n\nMore rustling from the corner, and out of the corner of my eye I saw the man slowly rise from the chair.\n\n*Reese: She had to say those three sentences and then LOCK to close the connection, right??? She only finished two. She died before got through the third one…*\n\nA low hum came over the line, an atonal buzzing that distorted his words and made him hard to hear. A burst of static briefly cleared the line as…\n\n*Reese: I think he’s still here…*\n\nThe buzzing began to grow again. \n\n*Reese: …The door is still open…*\n\nThere was a *crash* through the line, and he roared in pain. A terrible, gut-wrenching sound that cut off on a staticky shriek.\n\nAnd I was alone again with the man in the corner who could only be Liam. I wouldn’t let myself believe anything else. “You led me right to you…” he said. “It was so easy to slip through…” It no longer smelled like pine and leather. It reeked of rancid meat and wet earth. \n\nDread crept in. Maybe death had changed him. Maybe I’d wished to be reunited with someone that no longer existed. Suddenly I was afraid for the first time tonight. “Liam, why are you doing this?”\n\n“Why…” he said, drifting toward me, trailing shadows in his wake, his eyes burning, sucking all of the air out of the room…\n\nI blacked out. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHours later, I woke with a throbbing head and a sour taste in my mouth. Pushing myself up on weak arms, I blinked at the bright sunlight that now slipped through the crack in the curtains and waited for the world to stop spinning.\n\nThe apartment was silent. The furniture undisturbed. There was no indication that anyone else had been in here but me.\n\nI raised a hand to touch the tender spot where my head had cracked against the floor, and my heart started to pound. *My arm was covered in blood.* It had gone numb as I’d laid on it after I collapsed, but feeling was starting to come back and along with pins and needles there was *pain.* \n\n*Troublemaker* was carved into my forearm in thin, slashing strokes.\n\nAnd someone… *something*… had used the blood that had pooled around my arm while I’d been unconscious to write me a message on the hardwood floor.\n\nHorror sliced through me as I read the smeared, crimson words, the hair on the back of my neck standing up as that rotten smell curled around me again. It was suddenly *so cold…*\n\nI ran to the bathroom on weak legs. Slammed the door shut and locked it. Tried calling out so many times but nothing will go through. Texts seem to work… But nobody’s answering. Not Erika, or Jade, or Ben, or Max, or Reese… So I’m uploading our story here. I’m not sure why, ‘cause I don’t think anyone can help me. So there’s a record, I guess.\n\nI just know that whatever’s in the apartment with me is still here, toying with me. Singing softly. Running its fingers over the outside of the door, the sound like hollow whispers. \n\nIt. Not him. I know that now, because of the message it left in the blood:\n\n*WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING ME LIAM?*",

        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "Part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/5dFf6pQVtW \n\nI want to start by apologizing for not replying to the few of you that commented on my first post. I assure you there is a good reason. Right as I hit post the whole park lost power. It was late at night and there was a considerable rain storm outside. I checked the time on my phone, it was 12:03 a.m. \n\nI am the only ranger that lives here on sight. I have a little cabin just down the trail from the main office building. I’m fairly certain that Phil doesn’t live here but he’s always here before I get up, but I never see his truck after dark. I can’t really blame him. This place isn’t exactly peaceful at night. You’ve got the screams from the old abandoned mine over on the east side, and despite the significant distance between the mine and my little cabin I can still hear them. I usually just keep music or a movie going in my cabin to drown it out. The screams aren’t a guaranteed thing, but they also don’t follow any kind of logic. Some nights it’s there, some nights it’s not. That’s not the only thing either. It seems whatever temporal wasteland this park occupies fosters more activity at night. \n\nWhen the power went out my cabin fell into inky silence. No screams that night. My fan, my T.V. and most importantly my fridge all shut off. The sound of the rain driving into the roof would have been relaxing if I didn’t have to do something about the power. My fridge is one thing, and honestly reason enough to go get the power back on, but more importantly the water pumps at the spillway shut off if there’s no power, and I suppose that’s a big deal. \n\nSo out I went into that torrential downpour, armed with a flashlight, I should really get a gun. For whatever reason the generator that runs the whole park isn’t located anywhere near the main buildings. It’s at the very end of a mile long out and back service road at the top of a ridge. It’s still on the West side, thank God, but seriously it’s not easy to find, or get to. The distance is one thing, the rain is another, but the whispers, that was another thing altogether.\n\nI’d heard about the whispers before. I guess Richard had a run in with them a few months back. He was pretty freaked out by them, and I have to admit, in that darkness, vainly attacked by my dim flashlight, and the rain, which soaked up most of that dim light, those whispers were pretty ominous. It’s not like anything intelligible, just vague languageless whispers. I think it comes from the trees, but who knows? I couldn’t focus on those right now, I had to get the power on.\n\nWhen I finally reached the generator I began troubleshooting, trying to get it back on. I pulled the ripcord hard several times to no avail. Out of gas, of course. Why had I not thought of that before I ran all the way out here. Well, walked. I was told to never run through the park at night. When you take off running your imagination takes off with you and it tends to outrun you. Before you can catch up to it it's already reached out to grab you with big hairy, disturbingly ape-like arms. \n\nAlso, why don’t we keep gas cans in a shed close to the generator? Like wouldn’t that be the obvious thing to have? So I began to walk back. The rain was starting to feel cold, and what was just a rain storm quickly became a thunderstorm. Lightning lit across the sky and a loud crack of thunder shook the earth beneath me. At least the thunder drowned out that whispering. \n\nHalfway back, my already failing flashlight finally gave out. That was the first time I’d ever been in those woods at night, with no light source to guide me. Usually you can at least see some light from near the office area, or the lodge, but with the power out it was true, natural, unadulterated dark. The only way I could see anything at all was via the periodic lightning flashes. There’s a point on that trail with a good enough gap in the treeline that you can, under normal circumstances, see the lake. Lightning flashed and I looked out towards it. That quick snapshot will always stick with me. That was the first time I saw Ricky. Silhouetted against the night, I saw the creature's long neck sticking out of the water as the beast swam around. He seemed to like the rain, and he did look exactly like the loch ness monster. \n\nI don’t know why seeing Ricky shook me up so much. I mean I see weird stuff here daily. The whispers I heard that night, Gary the forty foot croc, the talking crows, the squirrel pile, but seeing Ricky, that’s what finally made it all set in, it was like an encounter with a deity, a quiet, unassuming god, who cared nothing of the people who worshipped him, erected his graven image all across the park, and I have to say, I haven't been able to look at those signs, t-shirts, and stuffed animals of Ricky the same after that. \n\nWhen I finally made it back up to the rangers station I realized that I had no idea where any gas canisters were, and in the dark, there was really no way I was going to find them. Maybe one night without power wouldn’t be too harmful. No sooner had I decided to give up than I heard those whispers again. This time not inarticulate gibberish. This time they spoke to me. \n\n“Go back, go back, go back!” \n\nIt was as if a thousand voices whispered at once. I felt dizzy for some reason. The whispers were closing in around me. \n\n“Run, run, run, run!”\n\nThey didn’t have to whisper that twice. I took off back towards the generator. Not really knowing why or what I would do once I got there. Even though the Whispers gave me permission I still felt my imagination overtake me on the road. Strange figures stood just off to the side, crouched behind the trees. I felt their nonexistent eyes watching me from all sides, and I began to get the sense that I was actually being chased. I ran harder, faster, the rain stinging my face. The whispers cheering me on. \n\nI can’t really explain this, but isn’t that kind of the whole thesis here; when I got back to the generator, there was a gas can there. I really didn’t have time to think about it very long. I filled the generator back up, gave that cord another forty or fifty pulls, and it fired right back up. I saw the lights by the rangers station and the lodge pop on through the woods. The Whispers stopped, and I began to walk back to my cabin.\n\n I got in, took my rain soaked jacket off, grabbed a towel for my hair, and returned back to my bed.\nI grabbed my phone to check the time. It was 12:05.  \nI really don’t know how to explain that.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nJimmy\n",

Today has been… too much.\n\nI spent all of the morning trying to call and get a hold of my wife. Nobody was answering my calls. I tried everyone I could. I found that people were now starting to block my number too… People I would consider my closest friends. Why would they just suddenly cut all contact?\n\nWell, honestly, right now, I don't care about them, I just need my wife. \n\nI miss her so terribly, and just when I need her the most, she isn't here. There is nothing I wouldn't give to feel her embrace right now. She is the one thing in my life that keeps me grounded and lights up my world no matter how dark it gets. Without her, the darkness has closed about me, strangling me. I'm scared and alone. I feel like a child.\n\nI was supposed to be back at work today, but I called in sick and instead decided to go try her mother's house…\n\nAfter an uneventful journey on the bus and a short walk, I stood staring up at my in law’s house. For a few minutes, I paced, building up the courage. Eventually deciding I better just do it. I walked up to the front door and knocked. Nothing. I walked around the house to the back and tried to just open the back door. Locked. It didn't seem like anyone was home. I tried a couple of times more. Tried to peek through the windows… but not a peep. \n\nI'd given up hope and had started out of the garden gate when suddenly I felt the phone in my pocket begin to buzz.\n\nA private number was calling me. I glanced back at the house, still no movement, maybe it was work? I answer.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Don't come back here again… And please stop calling.”\n\nMy stomach twisted as it jumped up into my chest, it was my wife. Well… it was my wife, but I could scarcely recognise her voice and her tone. I have never heard her talk to me this way before. She sounded wrong. All of the warm bubbliness that embodied the voice of the woman I loved most in my mind was gone. Replaced by a cold, emotionless monotone. She sounded like she had been crying for hours and chain smoking because she was barely able to get the words out.\n\nI felt like she was about to hang up straight away, so before she could, I blurted out as quickly as I could, “Wait!... wait. Please just… tell me what you saw.”\n\nSilence. A shaky breath. More silence.\n\nThen, in a ragged whisper, she spoke, “You don't want to know.”\n\n“I do, please.”\n\nI could hear her sobbing. Not out of sadness, but fear. She was terrified. The silence continued for a minute or so, broken only by her soft sobs.\n\n“I saw the real you.”\n\n“What? What do you mean? I am the real me. I love you. Please don-”\n\n“No. Stop trying to trick me. I saw you. I saw… what you really are.\"”\n\n“Please… please just tell me what you saw. I'm so confused. Was it the way I was walking? Was there something wrong with my movements? Please, I'm trying to understand.”\n\n“No, no… it was worse.” The memory caused her great pain, I could hear it in her voice.\n\nI waited. My heart was now hammering so hard I could feel it throughout my whole body.\n\n\"At first, it was just you coming down the stairs,\" she said. \"Slow, jerky… like you weren’t fully in control. But then, when you passed the camera, it… changed.\"\n\n\"Changed?\"\n\nShe sucked in another breath. I think she was smoking now. Her next words came in a rush, as if she was forcing them out before she lost the courage.\n\n\"You stopped at the bottom of the stairs. You turned toward the camera. And then… your face…\"\n\nShe started crying. Full-body sobs muffled like she was pressing her hand over her mouth.\n\n\"Tell me, please.\" My voice cracked.\n\n\"You… It smiled.\"\n\nThe memory of that eerie, too-still movement flashed in my mind. But that didn’t sound so bad.\n\n\"A smile? Just a smile?\"\n\nHer sobbing grew harsher. \"No, no, you don’t understand. It wasn’t a smile, it was…”\n\nShe broke off into unintelligible mumbles gasps. I gripped the phone tighter, my own breath shaky.\n\n\"Your eyes… Jesus Christ, your eyes…\"\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\nShe whimpered. I didn’t realize how badly I was shaking until the phone quivering in my hand nearly slipped from my grip. Her voice dropped to a shuddering whisper. \"You… looked at me.\"\n\nCold dread trickled down my spine.\n\n“You turned, you looked straight at the camera, and… and it was like you knew I was watching. Like you could see through the screen. And then…\"\n\nShe broke off again, her breathing shallow. She takes a draw of her cigarette.\n\n\"Then what?\" I whispered.\n\n\"Then… you spoke.\"\n\nThe line crackled with static.\n\n\"I heard you. I heard you whispering my name from the phone speaker. And then you said…\"\n\nI could barely breathe.\n\n\"You said… ‘I see you.’\"\n\nA long pause. Then, barely audible, she whispered:\n\n\"And I think you still can.\"\n\nThe call disconnected…\n\nI stood there, staring at the screen of my phone. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't collect my thoughts. I wanted to cease existing.\n\nI slumped right there onto the ground… defeated. As I did so, my wife's phone slid from my pocket, clattering to the pavement. I still don't remember having put that into my pocket. \n\nI pick it up and click the side button. On the screen, there is a motion alert from the Ring App…\n\nI gulp, visceral fear building, making me choke on my own breath… but I find the courage to hit play.\n\nIt shows me standing… it standing… No, me standing looking directly into the camera at the bottom of the stairs…\n\nI'm going to try to describe what I saw, but words were not made for this…\n\nImagine a face stretched beyond the limits of human anatomy. My skin pulled so taut over my skull that it seems close to tearing open. My mouth… too wide, is frozen in a grotesque, rictus grin. My lips are cracked and split at the edges, as if I had been forced to smile for far too long. My teeth themselves are uneven, jagged, and spread apart like my mouth has space for double the amount of teeth.\n\nMy eyes… my eyes are the worst part. My eyes aren’t just wrong, they’re hungry. Hollow pits where eyes should be, but inside them, something shifts in the darkness. Watching. Peering. With malice so pure it feels like the air around you curdles. And yet, even with the lack of pupils, you know it's staring directly at you, into you.\n\nThe skin twitches and shifts, almost as if something inside me is pressing outward, trying to get free. And the longer you look, the more the face changes just slightly at first, a tilt of the head, a widening of the eyes, but then you realise… you can't remember how it used to look. A fraction of a second behind, like a reflection struggling to keep up.\n\nAs I watched, the smile grew wider, and wider still.\n\nThere is no kindness in that smile. No joy. Only an invitation to something worse than death. Like looking directly into hell itself.\n\nThe recording finishes. The file is nowhere to be seen and I stare at the phone… stare until the screen goes black and I see my reflection on the screen… smiling back at me… and I realise, like waking from a dream… the smile has always been there. Maybe I've always looked like this. I can't even remember how I looked before.\n\nI felt myself start to slowly drift into a dream. As a looked at my reflection, sleep started to take me, right at the side of the road outside the garden of my mother in law’s home. I'm exhausted. My last thoughts, “I hope it's a nice dream, where me and my wife are happy.” \n\nI feel myself stand up.\n\nNow I'm laying in bed at home, alone, in the dark. I haven't yet moved. I'm not sure if I have ever moved…  I am typing this on my phone. As you can guess, this will be my last update. It's likely the last thing I write ever. The last proof I was ever a good husband, hard worker, and decent human being… the only proof I ever existed at all. Because my wife was right… I can still see her.\n",

        "author": "AGirlHasN0Name",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "This all happened a year ago when I ran into this guy while waiting for my plane at the airport lounge. No one would believe me even if I told them why I would never sleep on the plane. I intended to keep this a secret to keep my job. But I need an outlet, or I will be crazy... so here it goes...\n\n\"Aerophobia, the fear of flying, is an instinct encoded in an almond-shaped cluster of neurons in our human being's lizard part of the brain. It screams the consequences that may occur when we take our bodies off the ground, all from our ancestors' memories that are deeply engraved in our blood and bones.\"\n\nThe above lengthy statement summarized the lecture the stranger I met in the airline lounge had been giving me.\n\nI sighed, loud and intentional, while swirling my half-glass of merlot and checking the airline app on my phone. My plane was still only halfway en route from a major Midwestern city to my terminal in a Southern coastal city. Thanks to the ripple effects of previous flight cancellations since this morning, my departure time had been delayed for more than three hours. I thought I could pass the time in the lounge easily, but now I have to listen to this guy's unsolicited, endless podcast-style speech, all because I was too polite to say no when he asked if the bar stool next to me was empty.\n\nFrustrated, I finished the rest of the wine in one big gulp, and the stranger beside me said, \"So, do you agree?\"\n\nShit, I almost forgot he was still talking. \"Uh, sorry. I wasn't paying attention.\" Out of courtesy (Damn the manner my parents taught me!), I followed up, \"What were you saying?\"\n\n\"Our feet have their purpose - to support us to walk on the solid ground. They also link our body and soul with nature. When we fly, it's like we are cutting our connections with our core in the earth. It's unnatural for the human body to be in the air for that long. Doesn't that scare you?\"\n\nI laid my phone on the table and looked at the stranger closely for the first time. This man was in his forties or fifties, Caucasian, and thin-built, but with a big beer belly sticking out under his chin. His long pepper hair was tied back to cover the balding spots on top of his head, and his face was tanned and flakey. He was sporting a set of brown checked suits with the same wrinkle level as his face.\n\nI assumed he was a salesman trying to strike up conversations and build networks with potential clients in the airport lounge. After all, this is a great place to meet many potential customers if you have the thick skin to bother people who are exhausted and busy minding their business. I am also a sales representative for a company that sells AI solutions as a service. I fly out of my city every week to different locations, which gets mentally and physically draining. That was why I lowered my guard and gave this guy some attention, not to discourage his hustle. But this conversation was taking a weird turn. I surely didn't want to entertain him anymore.\n\n\"I never thought about it this way, \" I said, pulling my laptop from my purse. \"Alright, nice talk. I've got to get some work done before boarding.\" This was my best firm yet polite hint that I was done talking to him.\n\n\"Busy, busy, busy, I understand. I used to be on the road a lot for the M&A work, too. until I found my enlightenment.\" The man smiled but didn't seem able to take my hint.\n\nI hummed once as the answer. My eyes were still glued to the laptop and my fifty unread emails. I couldn't stop wondering why this man was at the airport if he hated flying that much.\n\nThe stranger sipped his beer, looked at travelers passing us, and said, \"Ok missy, I appreciate you listening to my rant. How about I get you another glass of red and get out of your hair?\"\n\nBefore I could protest, he's already turned and asked the bartender, \"Can you get her another glass of what she was having?\" He pointed at my glass and pulled a dollar bill from his beat-up wallet. \"Here's the tip.\"\n\nI know that bartender's probably laughing inside. In this economy? What could a dollar get you?\n\nThe cold and blood-red liquid was quickly presented next to my laptop. I whispered thanks as the man finally left his seat as promised. I let out another long sigh and stayed focused on my screen to beautify the PowerPoint I had prepared for my pitch. Some time passed, and my phone vibrated. The airline sent a text message informing me that my flight had finally arrived, but the boarding gate was pushed further away from where I was. I growled, packed my things, and slipped off the stool.\n\n\"Ma'am? You forget your thing.\" The bartender stopped me.\n\nI turned around. The young man was holding a palm-sized white linen bag in the air.\n\n\"No, that's not mine.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"The gentleman who left said to make sure you take it with you.\"\n\n\"What? That's weird.\" This strange offering took me aback. \"Can you just throw it away?\"\n\n\"Um, I'm not sure if I could do that.\" He put the bag down on the marbled counter. \"This looks like some organic matter in it.\" He poked the bag, and I could hear the rustling sound coming out. \"If you don't mind...\" He lowered his voice, \"This is my first week at work. I'm not familiar with the rules. I'm not sure if disposal of this thing is allowed or not… could you just….\" He looked at me with begging eyes, \"Take it and throw it away somewhere along the way to your gate?\"\n\nOut of politeness and sympathy for this green bartender, I reluctantly nodded, grabbed the bag, tossed it in my purse, and exited the lounge.\n\nBoarding was fast enough. Thanks to two glasses of red wine I downed in the lounge, as soon as I sat in my comfortable business-class seat, I passed out like there was no tomorrow.\n\nSuddenly, the violent shaking woke me up. I opened my eyes and just caught the elderly passenger beside me drop the hot coffee on his lap.\n\n\"Damn it's hot!\" He cursed.\n\nBefore I could offer him a tissue, the seat under me suddenly dropped abruptly and lifted up, and with a \"ding,\" the buckle-up sign was turned on.\n\nThe captain announced:\" Flight attendants, keep your seatbelts fastened.\"\n\nIt's not a good sign when flight attendants must stop working and buckle up like the rest of us. I felt a pang of anxiety creeping up in my chest, but I brushed it off. Turbulence happens, I told myself; It's perfectly fine. We are like flying through jello—you can shake the gelatin however you want, but the plane won't drop—things are under professional control.\n\nThat's when I felt the plane start tilting downward. I opened the window blinds, witnessing the clouds rush past me at full speed. Soon, we were no longer passing clouds, and the green patches and gray lanes appeared outside the window. Panicky cries filled the plane.\n\n\"Holy shit, are we falling back to the earth?\" I said.\n\nThe old man beside me was still trying to dab his wet pants with his two square paper napkins, regardless of the fact that he was facing downward at a jarring degree like the rest of us. He turned to me, \"What? What are you saying? Isn't this normal?\"\n\nBefore I could reply, a silver coffee kettle flew out of the kitchen. With a loud, muffled \"pang,\" it hit the man's head, knocking him unconscious, and his blood splashed all over my white, pressed shirt.\n\nPassengers screamed behind me while more objects whooshed out of the front cabinet—the feeling of losing gravity sent waves of nausea from my stomach to my throat. I held my best not to vomit or start wailing like my fellow neighbors. I started chanting all the prayers that I could conjure up, hoping this was just a dream.\n\nThe plane's nose tilted further, and we were sat vertically like in a roller coaster. One teenage boy screamed and slipped down the hallway and past me. I tried to grab him, but the force was too strong, and he rolled down too fast for me to react. I could only guess he happened not to have his buckle fastened tight enough. Temporarily safe in my seat, I was not in the most comfortable situation. My back was facing the direction of the sky at a 90-degree angle, my blood was floating all over my body but my head, and the tight belt on my belly was inching into my ribs, suffocating me, threatening to squeeze the air and wine from my body.\n\nCrying, cursing, and praying echoed through the cabinet. Lights started flickering, and a pungent smell of coffee and piss filled the air. I still could not believe what I was experiencing. We were plunging directly back to the earth. My worst nightmare had come true, and I did not know it would be this soon, this real.\n\nAnother violent shake pushed me off the seatbelt, and my face hit the chair back in front of me hard. \"Ah!\" I whimpered, but I did not feel the pain as expected.\n\n\"Ma'am, ma'am, are you alright?\"\n\nI opened my eyes and saw the old man, who was supposed to be oozing blood unconsciously in his chair, looking at me with his blue, cloudy eyes filled with concern.\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" I sat up straight. Looked around. The plane was still flying - thank God - horizontally. No cries nor screams could be heard anymore. My heart pounded so fast that it could jump out of my throat. I rubbed my eyes; was that just a nightmare? No, it cannot be. The whole scenario was too realistic to be a dream.\n\n\"I didn't mean to bother you, but you were crying,\" my neighbor passenger said.\n\nAfter he said that, I sensed a trace of warm liquid on my face. I quickly wiped my tears off with the back of my hand, blushing out of embarrassment. \"No, yeah, sir, thank you for waking me up.\"\n\nHe still looked at me with concerned eyes. \"You know, life is short. Don't let anything - work, school, or family - stress you out. Once you get to my age, you'll hardly remember what or why you were worrying about those things. They will work out eventually; God has his plan for you. All you have to do is believe.\"\n\nHe must be thinking I'm another burned-out road warrior. I gave him a light smile and said, \"Thank you, I will surely remember that.\"\n\nAfter that episode, I could not go back to sleep anymore, so I stayed awake and reviewed my presentation for the tenth time. The rest of the flight was uneventful. After we landed, I turned off the airplane mode. I texted my boss that I'd landed and would send him the presentation soon after I got a better connection.\n\nA news banner popped up on my phone screen as I was texting my message. The title reads: \"Breaking News: Horrific Plane Crash During Descending.\" I opened the new window. The tragedy had happened only 2 hours ago, around the same time as I was having that bad dream in the middle of the air. This plane was taking off as usual, without interference from the weather or other planes. Still, the plane suddenly took a nose dive and crashed into the farmland nearby. Rescuing is ongoing, and no death or injury numbers have been officialized. But anyone could guess the results would be pretty bleak, given the wreckage footage the news is showing.\n\nWhy did this event seem similar to my nightmare a thousand miles away? As more emails came into my phone, I couldn't give the incident a second thought, so I went about my day.\n\n\\###\n\nI killed it at the sales pitch, and the 3-day meetings flew by like a breeze.\n\nThursday afternoon was our time to fly home. My boss booked a similar 7 pm departure flight to his home city, so we shared the ride to the airport. In the car, we compared our notes on our wrapped-up meeting and agreed that we had a high chance of winning the contract.\n\nOn the bus shuttle to the airport, my boss checked his phone and said, \"You know that crazy plane crash that happened on Monday?\"\n\nI answered him in my most nonchalant tone: \"Yeah, I only read the title. Did they find any survivors?\"\n\n\"No, it's so fucking sad. All of them, passengers and crew staff, were believed to be dead from the impact. Did you see the video?\"\n\n\"I don't like to watch that stuff; they kept me awake at night,\" I said. \"Did they ever find out how the plane could fly straight to the ground?\"\n\n\"Nah, they've just uncovered the black box and sent it to the capital, no details yet. Shit's crazy. My wife literally called me and asked me to cancel my flight and drive home after she read the news. I was like, it takes 7 hours without traffic to drive from the Midwest to the East Coast, and then what, does she want me to drive to all the places forever?\"\n\n\"Right? Only if we could.\" I laughed.\n\n\"It's much safer to fly than drive anyway. I told her this kind of thing doesn't happen daily, but you know, wife gotta be wife.\"\n\n\"Let's just hope this doesn't happen again soon. Especially not for our flights.\"\n\n\"It won't. You've got nothing to worry about,\" my boss said as the shuttle bus stopped. \"Well, here's my gate. \"He pulled up his carry-on. \"Let's regroup for our check-in meeting tomorrow.\"\n\nI nodded. \"You have a safe flight!\"\n\nHe saluted back to me and hopped off the bus.\n\nMy flight home wasn't delayed, so I considered it a huge win. I didn't want to look at the work stuff for one more second on the flight, so I started reading the book I bought from the airport store's best-seller shelf. I was only about ten pages in, and my eyes started blurring. I put the book down on my chest and dozed off.\n\nI was waking up from my own involuntary coughing. Immediately, I felt hot - flaming hot - all over my body. For a second, I was confused about why I couldn't see anything. Once my eyes adjusted to the light, I realized the flight cabinet was engulfed by thick smoke and fire. The open blaze was coming from the plane's rear end while passengers ran towards the exit door. Two men were already pulling the emergency exit door, but either door's red, bulky handle wouldn't barge, and the captain's inflight comm was fried. He spoke like rapid-fire, but his voice was distorted and drowned out by muffled statistics and white noises.\n\nOne more man stepped into the right end of the door and grabbed the door handle's tail, and one woman stepped on the door's ledge. With a few more pushes and pulls, a bright light cast into the smoke-filled space, and the door finally unclutched. The fresh air blew in, making the fire's tongue grow.\n\n\"We have to move now! Come with me!\" A flight attendant crouched next to me. Her curly black hair was spread all over her face. I looked at her hazel eyes glowing from the fire but couldn't recall seeing her when I boarded. She unbuckled my belt and lifted me, placed my belly on her shoulder, and walked towards the door. I was half amazed by her strength and half confused about how this was remotely possible. I looked down at my feet and gasped - when did I become so short that a petite lady could carry me like nothing?\n\nThe flight attendant halted as she moved down the hallway. A massive crowd was glued to the spot like a mountain blocking us from advancing further, and their movement to the exit was painfully slow. Every second was like a century passing in the inferno. Swears filled the air, mingling with desperate cries and shoves. Suddenly, \"BLAM!\" A thunderous explosion shattered the air, ripping me away from the flight attendant's grasp. The force slammed me onto the floor. \"No!\" I heard the flight attendant cry out. Instantly, another deafening \"BANG!\" filled the space, accompanied by the chaotic symphony of shattered glass and crackling crimson flames swirling around me. Then, darkness eroded my vision, erasing everything left to see.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Southern coastal city's International Airport. Local time is 11:25 pm…\"\n\n\"What?\" I said, realizing my throat was burning.\n\n\"Welp, that must be a hell of a book. Put you to sleep through the whole way.\" The man who sat next to me said.\n\nI looked down at the book. It was that boring book about not giving a fuck about everything, \"For sure, it gets repetitive fast after the shocking openings.\"\n\n\"This is home for ya?\" He stood up and helped me with my overhead carry-on.\n\n\"Yeah, you?\"\n\n\"No, I was supposed to head to a city in Florida for my brother's bachelor party, but it looks like the plane coming in caught on fire after it landed.\" He said, \"I may end up getting a voucher to stay in this place for a night. Do you have any late-night bite recommendations? I'm tired of going to those tourist trap places…\"\n\nMy ears rang, my throat was dry like sandpaper, and I could no longer hear the men. A flight caught on fire, same as my dream again? Could this be another freaky coincidence? It's not like my dream manifested the whole thing, or I suddenly became a seer who can predict omens, right?\n\nRealized the guy was still staring at me expectantly. I said, \"Sorry, I don't actually go out in town these days, so I'm coming up blank. A lot of good restaurants are probably closed by now. You can always hit up the famous party street for some late-night scenes.\" Seeing his disappointed face, I added, \"I'm sure you can still get decent local sandwiches at one of those bars that open up late.\"\n\n\"I appreciate it. Well, I'll have to find someone to help me sort out my flight schedule first and then get the food.\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" I said, \"Can you tell me your supposed incoming flight number?\"\n\n\"Sure, let me see.\" He pulled up the airline app on his phone. \"It was ABC### (I'm hiding the numbers for obvious reasons). So, are you heading home directly, or want to get a bite together?\"\n\n\"No thanks. I'm absolutely beat. I hope you have a good time in this city, though.\"\n\nOn my Uber home, I couldn't help but delve into the reports surrounding ABC###. The flight caught on fire shortly after taking off. The fire erupted from the plane's rear end, spreading too fast for flight attendants to put it off. The pilot made an emergency landing, but the emergency exit doors malfunctioned for no definite reason reported yet, which compounded the damage, and half of the flight passengers were killed from burning and smoke inhalation.\n\nAmong the passengers who lost their lives, the youngest victim was a 6-year-old girl. One of the brave flight attendants tried to carry the young girl toward the exit as her mom had succumbed to a lack of oxygen. However, during the process, one of the engines exploded, and the girl was hurled down the hallway and consumed by the blaze. The flight attendant who recounted the event suffered minor external injuries and was rushed to the nearest hospital along with other survivors for overnight observation. The news videos showed her profile picture - a young woman in her twenties with long, curly black hair and hazel eyes.\n\n\\###\n\n\"As I was saying, clients liked what they saw and wanted our team to fly in the following Monday to meet their CIO directly,\" my boss said.\n\nI frowned.\n\n\"Oh, someone's not happy about flying again?\" My colleague said.\n\nI cursed myself for forgetting the camera was on. \"No, it's just those flight incidents are getting really disturbing. \"\n\n\"Try to get some sleep this weekend,\" my boss said. \"But if you want to forgo the rest time for the party, you can always sleep on the flight.\"\n\nSure, like I would ever dare to sleep during the flight again.\n\nAfter the call, I started unpacking my luggage. While taking out my notebook from the backpack, a small bag slipped out. The damn bag of dirt that weird man left for me had been living in my bag for this whole time; I completely forgot to throw it away.\n\nI picked up the bag and untied the rope around its opening. The bag only has specks of dirt inside. I poked the dirt with my index finger, and a warm pulse shot into my brain. \"What the hell?\" I dropped the bag on the ground. It didn't move a bit. The sensation was familiar, cozy, and welcoming, like returning to a safe space, Nana's country home, or a long-lost ancient motherland unveiled itself once more.\n\nCould this be the culprit that sent me all those weird visions in my dream? What did that strange guy say he worked at again? I quickly jumped on LinkedIn and searched for a Merger and Acquisition law firm based in the Southern city; more than 12 million results came back on Google. I pulled my hair, knowing I had no slight clue about what that man's name was or if he was even still employed.\n\nI went to the fridge and grabbed one can of hard seltzer. Taking in the surprisingly refreshing sip, I checked the label. It's a citrus flavor, and the label says, \"Enjoy the natural sweetness without added calories.\" I returned to my laptop and typed in the keywords \"M&A lawyer, Nature, Aerophobia, Southern city,\" and a LinkedIn page came up as the first search.\n\n\"R. N., a former Mergers and Acquisitions lawyer with 30 years of experience in the industry, has recently exited the firm due to aerophobia. Embracing a new calling, R. has transitioned into serving as a spiritual leader, helping communities return to nature and find inner harmony.\" His LinkedIn profile said.\n\nI clicked the connect button next to his broad grin picture and waited about ten minutes. Still, no reply to the invitation was accepted. He probably couldn't answer me anyway, so I closed the laptop.\n\nI was waiting in my terminal to board the plane to the Midwestern city again on Monday morning. My boss and colleague were chatting about Saturday's football game, and I checked the news about the flight incidents. Nothing traumatic happened during the weekend.\n\nAfter boarding the plane, I was ready to pass out on the flight again when my phone vibrated, showing a new notification that R. had accepted my invitation. I checked the window. The flight was waiting to get into the take-off lane. I still had time, so I quickly messaged him, \"Hey R., do you remember me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He replied.\n\nOh, suddenly, he doesn't want to be talkative anymore. I replied, \"I wanted to ask you about the bag you left for me.\"\n\nAfter one second, I followed,\" Never mind. This is crazy. It's probably nothing.\"\n\n\"The bag that ties you back to the ground? Yes, that's my gift for you.\" R. typed back, \"I hope you carry it with you whenever you fly.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? What would happen if I didn't take it with me?\"\n\n\"Haven't you seen those punishments for running away from Mother Nature with your own eyes? Oh, I bet you did. That's why you come to me for an answer. Isn't it?\" I can see his smirk through the message asking for a punch.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I quickly typed, \"Guy, spell it out. I have about 5 minutes to take off. I had some bothersome dreams that happened to be the same as the real flight incidents. Are you saying those are connected? What am I being punished for?\"\n\n\"A real professional can connect the dots,\" he answered. \"I've told you, it's not natural for us to fly this high. Mother Earth's wrath has found you. But she is merciful. If you take the soil with you, you are keeping your connection. She'd just recast the condemned consequence for others.\"\n\n\"Are you serious? So this jerk mother would kill other people to show me how bad it is for me to take the flights to do my work and earn a living? I didn't do anything to you. Why did you have to curse me with this voodoo shit?\"\n\n\"You are still not awake. This is a blessing, not a curse!\" And beyond all things, he added a smiley face emoji at the end of the message.\n\nMy blood boiled. I couldn't tell if this guy's been dead serious or if he was at the last stage of a delusional rampage. The flight attendant came by and reminded me we were about to take off - that meant I needed to turn my phone to airplane mode.\n\nI answered her, \"Of course,\" but lowered my head to the phone and typed, \"R., what will happen if I don't have that bag of dirt with me?\" I did not even bother opening the overhead cabinet and pulling my luggage out to search for the dirt, as I knew for sure I had not packed that bag with me for this flight. Waste management is probably already picking it up from my trash can and carrying it to the landfill. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.\n\nR. didn't reply immediately this time. I anxiously stared at the phone as the flight safety video played.\n\nWhen the flight lifted off the air, my heart sank to the bottom of my stomach.\n\nThree dots appeared on the message, showing he was typing.\n\n\"Do not ever sleep on the plane.\" The message came through: \"Maybe that will work.\"\n\n\"Maybe? What do you mean, maybe?!\" I typed back, but my phone lost the signal, and the message I sent stuck in the forever circle symbol.\n\nI glanced at the passengers, who listened to the music, closed their eyes, tried to get some rest, or chatted with their companions. They were going through the routine like any other day on the plane.\n\nR. never replied me again - the asshole blocked me after our last conversation.\n\nThis is why I never sleep on my flight anymore, no matter how long the trip is—a four-hour domestic flight, a ten-hour trip to Europe, or thirty-two hours of international flights to South Asia —and I am so, so tired…\n\n ",

        "author": "MichaelMonkyMan",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "I found out about the mirror dare from a close friend at school, Calvin. He was always amongst the upper echelon of students when it came to grades and stayed at the school library after hours to continue studying and completing his homework. That was also where we’d spend the most time together with our friends. He brought up the mirror dare during our 5th period calculus class but only mentioned the name, and promised he would explain more in the library. \n\nYou’d never know it by a first impression, since he wore polo shirts and boot cut jeans and carried himself in an academically nerdy way, but Calvin was also really into scary and creepy stuff. He always wanted to talk about media like Resident Evil, the Saw movies, and campfire-esque stories. He’s actually the reason I found this subreddit, so thanks Calvin. \n\nI always loved to listen to him explain stories or universes he would read about or experience in a video game. A few days ago it seemed no different when he brought up the mirror dare. We were hanging out in the library with two other friends, Jamie and Sam, when Calvin pulled up on his phone some barebones forum from God only knows what grimey corner of the internet. He then read allowed the rules of the dare.\n\n**Find any clean mirror you can stand 6 inches from.**\n\n**Stare at yourself in the mirror.**\n\n**Stand completely still.**\n\n**See how long you can last.**\n\nSam, a friend of mine I’ve known since preschool, cutely laughed upon hearing the last rule. \n\n“That’s just bait to prove how shot our attention spans are. I bet you a boomer posted that out of spite for kids our age. It’s not our fault our childhoods are more entertaining than slapping mud with sticks and stones and listening to a radio.” She ranted\n\nSam’s wit was unmatched in my opinion. This was probably why I had a pretty big crush on her, which I hid, us being friends for so long and all. I don’t know why she hung out with our small socially inept group.\n\n“No, no.” Jamie pitched in. “The dude's name is ‘SonicProMaster2017’, I’d believe he’s more likely to be 7 than 77, any day.” He said pointing at the username above the post.\n\n“We could ask him.” I jokingly responded\n\n“Hell naw, Luke. The people that post on here are weird. I don’t wanna be roped into any contact with those types.” Calvin rejected.\n\nSitting on a couch in the library we argued over who the poster of the mirror dare could be, whether he lived in his grandparents basement or in a public park bathroom, and whether or not we should try the mirror dare. Initially we all thought it was stupid and decided to share funny TikToks with each other until we got kicked out for not ‘using the library in an appropriate manner’. Calvin was a little pissed at this since he didn’t want to be barred from his favorite after school hangout spot. \n\nWe were strolling down the halls until Sam made a proposal.\n\n“Why don’t we just go to the bathroom and try it?”\n\nIt was easy enough to agree too. We didn’t have anything else to do, and so we decided to find one of the individual sized school restrooms with a lock and carry out the mirror dare. Or at least try. It was less of a full commitment to the dare and more of a bit we acted out. We made Jamie lean over the bathroom sink and stare at himself in the splotch stained and cracked mirror since he was the most apprehensive to volunteer.\n\nAs he stared at himself, Sam stuck her finger in her mouth, really marinating it, and gave Jamie a sopping wet willy. His concentration was decimated yet he tried again. The entire dare session consisted of tickling Jamie, us moaning from the stall, acting like there was a poltergeist in the bathroom, and also Calvin crunching chips loudly in Jamie’s ear refusing to give him any because ‘the mirror man said no’.\n\nJamie, reasonably, was done with his part in the mirror dare and we all decided to go our separate ways and head home.\n\nI tried it again in my bedroom. I have a standing mirror, roughly 6 feet tall, tucked in between my dresser and computer desk. A persuasive curiosity grabbed a hold of me when I was playing games on my computer. I had a headache and took a break from any blue light or screens. But then, of course, I got bored just sitting around doing nothing. Maybe the forum boomer was right. \n\nI decided to do the mirror dare myself. At some point in the school bathroom we somehow managed to break every single rule. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t horsing around because I was scared to some extent. Maybe the others were too. Except Jamie, he doesn’t have much going on up there.\n\nBut now I had the urge to do it right. So I stood there, a few inches away, and stared at myself. Initially it had the effects I was hoping for. My breathing had slowed down to a meditative pace. My mind felt clear. How much of that was owed to the dare or just because I wasn’t stimulating my brain, I don’t know. But it was undeniably calming. \n\nIronically, as I kept staring at my features I’ve grown so familiar with, the more unfamiliar they became. It’s like when you think about a word for too long and notice how odd it’s spelled or pronounced. It just felt weird. \n\nI had never taken the time to actually look at myself in this analytical way. So close, so oddly personal, so unrecognizable. I know what I look like. I, like everyone else, see myself everyday when I brush my teeth and get ready for the day or when looking at a photo I’m in. I knew it was me I was looking at, but it didn’t just feel like me.\n\nYet, It wasn’t concerning. I assumed I just never had the chance to look at myself for so long and so intensely. What was concerning was when my face began to move on its own. Not any large super noticeable movements, but small ones that I wasn’t actively trying to make. Like micro twitches of the eye or the corner of my mouth. Enough to make me question if I was actually doing that.\n\nAt some point I began peering into my own eyes. Questions rose whether those were my eyes staring back at me. A primal sensation loomed over me. One that said I was allowing another person, a stranger, to watch me so closely. It emerged and disappeared just as quickly. It was silly to think that. It was just my reflection. Then my nose began bleeding.\n\nThat ended the dare for me then. It was just so sudden and unexpected that I reached for my face without thinking and broke my concentration. It wasn’t real. I wiped my fingers on my nose and there was nothing. Of course there wasn’t, ‘Just another psychologically explainable mind trick, I’m sure.’ I thought to myself. I looked back at my clock. 11:25pm. I had only stared for 9 minutes.\n\nThe following school day we were playing basketball in my P.E. class, starting with layup drills. We formed a line and would all run under the hoop and shoot a layup then circle around to the line. Since this was the first drill I assumed it would be the easiest. I would never find out how difficult the others were because when I jumped to layup my basketball something clocked me right in the nose.\n\nIt was a flicker of darkness followed by a numb bruising pain. The tip of my nose was shrieking where my skin was cut up. I didn’t know blood could gush from anyone's nostrils so fast. The gym coach immediately rushed to my aid and handed me a spare jersey to hold under my nose. He told me to skip the remainder of class and head to the nurse’s office.\n\nI may be a bit dramatic, it wasn’t that bad. The blood stopped within the hour and my nose survived with only lingering irritation where a very thin layer of skin used to be. Thankfully that was my last class of the day and I could tell my friends what had happened in the library. Of course, the mirror dare was the first thing that came up.\n\n“How long, Luke?” Jamie asked.\n\n“Only 9 minutes. Didn’t feel that long, though.” I remarked while feeling my tender nose.\n\n“Anything spooky happen? Did you see a ghost? Did Bloody Mary show up?” Sam butted in.\n\n“No, dumbass. She only appears when you say her name three times.” Jamie said\n\n“I didn’t see anything too weird or unexplainable. I guess the longer I looked the more my face felt like it was morphing or changing. Kinda felt strange. But I think that’s just because I was going brain dead staring for so long. Made me feel gullible for trying it.”\n\n“You were brain dead before the dare.” Sam said before looking at me. “That’s a real schnozzer you got there, bud.”\n\nBud. That hurt more than the basketball.\n\n“I got pelted in the face with an air ball at the gym. Asshole was shooting from the three-point during a layup drill. Ruined my shirt.” I said, unzipping my hoodie to show everyone my blood stained shirt collar. They all cringed at the sight. “It’s funny, I thought I had a nosebleed yesterday while looking in the mirror– which had freaked me out more than it actually did today. Otherwise I would’ve gotten farther than 9 minutes.”\n\nCalvin glanced at me swiftly, seemingly an unconscious reaction. I only now noticed the bags under his eyes. Jamie and Sam and I sometimes questioned Calvin’s health when he wasn’t around to hear. We didn’t know much about his home life but assumed it wasn’t the best considering he always wanted to be at school. \n\nSometimes he would show up looking drained, wearing the same clothes as he wore the previous day, but today he looked much more tired. You would’ve thought he was aggressively hungover if you didn’t know Calvin never even knew what alcohol tasted like.\n\n“Wait, wait, wait.” Sam said abruptly. “You can’t just not put that together– am I the only one that thinks that’s weird?” \n\n“No, that's definitely weird. Luke, you idiot, you’re saying you saw your nose bleed during the dare and then it actually bled later on? You’re a fortune teller!” Jamie cheered.\n\nI did feel dumb for not putting it together. But I also felt a sense of fear now that I realized the eerie connection. As Jamie and Sam laughed at the joke, Calvin stayed quiet. His gaze had never left me.\n\n“I bet I can get the longest time tonight. Your 9 minutes are cooked, Luke!” Jamie spouted\n\nAnd with that, we left the library with the plan to try the mirror dare once again. We all agreed. Some of us more excited than others. To rephrase, I decided not to do it that night. When they had brought up the whole bloody nose thing I began feeling an irrational fear similar to what a child would feel sleeping in a dark bedroom. I knew it was a silly thing to be scared of, yet I still felt afraid. \n\nI was so paranoid that when I had to use the toilet that night I entered the bathroom with my eyes closed and blasted hot water from the sink. When I was sure the mirror had fogged up, and when I couldn’t hold it anymore, I opened my eyes and entered to do my business. I was deeply fearful of my own reflection. It was embarrassing.\n\nThe next day Calvin was absent from our Calculus class. I tried texting him but he didn’t respond. That guy *never* missed school. \n\n“Calvin not responding to you guys either?” Sam asked as we all sat in the library.\n\nJamie and Sam had been calling him throughout the day with no response. We would’ve asked his parents where he was, but none of us had their numbers let alone even met them.\n\n“You think he died? He looked like a Tim Burton character yesterday” Jamie said\n\n“Jamie. Shut up.” Sam said disregarding him.\n\n“You shut up. I bet I got a longer time than you.” He said in a snarky voice.\n\n“36 minutes.” Sam dropped casually.\n\n“3.” Jamie mumbled.\n\nI couldn’t fathom looking in the mirror for that long. I thought that Sam must’ve had the patience of a monk. \n\n“I don’t wanna do it again.” She added. “It was like what Luke said; I felt like I didn’t recognize myself after a while. I thought it was silly at first, too, but then I got this numb feeling. Like I was comfortable just standing there and looking at myself. And more and more I felt like I was looking at someone else. Like someone else was bending over and staring back at my face. I got… scared. But it was like luring me in, you know?”\n\nWe both stared at her blankly. I tried processing what she was saying, how it was similar to what I had felt. But Jamie might’ve just thought she was crazy.\n\n“But yeah. I’m done. Not for me.” Sam threw her arms up and shook her head.\n\n“I’ll beat it.” I said unprompted.\n\nThe words just came out of my mouth. I wanted to impress Sam and in the moment I shoved down all the fear I suffered through two days before.\n\n“Ooh, okay. You should FaceTime me so I can watch you do it. That way I know you’re not cheating.” Sam said, tapping my healing nose.\n\nThis was the first time Sam had asked for something like this. Something one on one. My fears were suddenly pushed aside, overwhelmed with a warm excitement. All I could think about now was our time spent alone together, even if it was just over a video chat.\n\nLater at home, I called Sam and propped my phone on the dresser facing myself and the mirror. She answered immediately and her cheerful face appeared on the screen. Soon after I found myself staring at my own. \n\n“I wanna ask questions while you’re doing this so blink twice for yes and three times for no. Okay?” She said before starting the timer.\n\nI blinked twice.\n\n“Good.” She chuckled.\n\nAnd so I began staring at myself. It didn’t really hit me what I was doing until I was looking deeply into my own eyes again. I could feel my heart racing until Sam spoke again.\n\n“Do you really think you can beat my time?” She asked\n\nI blinked twice.\n\n“Well I’m not trying it anymore. So if you beat me the record is yours.” Sam said acting disappointed then following it up with more laughter.\n\nI wanted to ask what my prize would be if I won. I almost broke my concentration to say it but stopped myself. It was probably best I didn't, too cheesy. Then the face twitching started again. I could feel the miniscule muscles in my cheeks clenching ever so slightly.\n\n“You see your face twitching?” Sam asked.\n\nI blinked twice.\n\n“You at the point where you see any movements you can’t feel?”\n\nI scanned my face carefully and noticed my lip had quivered– or might have, I wasn’t too sure. I guess that was enough to confirm it. I blinked twice.\n\n“It’s so weird how that works. I don’t like thinking about my body moving on its own.” She said, her voice sounding more distant from her phone. \n\nMaybe she was off doing something while I stared at the mirror. That’s when I felt something different. Something… new, that I hadn’t felt last time. Gentle brushing on my face like a soft breeze was caressing my skin. Sam must’ve noticed my discomfort.\n\n“You must be seeing something I can’t see 'cause from here everything still looks fine.”\n\nI blinked three times.\n\n“Well, you’re 10 minutes in now. Get it together.” She said.\n\nThat gave me a small boost of energy. However, it was quickly stripped away once I heard crunching. It was very audible, like she was chewing right by her phone. I began blinking slow and rhythmically hoping she would get the idea.\n\n“Ah, sorry. I forgot. I’ll just mute myself until I’m done. Wanted to get popcorn for the show.” She apologized.\n\n‘Thank God.’ I thought to myself. \n\nAnd then I noticed something weird as my mind was drawn away from her words. I was angry. Like, my face looked angry even though I didn’t feel angry. Eyebrows furrowed, chin and lips scrunched, full on mad. I was a little annoyed when Sam was crunching in my ear but now I looked cartoonishly enraged. It was extremely odd. \n\nMy brain didn’t know what to do, seeing my expression so intense yet I felt no tension in my face. It felt like my brain was attempting to mimic a feeling of tension that should be there around my chin and nose and cheeks and brow.\n\nThe mix of witnessing this angry expression and being unfamiliar with the face before me, a sudden urge to help this man erupted. I wanted to talk with him, I wanted to know what made him so angry as to see if I could help him. I don’t mean to sound narcissistic or self pitying because that is not where this feeling came from, but I wanted to bond with this stranger in the mirror.\n\n“I know you like me… and that you’re doing this for me.” Sam suddenly spoke.\n\nHer voice surprised me, and that grim expression subtly morphed to that of a neutral one as if my brain was recorrecting what I was truly seeing. My chest fluttered with emotions at just that single sentence.\n\n“Just sitting here… watching you… I realize how brave you are, Luke.” Her voice sprinkled all over me like a soft misty rain. “I notice you looking at me at school. The way you’ve always looked at me when you thought I didn’t see you.” She giggled.\n\nIt was at this moment I realized I could stand here forever. Forever looking into the mirror and hearing the voice of a girl I’ve known my whole life. Until an abrupt ‘ding’ erupted from my phone.\n\n“I finished eating. Damn, I feel bloated.” She spoke candidly.\n\nShe had unmuted herself.\n\nMy heart wilted over and died at the sudden realization that the voice I heard speaking may have not been Sam’s. It felt so real. What I just heard had to be real. Her voice was so clearly audible from the phone’s speakers. This wasn’t just something that my brain could conjure up for me.\n\nMy breathing was on pace with my heartbeat. I could see my chest heaving and shuttering in the mirror. The thought of looking at my phone dashed through my head, but it just felt wrong. Like I wasn’t supposed to. Like if I looked away from the mirror I would be in trouble.\n\n“Luke, are you Alright? Remember to blink for me, okay?” She said.\n\nThat’s right, maybe I could let her know something was wrong. I blinked three times for ‘no’. Sam didn’t acknowledge it. I tried it again. Still nothing.\n\n“Is my phone frozen?” Her casual tone worried me even more.\n\nI tried rapidly blinking. I saw flashes of my face interrupted by darkness. I blinked as hard and fast as I could just hoping she would say something.\n\n“Your head’s still moving, you know. You’re not funny.”\n\nShe really couldn’t see me blinking. I had tried everything. So I stopped and kept my eyes open. My reflection continued to blink. If I already wasn’t able to move, that would’ve paralyzed me with the fear I felt. No man was supposed to see themselves with closed eyes. It felt like a stranger was invading my space and there was nothing I could do about it. \n\nI wanted to cry so bad, to feel the tears run down my cheeks. At least that was something I would’ve been able to control. But it didn't matter. I knew I wasn’t in control anymore. Whatever the mirror dare was, I had taken it too far. And there might be no return.\n\nThen the mirror image of myself leaned back slowly, only centimeters a second. It leaned farther and farther and farther, falling into my mirrored dim bedroom. And then with a loose and limp neck, it swung its forehead at the mirror— at me. \n\nI heard the thump, the crack of the mirror, and I reflexively flinched away. I stood with my hands raised in front of my face, as if to shield myself, lowering them as I grew accustomed to the lack of intense focus I was just freed from. I could move again.\n\n“Sam?” I pleaded.\n\nShe didn’t answer. I grabbed my phone on the dresser and was confused to find that it was dead. I had fully charged it when I got home from school, there was no way it was dead now. \n\n‘How long was I staring at myself?’ I had thought. I ran for the kitchen where I knew the stove had a clock on it. It was 1am. I had been staring at myself in the mirror for 8 hours. Far longer than what I expected. I just stood there staring at the clock as I had done with my reflection. \n\n“Luke, is that you? Where the Hell have you been? We've been trying to find you for the past hour.” My Dad said, barging into the kitchen and switching the lights on.\n\n“I’ve been in my room.” I said. But my voice came out monotone and slow. I had felt like I took a nap that was hours longer than expected and had awoken in the middle of the night.\n\n“Your Mom and I tried knocking on your door, calling, searching for your location on your phone, nothing was working! You can’t just ghost out on us like that!” He was becoming passionately angry. A caring parental wrath emerged within his voice. \n\n“My phone was dead. I’m sorry. I don’t know when it died.” I said. \n\nMy Dad continued to lecture me on updating them on my whereabouts and always keeping my phone charged, but I was more worried about whatever the hell I had just experienced. When my Dad decided he was too tired to ramble on at me, I immediately returned to my room and threw my phone on the charger. Missed call notifications flooded in from Sam and my parents. Along with a few text messages from Sam.\n\n*9:53pm - Dude, are you okay?*\n\n*10:01pm - I can’t tell if you can hear me or not can you please respond?*\n\n*10:05pm - I’m really close to calling 911 you’re scaring me.*\n\n*12:16am - What you did was extremely rude and upsetting. I was so worried about you and after pleading with you for so long you just smile at me and the phone hangs up? Was I even FaceTiming you or was that just a video? If this is a prank you’re insane and need help. It’s like you don’t even consider me a friend.*\n\nIn a panic, I was about to call Sam back to apologize, to tell her I was okay, that I don’t remember doing any of that. I don’t know what I could have possibly said that didn’t make me seem crazy. I remember picturing her in my mind yelling to get my attention as I stared at myself blankly. I didn’t like thinking about what I was doing during that span of time where my memory seemingly disappeared. I decided to hold off on texting Sam. I had to call Calvin. He was the only person I could think of that possibly had any idea of what was happening to me.\n\nHe picked up immediately. The call was silent for a moment.\n\n“Hello?” I said.\n\n“Hi, Luke.” Calvin said, oddly energetic and confident sounding at the early hours of the AM.\n\nI attempted telling him everything that had happened, minus the part that Sam was watching the whole thing. I was still embarrassed and scared about that and wasn’t ready to accept everything yet.\n\n“You shouldn’t have stopped looking!” He screamed into the phone. His tone switched entirely from friendliness to pure rage.\n\nHe hung up immediately after that. I tried calling him. The ringer abruptly stopped and I was sent to voicemail. I just sat there full of confusion and fear. I had so many questions that I was afraid to have answered. I decided I was going to stay awake the entire night, partially on my phone and partially sitting in silence doing nothing. I didn’t want to be unconscious again.\n\nThere was a knock at my window. Booming and strong enough to jolt me out of my stagnant bed-rotting trance. I looked over at my white curtains. Another knock. My legs were shaking, not knowing if they should carry me to the window or keep me still and hidden. I decided not to move.\n\n“I know you’re there.” A muffled yet familiar voice called from outside.\n\nI don’t know if it was the fatigue or the come down from an adrenaline rush accumulated throughout the evening that lowered my guard, but I decided to investigate. I slowly crept up from my bedside and ran my hands down the curtain, pulling it slightly aside. A figure stood right below the window. His face barely revealed in the moonlight. It was Calvin.\n\n“Let me in. Now.” Calvin said with a blank expression.\n\nI had never seen him so serious. I almost forgot about the way he yelled at me over the phone just less than 2 hours ago. And now he was outside my room. I didn’t know exactly where Calvin lived, but I knew his home was two towns over. He had to have walked since he didn’t have a car.\n\n“Calvin? What the hell are you doing here?” I groaned.\n\n“Open the window. I need to help you.” He said.\n\nTalking to him, I noticed he looked even more disheveled than I must have. Like he had followed through with staying up for more nights than I did. \n\n“Why didn’t you answer our calls yesterday, dude? We were worried about you.” I asked him.\n\nHe didn’t bother answering that, either. I was not going to let Calvin in. Something was off enough for me to realize, even with my mental fog and general grogginess, that whatever he was trying to do his intentions weren’t in my favor. He must’ve realized this when I just stood there behind the glass, because he was now trying to hoist the window up. I watched it lift upwards a few inches before realizing what was happening.\n\nI immediately fought back, pushing the window down so I could lock it. But he reached his arm through and pulled hard on my shirt to lift himself up even more. He knocked me off balance and my face smushed into the window. When I steadied myself again, pushing against the glass, I saw that the window was open even more. He was about to get in, having lunged through the frame which his chest now rested on. \n\nI clawed and slammed my fists into his arm, but he kept his grip on me as he shoved the window open with the other hand. I tried reaching down and shoving the palm of my hand onto his face. That's when he grabbed my arm and pulled me. I was yanked down by his weight, my head knocking onto the bottom of the frame. He was still using me and the window to hoist himself up. \n\nThen everything went black as Calvin lost his footing on the side of my house, falling to the ground with one hand on me and the other on the wooden trim on top of the window pane. The window came down on my neck like a guillotine.\n\nWhen I awoke at the hospital, a long process that consisted of waves where I dipped in and out of consciousness, everything above my chest was in severe pain. A nurse was present when I awoke, but I could barely speak let alone move my head to get her attention. \n\nI resorted to rapping the metal hospital bed frame with my knuckles. When she realized I was awake, she brought my parents. It was hard watching my Mom hold back tears, but my Dad reassured her and I that everything would be okay and the doctors told them I’d recover within a few months. \n\nIt was explained to me at some point by the nurse and my parents that my neck was broken. Police were called and assumed I was fighting off an intruder due to the ripped shirt and bruised arms; signs of a struggle. I had to tell them what happened with the notes app on my phone, that Calvin had tried to break in and accidentally slammed the window on me, or at least I’d hoped it was an accident. I still try to believe that it was. When I told them what had happened, my parents assured me they would bring this information to the police.\n\nLater that day, Sam and Jamie visited me. When they walked into my hospital room, they carried with them a box roughly the size of a milk crate. They sat by me, setting the box on a nearby table, and told me how glad they were that I was making a full recovery. I appreciated the sentiment of their visit, but was too tired to respond with my phone. I just smiled at them. Before they left, Sam told me something that brought back the fear I felt while I was staring at the mirror.\n\n“Calvin gave us this at school during lunch. He mentioned he was sorry about what happened. Obviously we had no clue what he was talking about at the time, but he wanted to be sure that we gave you his present. Your parents told us what he did so I guess if you want us to throw it out we can.” She explained.\n\nI blinked three times.\n\n“Want us to open it for you?” Jamie asked.\n\nI blinked twice.\n\nSam and I watched as Jamie tore open the cardboard box. Something shiny emerged from the packing peanuts and paper. Jamie lifted it. It was a mirror. They decided to leave it on the table facing away from where I lay, which was alright with me. Just glancing at the dark black screen of my phone when it’s turned off scared me enough to avoid typing this out. But I found resilience with enough time. It gets boring doing nothing all day but wishing you could move freely again. \n\nKnowing what I know now, I'm not sure how I can live a normal life. Brushing my teeth won't be a big deal, but shaving might be harder. I'm always gonna have to ask for second opinions on outfits and rely on others to tell me how I look. I just can't imagine myself being near a mirror and not thinking about what happened that night. What might happen again.\n\nI wanted to share this as a warning. Do not emulate anything I did. Do not stare into mirrors too long. You will regret it.\n\n  \n",

        "content": "So I live in an area of the United States thats well known for being in the \"path of the skinwalker.\" And this has led to several small encounters, but nothing has ever been concrete enough for me to actually attribute it to a skinwalker. Until last night.   \n  \nI arrived home from work pretty late, around 11pm. As I exited my car and walked towards my house, I felt like someone was watching me. So I hurried in and slammed the door behind me. The feeling soon disappeared as I made myself a late dinner and prepared for bed.  \n  \nA slight breeze from my open window that was right next to my bed crept in as I slipped into bed. I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my social media apps as I waited for sleep to take me. Suddenly, a whistle from outside broke my concentration. I turned off my phone and listened as it continued.   \n  \nI live in a small town, in the center of it no less, so I'm used to people walking around in the daytime. However, there's no streetlights, so by the time it gets dark everyone's inside. Something about the distant whistling disturbed me, so I got up and shut the window.  \n  \nThat incident soon faded into the back of my mind as I continued to scroll on my phone. Eventually I fell asleep, but that was just the beginning.   \n  \nI dreamed that I was in an apartment with my sister. I was talking with her when she suddenly became very scared. \"Oh god, its here,\" she said with clenched teeth, pointing behind me.   \n  \nI turned to see a shadowy figure manifest before my very eyes. It was entirely black, except its eyes, which were a crimson red. It glared at the two of us before lunging in our direction.   \n  \nI woke up, my heart racing. It felt like the figure was still in the room with me. I took a deep breath and opened my eyes. They panned across the room, dreading what would happen if I actually saw the figure.   \n  \nTo my relief, I didn't see anything. My eyes looked at the alarm clock on my desk, and my heart dropped. It was exactly 3am. I covered myself with my blanket, telling myself it was just a dream. I tried to fall back asleep, but every time I almost did, I shot back awake. It felt like something was right next to me.   \n  \nMy eyes widened in fear as I realized I could hear a slight tapping on my window. I pulled my blanket tighter over me as it continued. My heart raced as it seemed like another thing joined the tapping. Multiple fingers slammed against my window, the rapid tapping escalating.   \n  \nI could do nothing but cower as muffled whispers starting coming from the other side of my wall. This continued for exactly one hour until 4am. Once my clock it that hour, everything ceased immediately. I stayed awake for 10 more minutes, before sleep overtook me.  \n  \nThis morning, I woke up with the memories of that hour still etched into my mind. Before sitting down to write this post, I decided to go look outside my window. A plethora of various footprints were etched into the dirt. I found a small bone neatly placed on my windowsill as well.   \n  \nI've placed several protective crystals at the base of my window. And I plan on picking up some smudge sticks today to cleanse the area. I hope this is enough to keep these creatures at bay. But I know when night comes, they will too...",

        "author": "manbearpig_248",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "Ok, I posted this story in a few other communities yesterday and it seems like the vast majority of people were intrigued. If you haven’t already, and are curious, go back and read my last post to get caught up. I’ve linked it right here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Qywx56z2Zi\n\nAdditionally, if there’s a better way for me to link everything together on here please let me know as I’m not much of a frequent poster on here. \n\nAgainst my better judgement, I’ve decided to upload more. I’m writing this on the flight back home, as a preface to this next post. Contained in the package we found before leaving the island was a journal with loose pages placed carefully in between certain pages, and a hard drive, along with a note that served as a precursor to what was in the journal. What you are reading next is the word for word firsthand account of the man in the bunker. It reads almost eerily like a story at times, to which I can only assume was the result of a man who knew he was on borrowed time trying to put that reality aside for the sake of whoever found this (There are a lot of entries in this journal, so I will most likely be breaking it up again, whether for the sake of me typing it, or in order to give myself a second chance to stop digging and bury this once more):\n\n…\n\n(This was the note attached to the outside of the package)\n\nForgive me for any crude and borderline illiterate mistakes as my only method of recording these events lies with this dingy old typewriter I found on a desk in these old quarters.  This note, along with my personal logbook will be hidden away in hopes one day it finds someone who knows what to do with this information. If you are reading this, then maybe you are that person, otherwise… well I don’t know how else to say it other than good luck. The pages of this book are firsthand accounts of the preceding weeks and the events that transpired… The additional typed pages I am now working on will be put in chronological order to fill gaps in those retellings.\n\nAdditionally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, there is a hard drive tucked within the contents of this package. If you are going to open it, have a plan. They will come for you. They won’t risk anyone else knowing this, and I’m already on the clock. I risked my life for that drive in ways I only wish to have to recall one last time… It is a raw download of all the files and data stored and recorded in the ships computer system. Play the audio and video files if you must, but hopefully my words are deterrent enough. They serve as nothing more than evidence, and are described in detail when applicable. I know my time is limited as they’ve surely figured out someone is missing by now. I managed to get off that ship in a stolen life raft… Made it out here to the lighthouse. On this island. Or what’s left of the island.\n\nFor what it’s worth, a bit about me: I joined the marines back in the early 2000s as a means to pay for education. After a brief stint in the military, I went on to pursue physics, eventually narrowing my field of study to quantum theory. I don’t have time to explain great detail some of the projects I’ve been a part of, but a lot of it pertains to multi-dimensional research. Fast forward to three weeks ago. I got a call from an old Captain I had on my first deployment. It was very odd to hear from him seeing as we hadn’t kept in touch, but I remembered him nonetheless. He said he found my contact information through the school directory I had been doing research at. I knew a temporary research assistant wouldn’t have a page on their directory. But before I could question it, he asked if I had time to meet that evening. It was all very odd and fast but I agreed. He cut the line immediately after, and a few hours later I was on my way to the diner we agreed upon. \n\nThere was Captain Downes, wearing a dark baseball cap tilted to cover his face, seated in a booth by the window. Before I could say anything, upon my sitting he opened his jacket and pulled out a Manila folder. He slid it towards me. SCI was stamped in bold red letters across the words on the folder: Project T.R.I.A.D. At the bottom in small text, the words “Property of United States Government” were underlined by the edge of the folder. I recalled SCI standing for “Secret Compartmentalized Information”, and is the government’s highest clearance level, although I never was privy to anything at that level during my time in the military. “I wouldn’t be doing this if it wasn’t urgent.” He interrupted. \n\nI flipped open the folder, inside was littered with old photos of a town under construction. “Back in 1915, right after World War One had just began, the government knew that the United States was far behind other nations when it came to scientific and technological breakthroughs, despite what the history books say. As a result, Wilson sent a whole lot of taxpayer dollars to fund a secret research project, hidden behind a government sanctioned paper trail. There’s not a lot about what the goal was other than to militarize some sort of breakthrough these scientists were after.” The photos were black and white, one depicting a small cul-de-sac. There were figures dressed up, but they weren’t people, they were mannequins. The Captain went on.\n\n“There was a small island off the coast of New Zealand that had been bought by the government under a bunch of fake shell corporations. It was supposed to serve as the base of operations for the experiment. Despite their best efforts to scrub it, officially the record is that it was simply a way-to-early attempt at what later became the basis for the Manhattan Project.” That’s what those photos were. It was of a bomb testing site. The cars, the mannequins, the suburban houses, all very set up to look like a superficial town living the American dream. I slid the next photo behind the other papers and began scrutinizing the next one. It was of a tall lighthouse. It seemed very out of place considering it was just sitting on the near horizon behind the manufactured cul-de-sac.\n\n“And unofficially?” I asked. Captain stiffened a bit. “There was some truth to the cover up. At first they were aiming to make some sort of weapon. There’s a few pages photocopied in there that explains more on it. I’m sure you’ll understand more than I will.” I found it. It was dated August 1, 1915 and was formatted like a report. It was outlining a lot of theory and hypothesis, along with rudimentary schematics. I only took a few classes that covered topics in nuclear physics during my studies, but from what I understood the information was about how the project was indeed for a nuclear bomb. At the time however, containing fusion and/or fission reactions was out of the question considering the given technologies. \n\nA group of scientists had theorized that they could harness enough energy from targeted and contained electromagnetic radiation as a means to initiate a detonation process. The big appeal was that it allowed for the device to be armed from safe distances, so long as the energy could be directed properly. There was a diagram that was sketched out which looked like a spotlight, only double sided, with equations and part numbers labeled all over. Captain Downes started talking again as I looked over the document.\n\n“So basically they put this device at the top of that lighthouse. The town was then built as a contained environment for testing. At first it was working great. The test records show success after success for over a year. They’d shine the beam from the ‘lighthouse’ at the explosive device, and it would activate. It was silent, and basically untraceable. The implications of what they made became vast and the scientists concluded that since the war was over, they couldn’t let this project go any further.”\n\n“So what happened next?” I asked with the curiosity of a child. “They buried it. Literally. Or at least tried.” He responded. I was confused. “There was a final test scheduled, and it failed miserably. They initiated what was called Erosion Protocol.” I pulled out a paper titled “Erosion Protocol and Procedures for Site Shrapnel.” Another post war document photocopy. In summary it said that the island was located on a fault line that ran alongside a deep ocean canyon. Before anyone stepped foot on the island, shortly after the government purchased it, high powered explosives were dug into the earth along the island, following the track of the fault line. Basically if things went awry, the plan was to detonate the explosives and sink all the evidence of this project down to the bottom of the sea. And that’s what happened.\n\n“Now the last part of the story is that the scientists actually completed the test. They planned to tamper with the device beforehand so it would seize up and fail beyond repair. Whatever they did had the reverse effect and it harnessed levels of energy beyond what they could handle and the machine started sending out bursts of energy. The bursts should have faded but instead created what the reports refer to as ‘dimensional ripples.’ So hey sunk the whole town and all the facilities on the island related to that project. The only thing left is the old standing lighthouse and a few old scattered maintenance buildings or crew quarters from way back when it was in use.”\n\n“A few weeks ago there’s a file sitting on my desk on the base when I get into work in the morning. That file.” He pointed at the folder in my hands. “Threshold Reconnaissance, Investigation, Assessment, and Dissolution. Project TRIAD. A few days ago, a private ocean research company, MaritimeX, had a vessel out near the island conducting sonar scans for seabed mapping. They were operating close to the site of the underwater canyon and they lost two submersibles. They notified the coast guard and about 48 hours later pieces of the submersibles began just floating up to the surface. They all looked to have severe heat damage and burn marks.” \n\nIn the folder were pictures of the wreckage described on the deck of a very large ship. “Their submersibles transmit footage to the servers on the ship, so they were able to live stream the dive up until they lost contact.” He slid a tablet over to me. A video was queued up. I hit play and couldn’t make out much. It was clearly dive footage. A vast blackness with particles floating across the screen as the camera descended. The footage went static briefly then cut back. The depth gauge on the display kept increasing: 9000ft, 9100ft… I fast forwarded a few seconds to where the screen began to focus. The gauge read 15,000ft. The static was cutting in and out and the video was almost unwatchable. A toppled over house came into frame, littered with debris nearby. Wedged into the cliffside was another half standing home. I gasped as a mannequin floated close to the camera, quickly in and then out of frame. In the corner of the screen a sliver of an elongated silhouette flashed by and then the camera feed cut. \n\n“They found the town? Underwater? How?” I was filled with questions. “Listen, I’ve already said far more than I should have.” Captain Downes said. “I called you because the higher ups are having me put together a group to investigate this. The research vessel is still out there. Commandeered for the past few days by the coast guard under the guise of pirate activity in the area. It’s a big ordeal, and the less you know for now the better. All you need to know is that you’ll be in charge of the Project’s research efforts, and aid in any other capacity I might need a number two for. There’s a reason I called you. The first and most important is that whatever we find, if substantial, is part of an already big cover-up, and my guess is it will continue. You’re my failsafe. If this goes south, the world needs to know about what’s going on. Next one is pretty simple. You and I had each others backs when it mattered during those life or death situations overseas.” I flinched. I try hard not to think about my first tour. \n\n“That’s a kind of trust that doesn’t break.” He said, almost reassuringly. “Plus I don’t think the paycheck is all that bad.” He typed something into his phone and I got a direct deposit notification that was well over the entire amount of my savings thus far. I wish it hadn’t at the time, but that was more than enough to convince me. \n\n…\n\nI’m going to end the post here. I was going to go into the first journal entry but after writing down everything and looking back over it… Well it’s a lot. I’ll post once our plane lands back in the United States and I’m back home. Jack and I agreed to meet later tomorrow after getting a good nights rest. It took a lot to convince him and I’m going to use the last hour of this flight to continue to do so…\n",

My bubbly younger sister and I were polar opposites; Abigail was the star of the school since the start of her freshman year while I was just an extra. Her slender figure was enough to put even models to shame. Her eyes sparkled, unblocked by bulky and cheap glasses. Her face was never cursed with a hideous acne that leaked putrid yellow puss and scarred cheeks with a cantaloupe-skin texture. We could both turn heads–I just turned them away. It was obvious which of us our parents preferred, along with the rest of the town for that matter. Every day was a challenge not to let the jealousy eclipse my outer demeanor as she won the crowd's hearts by doing her part of the cheer routine at games. The roars of applause would echo from the school stadium back to our house, violating the sanctity that my quiet little room had to offer. *Being an afterthought was hard enough. Why do I need to be reminded of it every week?* I’d always think to myself.\n\nThe only solace in my life came from the times I spent with Thomas, the only guy who looked in my direction–only ‘cause our parents grew up together. After being forced into playdates with him, he quickly went from that one kid who chowed down on his own boogers to my closest friend. His being an only child and me being a lonesome one gave us something to bond over. While not as bad-off as me, Thomas wasn’t the most popular either. Small towns like ours weren’t exactly enthused about computer nerds as much as quarterbacks, if you know what I mean. Considering his looks though, he could easily score enough points on the social ladder to get into some decent circles. The controlled chaos that was his auburn curls and the way that light bounced off his emerald pupils could be quite the distraction. Thankfully, he’s clueless about this and opts to spend his time presenting me with his findings from the peculiar depths of the internet.\n\nEven though my tech skills maxed out at Google searches and the occasional YouTube video, I was curious about the things that people from across the world had to say. We’d spend hours in his room while he presented the new haul of websites: hitmen-for-hire, paranormal sightings, and forums dedicated to downright creepy shit. Thomas always got his kicks from watching me shiver from the particularly gory stuff.\n\n“You know half of these things aren’t real, right?” He’d say, with a clear grin on his face. The computer screen proudly illuminated blurry photos of a deer-like monster feasting on bloodied remains.\n\nI winced. “Uhuh, and you’ve definitely shown me both halves, at this point. ”\n\n“Yeah, yeah. By the way, I have a real good one to show you before I gotta finish this history paper. There’s this cult that worships a lightning demon and apparently, they believe that you can communicate with it through your phone or something.”\n\n“The hell?” I said with a chuckle. “So they dial 666 and get a direct line to their lord and savior? Do they charge for long-distance, or can I call toll-free today?”\n\nJust like we normally do on the forums, Thomas and I went through and gawked at the various posts and user profiles. The whole site was decorated in low-resolution blood clipart and played some old-timey music in reverse like it hid some secret message, making it impossible for us to contain our laughter. Most sites I’d seen before were relatively boring visually-speaking, while this one looked like a cult member’s toddler was given total creative control.\n\n“Alright, alright,” Thomas struggled out after wiping away a tear. “This was fun, but I’m ready to hang up on ol’ Lightning Luci. Anything else you wanna see before I close it?”\n\n“Yeah, check out the bottom of the page. See that button that says ‘Initiation’ on it? I’m dying to know how I can get a direct line to the spooky man downstairs.”\n\n“Oh hell yeah, I’m willing to even try it out–even if it’s just to make you squirm a bit.”\n\nThomas clicked through the link, which led to a monochrome page with step-by-step instructions on summoning the devil and joining the cult. I got up to the screen and took a look.\n\nStep 1: Take the phone of the prospective member and wrap it in red silk. Secure the wrapping with a golden ribbon in the form of a snake knot. Tighten the binding to ensure the ritual is successful.\n\nStep 2: Use a salt to encircle the bound phone. The radius should be approximately one foot with the phone at the center. As long as a full circle is made, any salt should suffice.\n\nStep 3: Let three drops of human blood drip onto the surface of the phone’s binding.\n\nStep 4: Recite the phrase “imina rotuba, enimod, egrusxe” exactly three times in prayer. If the Dark Lord chooses you, then he will arise and reveal himself to you. With this, you have become wholly subjected to him.\n\n“This is a lot of BS for some cult hoax,” Thomas said with a frown. “I was gonna give it a shot before I realized I’d be doing fetch quests for silk and ribbon.”\n\n“Nah, you know that my mom probably has that stuff in her crafts kit. If you ask me, it sounds more like somebody’s chickening out. You don’t actually believe in that soul nonsense, do you?”\n\n“Nope. I’m not a little kid, I’m fifteen. I just don’t feel like cutting myself up over something I know isn’t real. If you wanna do that, be my guest.”\n\n“That’s fine by me. You act like you never got a little scrape or cut before. Besides, I can just use a thumbtack to prick instead of slicing myself open. It’s three drops, not three gallons.”\n\nThomas sighed. “Whatever, man. We can try it out tomorrow so you’ll shut up about it. Now I’ve gotta go bust my ass writing about the Meiji restoration before Mr. Harrison gets in my ear again.”\n\n“See you then, scaredy-cat.”\n\nThe next day was a Friday, so my parents didn’t mind if I stayed over at Thomas’ house a bit later than usual. His parents were heading out of town for the weekend, so I didn’t have much time to exchange pleasantries before they finished loading up into his dad’s antiquated pickup. He gave his son a thumbs-up and a wink when he thought I couldn’t see him, causing me and Thomas to recoil in disgust. After they drove off, we headed straight upstairs to his room and his computer.\n\n“You ready to do this?” Thomas asked me.\n\n“If by ‘this’ you mean watching you squirm, then yeah.”\t“Oh please. You’re the type to scream Bloody Mary at a cheesy 80s flick and I’m supposed to be the scared one?”\n\nI rolled my eyes. “Fine then. Whoever freaks out has to buy dinner for a week.”\n\n“A week? I make the same as you every week; we both know you’ll shred through my wallet like that.”\n\n“Better not cry then, Tommy-boy. Now go grab some salt while I prep my phone and figure out how many ounces of gourmet steak I can mooch off you.”\n\nAs instructed, I wrapped my phone in silk and properly knotted it with ribbon while Thomas made the salt circle on his floor. After wrapping and tying it together, it almost looked like a Christmas gift ready to be tucked under the tree. Once it was placed down in the center of the circle, I pricked myself with the thumbtack Thomas took out of his “Silence of the Lambs” poster and let the blood pool on my finger before letting it drip onto the wrapping. I knelt into a praying position and I could hear Thomas start holding his breath. After closing my eyes, I uttered the words…\n\n“Imina rotuba, enimod, egrusxe.”\n\nMy head began to feel a pulling sensation–a subconscious force trying to puppeteer my brain into backing out of it. But I wasn’t going to back down to some internet hoax, much less sponsor Thomas’ pizza addiction for a week.\n\n“Imina rotuba, enimod, egrusxe.”\n\nThe beat of my heart hastened into a drumroll, each thump crescendoing with a sudden rush of anxiety. The word “stop” rang through my ears as I took a deep breath before saying it a final time. I pursed my lips, took a deep breath, and spoke the words a final time:\n\n“Imina rotuba, enimod, egrusxe.”\n\nThe ringing in my ears suddenly stopped as a deafening silence overtook my senses. After about thirty seconds, I opened my eyes to see that nothing had changed at all. The initiation hadn’t done anything, just like we thought. I noticed Thomas trembling with his eyes still closed, so I slowly crept up to him and flicked him on the forehead.\n\n“Hey, stupid. I hope you saved up enough cash from work, cause I’ve been dying to try Wagyu.”\n\nHe stood up and shot me with a grin before flicking me back. “Oh shut up. I was just falling asleep from how boring the whole thing was.”\n\nI went to grab my phone from the ground when I sensed a stinging pain in my palm.\n\n“Shit, my hand got burnt,” I gritted.\n\n“You good?” Thomas suddenly clutched my hand and scrutinized it. His face got a bit too close, so I turned my eyes to the poster he had on his wall. The glare of a woman met mine with a familiar coldness and ambivalence towards the world. After a few seconds, Thomas released his grasp and shook his head.\n\n“It’s a little warm but your hand seems alright to me.”\n\n“Really? I swear it was practically on fire a moment ago.”\n\n“Mhm. Cellular Satan must’ve left a fiery rejection letter.” Thomas chuckled to himself. “I’m sure the Radio Reapers would love to have you, though.”\n\nI had a look at my hand, expecting a visible burn but found it unscathed. A small feeling in my heart told me that something wasn’t right, though I couldn’t express that to Thomas or anyone else without sounding like I’d lost it. We exchanged our goodbyes after cleaning up the mess from the ritual and I started to head home. *The only thing to do was go home and forget about it.* Luckily, my hangout with Thomas gave me an excuse to skip dinner, so I could just slip by my parents watching TV on the couch. Not like I needed to eat but the churning in my stomach was a complete turn-off from indulging myself with food. As I dragged myself to my room, I replayed the events of the ritual to see if I could remember why I got burnt. Nothing. I took a final glance at my phone before retiring into the turquoise curtains of my bed. While initially pervasive, the worry in my mind faded with my consciousness and eventually disappeared from my mind entirely as I fell into a deep slumber.\n\n“Awaken, my servant,” a deep, monstrous voice bellowed.\n\nI jolted awake, dazed by the words that were seemingly spoken directly into my ears. I surveyed my room for signs of disarray. It was still dark out, trees blowing with the wind as late-night critters doing their deep calls. Wanting to know what time it was, I reached for my phone and pushed the power button. As the screen illuminated, the clock read out 3:04 AM–still early enough to get some more rest. While rushing to fall back asleep before my body fully woke up, I noticed a notification with a blank icon pop up on my phone: “Hellwish: You have been inducted. Thank you for your commitment.”\n\nThe shiver from the day before had been reignited. I sat up and reread the message to see if I had made a mistake, but the notification was clear. The shakiness in my hands caused me to accidentally tap the popup, turning my entire screen a bright red. An eerie choir hymn played, accompanied by a scrolling wall of text reading out the words, “He shall rise again.” *Shit! Did a virus get on my phone or something?* I thought. Trying to close the app or use the side buttons was pointless–any input I tried yielded no response–so I chucked the phone across the room and gunned for the door. With a bright flash and a roar of thunder, a billow of smoke shot past me and enveloped the door, solidifying around it and blocking my escape. I fell to my knees in despair.\n\n“You’re an excitable one, aren’t you, Evelyn?” The same voice from before spoke.\n\nI slowly turned my head around and saw the floating creature that the voice belonged to. Its body resembled that of a dehydrated corpse, with sunken cheeks and wrinkled skin. Its pale skin was a freakish grey, well-removed from the limits of human skin tones and closer to that of clay than flesh. A volley of scales interrupted the smoothness along the sides of its face, blurring a heritage of humanoid and reptilian features. The spaces for the eye sockets were composed of an infectious darkness that you couldn’t see through, though I could still feel an intense stare coming from it. A maroon cloak covered most of the creature but I could see the split yellowed nails of the warped feet that dangled out from underneath. Chapped lips made a grotesque cracking noise as they parted,  revealing an overpowering darkness housing a forked tongue.. It spoke to me once more.\n\n“Where’s that bravado that you had before, little girl? I was eager to get a more eccentric servant to liven things up down below.”\n\n“W-What the fuck are you?” I stammered out. The churning of bile in my stomach was getting more intense as my mind realized the contract I had signed myself into.\n\n“Now, now. You should know quite well what I am, though I feel as though ‘phone devil’ is a bit lacking as a name. You may call me Absatium, instead. Now that the introductions are done, we can get into the business. You have signed your life over to me, so I have the right to call upon you to serve me in the war against the angels. Until the last of God’s soldiers have been slain, you will plunge yourself into battle in the name of your master.”\n\n“I’m sorry, I didn’t know this was real. I didn’t mean to summon you and I don’t want to die in that war.” I bumped my head against my wall, unaware that I had been crawling away from Absatium.\n\n“You will not die, though your servitude is non-negotiable. However, I can assure you that your battle will not come for a long while. My army is far emaciated from prior conflicts, so your human life will have been long played out before I can put your soul to good use. Further details of our covenant can be discussed later. For now, rest my loyal servant.”\n\nA violent gasp escaped my throat as my phone alarm rang out. I turned towards my door, relieved to see that it wasn’t charred. *It’s a new day–don’t let the before haunt your after*, I told myself. The normalcy of my Saturday morning routine before work was enough for me to nearly forget the dream I had the night before. When my dad dropped me off at the mall, all I was thinking about was getting through the day’s shift. Thomas would be in a while after me, so I’d have to be on autopilot until he got there.\n\nDealing with order after order had started to blend time into a gradient of uneventful happenings until my phone disrupted the monotony. As I began to recite the company’s cheesy pizza-themed greeting for the umpteenth time, a painfully high-pitched shriek played from my back pocket. I fumbled it out of my pants and tried to turn it down, to no avail.\n\n“Evelyn, what the hell is wrong with you?” my manager scolded as she stormed out the back. “Hurry up and turn that thing off!”\n\nI dashed into the bathroom while I tried to force reset my phone but it’d seemingly lost its ability to respond to any inputs at all. Once I had closed the door behind me, the ringing stopped and a newfound headache overcame me. My phone suddenly got hot and scorched my hands like it had at Thomas’ house. I reflexively dropped my phone onto the tile floor and ran to the sink. While I flooded my palms with cold water, another billow of smoke swirled out of my phone with a flash. The demon from my dream had emerged once more; a believer had been made out of me.\n\n“Oh Evelyn, my dear,” Absatium spoke with a hint of playfulness. “You really should check your phone more often. I’ve been trying to reach you for an eternity.”\n\n“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered out. “I’ve been a-at work and–”\n\n“It’s of no concern. What is, though, is the arrangement that we have found ourselves in.”\n\n“Please, I already told you I’m sorry for doing your ritual without taking it seriously.” I wept as tears flooded the bags under my eyes and dripped onto my uniform.\n\n“I’m sorry, Evelyn, but that doesn’t matter: you will be my servant once your natural life has concluded. Now, call me a romantic but the tears of a young woman strike my many hearts with a deep sadness. Perhaps your mind will be at ease with the fact that part of our deal includes the opportunity to satisfy your deepest desire. Your mortal life will be bestowed with unmatched euphoria, as long as you’re willing to work for it. How does that sound?”\n\nI was at a loss for words. *I’ve fucked up. Bad. How do I always manage to find a way to make my life more miserable? What can I even do now?* I contemplated. After having given it thought, I came to an answer: if I was going to spend my afterlife in servitude, then I could at least make my mortal life better.\n\n“Absatium, we have a deal.”\n\n“Excellent, Miss Evelyn.” The devil hissed with delight. “What would you like your wish to be? I’m curious as to what you’d be most interested in altering.”\n\n“I just want people to think I’m beautiful. My sister gets more affection from the whole town in a day than I do in a year and it’s only because of her looks.”\n\n“Your wish is my amusement, Evelyn.” Absatium grinned. “Consider it done.”\n\nA white flash struck in the center of my vision, blurring my sight and sending me into a stumble. Once my eyes recorrected, I saw that Absatium had disappeared; only my phone lay on the ground in his place. When I bent over to pick it up, another notification appeared on the screen: “Check your pocket.” Patting myself down revealed an object’s presence in my left pocket. I reached in and pulled out a knife, which disgusted me with its appearance. It had a darkened blade with a glowing red pattern along the edge. The handle was fleshy and purple, with a warmth that I could only pray originated from Absatium’s conjuring rather than its being alive. I almost instinctively tossed it into the trash but was stopped by another ringing sound from my phone. The screen illuminated once more: “Use it. Carve a better Evelyn that the world can love.” Somehow, I knew what the message meant. It was as though the knife and I had bonded–we both anticipated the carving. I raised the knife to my right cheek and began to slice into it. This time, there was no pain at all.\n\nThe slice wasn’t deep, so the knife quickly expunged the excess flesh from my body. I turned to face myself in the mirror and was amazed: my face was normal, including the part I had sliced off. It was as though perfectly healthy skin lay underneath and was simply waiting to be revealed. Unable to resist the urge to continue, I began another slice into the opposite side and was met with the same result.\n\n“This is it,” I said, drunk with euphoria. “I can finally be beautiful.”\n\nCut after cut, every pimple and slab of fat was butchered from my face, liberating a sense of beauty that had been suppressed my whole life. Each piece of meat smacked the floor with disgusting wetness before evaporating, leaving the bathroom an invisible slaughterhouse. I paused to take stock of my new self: a gorgeous girl met my eyes through the mirror, smiling back.\n\n“Hey, Evelyn,” the voice of my manager called through the other side of the bathroom door. “You doing okay in there?”\n\n“Yeah,” I replied. “I’ll be out in just a second.”\n\nI took one last look at myself and stared admiringly at the knife I had been gifted with. *Thank you, Absatium.*\n\nI left the bathroom to be greeted by the manager standing in the doorway with a concerned look on her face.\n\n“Hey, um… I’m sorry about what I said earlier,” she said nervously while staring at the ground. “I came to go check on you since you’d been in there a while and heard you crying. That ringing noise was just getting on my nerves when I was already having a rough morning, but it doesn’t excuse how I treated you. Please forgive me.”\n\n“Don’t worry about it, please. My day wasn’t the best either so far but I saw a new side of myself that I can smile about. Everything is fine now.”\n\nI walked up to her and hugged her. Something like that was insignificant compared to the blessing that Absatium had given me. At the end of the embrace, she met my eyes for the first time and had a look of shock. *Oh no*.\n\n“Is something wrong?” I asked nervously.\n\nShe grinned. “No, Evelyn. I guess I just never realized how beautiful you are.”\n\nMy shift flew by so quickly that I didn’t realize it was time to clock out until my dad called me to check in. Everyone I served seemed happy to see me, with some boys from school struggling to even maintain eye contact. *Was this what it was like for Abigail every day? I could get used to this.* Even Dad was more interested in hearing about my day than the sports station on the radio like he usually was.\n\nIt wasn’t until I got home that I realized that Thomas never came in. Scrolling through my notification history, I realized that he had texted the work group chat calling out sick right before he was supposed to come in. *Weird. Thomas isn’t the type to play hooky but he did seem fine last night.* Before my mom finished dinner, I decided to make a quick run across the street to check in on him. I noticed his room light was off, so I rang the doorbell. After a few seconds of silence, the corner of my eye caught his curtains darting back and forth. With a smirk on my face, I texted him.\n\n“Hey Tommy, you know I’m not blind? I saw you peeking at me.”\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, he replied. “Yeah, sorry. Not feeling good, so I didn’t come to work. You need something?”\n\n“I was just checking on you since you’d normally be spamming me with paragraphs on the weirdo site of the day. Promise you’re okay?”\n\n“Promise. Just need some R&R.”\n\n“You’re good. Rest up we can hang out later, you dork.”\n\nI started to head back as my mother had texted me that dinner was ready. For the first time in a while, I was excited to eat.\n\n“Abigail,” I said with a smirk. “How was cheerleader practice?”\n\nMy sister had had an awfully glum look on her face since she came home, so I knew that something had gone wrong in her perfect, little world.\n\n“Not good,” she replied glumly while stirring her fork in her mashed potatoes. “I overheard that Coach isn’t allowed to recommend more than three students for competitive cheer and she’s only been paying attention to upperclassmen. I’m worried that I’m gonna be overlooked.” She glanced at my face and froze before quickly darting her eyes back to her plate.\n\n“That’s awful, honey,” Dad said with a concern that he could only reserve for his Abigail.\n\n“It is. Maybe there’s a way you could ask one of the older girls to put in a good word,” Mom suggested.\n\n“Yeah, yeah. But guys, I got my essay back for English and I’m the only one who made over a 95!”\n\nMy parents were beaming with pride as if they had immediately forgotten about Abigail. The frown on her face gave me a rush of satisfaction–she’d finally gotten a taste of what my life had been for years and I got to be the favorite child.\n\nI went to bed that night feeling the happiest I’d been in a while. Before today, I could only dream of being looked at like this; now it’s become my reality. I laid the knife on my bedside table and fell asleep with a newfound inner peace.\n\nA loud vibration from my phone disturbed me from my sleep. In a drowsy daze, I checked my phone and sank my teeth into my lip after reading the contents of the screen. A flurry of messages from Hellwish had appeared, each piercing my heart with anguish.\n\n“You stupid bitch. You think you’re good enough cause you lost some weight and got clear skin? Think again, sis.”\n\n“She got rid of the baby fat but not the lady fat. Even if you carve up a pig’s face you still got the body to deal with. Disgusting.”\n\nPlumes of smoke drifted across my window and blocked the moonlight, casting the room into an unnatural darkness. A fire danced brightly at the foot of my bed, illuminating its surroundings with a crimson hue. Within the flames, I could see myself as a child at school. I was being encircled by my classmates and teased for my weight. Echoes of their laughter all but drowned out the soft weeping of the helpless little girl they’d trapped; the sight choked me with a ferocity stronger than that of the smoke. My classmates looked away from their target and turned towards the view of the flames, changing their target to their observer. Their monstrous cackling swelled into a twisted chorus of insults.\n\n*No, this can’t be real! I fixed myself already. Is it not enough?* I woke up in a cold sweat and practically jumped out of bed. Quickly grabbing the knife, my heart pounded as I lifted my nightgown. I plunged the blade into my stomach and hacked off chunks of flesh without the precision or care that I had taken on my face. As each slab of meat thudded onto the floor, the knife grew warmer in my hand and began to throb excitedly.\n\n“I will be beautiful,” I murmured to myself, over and over. “I must be beautiful.”\n\nThe morning song of a raven awakened me the next morning. Not having work today meant that I could spend some time with Thomas to make up for not seeing him yesterday. Abigail was being driven to the doctor for a nasty migraine, so I snuck into her room and cycled through her wardrobe. After fixing myself last night, I was able to fit the smaller clothes with ease. While settling on a crimson crop top and jean shorts before heading out, the thought of Thomas’ reaction to my new body made me blush. *He never told me what his type was, but surely this couldn’t be far off.*\n\nAs I made my way across the street, dread positioned itself in the forefront of my mind. It was beyond the usual nervousness of seeing Thomas and I couldn’t decipher why. I made my best effort to swallow the anxiety once I arrived on his doorstep. Ringing the doorbell yielded no response, so I tried calling his phone to see if he was up. I frowned, hearing the robotic voicemail response in place of a reply. Like Thomas had done many times after locking himself out before his parents got home, I fished out the spare key from the pot of ivory orchids on the side of the walkway. I let myself in and made sure to announce my presence to distinguish myself from an intruder.\n\n“Tommy! I’m here! You better stop leaving your phone off or someone’s gonna get worried!”\n\nNo answer. *Either he’s sleeping like a rock, or he’s just being a jerk and ignoring me.* I walked upstairs and down the hall towards his bedroom door. It was cracked open a bit, so I averted my eyes and gave him another warning.\n\n“If I walk in on you doing anything weird, I’m going to strangle you.”\n\n“Evelyn,” a weak voice whispered from within. “Help me, Evelyn.”\n\nI burst into the room to find Thomas in his bed, fighting something in his sleep. His covers were a mess, sprawled out and hanging off the bed.\n\n“Thomas, wake up! I’m here!”\n\nHis body suddenly went limp. Slowly, his eyes began to open up, which made me breathe a sigh of relief.\n\n“Evelyn?” he said as he began to turn his head towards me.\n\n“Hey Tommy, I just wanted to check in on y–”\n\n“Oh my God, what the fuck happened to you!? Why do you look like that?” He said as he sprung out of bed.\n\nMy heart shattered into a million little pieces, each shard cutting me deeper than a blade could ever hope to. I ran out of his room, fighting back the welling in my eyes. Carelessly, I bumped into the doorframe and tumbled down the stairs. Bruised by the fall, I burst out of Thomas’ house and retreated to my room in anguish. My phone buzzed with more notifications from Hellwish, much like the ones I had seen in my dream.\n\n“Dolling yourself up for him didn’t go as planned, did it?”\n\n“A sluttily-dressed pig is still a pig. No boy would go for that.”\n\nThe rejection Thomas had given me echoed amongst the voices. “Why do you look like that,” played endlessly as I reached for the knife Absatium had gifted me and forced it into my chest. My heart bled. I collapsed back onto my bed, darkness predating on my consciousness. It would be a  familiar smoky smell that woke me back up, the signature mark of the demon who was now at the foot of my bed.\n\n“Absatium,” I weakly stammered out. “Why did you betray me? I told you that I wanted people to think I was beautiful.”\n\n“He didn’t,” a certain someone spoke.\n\n“Thomas?!” I gasped.\n\nAbsatium chuckled, “I gave you everything you wanted, my dear.”\n\nThomas shot him a cruel look before turning toward me. “Evelyn, you’ve always been beautiful to me. What happened at my house wasn’t what you think.”\n\n“Yes, yes.” Absatium bellowed. “I tried to corrupt his mind to force him to see the same delusions as the rest of you but loverboy truly prefers you as-is.”\n\nA bittersweet wave rushed over me. *I should’ve known, shouldn’t I? That dork has always been there for me, even when my parents weren’t.* I tried to raise my hand to Thomas’ face but the strength left in me was too little.\n\n“Tommy…” I softly spoke.\n\n“Don’t move. Your wounds are already bad enough. I just wanted to speak with you for a moment so that we could say goodbye.”\n\nLightheadedness stalled my reaction to the feeble state I’d found myself in. “I’m dying aren’t I…”\n\n“You are. Absatium fooled you with the knife and made you feed his power. Without you giving your flesh, he wouldn’t be able to strengthen his influence in our world. Look at what that monster did to you.”\n\nThomas sorrowfully handed me a mirror, which stung me with deep remorse as it reflected my decaying body. Everywhere I had sliced and gashed was an open, fleshy wound. The tissue that was supposed to be encased within my skin was now hanging out of my cheeks freely, with a stream of dried blood running down my neck from where I had lobbed off my chin fat. Turning the mirror downward to my stomach revealed similar wounds, with maggots squirming around the decaying meat that composed me. The smell of my perfume had suddenly dissipated and was eclipsed by the stench of necrosis. I was hideous–actually hideous–and I had done it all to myself. My heart sank seeing Thomas’ face. His eyelids were shut, but small teardrops managed to escape from underneath. *All his pain was caused by me and I’m powerless to stop it.*\n\n“It’s okay, Tommy,” I said with a shaky smile. “I’m really happy that I can die knowing you loved me, too. Thank you.”\n\n“No, that’s not what I meant when I said we had to say goodbye. I’ve arranged a deal with Absatium that will save you.”\n\n“It’s truly romantic, isn’t it?” Absatium spoke with a devilish smile.\n\n“Please Absatium, don’t!” I managed to choke out.\n\n“Everything will be okay, I promise,” Thomas whispered to me. “You mean the world to me, so losing you would mean losing the reason to go on.”\n\nThe determination in his eyes told me that there was no convincing him. Thomas leaned in close and embraced me as our lips met, giving us our first and final moments of intimacy. While it was short, the blossoming feeling in my heart left a warmness that could carry on forever. Thomas held my hand for the last time as we gave each other a tearful smile. His hand was burning hot, radiating with a heat that had once permeated through my own.\n\n“I’m ready to serve you now, my liege,” Thomas said to the demon.\n\n“Excellent. I’m truly grateful for your commitment. Let us now embark.”\n\nA meager cry of despair was the only form of protest I could make with my mutilated body refusing to move. Absatium let out a haunting laugh as he conjured a swirling inferno that took the form of a tunnel. The location on the other end, though invisible to me, was discernible from the ghostly wails of the damned. Both Thomas and Absatium began to enter the tunnel, with my love turning back to face me as the opening dissipated. He spoke to me for the last time: “Cherish yourself, for the both of us.” Absatium’s deep cackle echoed around me as the tunnel closed. A spell of cloudiness swirled around in my mind, sending me into a daze as the familiar call of sleep beckoned me into the darkness once more.\n\n“Please, Evelyn. Come back to us,” sobbed a muffled voice.\n\nOpening my eyes revealed the mundane beige of a hospital room, alongside my sister face-down at my bedside. The dryness of my throat triggered a cough as I muttered, “I’m here. It’s okay now.”\n\nShe looked up with weary eyes in disbelief. Once the initial shock had disappeared, she quickly got up to hug me.\n\n“We thought you’d never come back to us. Things were looking dire but I kept praying for you to pull through.”\n\n“Abby, what happened to me?” I asked, still dazed and trying to recollect my senses.\n\n“You weren’t responding when we tried to wake you up for dinner and rushed you here. The doctors said that they’d never seen a case like yours, an acute coma without signs of injury.”\n\nA horrible churn in my stomach emerged when I put together the reality that I found myself in. Despite being painfully aware of the answer I’d get, I asked, “Has Thomas come to see me?”\n\n“Evelyn…” Abigail’s eyes darted towards the wall opposite my bed. “Thomas has been missing since the day you went into a coma. The police only found a note written to his parents apologizing for having to leave but no other leads have turned up. It’s been a month and the case is on the verge of being dropped.”\n\n“Oh God, you’re not serious,” I exclaimed with feigned ignorance.\n\nAbigail frowned as she reached out to hold my hand. Her gentle touch made me question why I ever wanted to hurt her in the first place.\n\n“Abby, about the last dinner we had together… I’m sorry. I was being a huge jerk to you.”\n\nShe smiled. “It’s alright. I was out of it that night anyway so I can’t remember what actually happened too well. Got so bad that I was starting to see things, so whatever you did probably went over my head.”\n\n“For sure.”\n\nThe two of us hugged for the first time in what felt like forever. No matter what happened between us and our parents or school, she’d still be my sister. Absatium had maimed my heart but he couldn’t stop me from loving again. Things won’t be easy without Thomas but I’d be able to get through it with Abby on my side.\n\nI turned to my little sister and smiled. “Abigail, thank you for cherishing me.”\n\nEver since leaving the hospital, I’ve been writing this confession despite knowing that it will seldom be believed. Regardless, it’s better that the truth is out there for those who might fall down the same path. Not everyone has a Thomas, but they do have a heart. Use it to love yourself in place of those who won’t, and for those who can no longer.",

        "content": "It was 2:49 AM when my phone started vibrating on the nightstand. Half-asleep, I reached for it, and my fingers blindly fumbling in the dark. But as soon as I saw the caller ID, my breath hitched.\n\nIt was my wife.\n\nMy hand trembled. My mind raced. This couldn’t be happening. She had been dead for a week. I buried her myself—I saw the coffin lower into the ground. My chest tightened as cold sweat gathered at the nape of my neck.\n\nMaybe someone else had her phone? But that didn’t make sense. Her phone was in my drawer. I had put it there after the funeral. Slowly, I turned my head toward the dresser. The drawer was still shut.\n\nThe call ended.\n\nI sat there, heart hammering against my ribs, trying to convince myself it was just some sick joke or a glitch. Then, I heard it—\n\nDrip.\n\nA single drop of water echoed from the bathroom.\n\nDrip. Drip.\n\nBut wait, I fixed that tap this morning. There was no way it could be leaking again. My stomach twisted. I turned my head slowly, staring at the darkened bathroom doorway. The silence pressed down on me like a weight.\n\nThen my phone rang again.\n\nThis time, it was a FaceTime call.\n\nNo name. No number. Just a blank screen.\n\nI hesitated but reached for the phone, my fingers hovering over the screen. But before I could answer, something caught my eye—the framed picture of me and my wife on my bedside table.\n\nIt was gone.\n\nThe call ended.\n\nA cold, suffocating dread filled the room. Every hair on my body stood on end. I gripped the sheets, my breath shallow, my mind screaming at me to run. But before I could even move, my gaze drifted to the corner of the room.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw a shadow at the corner of the room near the bathroom gate Oh dang i saw her.\n\nA shadowed figure, crouched in the darkness, her ethereal shoulders trembling. Her face was buried into the wall, long, damp strands of hair sticking to her ghostly skin.\n\nShe was weeping, the sound of her muffled weeping crawled and slithered.\n\nThe sound slithered into my ears, each muffled sob a dagger slicing through the silence. My chest tightened. My breath hitched.\n\nMy legs? I couldn’t move.\n\nA paralyzing cold spread from my feet, creeping up my spine like fingers of ice. My muscles locked. My mind screamed, but my body was a prisoner to something greater—something I was seeing but can't believe. This wasn’t fear anymore.\n\nThis was pure, unfiltered dread.\n\nAnd then, something changed.\n\nThe air in the room became thick. The shadow seemed to be deepened, stretching unnaturally across the walls. A strange pressure built in my ears, like I was sinking underwater. The light from my phone screen flickered, casting an erratic glow across the room. My breath came in short, panicked gasps.\n\nThen, her sobbing stopped.\n\nSilence. Absolute and unnatural.\n\nMy ears rang from the sudden absence of sound. My heart pounded in my chest like a war drum. The figure in the corner remained still, unmoving, as if frozen in time. But something was wrong.\n\nThe shadows around her shifted. Twisted. They pulsed like something was breathing within them.\n\nAnd then—\n\nA soft scraping noise. A slow, deliberate dragging sound, like nails running down the wooden floor. It was coming from behind me.\n\nI didn’t dare turn around. Every instinct screamed at me to move, to flee, to escape whatever had crept into my room. My body was locked in place, but my mind was spiraling into panic. My vision blurred, spots dancing at the edges of my sight.\n\nThen, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.\n\nThe mirror on the dresser. It reflected the corner where she sat. But in the mirror—she wasn’t crouched. She wasn’t weeping.\n\nShe was standing.\n\nAnd she was staring right at me.\n\nThat was it. The final crack in my already fractured sanity. A strangled gasp escaped my lips as I lunged out of bed, stumbling towards the door. My limbs felt heavy, as if something unseen was clawing at me, trying to hold me back.\n\nThe door. Just reach the door.\n\nMy fingers grazed the doorknob, slick with sweat. I yanked at it desperately, but it wouldn’t budge. The air behind me turned icy. My breath came out in ragged, frantic bursts.\n\nThen, the lights flickered.\n\nAnd the last thing I heard before everything went black—\n\nWas a whisper.\n\nA voice I knew too well, right against my ear.\n\n\"Why did you leave me?\"\n\n",

        "content": "Nichole sliced into the back of my neck with precision. She made quick work of the surgery, but the pain was blinding. I willed my body to stay rigid, only allowing my hands to grip a wad of the sheet beneath me. My fists balled around the fabric so tightly that even with the barrier, my fingernails pressed through and dug into the skin of my palms. I was sweating as if I had been doing sprints. Nichole made no sound other than her steady, even breathing and one hand pressed on my neck, the other cutting into it. I thought I would black out from the searing agony, but before I could she pulled out the small pill-like device, tossed it on the bed in front of my face.\n“I’m going to stitch this up and then we have to move. Can you handle that?” she asked, a brisk clip to her voice. I started to nod, and she grabbed my head. “You still can’t move, Liz.”\n\nI said, “Yes. Sorry. Yes, I can handle it. I’m ok.”\nI felt the burn and pulling of the needle sewing the wound she had made. It was unpleasant but bearable. Then there was a crinkle of paper, a ripping sound and she placed a bandage over the whole thing. Then a quick beeping started to go off from somewhere deep inside her bag. Her head snapped toward the sound. “That’s them. They know it’s out. We have to go. NOW!” She jumped from the bed, launching herself toward the door to looked through the peephole. She rushed back to me as I was carefully maneuvering myself back into a sitting position on the bed. She snatched my hand and heaved me onto my feet. She threw everything back into her bag, zipped it, and went to open the door. “When I open the door, no matter what is out there, if anything, do not stop. Go to your left, down the stairs at the end, all the way to the ground floor. From there make a right. You will see a maroon minivan. Go to the passenger side and open the door. Get in. Do not look back. Do not ask questions.” Her words came at me like rapid fire. It was difficult to keep track of her words, but I understood.\n\nShe opened the door. Nothing greeted us but the sunlight and musty smell of the building. I walked out in front of her, followed her directions. When I made it down the steps, I heard a man’s voice shout from somewhere above me. Nichole was right behind me and shoved me in the back, urging me to keep moving forward. I saw the minivan, ran to the passenger side, yanked open the sliding door and hopped in the seat. Nichole got in the passenger seat, which confused me until I saw a man sitting in the driver’s seat, hands wrapped around the steering wheel and a stricken look on his young face. He could not have been more than 20 years old. I started to ask who the hell this kid was when both doors closed and Nichole shouted at the boy, “GO!”\n\nThe minivan did not look like much, but it tore out of that parking lot like it was in the Indie 500. I could not see out of the back windows since they had all been covered. I could only see the road stretching out ahead of us. Buildings, stores, houses, trees, and fields emerged on the horizon on either side and disappeared as we passed. We barreled down the road for over an hour before any of us could find the courage to speak. The driver glanced over to Nichole, then, using the rear-view mirror, at me, then dutifully back to the road. “Do you think we put enough distance between us now, Nikki?” he asked with a voice just as childlike as his face. You could see he was stressed almost to his breaking point. Nichole responded without looking at him. She simply said, “No.” The two in front must have known where they were going because there was no GPS in sight, and no one was giving or asking for directions. Left turn down a side road, right turn by an old barn. We spent hours moving through back streets and emerging back onto highways, then back off again. No one turned on the radio. No one spoke after Nichole’s reply. The engine, the passing cars, and the tires on the road were all I could hear. I sat, stiff, in the seat, my stomach doing backflips and my heart drumming in my chest. Each time I felt the adrenaline wane even slightly, Nichole would look out the window, or there would be a siren, a car honking, and it would spike, redoubling my anxious state. The sun set and then rose again and still we drove.\n\nAt some point, my body must have given out. I woke up abruptly – having no memory of falling asleep or even getting tired. The slow crunch of gravel was like an alarm. I reached to rub my sore neck, forgetting about the stitches. As the pressure of my hand fell upon it, I winced and pulled my hand away quickly. Blood had soaked through the bandage. I wiped my hand clean with the hem of my shirt.\n\nThe sky was smoldering behind the orange glow of the sun just visible on the horizon. There were green rolling hills in the distance, and a small and abandoned looking house just ahead. The faded blue paint on its exterior was cracked and peeling. The white front porch spanned the width of the house’s front, the front steps in alignment with the front door. The yard was lush and overgrown. A patch of sunflowers was collapsing in upon itself to the right of the porch. Irises and daffodils were dotted throughout the yard. The whole place felt lonely yet friendly, like a childhood home that sat waiting for you to come back to it. The boy put the minivan in park. His hands were shaking badly as he dried the sweat from his palms onto the legs of his jeans. We both looked to Nichole for some sign of direction. She was still for another minute or so, listening, waiting, watching. Then she took a deep breath and opened the car door. She motioned for the boy to do the same but told me to wait. They walked to the front door of the house. Nichole took out a key, unlocked the door, and walked inside, closely followed by the boy.\n\nThey were inside for a few minutes while I waited on pins and needles to know our next move. I was an exposed nerve, growing more restless and fretful as I watched the open doorway until Nichole came back out. She stood on the top porch step and waved for me to join her. My legs ached as I got out of the van and walked awkwardly inside the house. She did not wait for me. She disappeared into one of the rooms as I entered. The boy was nowhere in sight. They both must have felt safe enough here to leave me unattended. I felt exposed. The front door was still hanging wide open, so I closed it and turned the lock, hearing the moderately comforting click of the bolt securing into place.\n\nI wandered around the house giving myself the tour no one else felt was necessary. It was fully furnished. I expected it to look as forsaken on the inside as it did on the outside, but it wasn’t. The living room was warm and bright. There was a soft, plush gray couch along one wall, a scratched yet spotless coffee table in front of it. There were pictures hung on the walls, a bookshelf in the corner, and a coat rack near the front door.\n\nNothing was dusty. It smelled clean and fresh. The next room was a kitchen, just as immaculate as the living room. A hall opened to the left and there were two doors on the left and one on the right. On the far-right wall of the kitchen was another door. It opened onto a set of stairs leading down into a finished basement that someone had converted into a mother-in-law suite, complete with kitchenette and bathroom. I walked back upstairs, feeling queasy. It could have been nerves, hunger, or the imperceptible strangeness of this place.\n\nAll of the furniture looked to have been pulled straight from the early 1990s. Some walls were adorned with faded and out-of-style floral wallpaper, others had wood paneling. It was as if walking through the entry of that house sent you back in time. While the exterior aged with the world beyond, the inside stood as a perfectly preserved monument. It was cozy, even charming, but the contrast of its exterior made me ill at ease.\n \nWhere am I?  \n\nI was eager for more information, but I had yet to press for any. We had been quiet for so long, it felt as if talking would be unlucky somehow.\nI had gotten so used to the quiet, that the sound of the front door felt like a cannon blast in my ears. I held my breath as I rushed back down the hall, searching for Nichole. She materialized from the dark end of the hall, held a finger to her lips, and whispered, “The chimera found us.”\n\n",

        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "I should have known something was off the moment I downloaded an app specializing in underground food pop-ups. It was just another weak attempt by me to fit in with the young millennials at work. But this was the perfect chance to get Vanessa to go on a date with me.\n\nAfter I downloaded the app, it required a full profile setup before I could even browse. Not uncommon, I thought. But then the questions started getting... weird.\n\n\"What is your average daily microplastic intake?\"\"Do you prefer your meat lean or marbled?\"\"How often do you moisturize? Would you consider your skin more oily, dry, or fibrous?\"\"Are you currently taking any antibiotics, chemotherapy, or radioactive treatments?\"\"On a scale of 1 to 10, how ethically raised were you as a child?\"\"Do you sleep on your side, back, or stomach?\"\"How often do you experience existential dread?\"\"How tender do you feel today?\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, then laughed it off. Probably some edgy branding gimmick. I answered truthfully, but also maybe subconsciously picked the ones that made me sound more refined. Like I knew what I was doing, but I had no clue. Frankly, I could care less about this shit—I just wanted to appeal to Vanessa’s tastes.\n\nAt the end of the quiz, the app congratulated me for being an ideal candidate. My exclusive invite had been unlocked. One destination lit up:\n\n**Sublime Bites.**\n\nThe enigmatic \"Sublime Bites\" was shrouded in an aura of mystery. It lacked a physical address we wouldn’t receive until hours before our reservation. It had no online reviews to speak of and operated solely on an invitation-only basis. Its only claim was the tantalizing promise of an \"unforgettable, underground dining experience.\"\n\nAs a programmer, my world revolved around logic and reason; skepticism should have been my default response. However, my personal life wasn't as neatly organized as my code. I should’ve been skeptical about their tagline, \"We serve our guests like no other,\" but as a single man with a pronounced aversion to social interaction, I found myself in a situation that defied logic. I was attempting to impress a woman who was, by all accounts, far beyond my reach. Desperation had a way of overriding reason, and in my anxiety, I had cast logic aside.\n\nSo there I was, on a gloomy Friday night in Utica, New York. It would be too kind to call this city the armpit of the state. Once a vibrant hub of activity and promise, it now wore a mask of despair and abandonment. As I navigated through the urban decay, a chilling scene unfolded before us. A group of gaunt figures, high fentanyl, crack, meth or all of the above, their eyes hollow and their bodies ravaged by addiction, lined the sidewalk. Their attention was riveted on a pathetic spectacle: two men, their faces flushed with anger and their bodies bloated from years of neglect, engaged in a clumsy brawl. Their clothes, oversized and ill-fitting, seemed to mock their faded dignity as they bopped around like chickens pecking at each other. As the fight escalated, a hat flew up in the air and one of the men's pants, already precariously low, slid completely off, exposing his pale and flabby ass cheeks to the indifferent world.\n\nTurning a corner, we thankfully avoided his full moon's unwanted glare, but the bleak reality of our surroundings followed us. Our destination, I suspected, was yet another symbol of the city's gentrification: a trendy pop-up shop, no doubt housed in a repurposed factory building. It would be an oasis of overpriced farm-to-table horse shit and artisanal goods, decorated in my generation’s millennial sorry, not sorry aesthetic while oblivious to the sea of poverty and despair that surrounded it. The contrast between the city's past and its present was stark and painful. The vibrant metropolis had been replaced by a hollow shell, its soul devoured by the relentless forces of neglect and decay.\n\nI was right. Kind of.\n\nWe parked in a graffiti-laden lot between two towering brick walls of a factory. The remnants of an old fire left black scars along the busted windows, making the building look like a skull peering at me as I got out of the car. Vanessa, who grew up not too far from here, said this sad-looking monstrosity wasn’t a factory but \"Charlestown,\" a once-bustling shopping center in the 1960s.\n\nThe parking lot, a haphazard canvas of graffiti, was hemmed in by the imposing brick walls of the factory. It was an ugly place ripe with industrial decay and smelled of dead dreams of forgotten times. The skeletal remains of the building, its windows shattered and its facade blackened by the ravages of a past fire, loomed ominously over us, giving the impression of a macabre skull leering down at me as I stepped out of the car.\n\nVanessa, who had spent her formative years in the vicinity, offered some context, explaining that this melancholic ruin wasn't always an industrial eyesore. In the 1960s, it had been a bustling hub of activity known as \"Charlestown,\" a popular shopping center that had pulsed with life and energy. Condemned, the building met an unceremonious death in the late 90’s as the contrast between its past vibrancy and its current state of dilapidation was stark and unsettling.\n\nAs we exited the car, three tiny quadcopters buzzed down from above. Drones. They hovered around us, each with blinking red lenses that zoomed in and out on our faces. Vanessa laughed. \"Oh my God, how cute, they're scanning us. This place is so high-tech.\" \n\n“Maybe they’ll offer us some craft beer,” I chuckled nervously as my anxiety heightened. The last thing I wanted were drones all up in my face reminding me why I hate people who try too hard so much. This was more unneeded but Vanessa seemed to like it so I just played it off.\n\nThe drones followed us the entire walk to the alley. They made a faint whirring sound that seemed to harmonize with each other, like some eerie insect choir. Occasionally, one would hover closer to me than her. The lens would dilate, blink, then buzz away like a curious bee. I had to restrain myself from squashing the little sonofabitch.\n\nAt the door, I stopped, checking into the app, letting them know we had arrived. Seconds later we followed the newly delivered instructions to our reservation. I guided Vanessa through a graffiti-covered alley, past an unmarked door with a glowing keypad. I entered the access code from the app, and the door slid open with an unsettling whoosh. The drones zipped inside ahead of us.\n\nThe restaurant was elegant. Almost too elegant for this shitty building. We checked in at an automated hostess counter and sat down in the waiting area to be called. It felt more like a hospital waiting room than a restaurant, and that should have roused my suspicions. But again, I just went along with it all.\n\nThe door hissed open, and a sterile, robotic voice from our automated hostess welcomed us in and sent us to table nine.\n\nThe other patrons, dressed in expensive clothes, were already seated at candlelit tables. It was strange, to say the least. It smelled, felt, and looked like an old-school Italian restaurant. But upon further inspection, little details were off. Plates and dinnerware were malformed. No tablecloth matched or fit the tables. It couldn’t help but think this place was what A.I. might imagine a restaurant to look like.\n\nA waiter, eerily smooth in his movements, guided us to our table. His smile was… off. Not uncanny valley off. Worse. Too human. Perfect teeth, perfect posture—like a stock photo of a person brought to life. His voice made me laugh out loud and Vanessa asked me what was so funny. I told her the waiter’s voice reminded me of JP from Grandma’s Boy. “Adios turd nuggets,” I said in his mocked robotic voice. My joke fell flat because she had never seen the movie so I slid back into my chair and my eye twitched with anxiety. I hoped she didn’t notice.\n\nVanessa giggled. \"I love secret spots like this. So exclusive. How did you even find this place?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know,\" I said, sweating. \"Hacker stuff.\"\n\nShe laughed,”Hacker stuff? What kind of stuff do you hack?”\n\nI stammered about, tripping over my tongue. “Umm you know, I don’t really do this stuff anymore, but we used to hack lots of things in college. One time I hacked into our grading system and gave all of my friends straight A’s and then I set it up so this jock dick, named Derek, took the fall. It was a brilliant execution--”\n\nI stopped when I could see she was repulsed. Luckily the waiter dropped a glass behind us that shattered loudly and startled her, changing the subject quickly.\n\nHanding me a menu, she said, “Let’s check out the menu, I can’t wait to see what’s for dinner. I’m so hungry. All I ate was an apple today.” \n\nI smiled nervously and a droplet of sweat rolled off my forehead and onto the menu. I wiped off abruptly and stared at the bizarrely designed menu. It was blurry in areas and the colors didn’t match at all. My OCD for organization and legibility was on fire as I tried to digest the even stranger offerings—items like \"Prime Selection Special\" and \"Farm-to-Table Tartare.\" No descriptions. No prices. Just ominous italics. Before I could process, the waiter reappeared.\n\n\"The house recommends the tasting menu,\" he said, his head tilting just a bit too far. \"A little bit of everything.\" I smiled at him and chuckled again, unable to get JP’s voice out of my head.\n\nI looked at Vanessa who nodded in approval to his suggestion then turned to the waiter and said, “Okay, let’s do it.” \n\nHe smiled creepily and nodded his head. I could have sworn I saw one of his eyes rotate and twitch as he turned away and walked away like he had a giant pole stuck in his ass. \n\nI glanced around. Other tables were eating. The food looked… normal. Steaks, pasta, salads. But something gnawed at me, something I couldn't quite—\n\nThen, the lights dimmed further. A hush fell across the dining room.\n\nA spotlight hit the center of the room where a man was being ushered forward by two waiters in tuxedos. \"For your amusement,\" one of them announced, \"the House presents: a demonstration of transformation.\"\n\nA magician in a long, dark robe and unnervingly wide-brimmed hat stepped forward.\n\n“Hello boys and girls, I am Optimum the Great, a magician for human pleasure!”\n\nHis soulless face was caked in theatrical makeup, his eyes painted in exaggerated spirals. He pulled out a deck of cards, a wand, and a small meat cleaver. Tall and intimidating, he was terrifying.\n\n\"May I borrow your hand?\" he asked the man, who laughed nervously and offered it.\n\nThe magician tapped it with the wand, muttered something in static like gibberish, and produced a live pigeon. The crowd clapped. The man laughed in relief—until the magician pulled out the cleaver again.\n\nWith a wink, he brought it down hard on the man’s hand.\n\nThere was a sickening *crack.* The man screamed, blood spurting onto the white tablecloth.\n\nThen the waiters closed in. As the man dropped to his knees. I assume it was his wife who got up and came to his side. \n\nThe man didn’t get a second act. The waiters’ arms elongated with surgical precision, metallic fingers splitting into grotesque cutlery—knives where knuckles should be, forks sprouting from fingertips.\n\nOne stabbed deep into his gut, twisting. Another scooped something gelatinous from his mouth, shoving it into a bowl. Blood spattered their uniforms. His wife fainted and I watched the waiters closely as they whisked her away into the kitchen.\n\nThen, they plated him.\n\nOne folded a napkin across his spasming chest. Another poured a rich, velvety sauce over his exposed ribs. The head waiter dabbed his mouth with a napkin before slicing into a still-twitching thigh like a Michelin-starred chef unveiling the main course.\n\nThe room erupted in applause.\n\nJust then, a child across the room screamed. She was yanked from her chair by another waiter, her legs kicking in the air as she was dragged into the back. Her mother stood frozen, staring at her plate like nothing had happened.\n\nMy sweat turned cold.\n\nI looked around. Everyone kept eating.\n\n\"Wow, that was incredible. It looks so real,\" Vanessa said.\n\n\"Umm, yeah. It does... and maybe it *is,*\" I muttered.\n\nThat’s when I noticed him. A hulking man in a metallic shirt, tucked in the corner in a haze of moody lighting. Something was wrong with his posture, his stillness. As I stared, he looked up and caught my gaze.\n\nHis eyes blazed yellow—not glowing, not reflecting. *Burning.*\n\nHe reached down, lifted something to his mouth.\n\nIt was a human foot.\n\nHe gnawed through the ankle bone like it was a chicken wing.\n\nHe saw me watching. He smiled. A single metal tooth glinted in the candlelight. As he sat upright, I could now see this wasn’t a man, but some sort of machine. \n\nThat’s when I realized, with mounting horror, that they weren’t guests. They were androids. All of them. Dining alongside their human entrees, using forks and knives like we did, mirroring the ritual of fine dining.\n\n\"We have to get out of here,\" I whispered.\n\nVanessa turned. Her smile vanished.\n\nThe android in the corner stood.\n\nThen a waiter, its metallic face spattered with blood, turned to us.\n\n\"Sir, madam—your meal is on its way.\"\n\nVanessa screamed. I ran. She followed me.\n\nStraight to the bathroom.\n\nNot the exit. Not the kitchen. *The bathroom.*\n\n\"Are you serious?!\" Vanessa shrieked.\n\nI looked around, grasping at anything to come up with a plan, \"Umm…I can hack the window!\" I panted. \"The toilet, this is where I do my best hacking!\"\n\nShe looked at me in disgust as the door clicked and locked behind us.\n\nI pulled out my phone. The restaurant's ventilation and automation system was weakly encrypted, likely built on a cobbled-together API using outdated IoT components. I brute-forced the admin panel through a custom port-scan script I wrote in college, then backdoored into the local device array using SSH tunneling.\n\nWithin seconds, I accessed the bathroom module.\n\nI forced a manual override on the window lock.\n\nThe window hissed open.\n\nI shouted to Vanessa, \"go!\"\n\nThen the doorknob turned.\n\n\"Vanessa, listen—one of us has to distract them. I’ll get the car and come back for you!\"\n\n\"Are you serious?!\"\n\n\"You’re faster, stronger, tastier—\"\n\nA metallic limb burst through the door. Vanessa punched it hard. The bot reeled back.\n\nI was already halfway through the window.\n\n\"YOU FUCKING WORM!\" she screamed.\n\nI hit the pavement hard. As I gathered myself, I heard her scream in agony. The wet, sickening sounds of cutlery piercing flesh echoed out the window. Blood splattered onto my face.\n\nI stumbled, turned, and ran.\n\nI did not look back.\n\nMy lungs burned as I fumbled at the car door. I saw her blood on my face in the reflection.\n\nI climbed in, winded, and peeled out.\n\nIn my jacket, my pocket, my phone buzzed. I fumbled for it. \n\nA notification from *Sublime Bites.*\n\n**\"Thank you for dining with us! Bring a friend again and receive 50% off your meal.\"**\n\n",

        "content": "We know more about space than we do about the depths of our own ocean, at least that's what they say. I'm not sure who “they” are, or if there is even any truth to it. What I do know, is that what we found down there doesn't belong here. What I have seen, can never be unseen. It has changed me... forever. \n\n \n\nThe salty cold spray splashed against my face as we pulled the cage over to the dump area.  A mix of The Dropkick Murphys, ACDC and Metallica blared from the deck mounted speakers as the rigging groaned under the weight of the haul. The cage, once in position, was flipped and opened, dumping 300lbs of Alaskan king crab onto the sorting table.  \n\n“Get sorting greenhorn!” Yelled Cobb, the deck boss. Cobb was a big man in his early 40s, he was built like a linebacker and had the disposition of an irritable grizzly. Apart from the captain, he was the oldest, most experienced crabber on the ship. \n\nI nodded and stepped up to the table to begin digging through the mass of bright red legs and claws. Jimbo, a short wiry man and the only other deckhand on the ship, joined in and we began sorting by size and sex. The females and the undersized crabs are separated to be released back into the sea, while the legal-size males are dropped down a chute to the live well below the deck, where they would be stored until we returned to port.  \n\nBeing a crabber was never something I planned on doing. After graduating high school and disappointing my parents by refusing to go to law school like they had always planned, I decided to go traveling. I bummed my way around my home state of Texas for a while before making my way north, and then even farther north. I had originally come to Alaska with a friend who had promised me a career in the oil business. Unfortunately, that had fallen through, as most of his plans did. I found myself broke, jobless, and homeless in a cold and unforgiving climate. I could have called my parents for help, but my pride wouldn't allow it. I had set out to make it on my own and that is exactly what I would do it. I spent the summer working odd jobs here and there but never found anything stable. I was wiping tables at a bar in Unalaska when I met Captain Larsson.  \n\n“You like working here?” He asked as he watched me prepare to clean up a puddle of vomit on the bar floor. His voice was deep and carried a hint of a Scandanavian accent. \n\nI looked up at him and shrugged, “Not really, but I need the money.” \n\nHe was a tall man with broad shoulders, I guessed he was maybe late 40s to mid 50s. He had a head of shaggy blonde hair streaked with gray and a short beard to match. He nodded, “You look like you can handle hard work” He said looking me over, “I happen to be in need of a deckhand. Ever thought of being a fisherman?” \n\nI shook my head, “No, but I never planned on doing this either. How's the pay?” \n\n“Better than you’ll make here.” He said, glancing around the bar room. His eyes fell to the vomit on the floor, “And you won't have to clean any more of that, unless you make it yourself.” \n\n“Where do I sign up?” I asked.   \n\nHe smiled, “Come to the harbor tomorrow morning, we’ll get you sorted.” He finished his beer and headed for the door. \n\n“Wait.” I called after him, “Which ship is it?” \n\nWith a slight glance back over his shoulder he called back, “The Horven.” \n\nWeird fucking name. I thought. \n\n \n\n“Wake up kid.” Said Jimbo, giving me a shove. “We got 50 more pots to haul in, no time for daydreaming.” \n\nI nodded and went back to work. The rest of the day went on the same as usual, haul in the pot, dump the catch, sort the crab, stow the pot. Captain Larsson was right; it was hard work, repetitive hard work, and damn was it cold. After four weeks at sea, you’d think I'd be used to the cold. But my warm Texas blood refused to acclimate to the frigid climate. \n\n“Incoming.” Yelled Cobb. \n\nThe pot was pulled up the side of the ship and swung over to the dumping area. \n\n“Looks like we got a hitchhiker.” Said Jimbo, as he looked over the pot. \n\n“A hitchhiker?” I asked, trying to see what he was talking about. \n\nAs the pot was spun, in preparation for dumping the haul, I saw what he was referring to. Clinging to the side of the pot, its tentacles in a writhing mass, was a giant pacific octopus. Hauling up an octopus wasn't exactly uncommon, but they were usually caught inside the crab pots. I hadn't heard of one riding a pot up on the outside, but there it was. It had an unusual color to it as well. I mean, everyone knows that an octopus can change its color, but this seemed different. It was a sickly gray color with odd purple veinlike designs covering its body.  As we approached the pot, I noticed something else. There was something clutched in the grip of the tentacles. \n\n“What the hell kind of octopus is that?” Asked Jimbo. \n\n“Biggest one I've seen.” Said Cobb. “Greenhorn, pull it loose and toss it overboard.” \n\nI nodded and stepped forward, “Hey guys, its holding onto something.” \n\n“Yeah, the cage.” said Jimbo, “Come on Evans, just get it done.” \n\nI reached out, preparing to pry the odd colored octopus from the pot. Suddenly it let go and dropped to the deck at my feet. I leapt back in surprise, causing the others to burst into laughter.  \n\n“Shit, I got it.” I said, as I reached down for the limp creature. \n\n“Is it dead?” Asked Jimbo as he stepped over to look down at it. \n\n“It doesn't matter.” said Cobb, “Just toss it over already.”  \n\nI tried to lift the huge octopus but kept losing my grip. The thing had to weigh a hundred pounds or more, and its limp slimy texture made it almost impossible to handle. \n\n“Move over.” Said Cobb, as he bent and hefted the limp creature over his shoulder, “Fucking greenhorn.”  \n\nAs he carried the octopus to the starboard edge of the deck, it dropped what it had been holding on to. I walked over and picked up the object, looking it over. It was a large egg-shaped stone, cracked open down the center. I turned it over in my hands, it was lighter than it looked. As I investigated the crack, I noticed it was hollow with jagged purple crystals within it. The crystals seemed to glow with an inner light, a soft, beautiful light. \n\n“AHH! HELP!” Yelled Cobb. \n\nI looked up to see the octopus’ tentacles wrapped around Cobb’s torso, its head bobbing around on his shoulder Jimbo and I rushed over and began trying to pull the tentacles free. \n\n“GET THIS FUCKING THING OFF!” Yelled Cobb, “ITS BITING ME!” \n\nWe tried and tried but we didn't have enough hands, every time we got one tentacle free another took its place. Luckily the captain and Ramirez, the ship’s engineer, had seen the commotion and came running. With their help we managed to pull the creature off of Cobb and tossed it overboard. \n\n“Ahh!” Groaned Cobb, holding his shoulder.  \n\nCaptain Larsson rushed over to him and pulled his coat aside to inspect the wound. There were two large gouges, where the beak had taken out chunks of flesh. \n\n“Ramirez, Jimbo, get him inside and patch him up.” He turned to look down at the stone as it rolled across the deck. His brow furrowed as he studied it, “Evans, toss that thing overboard.” He said pointing to the stone. \n\n“What? Why?” I asked. \n\nThe captain gave me a stern, uncompromising glare, “Do as I say, now.” \n\nI nodded, “Yes, sir.”  \n\nThe captain returned to the wheelhouse as the others helped Cobb inside. I walked across the deck and picked up the stone. When I had seen that it was full of crystals, I thought that it might be worth something. Me being broke, I could have used all the extra cash I could get. I glanced up to the wheelhouse and saw the captain watching me, so I made my way over and hesitantly tossed the stone back into the ocean. As I did, I looked back to the wheelhouse, the captain gave me a nod of appreciation. With a slight hesitation, I nodded back. With nothing else to do on the deck, I decided to head inside and see how Cobb was doing. \n\n“I'm fine.” Said Cobb as Ramirez packed his wound with gauze. \n\n“I know that.” Said Ramirez, pushing his glasses up on his nose. “But I still want you to stay inside and rest. I can help the boys finish up the haul for the day.” \n\nCobb sighed and shook his head, “It's really nothing, the damn thing surprised me more than anything.” \n\n“No kidding.” Said Jimbo, “I mean, I know they can bite, but who ever heard of an octopus attacking someone like that?” \n\nRamirez nodded, “It can happen, usually only if they are threatened. What did you do to it?” \n\n“No idea?” Said Cobb, “I thought it was dead, one minute it was completely limp. Next thing I know, the thing is squeezing the hell out of me and trying to gnaw my arm off.” \n\nRamirez shrugged, “Well, whatever set it off, it took a serious bite out of you, my friend. But you're patched up for now.” \n\nCobb started to get up from his seat at the dining table, “Alright, let's get back to it.” \n\n“No.” Said Ramirez, “We got this, you take it easy for now.” \n\nCobb looked from Ramirez to Jimbo, then to me, “What do you say greenhorn? Can you try not to be a fuck up for once?” \n\nI sighed and nodded, “Yeah, Cobb. I can handle it.” \n\n“I’ll keep an eye on him.” Said Jimbo. “You just rest that arm.” \n\nAnd with that, Jimbo, Ramirez and I headed back out to the deck to continue hauling in the few remaining pots. A few hours later, after the last pot was stowed and the others went inside to the bunkroom to check on Cobb, I decided to head to the wheelhouse. \n\n Captain Larsson glanced at me from behind the control panel as I opened the door. He took a puff on his long-stemmed pipe, filling the wheelhouse with the aromatic smoke.  \n\n“Storms coming.” He said, looking back out the front facing window.  \n\nI removed my hood and took a steadying breath, “Captain, I...” I paused. \n\n“What's on your mind Evans?” He asked, still looking out the window. \n\nI cleared my throat, “The stone, I was wondering why it bothered you so much? You took one look at it and...” I trailed off, feeling foolish for even bringing it up. \n\n“I've been a fisherman in one form or another for going on thirty-five years. I've never been married, never had any children, at least that I know of.” he grinned and winked at me. “I've had good seasons and bad seasons. I've seen good men die young and bastards live to old age. I've lost friends and found new ones. And I've done it all out here, on the water. The sea is all I've ever known, and its likely I'll die out here one day. Through it all, there's only one thing I've ever truly trusted.” He turned to face me, “Instinct. A captain has to know when it's time to turn the ship around to avoid a storm, or when to go for one more haul. A captain must trust his instincts, his gut feeling. Because when it's all said and done, it all rests on his shoulders. Do you understand?” \n\nI nodded but didn't speak. \n\n“When I looked at that thing,” Said the Captain, “I felt a deep and powerful dread come over me. I don't know what it is or where it came from, but I tell you now boy, there's an evil about it.” \n\nThunder rumbled in the distance. \n\nJust then, the wheelhouse door opened, and Ramirez came in. He was a heavy-set man with a kind face. \n\n“How's Cobb?” Asked the captain. \n\n“He’s sleeping.” Said Ramirez, “I was going to change his bandage, but I figured I'd just let him rest.” \n\nCaptain Larsson nodded, “Fine, just make sure you change it first thing in the morning.” \n\nRamirez nodded, “Will do.” He turned to me and smiled, “You did good today greenhorn.” \n\n“Thanks, I'm trying to pull my weight.” I said. \n\n“You're doing just fine, Cobb only picks on you ‘cause you're new. Next season you’ll be best friends.” Said Ramirez, as he slapped shoulder.  \n\n“If he doesn't kill you first.” said Captain Larsson. \n\nRamirez and I laughed. \n\nAfter another ten to fifteen minutes of small talk about the season, and what we would be doing when we got back to port, I was getting pretty tired. I told the two of them goodnight and headed for my bunk.  \n\nThe bunk room on The Horven was a small, cramped space, consisting of three sets of bunk beds along one wall. Cobb, who usually sleeps on the bunk above Jimbo, had lay down on the spare bunk and was out cold. Jimbo was snoring loudly from his usual spot, which would normally bother me. Tonight however, I was exhausted. Nothing would be keeping me up, or so I thought. As I lay down in my bunk, I heard the boom of thunder in the distance. I listened to the storm in the distance, growing closer and closer. Eventually the rocking of the waves lulled me to sleep, despite the booming thunder, and Jimbos snoring. \n\nSuddenly I was jarred awake by a heavy metallic thump. I looked at the clock on the wall, it was nearly 1:00, I had only been asleep for about an hour. I climbed out of my bunk and switched on the light to see Cobb lying in the floor, his body shaking violently. \n\n“Shit! Ramirez, Jimbo, somethings wrong with Cobb!” I shouted shaking them both awake. \n\nRamirez jumped out of bed and rushed over, “Fuck!” he exclaimed, “Looks like he's having a seizure.” \n\n“What's going on?” Asked Jimbo as he sat up in his bunk, rubbing his eyes. \n\n“Cobbs having a seizure. Go get the captain.” Said Ramirez, “Evans, help me move him.” \n\n“Oh shit. Okay I'm on it.” Said Jimbo jumping up and rushing to the door. \n\nI knelt down next to Ramirez, “What do I do?” I asked. \n\n“Help me move him onto side and grab his pillow. Shit, he’s burning up.” \n\nAfter we carefully rolled Cobb onto his side, Ramirez slid the pillow under his head and raised his chin. Cobb continued to seize for around a minute before falling limp. \n\n“Is he dead?” Jimbo asked from the doorway. \n\nThe captain pushed him aside and knelt down beside Ramirez. \n\n“No.” Said Ramirez, “He’s unconscious.” \n\n“Should we move him?” I asked. \n\nThe captain shook his head, “Let's give him a couple minutes, make sure the seizures are over.” \n\nWe all sat in silence for the next few minutes. I think we all hoped that Cobb would just wake up and be fine, but that didn't happen. \n\n“Okay.” said Ramirez, “I think he's done. Let's get him into his bunk.” \n\nAfter lifting Cobb’s limp body into his bunk, Ramirez bent down and examined the wound on his shoulder. \n\n“Oh shit.” he said, after removing the bandages. \n\n“What is it?” asked the captain. \n\nRamirez stepped back from Cobb's bunk, revealing the wound. The flesh around the bite mark was swollen and discolored. There were dark lines running out in all directions from the wound, which seeped a dark oily substance. \n\n“My god.” Muttered Jimbo, “Is he gonna be alright?” \n\nRamirez shrugged, “Its clearly some kind of infection, but I haven't seen anything like it before.” He turned to the captain. “We need to get him back to port. All we have out here is ibuprofen, he needs a doctor, antibiotics. He needs more than I can do.”  \n\nRamirez ran his hands through his hair, clearly stressed. Aside from being the engineer, he was the ship medic as well. He took his responsibility of taking care of the ship and the crew very seriously. \n\nThe captain put a hand on his shoulder, “I know you're doing what you can, I can't ask for more than that.”  \n\nRamirez nodded, “Yes sir.” \n\nThe captain turned to Jimbo and me, “Evans, you stay here with Ramirez and Cobb. Jimbo, to the wheelhouse with me. We’re headed for Dutch Harbor, and I need coffee.”  \n\nAnd with that Jimbo and the captain left. Ramirez and I sat there in silence for several minutes. Cobb's breathing grew labored as the ship rocked back and forth. Ramirez bent over Cobb and pulled open his mouth. \n\n“What are you looking for?” I asked. \n\nHe turned to me, “I'm checking to make sure his airway is clear.” \n\n“I thought swallowing your tongue during a seizure was a myth.” I said. \n\n“It is, but he could still be choked if he...” Ramirez trailed off. \n\n“What?” I asked.  \n\nHe glanced at me, “Somethings wrong with his tongue.” \n\n“I thought you just said...” \n\n“Just shut up and come look at this.” Ramirez said interrupting me. \n\nI stepped over and looked into Cobb's mouth. Something was definitely wrong. Cobb's tongue was swollen and covered in lines, like scars. \n\n“What the hell?” I asked, “Were those there before?” \n\nRamirez Shook his head, “No, I don't know what this is. The lines are too symmetrical.” \n\nHe was right, the lines ran from the back of Cobbs mouth down to a central point on the tip of his tongue. And his breath, Jesus it was horrible, like rotting fish. \n\n“Ramirez.” The captains voice called over the intercom, startling us both. “I need you in the wheelhouse.” \n\nRamirez looked at me, “Are you good here?”  \n\nI nodded, “Yeah, I think so.” \n\n“If anything changes, anything at all, you come find me.”  \n\n“Right, I got it.” I said, trying to sound confident. \n\nRamirez patted my shoulder and left the bunkroom, leaving me alone with Cobb. The next half hour was pretty uneventful. Cobb slept, his breathing ragged and labored. I sat on the bunk next to him, waiting for someone to come and tell me what was happening. I was beginning to get bored when all of a sudden, Cobb started choking violently. I jumped to my feet and leaned over him, not knowing what to do. He coughed and sputtered, dark saliva flying from his lips.  \n\n“Cobb, Cobb!” I shouted, “Fuck, I'm going to get Ramirez. Just hang on man, he’ll know wat to do.” \n\nI ran out of the bunkroom and up to the wheelhouse, my heart pounding in my chest. \n\n“Ramirez!” I shouted as I flung open the door. But he wasn't there. \n\n“What's wrong?” Asked the captain. \n\n“It's Cobb! He’s coughing and choking, I don’t know what to do!” I said, my breath coming hard. \n\n“Shit.” Said the captain before turning to the intercom, “Ramirez, get back to the bunkroom now, Cobb needs help.” \n\n“Where are they? What's going on?” I asked. \n\nHe turned back to face me, a worried look on his face, “Engine room, something's wrong with the ship. The engine has power, but she won't move. We’re dead in the water.” \n\n“What do we do?” I asked. \n\nThe captain stood up and threw on his coat, “I’ll head down to the engine room and see what I can do. You head back to the bunkroom; Ramirez may need help.” \n\nI nodded and we both left the wheelhouse. This whole situation was wrong. Of course, accidents happen. People get hurt or sick, the ship has problems, but... this was something else. I could feel it, like the captain said, instinct. \n\nI entered the bunkroom to find Ramirez, alone. \n\n“Where's Cobb?” I asked. \n\nRamirez whirled around, “Jesus, Evans. You scared the hell out of me.” He shook his head, “I could ask you the same thing, what happened?” \n\n“He was here when I went to find you. He started choking on something. I didn't know what to do, there was some stuff he was spitting up, dark stuff.” \n\n“What kind of dark stuff? Was it blood?” Ramirez asked. \n\nI shrugged, “I don't know. I don't think so.” I thought for a second, “I think it was black, and had chunks in it or something.” \n\nRamirez studied me for a moment, “Whatever it was, we need to find him. He has a fever; he could be delirious.” \n\nI nodded and we left to tell the captain and Jimbo what was happening. \n\n \n\n“Gone?” Jimbo asked, “What do you mean gone? Where could he go?” \n\n“We’ll find him.” Said Captain Larsson, “Ramirez, you and Jimbo stay here, get my ship moving. Evans and I will search the ship and find Cobb. One of us will come get you when we do.” \n\nWe all agreed, and the captain and I set out to search for our missing crew mate.  \n\nWe swept the upper and lower deck, the wheelhouse, the latrine, the dining area and back to the bunkroom. The Horven wasn't a large ship, but still there was no sign of Cobb anywhere. \n\n“Could he have fallen overboard?” I had to shout the question over the raging storm.  \n\nWe had gone back out to check the decks again, thinking that maybe we had missed him among the nearly 200 crab pots. \n\n“If he has, then he's lost. We’ll make a few more passes before we start thinking that though.” The captain shouted back. \n\nWe started to make our way back inside, when I noticed something. The chute that we used to drop the crab down to the holding tank had a cover on it that usually stays closed when not in use. The cover was pushed to the side, leaving a gaping portal down into the tank. \n\n“Wait.” I called out, “Captain the hold.” \n\nThe captain turned to see what I had seen. \n\n“Shit!” He exclaimed, “If he fell down there, he could be seriously injured.” \n\nWe rushed over to the controls for the holding tank's large hydraulic door. The door groaned as it opened. The deck lighting illuminated the inside of the tank as the door opened wider and wider. I feared I would see Cobb's limp and broken body in the tank, being feasted on by thousands of large hungry crabs. But... I was only half right. Cobb was there, his flesh ripped and bleeding from the pinchers and claws of the large crustaceans, but he was still alive. He turned to look up at us, a large crab shell in his hands, his mouth was ragged and torn as he chewed the shell along with the meat.  \n\n“What the fuck?” I exclaimed, stepping back from the door. \n\nThe captain stood his ground, “Mr. Cobb, I need you to come with me. You aren't well.” \n\nHe just stared back, unblinking as the freezing rain pelted his face. Dark blood flowing from dozens of open wounds. All the while, continuing to chew. \n\n“Cobb!” Shouted the captain, “Get the hell out here now!” He leaned over to me, “Go get Ramirez. Tell him to bring some rope.” \n\n“Rope?” I asked. \n\nCaptain Larsson met my eyes, “I’ll not have this man loose on my ship.” \n\n“You think he's dangerous?” I asked. \n\n“Cobb was dangerous before he went mad. Now, I don't know what to think.” \n\nI nodded, “Yes sir.” and rushed off to get Ramirez. \n\nAs I ran, I kept seeing Cobbs's face in my head. His face... it just looked wrong, like it didn't fit right anymore. What the hell was happening to him? I didn't think an octopus could even hurt a person, let alone give them some kind of infection. Whatever was happening, I would not be returning for another season on this ship. \n\nI entered the engine room to see Ramirez scratching his head. \n\n“We have power, I don't understand what's happening.” He said pacing back and forth. \n\n“Ramirez.” I called, “We found him.” \n\nAfter explaining how we had found Cobb and the state he was in, Ramírez's face went pale, “Madre de Dios.” He muttered. \n\nJimbo tried to smile, “You’re joking right? You have to be joking.” \n\nHis smile fell away when he saw the look on my face.  \n\n“Theres more.” I said, “The captain said to bring some rope, he thinks Cobb may be a threat.” \n\n“What kind of threat?” asked Jimbo. \n\nI shrugged, “I don't know, but I think he's right.” \n\nRamirez nodded, “I agree. If not to us, he’s clearly a danger to himself.” \n\nAnd with that the three of us left the engine room and headed for the deck. Ramirez found a large coil of thick nylon rope on the way. It was clear to see that the two of them didn't like the idea of tying up their friend, but what choice did we have? Something was very wrong with Cobb's mind. \n\nWhen we stepped out onto the deck, we saw no sign of the captain. We approached the holding tank door, still standing wide open, afraid of what we might find inside. But, apart from a half-eaten crab on the deck, there was no sign of Cobb either. \n\n“Where are they?” Asked Jimbo. \n\n“I don't know, dammit! They were both right here!” I shouted in frustration. \n\nRamirez put up his hands in a calming motion “We will find them. Let's just stick together and search the ship.” \n\nWe did exactly that, we scoured every inch of the ship and dammit there was no sign of either of them. After the search, the three of us sat down in the wheelhouse. Jimbo had his head in his hands. Ramirez just sat there silently, lost in thought. \n\n“Guys?” I said breaking the silence, “What do we do?” \n\nJimbo took a breath and shook his head, “I don't know man, the captains gone, Cobbs gone. I don't know what's happening, but they are gone. I just want to go home.” \n\n“Look we don't know if they are gone, maybe we search again?” I suggested. \n\n“Wake the fuck up man!” Jimbo shouted, “They're gone. Something happened to them, and I don't want it to happen to me!” There were tears in his eyes. “They were my friends, but I won't die out here!” \n\nRamirez stood up, “Okay, that's enough!”  \n\nWith the captain and Cobb both gone, Ramirez was next in command. Not that Jimbo and I were much to command. “Look, I think you are both right. Evans, I want to find them too. I care a lot about both of them, but I think Jimbo is right, something isn't right here.” He thought for another moment then said, “Whatever happens, the ship still needs fixed, so that's what I'm gonna do. Jimbo, I want you on get on the radio and call for help. We are pretty far out here and I'm not sure we will be able to reach anyone, but we have to try.” He turned to me, “Evans, search the ship for the others. It's possible they fell overboard, but if they are here, find them.”  \n\nI nodded, “If they're here, I'll find them.” \n\n“And I’ll get to work trying to reach someone on the radio.” Said Jimbo, taking up position at the radio. \n\n“Alright.” Said Ramirez, “I’ll head below and see if I can figure out what's going on with the ship.” \n\nWith the others tending to their duties, I headed off to search the ship yet again. Only this time, I didn't get far before the shit really hit the fan. \n\n \n\nI had just finished checking the dining area and latrine again and was about to head into the bunkroom when I heard Jimbo's voice over the ship intercom. \n\n“Evans, there's someone on the upper deck.”  \n\nFinally, I thought. I had begun to fear that the missing men had fallen overboard, maybe our luck was turning.  \n\nI stepped onto the deck and peered through the pouring rain, but I couldn't see anyone. I turned back to face the wheelhouse where I could see Jimbo looking out at me. I gave him a shrug. \n\n“He was at the bow, all the way out. I can't see him now.” said Jimbo, his voice tinny over the intercom. \n\nI wanted to ask him who was at the bow, I found myself hoping it was the captain and not Cobb. But I figured that at that distance he wouldn't be able to tell anyway. I made my way down the narrow path between the stacks of crab pots to the end of the bow, and still, I didn't see anyone. \n\n“Shit! Evans, He’s on top of the pots.” Jimbo sounded panicked.  \n\nI looked up just in time to see someone jump across the pots overhead. Whoever it was they were damn fast. I began to feel less like a man searching for his friends and more like prey being stalked by some unknown predator. I turned and started back towards the wheelhouse. \n\n“Evans!” Jimbo's voice was growing more panicked, “Jesus, he’s...” His vice cut off abruptly.  \n\nThe nearest intercom speaker had gone silent, I could still hear Jimbo's voice coming from the speaker further up the deck, but with the storm raging around me I couldn't make it out. \n\n“Jimbo!” I shouted, fear taking hold of me. \n\nI ran for the wheelhouse, hearing the rattle of the crab pots above me as the unseen person pursued me. My heart pounded harder and harder with each step. Suddenly, I lost my footing and slipped. The cold hard floor of the ships deck rushed up to meet me. I tried to catch myself, but my hands slid forward on the slick metal. My chin slammed into the floor, splitting open and rattling my entire skull. For a moment, I was too stunned to move. \n\nWhen I finally climbed to my knees, I could feel the warm blood flowing from the gash on my chin, but that wasn't all.  I could taste it too, I spat the warm coppery fluid onto the deck and saw a few shattered teeth among the mess. \n\n“Fuck.” I mumbled painfully. \n\nI realized, I could hear Jimbo now. His voice racked with fear, “Evans, Ramirez! It's not Cobb anymore! Someone help me!” \n\nI stood on shaky legs and started toward the wheelhouse. I was still seeing stars, but Jimbo's panic spurred me on. “I'm coming!” I shouted.  \n\nBut, when I got to the wheelhouse, it was too late. The door had been smashed in, and Jimbo was gone. \n\n “God Dammit!” I shouted in frustration. \n\nI rushed over to the intercom and called for Ramirez, “Ramirez, where are you? Jimbos gone, someone took him, I think it was Cobb.” \n\nI waited for Ramirez to come to the wheelhouse, praying I wasn't alone now. But he never came. \n\nAfter another ten minutes of calling for help, from Ramirez, the coast guard, God, anyone who would listen. I decided to head for the engine room, maybe he was still there, maybe the intercom was busted. I didn't know what to do, I just couldn't stay there. Before leaving the wheelhouse, I took the fire axe from its glass compartment. Whoever took Jimbo, even if it was Cobb, they wouldn't get me without a fight.  \n\nI started down the stairs, axe in hand. I'm not a very big man, and the axe felt heavy in my hands, but I’d swing it for all I was worth if I had to. As I was about to enter the engine room, I felt a presence behind me. I froze, my grip tightening on the axe handle, but I wasn't fast enough. A pair of strong hands latched onto me from behind. One of them wrapping around and pinning the axe to my chest, the other clamped over my mouth stifling a scream. I squirmed and fought but couldn't break loose. \n\n“Calm yourself boy.” Came a hushed voice, “we may yet get out of this.” \n\nI calmed and he released me. When I turned around, I saw the last person I expected to see, “Captain Larsson.” I exhaled feeling a sense of relief, I wasn't alone. \n\n“Where have you been?” I asked, “We thought you fell overboard.” \n\n“I did.” He said in a shaky voice, “Cobb came after me like a mad man, swinging wildly. I tried to fight him off, but he was too strong, too primal. I ran, tried to get away, but the bastard chased me. His teeth chattering like he wanted to take a chunk out of me. I tried to make it back to the wheelhouse, but he tackled me over the side. I must have hit my head because I woke up hanging off the side of the ship, my leg tangled in the rigging and soaked to the bone.” \n\n“God, Jimbo was right.” I muttered. \n\nThe captain nodded, “Whatever happened to him, he’s changed. When I finally managed to pull myself back aboard, I saw him. He’s not human anymore.” \n\n“What do you mean?” I asked. “And how did he get back on board?”  \n\n“I don't know how he got aboard. But I saw him break down the door to the wheelhouse, I tried to get there but my numb fingers couldn't move fast enough to get the rope untangled from my leg.” His head dropped as he spoke, clearly disappointed that he couldn't protect a member of his crew. \n\nI looked him over; he was absolutely drenched and shivering violently. I was amazed he was alive, let alone on his feet. \n\n“I tried to get there too, but I fell. We tried radioing for help, but I don't think anyone heard us. And I don't know where Ramirez is, I was on my way to the engine room when you found me.” I explained. \n\nThe captain nodded, motioning for me to give him the axe. \"Good man. I’ll take the lead from here; you just stay close. I won't lose anyone else tonight.”  \n\nI didn't argue. I handed over the axe and fell in behind him. I was just glad I didn't have to face whatever was going alone. \n\nAs we approached the engine room door, the captain ducked low and motioned for me to do the same. He carefully turned the handle and pushed the door open, being as quiet as the squealing hinges would allow. We stepped inside and were greeted with a scene straight out of a nightmare.  \n\nCobb was there, but Jimbo and the captain were right, he wasn't Cobb anymore. His back was to us, but I could see enough. His hair had mostly fallen out, his head swollen and misshapen. His arms had lengthened, nearly to below his knees and his flesh was the color of a rotting corpse. \n\nJimbo and Ramirez were there too. Their bodies wrapped up in a mass of black slime-like webbing that covered the walls of the engine room, like massive, bloated flies in a spider's web. I could see chunks of flesh missing from Ramirez's body, yet somehow, he was still alive. Jimbo squirmed and fought against the webbing when he saw us, his eyes pleading for mercy. \n\nWe watched on in horror as Cobb stepped to the back of the room and knelt down, bowing his head in supplication as the octopus climbed out from the shadows behind the ship's engine. The creature had grown massive since the last time we saw it; its size dominated the engine room. \n\n“Holy shit. Is that...” \n\n“Yes.” breathed the captain. \n\n“It can't be.” I whispered, “Its huge.” \n\n“It is.” \n\n The creature crawled over to the black webbing where Jimbo had been cocooned. \n\n“Jesus!” I gasped, “Its eating them alive.” \n\n But before it could start in on its fresh meal the captain stood and began shouting and banging the axe against the wall. \n\n“Leave them alone, you bastards!” He shouted, before turning to face me. “Go to the wheelhouse, get the life raft and get away from this place.” \n\n“What? No, I'm not leaving you here.”  \n\n“I won't leave my men to suffer. Now go!” \n\nCobb had turned to face us. He looked even more terrifying now, dead skin hung loose on his face and his eyes bulged from their sockets.  \n\n“Damn you boy, go now!” Yelled the captain, “I’ll hold them off.” \n\nHe gave me a shove out of the engine room, then slammed the door behind him. With no other option in sight, I ran. I ran as fast as I could to the wheelhouse and found the inflatable life raft. I was about to leave the wheelhouse when the radio crackled.\n\n\"Horven. This is the cargo ship Weston. We are always out from you yet, but we are coming. You men just hold on.\" \n\nI snatched up the radio transmitter to respond, \"Weston. This is The Horven, please hurry. I don't know how much longer we can last.\" \n\nBut there was no response, only static. I tried a few more times but still got nothing. I made my way out onto the deck, then hesitated. Could I really leave the captain and the others here? The life raft had a distress beacon on it, I was sure that the Weston would see it, even through the storm. Maybe I could find a weapon and help the captain fight them. Yes, I thought. I would help the captain; we would save the others.  \n\nI began looking around for something, anything I could use as a weapon, then I heard it. A wet, broken, gargled voice from behind me.  \n\n“G... Gr...Grreeeennhorn.” \n\nI turned to see Cobb, standing at the top of the stairway. He had a large gash across his chest and shoulder, which oozed dark purple. I think he tried to smile, but the loose flesh didn't move with whatever was underneath. \n\n“Oh God.” I breathed. \n\n“N... Not y...yett.” Said Cobb, in his grotesque voice. \n\nHe lunged for me. I tried to back away, but I slipped again. I fell hard onto my back, kicking out at Cobb. My foot made contact with his face and knocked more flesh loose, he hissed and sputtered as I continued kicking but I couldn't get him off of me. His long arms reached out and clamped onto my shoulders, pulling my face closer to his. I punched him as hard as I could, causing him to grunt in pain but he never slowed. In a last effort I reached out and took hold of the loose skin on his face. With a mighty heave, I ripped it away, causing him to howl in pain and me to shriek in terror. Underneath the dead skin was mottled gray flesh lined with purple veins, just like the octopus. He was left with a gaunt featureless face under a swollen and bulbous head.  \n\nI screamed and screamed as his mouth opened, what was once his tongue was now a writhing mass of tentacles which reached out and wrapped around the back of my head, pulling me closer and closer to certain death. I fought and fought but could do nothing but watch as inch by inch my head would be pulled into Cobbs waiting jaws.  \n\nSuddenly there came a wet thwack sound. The tentacles around my head tensed once more before falling limp along with the rest of Cobbs body. I scrambled back away from him to see the fire axe buried in his head. \n\n“Why the hell are you still here?” Asked Captain Larsson.  \n\nI jumped to my feet, “The others?” I asked. \n\nThe captain shook his head, “Nothing to be done. Get the raft inflated, now. It's coming.”  \n\nI grabbed the life raft and pulled the cord, the raft self-inflated in a sudden whoosh of air. \n\n\"There's a ship on the way. The Weston, they said they were still a ways out but they are coming.\" I told him. \n\n\"Good. Let's get the raft in the water. That thing will be here any second.\" \n\n“Wait.” I said, “Can't it just follow us into the water?”  \n\nThe captain smiled. “There is no us boy, I'm staying.” \n\n“Are you crazy? You can't stay here.” I said. \n\nHe looked out to sea for a moment, “Did I ever tell you the meaning of the ships name?” \n\n“The Horven?” I asked, “Its Scandinavian, right?” \n\nHe nodded, “Thats right. Back in Norway, my grandfather would always tell me tales of the old myths and legends. Tales of hero's and monsters. The horven was always his favorite, mine too I suppose. But the horven has another name.” \n\n“What name?” I asked. \n\n “Kraken.” \n\nI shook my head in disbelief, “No. That's just a story...” \n\nHe put his hand on my shoulder silencing me, “Maybe it is just a story. Or maybe, by naming my ship after the beast, I cursed us all. Either way, it's here and I’ll not leave while it lives.” \n\n“But...” \n\n“No, Evans. My mind is made up. Take the raft and go. If I kill the beast, I'll have avenged my crew. If it kills me, well, I’d like to think that at least someone made it out alive.” \n\nI studied his expression, “You don't think you can beat it, do you?” \n\nHe looked down at his leg, blood pouring from an open wound and shrugged, “I'll give it hell all the same, maybe keep it busy long enough for...” \n\nJust then something wrapped around my ankle and began pulling me across the deck. I looked to see the huge octopus climbing its way to the top of the stairs from the engine room below. I screamed in pain and fear. The tentacle gripped my leg so hard; I thought it would crush the bone. Captain Larsson rushed forward and with a swift chop, severed the tentacle. We rushed to the life raft and tossed it into the sea below. I held the rope tight, keeping the raft from drifting away. \n\n“Captain, I can stay, I can help.” I said. \n\nHe smiled warmly and put his hand on my shoulder, “Live a good life, son.” And with that he shoved me backwards off of the ship and into the waiting lifeboat below. \n\nThe waves quickly pulled my raft out to sea, away from The Horven. I managed to get one last glimpse of Captain Larsson, before the waves took me away. A flash of lightning lit the scene as he swung the axe amidst the flailing tentacles, again and again. He screamed in rage as blood flew from the massive creature, and then I was carried away. \n\n \n\nI was only at sea for a few hours before the cargo ship Weston came along. Their captain had heard our distress call and came looking for us in our last known location. After getting me some dry clothes and a blanket, they asked if there had been any other survivors. I thought about Jimbo and Ramirez, if they were alive, they were probably infected with whatever changed Cobb. I thought about the captain, I hoped he had survived, but didn't think he had. If he didn't manage to kill the creature, he’d be in the same shape as the other two. \n\n“No.” I said after a while. “There was no one else.” ",

        "content": "It was a hot summer night, and I was getting ready to sleep when my phone rang. I walked over to the table and saw it was my chief. I picked it up, but before I could say anything, his voice blasted through the speaker:\n\n**“We’ve got a report — a family is drowning. Get to the beach. Now.”**\n\nThen the call ended.\n\nI tossed the phone onto my bed, yanked on my lifeguard shorts, and sprinted out the door. I jumped in my car and floored it. In five minutes, I was at the beach.\n\nMy colleagues were already there. I could hear screaming — voices coming from the sea. Without hesitation, the chief pointed and told us to go in. I didn’t hesitate. I ran straight into the water.\n\nThe sea was pitch black. Wavy. Cold. The kind of cold that hits you so hard your brain blanks out. My colleague Charles was beside me as we swam toward the sounds. The waves kept slamming into us. We could barely catch a breath between them.\n\nWe hit a short calm. Just a few seconds.\n\n“Can you hear it, Charles?” I shouted.\n\n“No!” he yelled back.\n\n“What do we do?”\n\n“Keep swimming toward the noise!”\n\nSo I dunked my head and kept going. The last place we’d heard anything — we had to get there. But another massive wave hit us. Hard. I was underwater longer than before, and when I surfaced, gasping—\n\nCharles was gone.\n\n“Charles!”\n\n“Charles, where are you?!”\n\nI shouted again. And again. But there was nothing. No sound. Just water and waves.\n\nAs long as Charles was with me, I wasn’t scared. But now? Alone in the dark sea, being thrown around like a ragdoll by invisible walls of water? I felt small. Helpless.\n\nI had no idea what direction to go. But I couldn’t just float there. So I swam — blind, desperate, toward where I thought the voices had come from.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, my hand slammed into something.\n\nI pushed my face above the water, breathing hard. I reached out and clung to whatever I’d hit. My hands searched — and found skin. A neck. A face.\n\n**A person.**\n\nI grabbed the body and turned it, praying it wasn’t Charles.\n\nThe first thing I saw was the foam — thick and white, bubbling from his mouth, slipping down his chin like the ocean was trying to crawl out of him.\n\nHis skin was pale. Lips turning blue. His face swollen and stiff.\n\nI turned him gently, afraid of what I’d see — praying it wasn’t Charles.\n\nHis eyes were open. Staring straight at me. Unmoving.\n\nFor a moment, I didn’t recognize him. His face looked wrong — twisted by fear, the water, the cold.\n\nThen I saw it. The curve of his jaw. The scar under his right eye.\n\n**Mike.**\n\nMy arms locked up. I couldn’t breathe. He wasn’t moving — not blinking, not flinching, not even drifting. Just foam pulsing from his mouth in little spurts, like the sea still lived inside him, trying to force its way out.\n\nHe looked like he was still watching me. But there was **nothing behind his eyes**.\n\nI wanted to say his name. I wanted to shake him, to scream, to do *something*. But all I did was stare.\n\nThen a wave slammed into us.\n\nAnd he was gone.\n\nI spun around, looking. Screaming his name. But there was nothing left. Just me, and water, and darkness.\n\nI was alone. Again.\n\nI didn’t know where the beach was anymore. Didn’t know if I was swimming farther out. I couldn’t hear anything.\n\nCouldn’t think. I just floated there. Silent. Accepting.\n\nThen — a sound.\n\nA horn.\n\nI snapped my eyes open. A light was moving along the shoreline.\n\n**The ATV.** Our beach vehicle.\n\nI don’t even remember thinking — I just swam. My muscles were dead, but something kicked in. Survival instinct, maybe. I swam until my body hit the sand.\n\nOn the beach, I saw a child lying motionless. Two of my colleagues were crouched over him — one doing chest compressions.\n\nI stumbled forward. My knees gave out and I dropped to the ground.\n\nOne of them ran to me.\n\n“Edward! Where’s Charles?! He was with you!”\n\n“Did you see Mike? Mike’s missing!”\n\nI couldn’t speak. I just stared at the sand. My whole body was shaking.\n\nAnother teammate grabbed me by the collar and shouted in my face.\n\n**“Edward, what happened?! Where are they?!”**\n\nI slowly looked up at him.\n\n“Mike is dead.”\n\nEveryone froze.\n\nTwo of them ran over.\n\n“What do you mean? Did you see him?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Charles was with me. A wave split us up. I called for him, but he never answered.”\n\nI collapsed onto the sand again. One of them shouted, “We have to go back! We can’t leave Charles out there!”\n\nBut no one else moved.\n\nNo one even said no.\n\nThey just stared out at the sea — blank-faced. Like they knew we’d barely made it back ourselves.\n\nI laid there, letting the cold sand press into my skin. I’d lost two friends. And I hadn’t saved a single life tonight.\n\nThere was nothing left to do but wait.\n\nWait for dawn.\n\nOr for their bodies to wash ashore.\n\nThe sea didn’t take all of us.\n\nJust enough to remind us it could.",

        "content": "Have you ever felt like your body isn’t yours? Not just wrong—but unfamiliar, like something borrowed, altered when you weren’t looking? I know how that sounds. But I swear to you, I’m not crazy.\n\nI should clarify, I'm not suffering from dysphoria of any sort, I swear it. I know how it's going to sound, but I'm \\*not\\*, no matter how much everyone around me says it is. Says I've always been this way. I haven't been, I know this. I \\*know\\* this. A week ago I was fine, I was perfectly ordinary.\n\nFive days ago, that's when everything changed for me. I'd been at work - I work as a cashier at a small bookstore here in town - and I'd been shelving new books we'd gotten in. I distinctly remember that, because I remember reading the title of one, and making a mental note to have a look at it for myself later.\n\nOne moment, I was shelving books, running my fingers over the smooth spines. The next—a cut in the film reel of my life—I was in my boss’s office, nodding along as she rattled off event ideas. No transition. No memory of walking there. Just here now, without the in-between.\n\nWhen I asked her what was going on, she was irritated at first. I think she thought I'd been ignoring her, maybe? When I pressed, though, and she saw how freaked out I was, that's when she got worried, so much so that she sent me home early with instructions to get checked out at the ER.\n\nSo that's what I did. On the way there, I called my neighbors, asking them to feed my cat and letting them know where the spare key was—they were fine with it—and then I waited in the waiting room.\n\nI had plenty of time to sit and overanalyze. My hands fidgeted—rubbing my thumb over my pinky like I always do when I’m nervous. Something felt off. A slight wrongness. A texture that shouldn’t be there.\n\nI looked down.\n\nThe nail was gone.\n\nNot torn off. Not injured. Just… never there. Scarred over, like it had been gone for years.\n\nI know for a fact, an \\*absolute\\* fact that I had a pinky nail this morning, so that was immediately added to my list of things to freak out about.\n\nWhen I was finally escorted back to a room everything went speedier from there. It wasn't more than thirty minutes before the doctor came to see me. I'd listed the black out and memory loss as a reason for coming during intake, but now I had the missing pinky nail to add to the pile, and add it I did.\n\nThe doctor was very kind, quick to reassure me that sometimes people just had memory lapses, that it was quite common, but he still scheduled a few tests for me. I no nothing about medical science, so I can't really say what any of them did, or were for. I had blood drawn, I was put through a tube and scanned, I think x rays were done? I'm not entirely sure about that last one. I want to say it happened, but there was never any mention of it when I finally got back to my room.\n\nThe other tests came back clean, healthy I suppose. The doctor certainly didn't seem concerned. He did mention something that made no sense. He informed that in my medical records it was noted that I was, in fact, missing my pinky nail. That I'd been born like that. But that can't be right. I mean, I don't look at my hands constantly, but I know I had all of my fingernails this morning. I told the doctor just that, and he looked at me like...well like I was crazy, and he felt bad for me being crazy.\n\nThat was when I decided to just go home, the tests were fine and did nothing to help me, so what was the point of even staying there. The doctor still insisted on me scheduling an appointment with a therapist, and I made all the right noises about it before I left.\n\nWhen I got into my car, I checked the mirror on instinct. The backseat was empty—no missing time, no gaps. Just me.\n\nExcept.\n\nMy eyes weren’t green.\n\nThey weren’t bloodshot or tired or glassy. They were brown. A flat, unremarkable, cardboard brown. No trace of green, no hint they had ever been anything else.\n\nBut I remember.\n\nI remember looking at my reflection this morning, and my eyes were green. I know they were green. Weren’t they?\n\nIt was late when I got home, way too late to be bugging my neighbor, so I just headed into my apartment. The first thing I noticed was the quiet. Normally when I come home I'll hear the jingle of my cats, Sofi, collar as she runs my way to say hello. This time, nothing. Just empty silence. When I turned on the lights one room after another, I kept calling for her and looking behind anything I could think of, but she wasn't there, neither were her toys, her litter box, nothing. There wasn't even any fur on the couch. It was like she'd never been there.\n\nOf course I woke up my neighbor, my fucking cat was missing. I pounded on their door until they answered, and when I started making demands, asking about my cat, my key, everything, they just looked at me like I was insane. Threatened to call the cops if I didn't leave. They had no idea what I was talking about.\n\nI opened up my phone log to prove to them that we'd talked, but there was nothing. Calls from my mom, a few spam calls, a call from my boss, but nothing to or from my neighbor. I remember feeling panicked, so fucking scared, and then the next moment - like I had been ripped out of one scene in my life, and stuffed awkwardly into another - I was back in my apartment. Sitting at my kitchen table, with a bowl of cereal in front of me.\n\nI'm here now, typing this out. I don't understand what's happening to me, to my memory. But I'm terrified of the idea of what I might lose next.\n\n  \n[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jogirm/slow_unravelling/)",

        "content": "The first time I was struck by lightning was in the summer three years back. I was coming home from working on a neighbor’s car when the rain started, a red-black cloud like a slit gut splitting the sky in half.\r\n\r\nWell, about damn time, I thought. It had been a dry August, and a little moisture would have done the town good. \r\n\r\nIt was as I got out of my car that a feeling up the back of my neck gave me pause. Growing up near bear country you get to know the sense of some big animal watching you, and I had that same sense then, only it came from where that dark cloud bled and threatened a storm. \r\n\r\nI’d never held with Walpurgis town superstition, nor what folks said about the things living in the National Park nearby, or what was walking in the mountain forests beyond; if you listened to the way people get going around here you’d think that there were devils and spirits of all kinds just about everywhere you looked.\r\n\r\nIt was just talk, that’s all I figured. \r\n\r\nBut as I looked up at that dirty cloud and heard the start of thunder I could hardly move with the dread of that storm coming in. I stood where I was like my boots had been nailed down to the driveway, the rainfall soaking my shirt through to the skin.\r\n\r\nStill the ‘bear feeling’ ran up and down my neck, and if my legs had worked right I would have ran.\r\n\r\nThe first visible lightning flash came so close that I could smell the reek of sulphur and ozone. Felt the heat of it blast me like the first step out of an aircraft into a tropical country. I remember thinking that it was a bluff charge, trying to scare me off out of its way, only for all I wanted to I still could not move.\r\n\r\nFear like that gets people killed in the wilderness every day, and right there in the heart of Walpurgis I came close. There was another growl of thunder, and even before the second bolt of lightning struck I knew that it would hit me. That what was up there in the sky was no natural weather phenomenon but something like the mountain god the cult up in Hill Town kneel to, as the rumors go.\r\n\r\n“Black bear,” I thought. “Hunter lightning.”\r\n\r\nFunny where our minds go at times like that.\r\n\r\nI recall a pull like hands all down the back of me yanking me to the ground, then a light in my eyes of such a whiteness I thought it’d burn me blind. Next thing I knew I was on my back in the driveway, my throat full of smoke, and then my wife was running out of the house screaming my name and pulling my clothes off where they’d melted down to the skin.\r\n\r\n“Jesus, Ann,” I heard myself say distantly. “I’m alright. Just get me up and inside. Ain’t safe out here.”\r\n\r\nThe shock had washed my fear into calm, and in a way I wish it hadn’t, being that it made it easier to forget what I’d felt before that bolt knocked me down.\r\n\r\nI brushed it off as something I’d imagined in the panic of being caught out in a storm, terror attaching character and purpose to something that had none. It was an accident, I said to myself, that was all.\r\n\r\nI spent a couple of days holed up in a hospital ward, counting my blessings that I only had second-degree burns. More visitors came by than I cared to see, being that my ordeal had exhausted me to the point I would have gladly killed a man if it meant that I could sleep some.\r\n\r\nAnn got me through it all, sitting by me with her hand in mine no matter the time, day or night. Though she didn’t talk much I had the notion she’d seen something that afternoon that spooked her. Seen, or felt it like eyes on her as she ran out to pick me up off the ground.\r\n\r\nA hostility, she’d later call it. Not a thinking sort of hatred, like a human being would have, but like something startled in the woods and mad about it.\r\n\r\nOnce I was out of the ward and my burns had healed up I went back to work, pushing that day as far out of my head as it would go. I traveled out of town for a time, worked in other places that rained heavy and stormed hard, and though I got myself indoors quicker than I would have done before the incident I felt nothing like I had in Walpurgis.\r\n\r\nI’d been mistaken, I thought. Must have been. Only Ann biting at her lip and looking at me strange whenever a hard rain got going made me think any different.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” I said, once I’d had just about enough of this. “I’ll be fine. It ain’t gonna happen again.”\r\n\r\n“It might,” Ann insisted. “People who’ve been struck by lightning once are more likely to get struck again. I read it online.”\r\n\r\nBeing that Ann read more or less everything online and from questionable sources I paid this no mind.\r\n\r\nIt’s as I was putting my coat on that she said, “You ain’t the only one that got hit in that storm, Joe.”\r\n\r\nI looked round at her, brows just about up to my ears.\r\n\r\n“Well, who else was?”\r\n\r\n“Fred Meier. My second cousin. You know him.”\r\n\r\nI did. Ann’s family were of the old German settler stock up in the North side of town. Most still had traces of the accent and some even spoke a little German, mainly the older folks. I figured that’s where all the superstition in this town came from: old ghost stories and fairy tales from that far country.\r\n\r\n“Fred Meier,” I said. “Sure, I know him. So how’d it happen?” \r\n\r\n“He was out hiking with some folks when they got caught out in the bad weather. Weren’t forecast, so they couldn’t reschedule or anything. Well, they were heading up some high path when Fred started acting strange, said he was sure something was after him.\r\n\r\n“Next thing they knew a big old lightning bolt came down and they were all flat on their backs half-stunned, and Fred hit so bad he couldn’t move all down his left side.”\r\n\r\n“Well, shit,” I said. “How’s he doing now?”\r\n\r\nAnn shrugged.\r\n\r\n“Getting his movement back some. He ended up in some hospital out of town because of overcrowding, else we would have seen him, I bet. I ought to visit.”\r\n\r\n“You take yourself over there,” I said. “He’ll be glad to see you, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\nAnn was clearly hoping I’d stay home after what she’d told me, and in hindsight I should have. \r\n\r\nAs it was I went to do some work on a roof that’d had shingles blown off it in the storm; I’d always been an odd jobs man, and I could repair just about anything I set my hand to. I felt a whole lot better once I was up there on the top of that house being of use to someone. Keeping active keeps the mind clean, and I had a lot of dirt to shake.\r\n\r\nBut it was while I was up there, sweating and cursing under the sun, that I got that feeling of woodland eyes on me again so strong that I couldn’t brush it off or ignore it the way I wanted to. For a while I told myself maybe there was a coyote or a wild cat around, watching me from the street, but no matter which way I turned I couldn’t see a thing.\r\n\r\nI sat up on that roof, scared without a cause, starting to blame Ann for putting an idea in my head I couldn’t seem to shake. Then like some disgruntled animal the first thunder boomed over me, and I was on the ladder and scuttling down it so fast that my boot missed a rung and my heart just about dropped out of my ass.\r\n\r\nI held onto either side of the ladder, my loose foot scraping desperately for grip. \r\n\r\nWhatever that storm was had been watching me, and now it had me where I couldn’t run. A fork of lightning thrashed the rooftop so close that all the hairs on my face singed off with the heat. The force of that nearby blow punched the ladder clean off the wall, and it’s lucky I didn’t have too far to jump clear of it before it fell on top of me.\r\n\r\nI lay on my back, breathing hard, trying to get myself up and failing each time. It was having that pressure over me that did it, the knowing that the lightning was hostile and aware of me. Though it couldn’t eat like a bear it could kill me as surely as one: it’s as I was thinking this that a second strike clapped over my head, and what I felt then was like being hit by a lit firework, a force that stunned me into the black of near death that I’d seen once before.\r\n\r\nI felt an uncanny acceptance come over me, and I waited to die, terror burned out of me into cold. When I came round I was surprised that nobody had run over to check on me, but with the storm still going strong most folks were likely safe indoors.\r\n\r\nI stayed where I was, eyes closed, hoping to God the lightning wouldn’t notice that it hadn’t killed me.\r\n\r\nI probably lay there a good twenty minutes before I dared to get up again, stiff all over with the taste of metal so strong in my mouth that I had to spit. My heart seemed to beat off rhythm, though whether it was the strike that did it or the fear that still had not left me I do not know.\r\n\r\nThat was the first time in my life I’ve had to leave a job unfinished, though at least I had a solid reason. I thought about lying to Ann about why I’d had to call it off, but she knew as soon as I walked through the front door what had happened. \r\n\r\nI had burns running down my shoulders like the branches of red trees, or the scratches left by claws.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Ann. “Oh, Joe. What are we going to do?”\r\n\r\nThere were two more incidents with the lightning after that. The first time I was indoors, cooped up in front of the computer looking into some online courses my wife had been on my neck to take so as I wouldn't have to go outside to work so much. I knew she was onto a decent idea, but I've only ever been good with my hands and I couldn't make head nor tail of anything I was looking at.\r\n\r\nI guess that's why I didn't notice the clouds building outside my window till the first roll of thunder went off like the sound of vehicles colliding on a wet road. It occurred to me that the sound had always come first in this sinister weather, that this, too, was wrong.\r\n\r\nThen the lightning snapped so close to the house that the whole window lit up white, harsh enough that my eyes watered with it. \r\n\r\nI remember thinking, \"Can't get me in here, can you, you old bastard,\" before it struck again, this time somewhere on the roof.\r\n\r\nAll the lights in the house blew out with a noise like a shotgun blast, and I felt the shock of it all up my arm from touching the keyboard, knocking me off my chair and against the wall. I sat there cradling the limb, muttering the Lord's prayer and stuttering like hell over it, too. \r\n\r\nAll the while that storm went to work out there, and I could swear that it was angry it couldn't do more. Like it could see me, smell me, just couldn't get in; burning out all the electrics was the closest it could get.\r\n\r\n\"This ain't right, Joe,\" said Ann, shaking next to me in bed later that night. \"How did it get inside? How did it know where you were when—\"\r\n\r\n“When it couldn't see you”, she meant.\r\n\r\nShe was starting to think the same way I was.\r\n\r\nThe last time the lightning got me was a month later, when I'd been cooped up for so long out of work that I'd started going a little stir crazy.  I checked the skies beyond the windows with a paranoid frequency, desperate to go outside but in such a fear of the storm thing killing me that each time I went to my front door I could never bring myself to step foot beyond it. \r\n\r\nIt was Ann's birthday coming up that finally pushed me to do it. Sure, I could have ordered her something online, but I couldn't stand gawping at that screen for even one more second. Besides, I'd noticed since the third incident I had sort of a strange effect on electronic devices. Lights flickered, watches stopped working the second they were strapped to my wrist, and speakers started giving off an odd noise like they were picking up interference.\r\n\r\nAll in all I was jumping at the chance to get myself outdoors and away from everything, only I should have known better. Did know better. The confinement had sent me a little over the edge. I suppose I wasn't thinking straight, and Ann wasn't home to set me right.\r\n\r\nI let myself out of the house and set off for the nearest store on foot, telling myself that it was safer than driving, that I could duck for cover if I sensed something coming on.\r\n\r\nI hadn't cleared more than a few blocks when I felt a raindrop hit the back of my neck and nearly jumped a mile. Looking up at the sky I saw a black cloud had started pooling like blood in a blue iris, and I recognised at once that it was the same storm that had kept on me since the start.\r\n\r\nI felt a sweat starting under my shirt, but all I felt was cold as panic took me in a stranglehold. There was the feeling I was face to face with an animal, each of us waiting to see what the other would do. Out of the corner of my eye I took measure of the nearby buildings, judging how quickly I could get myself inside and wait for the storm to pass.\r\n\r\nBefore I knew it I was running as fast as my body would let me being that I was forty, and my previous injuries had me feeling a good deal older. I felt a weight over me like something pressed down from within the sky, and it was just as I got myself through the door of a tired looking bar that lightning hit the sidewalk, shattering the windows in a rain of charred glass. \r\n\r\nThe bar staff rushed forward to assess the damage, hanging cautiously back as the storm warred in the street beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Shit,\" a man said to me. \"Are you alright? You nearly got yourself shocked just there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need a drink,\" is all I could think to say.\r\n\r\nI don't recall how I got home. By the time I got in and lay down I was so drunk that I went immediately to sleep. I remember thinking that it was easier that way. That if the lightning came again I wouldn't know.\r\n\r\nWhen Ann found me she sat down on the edge of the bed and started biting at her lips until I thought she'd gnaw right through to the meat.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go up and see my cousin,\" she told me. \"He's bound to know something, surely. I'll go and see him.\"\r\n\r\nShe said it reluctantly, like it was some difficult thing she'd been working towards for a long time, which I suppose she had. \r\n\r\nI didn't see how it would help any. Surely Fred was just as lost in all this as I was. Still I said nothing, let Ann drive on up the next morning. Let her think it would do some good.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back later that night she had a look on her face I didn't recognise, one I still can't put a name to. All I knew was that something had gone wrong while she'd been visiting. That, or she'd got wind of something she didn't much want to hear.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said. “How’s Fred?”\r\n\r\n“Alright,” said Ann, setting her handbag down on the floor. “Well as he can be. Hasn’t been outside in weeks. My Great Aunt Lina was there with him, visiting from out of town. We got to talking.”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t Lina the one into all that cosmetology shit?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Meteorology, honey. Weather studies. She says even before her boy got struck and holed up in that hospital she was reading all about it, keeping scrap books of old newspaper clippings and articles she printed off from her computer. Real organised. She showed me everything she’d put together, said she’d tried taking it to all sorts of people— the authorities, psychics, experts in weather phenomenon. Nobody paid her any notice.”\r\n\r\n“About what?” I asked, though I knew almost since she’d started talking where the conversation was leading up to.\r\n\r\n“The lightning,” said Ann. “It was ’65 last time it went after people the way it’s been doing this summer. The autumn of that year there were flash storms just about every week or so. Lightning that just snuck up on you. Caught houses on fire, blew electrics and knocked trees down. All the things you’d expect, at first. Then it started after people.\r\n\r\nThere was a little girl, Hannah Müller. Lina knew her pretty well, played with her sometimes. She was just twelve years old when the lightning hit her the first time. She was riding her bicycle up and down outside her house when the clouds came in, and next thing anyone knew a bolt of lightning snapped down like an elastic band and struck her clean off the bike.\r\n\r\nHer hair and clothes were on fire but she wasn’t screaming— the shock, I guess. Her mother ran out to get to her and four more strikes came down, one after the other in a circle, like the storm was pacing around that girl, trying to get at her again. It only touched her the once that time or it would have killed her.\r\n\r\nIt’s as the family tried moving Hannah out of state for better medical care that it did. They were loading suitcases into the back of a moving van when the storm came back. Hannah started yelling, tripped over herself trying to get back in the house saying it was chasing her. Right then the lightning hit that little girl three times, stabbing at her till she was dead. Twelve years old and killed on her own doorstep. Can you imagine?”\r\n\r\nI didn’t much want to, but I shook my head and let Ann talk.\r\n\r\n“Hannah wasn’t the only one that ended up dying that way. There was a lady driving to work that said she felt something strange, like a warning bell going off in her head. She thought maybe she was about to get hit by another car, or somebody was going to run out across the road; it was that kind of feeling. The lightning hit her so fast all she saw was a white light across the windshield before she totalled her car against a fence.\r\n\r\nShe lost a leg in that crash, and because of the lightning hitting her she couldn’t use her hands much either. Something to do with the nerves, I guess. The second time she was struck coming out of the hospital— happened so fast passers-by don’t reckon she saw it. She died instantly. Her body was charred nearly to dust in how direct it hit.”\r\n\r\n“Fucking Christ,” I said.\r\n\r\nI got up to make coffee, needing something to do with my hands.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Lina was just a kid at that time,” said Ann, “but she got curious how come there had been two cases like that so close together. She started her research then and just kept on going, learning all the time. Every thirty to sixty years or so there are incidents with the lightning in this town, and this town only; it never crosses the border, somehow. Aberrant, Aunt Lina calls it. Aberrant lightning— Lord, that lady has a way with words.”\r\n\r\nAnn took the coffee cup as I handed it to her and blew on it gently as she gathered her thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Each time it comes there’s reports people sense it before they see anything, though it’s never forecast and it never seems like the right weather for it. Then the lightning just keeps coming back and back till the people it hits die, except sometimes if it’s starved out long enough it'll move off again. It’s like it’s alive, somehow. There’s been plenty of folks that think it is.”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“When it came that first time I thought a lot about wild animals that get aggressive with human beings. Man-eating gators. Bucks that charge at people passing through National Parks because they’ve gotten too comfortable being approached by people, or because we’ve  started moving in on their territory.”\r\n\r\n“You ain’t the first one to say that. Lina said the oldest accounts she could find were from the settling families. They were even more superstitious than people are now, and maybe they weren’t wrong to be.”\r\n\r\n“What did they say?”\r\n\r\nI’d given up my pretence of not believing by now, embraced what I’d known in my soul from the first day I’d encountered that lightning.\r\n\r\n“The settlers thought that whatever was causing that lightning wasn’t the weather at all,” said Ann. “More likely some kind of spirit or creature. Hell knows there’s enough talk around here of that kind of thing. Sure, it looked just like lightning, but it behaved like some angry animal that got woken up or disturbed somehow and attacked whoever it saw first.\r\n\r\nUsually it’d go for two, three, even five people at one time before it settled. There wasn’t any reasoning with it or chasing it off. You couldn’t bargain with it, kill or hurt it. You just had to stay out of its way until it left. Or slept, I’d guess. The settlers had a name for it. ‘Schwarzbär’.”\r\n\r\n“Black bear,” I said.\r\n\r\nAnn’s eyes widened.\r\n\r\n“How’d you know that? You don’t speak a lick of German.”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t hard to figure out. Besides, that's what came into my head that afternoon you found me in the driveway. Black bear. Hunter lightning.”\r\n\r\nWe sat silent a while, watching our coffee steam, not much wanting to drink.\r\n\r\n“What do we do, Joe?” asked Ann at last.\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess we’ve got to move,” I said without much confidence.\r\n\r\n“How in God’s name are we going to afford it? Besides, like I said, it won’t work. Look what happened to Hannah.”\r\n\r\n“Then we wait it out,” I said, exasperated. “What’s the longest the Bear’s been awake for?”\r\n\r\nAt this Ann worked her teeth into the little scar on her lip.\r\n\r\n“From what Lina showed me about a year. There were times people braved stepping out too soon and got hit right away, like the Bear was lying low thinking to catch them.”\r\n\r\nI began to knead my eye sockets with the balls of my fingertips.\r\n\r\n“So you’re saying I’ve got to hide in here and hope I get the timing right? How are we supposed to live when I can’t go to work?”\r\n\r\nAnn laid her hand on mine and squeezed it lightly.\r\n\r\n“Joe, it’s either this or you don’t live at all. I don’t see that we have a choice.”\r\n\r\nJust then thunder tore over the top of the house, and I knew that Ann was right. This lightning means to kill me, and if it reaches me it will.",

Please listen.\n\nI was on maternity leave when the world rotted.\n\nMy body still aches from birth. My stomach was soft and swollen in the places that no longer held her. My skin felt too loose, stretched by something no longer inside me. A ghost of her remained in the shape of me.\n\nAnd my milk had come in.\n\nThe pressure—God’s above, the pressure. My body had not yet learned what my heart already knew. There was no child at my breast. No warmth curled into me, no tiny fingers wrapped around my ringless hand. Just absence.\n\nShe was still in the NICU.\n\nBreathing through plastic, her ribs rising and falling like the wings of a crushed butterfly. The nurses assured me she was strong. That babies born too soon had a way of clawing their way into this world, of demanding space when they had been given so little time to prepare.\n\nBut she was small. So, so small.\n\nAnd I had been discharged without her.\nBecause I was healthy. Because my lungs worked. Because my blood pressure was stable and my stitches were healing.

His calloused fingers had shaped the wood, carved the edges, sanded the splinters down until they were smooth as water-polished stone.\n\nAnd yet, it was still unfinished.\n\nPiles of lumber leaned against the walls, stacks of planks waiting for purpose. Shelves stood half-built, cabinets missing hinges, doors propped in corners like forgotten ghosts. A staircase led nowhere, a second floor nothing but raw beams and an open sky.\n\nHe had planned to finish them before the baby came home.\n\nShe was not home.\n\nHer room was half-built like the rest of the house. The crib sat against an unpainted wall, still wrapped in plastic, the mattress stacked neatly beside it. There was a mobile, too—handmade, carved from scraps of mahogany and maple. Tiny wooden birds and flowers, sanded smooth, waiting to turn in a breeze that would never come.\n\nThe dresser was empty. No onesies folded into neat rows. No tiny socks waiting to be worn.\n\nI had spent months preparing for her. Washing her clothes in scent-free detergent, folding them carefully, pressing my fingers into the soft fabric and wondering what she would smell like.\n\nWould she smell like me? Like milk and warmth and sleep?\n\nOr would she smell like the sterile air of the NICU?\n\nWould she even know my scent?\n\nI should have been home with her, swaddled in my arms, pressed against my chest where she belonged. But she was still there, in a hospital bassinet, beneath the hum of machines, breathing through plastic.\n\nI stood in the doorway of her unfinished nursery, my arms crossed tightly over my stomach, aching in a way no painkiller could fix.\n\nHawthorn’s voice pulled me back.\n\n“You should eat something.”\n\nI turned. He stood in the hallway, arms crossed, shoulders broad enough to fill the frame of the door. His eyes flickered to the breast pump still clutched in my hands. He didn’t comment on it.\n\nI exhaled slowly. “I’m not hungry.”\n\nHe nodded once, like he expected that answer, then jerked his head toward the kitchen. “I’ll leave something out for you anyway.”\n\nAnd then he walked away, disappearing down the hall, his steel-toe boots heavy against the wooden floor.\n\nThat night, I was on the deck, curled into the warped wood of a chair that had endured one too many winters, my fingers wrapped around a chipped ceramic mug. A sticky ring sat on one of the many coasters dotting the table before me, the lemon balm tea long since lukewarm.\n\nAbove me, the moon hung swollen. It loomed low, too low, its surface stretched tight as if it were a bruised fruit on the verge of splitting. Veins of light crept through its craters, its formations bulging. I tilted my head, squinting, trying to grasp its unnatural fullness.\n\nThen, the realization tided over me.\n\nThe moon was too large. Far too large.\n\nIt was as if I had been staring at it for hours instead of seconds, blind to its obscene magnitude, until now. \n\nThat was when the night popped.\n\nA split amid the stars. It tore open, spilling across the horizon like flesh torn from bone. The sky peeled back, and that’s when it happened—\n\nShards of silver bled across the sky. They were not like meteors. These pieces, these fragments of the moon, they didn’t follow gravity’s tug. They hung in the air, as if the world had forgotten how to obey its own rules.\n\nThe impact ensued. A shift, as if reality itself had been waiting for some celestial trigger, some lost permission to crumble.\n\nThe ground heaved.\n\nI barely had time to stand, to keep on my feet, before the very air twisted, warped, and tore itself asunder.\n\nThe moon’s fragments were no longer fragments—they shifted. Twisted. They morphed mid-fall, as though the hands twisted them in transit. Some hunched, contorting into jagged monoliths, jagged spires that thrust themselves into the earth, impaling the land with precision that could only be described as divine execution.\n\nOthers—others liquefied, melted into a molten mass upon impact—and the streets buckled beneath them. The streets… devoured. Steel and stone. Pavement and pride. All torn apart, devoured, consumed by rivers of burning light.\n\nThe smaller fragments speared the asphalt—their silver points piercing the earth as though they were setting a wound to bleed. They carved gaping, jagged wounds into the world—each one a scar. Silver rivulets followed their path. And with them, the air bent. It swirled into itself, twisting like an elongated serpent’s body—pulling the winds with it. The air itself warped, churning into an awful, wide arch of black, drawn into the heart of something far more terrible than I had the strength to understand.\n\nAnd then—it came.\n\nThe voice.\n\nNot from the sky. Not from above. No, it came from within. \n\n“YOUR HANDS ARE STAINED. YOUR BREATH, A POISON.”\n\nAnd then, not with my eyes, but with my mind, I saw.\n\nI saw the oceans—bloated, blackened, slick with oil.\n\nI saw the forests—stripped, charred skeletons of trees, their ashes floating on the wind like diseased snowflakes, drifting in a world too tired to mourn.\n\nI saw fields of plastic, stretching far and vast, reaching into the horizon where the sun blazed too hot, far too angry to be anything but vengeful. The world was sick. And it was every bit our fault. Every wound, every scar upon it, had been made by our hands. Our greed. Our ignorance. Our philosophy that we will be long gone when the effects finally show.\n\n“NOW, THE EARTH RECLAIMS ITSELF.”\n\nAnd it was then that I understood. There would be no mercy.\n\nNo salvation, no forgiveness, and certainly no haven or miracle.\n\nWe had been the poison. And now—now the world would purge itself. We had poisoned the earth, and the earth would rise up to wash us away.\n\nThe ground buckled. The pavement folded inward, swallowing itself whole in an insatiable groan for more. The buildings sank. They did not collapse, and it sure as hell was not an explosion. They were pulled down, sinking into the hungry, hungry world of Mother Nature.\n\nThe deck lurched beneath me.\n\nThe earth was caving in, from the weight of us.\n\nI bent my knees, steadying myself on instinct. My tea mug wasn’t as lucky—it spun off the table, shattered against the warped wood, and was instantly swallowed by the widening cracks.\n\nThe treehouse was being reclaimed, becoming one with nature.\n\nHawthorn was inside.\n\nI ran.\n\nI didn’t stumble. My feet slammed against the deck as I hurled toward the doorway. I didn’t stop to think. I didn’t let my body realize it was too late.\n\nThe house let out a low, agonized groan. Wood strained, nails snapped, the walls curled inward.\n\n“Hawthorn!”\n\nMy voice barely broke through the howling wind.\n\nThen—the sound of the foundation tearing loose. A wet, sucking of earth peeling apart beneath us.\n\nI hit the doorframe hard, shoulder-first, and kept moving. The house was tipping—the hallway already at an angle, the floor tilting beneath my feet as I threw myself up the stairs.\n\n“Hawthorn!”\n\nI didn’t wait for an answer.\n\nI took the last three steps in a leap, bracing against the slanting walls. The ceiling cracked apart behind me. A black hole in the roof, a mouth yawning open to swallow us whole.\n\nI slammed into his bedroom door. The world was falling sideways.\n\nThe floor jerked beneath me. Falling. \n\nThen—a hand.\n\nFingers like iron, yanking me forward, ripping me free from the pull of gravity.\nHawthorn’s grip was iron. The kind of grip that did not allow for failure. He was already acting. \n\n“Move!”\n\nI moved.\n\nI followed the force of his arm, let him shove me toward the door, let him haul me through collapsing walls and splintering beams.\n\nThe house wailed and screamed. The foundation buckled.\n\nHawthorn hit the ladder first.\n\nHe climbed like the world was chasing him. Because it was.\n\nI didn’t dare to look down.\n\nI caught the rung and pulled myself up, pushing past the burning in my arms, the ache in my ribs, the shaking in my legs. \n\nThe moment my foot left the last step, the porch vanished beneath me—ripped away into the mouth of the earth.\n\nHawthorn reached down.\n\nI grabbed his wrist.\n\nHe pulled.\n\nI landed hard on the first platform, already pushing up, already reaching for the second ladder.\n\nHawthorn didn’t wait for me. \n\nI climbed. One rung, then another. The wind roared, thin-trunked trees corkscrewed, the ground kept folding itself inward, devouring what was left of our world.\n\nThen—we were above it.\n\nThe unfinished second floor. Raw beams, half-nailed planks, a skeleton of a home still reaching for the sky.\n\nI sucked in a breath, pressing my hands to my knees. \n\nHawthorn turned, staring down at the wreckage below.\n\nI remember dialing the hospital.\n\nThe line? Dead.\n\nI sat down, knees to my chest. The unfinished floor dug into my skin, the raw wood biting into my palms. I just stared at the sky—the ruined, moonless sky that no longer belonged to us.\n\nI didn’t sleep that first night.\n\nCouldn’t.\n\nInstead, I sat on the edge of what remained.\n\nAnd I waited to feel human again.\n\nHawthorn worked. Of course he did.\n\nThe hammer swung in a steady rhythm. \n\nHe didn’t pause to wipe the sweat streaking down his jaw, didn’t wince when he caught a splinter, didn’t falter when the wind howled through the skeletal beams of the unfinished floor.\n\nI watched him.\n\nHe had always been like this.\n\nNow, the sky falled, and Hawthorn was building anew. Because what else was he supposed to do? Afterall, humans were fickle and stubborn creatures, always repeating history.\n\nI pulled the tarp tighter around my shoulders as he wiped his palm against his jeans and kicked his pack toward me. “Eat.”\n\nHis voice was low, gravel-rough. Like he had spent the last few hours biting down on every scream that wanted out.\n\nI didn’t move.\n\nHis eyes flicked to me, assessing. \n\n“Heather.”\n\nI let out a slow breath and unzipped the bag. Inside: vacuum-sealed packs, a half-empty bottle of water, protein bars, a sheathed hunting knife.\n\nI took out a pack of dried mango and ripped it open with my teeth.\n\nHawthorn sat down across from me, his back to the unfinished railing. He pulled out a can of beans, stabbed it open with his pocket knife, and started eating in slow, measured bites. His knuckles were bruised. His jaw was clenched tight.\n\nThe silence between us was a wall.\n\nI swallowed the too-sweet mango, forcing it down. “How bad?”\n\nHawthorn didn’t answer right away. He swallowed, set the can down, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n“I walked the ridge.” His voice was steady. Like he was a meteorologist reporting on the weather. “Town’s gone.”\n\nI pressed my lips together. Of course it was.\n\n“The hospital?” I asked.\n\nA long pause.\n\nHawthorn exhaled. “Not there anymore.”\n\nMy stomach folded in on itself.\n\n“You don’t know that,” he said, quieter.\nI laughed—short. A sound dry of humor. \n\n“Yeah. I do.”\n\nHe didn’t argue. He just picked up his can again and kept eating.\n\nWe sat there, chewing through the end of the world.\n\nAfter a while, I set the mango down and pressed my palms into the floorboards. “So. What’s the plan, Bob the Builder?”\n\nHawthorn snorted. “Stay above ground. Reinforce. Build higher. If the water rises, we’ll need rain catches. If the ground sinks, we stay ahead of it.”\n\n“And if the world keeps eating itself?”\n\nHe licked a drop of beans off his thumb and glanced at me, eyes sharp in the low light. “Then we climb faster.”\n\nA gust of wind tore through the trees, rattling the tarp he had rigged as a temporary roof. Below, the world groaned under its own collapse.\n\nHawthorn stood, rolling his shoulders. “You gonna sit there all night, or you gonna do somethin’ useful?”\n\nI looked down at my hands. I pressed them hard against the boards, feeling the splinters prick my skin.\n\nI sat up.\n\nAnd I decided.\n\nI reached for the remnants of what was left of the world’s power, my fingers typing into nothing.\n\nIf you can read this—if anything still remains—please give us a sign.\n\n[The Skyfall (Part 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/yzLq5xP2zf)\n[The Skyfall (Part 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/FJTgZn93CB)",

        "content": "When I graduated college, my friends and I decided to go on a trip to both celebrate our accomplishment and mourn the fact that we were officially leaving adolescence and entering the ”real world”. We decided to go on a backpacking trip to Europe as it seemed to be the only place that we could all agree on and was perfectly cliche for a group of (former) college students. We were all experienced hikers and had traveled virtually everywhere in the U.S., so we thought Europe would be a nice change of scenery. Not a lot of planning went into our trip, we just had a vague idea of what we wanted to do. Fly into Denmark, end up in Switzerland, staying in youth hostels along the way. We had set aside a month for the entire trip so we weren't stressed about having a coordinated agenda or planned stops, we just wanted to get drunk at every bar and do things that caught our interest along the way. \n\n\n\nThe beginning of our trip went as expected. We flew into Copenhagen and immediately went out to the nearest bar. For the next month, we made our way south through Hamburg, to Hanover, to Frankfurt, and finally to Zurich. Our trip was filled with hiking, drinking, sightseeing, and a few drug-fueled experiences that now seem hazy in my memory. Everything was what I was expecting from the trip until we got to Zurich. When doing the little planning we did before embarking, the one thing that we did plan was our flights. When we arrived in Zurich, it was a few days before our scheduled return flight home. Being at the end of a month-long bender, none of us really felt like continuing partying and decided to go on a short hike in the Swiss Alps before our return trip. \n\n\n\nNot all of us went on the hike. Out of the 5 in total who went on the trip, only 3 including me decided they wanted to see the alps. The two who went with me were my friends Henry and Kyle. To get to the alps, we had to ride a train for about 2 hours. The image of the mountains towering over me as we stood at their base is imprinted in my mind. The smell of the fir trees, the quiet ambience only interrupted by the chirping of birds and the rustle of the leaves. It was truly serene, and Henry, Kyle, and I silently agreed to not disturb the peace with conversation as we started our way up the trail. Even though we were experienced hikers, we were not planning on climbing to the summit of any mountain, but as we continued down the trail at relatively the same altitude, it got cold. Very cold. \n\n\n\n“Do you guys also feel chilly?” Henry asked us.\n\n\n\nI turned around to see him shivering in his t-shirt and shorts.\n\n\n\n“Yeah it feels like way colder than when we started.” I replied.\n\n\n\nWe had set out for our day trip at around 11:00 AM and had only been hiking for about an hour, so it should have been getting warmer if anything. We didn’t really think anything of it as we all had sweaters in our backpacks for when it got chilly at night. In Switzerland the temperature in June, when we were there, is around 55 degrees Fahrenheit at the coldest, but we could tell it was getting much colder than that. Still, we decided to keep going since the route we were taking would take around 8 hours to complete, putting us back at the base of the mountain at around 7:00 PM, just before the sun set. About an hour later, clouds started to move in, blocking out the sun and making it even colder. The wind was picking up too, adding to the already plummeting temperature. I could tell that it was easily close to, if not already, freezing now. When we set out this morning, the forecast said that it would be sunny all day, with no clouds in the sky. \n\n\n\n“Guys, maybe we should just turn back now. It’s getting really cold and it looks like it might rain.” Kyle said. \n\n\n\n“Yeah it's getting mad uncomfortable and I don’t want to be cold and soaked.” Henry added.\n\n\n\n“Yeah alright, let’s head back. I'm cold as hell too.” I agreed.\n\n“Let me just take a piss real quick, I’ve been chugging water all morning.”\n\n\n\nI was disappointed that our excursion didn’t go as planned, but was looking forward to getting out of the cold. I went off the path to relieve myself behind a tree. After finding a nice pine, I unzipped and did my business. Looking up, I noticed a strange symbol carved into the tree slightly above my head. It looked like an owl head with a cross marked in its forehead. I figured somebody got bored doing what I was doing right now and decided to doodle it into the tree, maybe hoping to scare the next pisser. I zipped back up and headed back to the trail to meet up with my fellow hikers, but when I got back to the trail I didn’t see them. \n\n\n\n“Guys?” I said, slightly above my normal talking volume.\n\n“Alright, very funny guys!” I shouted.\n\n“I guess y’all are gonna jump out and scare me now?”\n\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\n\n“Guys?” I tried again, looking around to see if I just didn’t see them when I was walking back. \n\n\n\nI was only met with the howl of the wind and the swaying of the trees. Without any other explanation, I told myself that Henry and Kyle just ditched me as a prank and already started back to the trail head. It felt wrong to me though, I knew that they wouldn't do that to me, especially since we were hiking in a new place and the weather was so rapidly degrading. They wouldn’t leave me alone, even as a joke. I swallowed this doubt and started back towards the foot of the mountain, determined to save myself from the cold and hoping to find my friends along the way. \n\n\n\nThroughout the afternoon, the clouds above me grew denser, darker, until it felt like dusk. Trudging through the cold, windy afternoon it felt like knives were striking my skin every time the wind picked up, tearing my skin apart. After walking for what seemed like an eternity, I checked my watch to gauge how far I was from the trail head and the sweet warmness of the train ride home. It read “2:53 PM”. We had turned around at about 1:00 PM and had started at 11:00 AM, so I should be reaching the beginning of the trail soon I figured. As I read the numbers on my watch, a white flake landed right on the time display. I picked it up with my finger and it melted almost instantly. I looked up to see hundreds of snowy, white flakes falling from the deep, dark gray sky. A feeling of panic and dread filled my stomach. \n\n\n\n“How could it be snowing in the middle of June?” I thought to myself.\n\n“Thank God I’m almost out of here.”\n\n\n\nI was hoping with everything in my being that Henry and Kyle would be waiting for me when I got back, standing next to the warm train, waving me inside. However, as I continued down the path, my hope slowly evaporated. I walked for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 45 minutes, still no trail head in sight.\n\n\n\n“I should be right by the train by now.” I told myself.\n\n“Did I walk the wrong way when I finished pissing earlier? Did I somehow go back to the wrong trail? Where am I?”\n\n\n\nI was starting to panic. Snow was still falling and each crunch under my boot slowly weathering my assurance that I would see my friends or the train again. My feet and my legs were growing numb. I had nothing but my shorts and a sweater to protect me from the unforgiving cold. Still, I kept walking. Eventually, the clouds grew so dark I had to take out my flashlight so I could see the path better. I looked down at my watch, expecting it to be close to sunset. “4:12 PM” it read. I figured even if I did walk the wrong way, I would still end up at the trailhead by 7:00 PM since that’s how long the entire hike would have taken. I continued, each minute growing more and more scared of the reality I was in. Snow was building on the ground, the wind and the cold had still not given up. Each minute had the weight of a freight train, pounding into my body. Luckily, I wasn’t entirely stupid and had packed food and water for the journey, so I would still have my strength to continue. As the afternoon turned into the evening, 7:00 PM came and went and the trailhead was still nowhere in sight. My panic grew with each step I took. It was pitch black now, almost a complete absence of light. We weren’t expecting to stay the night up here, so I hadn’t packed a tent or many camping supplies, just a sleeping bag. \n\n\n\nI started coming to terms with the fact that I would probably have to spend the night out here in nothing but a thin sleeping bag when I saw a light up ahead of me. I felt my heart skip a beat, thinking it was another hiker. At least I won’t be out here alone. Maybe they had some camping gear or at least extra clothes so I wouldn’t freeze to death. However, as I made my way towards the beckoning light, it turned into multiple lights, yellow and warm. I finally got in range to tell what it was, not another hiker, but a cabin. I didn’t have time or the luxury to think about all the warnings I was given by Grimm’s fairy tales in my youth to think twice about approaching this lone cabin in the middle of the Swiss Alps. As I quickly walked towards the cabin, I thanked God with every step and thought about the warmth that would bathe me as I entered the cabin. The cabin appeared rustic, like Paul Bunyan built it himself. There was a big, cast iron knocker on the door. I reached to pick it up to knock, but the door flew open before I even touched it. Greeting me was a tiny, old woman. \n\n\n\n“What are you doing out there in the cold?” She asked in a sweet, comforting voice.\n\n“Come in sweetie, you’re gonna freeze to death!”\n\n\n\n“Thank you so much.” I blurted out as I quickly entered the safe haven of the cabin. \n\n\n\nThe crackling of a fire met my ears at the same time its warmth covered me. A flood of relief entered my body and mind with the assurance that I would not freeze to death tonight. This only lasted for a minute as I was reminded of Henry and Kyle.\n\n\n\n“Are my friends here? Have you seen them?” I automatically asked.\n\n\n\n“No, sweetheart, you’re the only soul we’ve seen.” The old woman said with concern in her voice.\n\n“Come in dear, sit down, do you want some coffee? Tea?” \n\n\n\n“Sure, uh coffee please. You’re sure you haven’t seen anyone else tonight?”\n\n\n\nI wandered over to the fireplace and sat down on the old sofa, next to the rocking chair. As I glanced over to the chair, I was shocked to see an old man occupying it. I hadn’t seen him when I entered.\n\n\n\n“Positive, dear. Your friends probably had enough sense to get off the mountain when it started snowing.” She chuckled.\n\n“What are you doing on the mountain in this weather anyway?”\n\n\n\n“I got turned around and couldn’t find my way back to the trailhead.” I said as she handed me my coffee.\n\n“I’m glad I found this place, I thought I was gonna freeze to death for a minute out there.” I took a sip of the coffee. It felt like ecstasy as it dripped down my throat, warming my insides.\n\n“Is it normal for it to snow like this in the middle of June?”\n\n\n\n“I remember only one time since I’ve lived here that it’s snowed in Summer. It was many many years ago, when I was about your age. As you can tell I’m not from here,” She smiled.\n\n\n\nIt hadn’t occurred to me when I was being rescued from the icy cold, but she spoke with an American accent. \n\n\n\n“Oh yes, now that you mention it.” I said between sips of coffee.\n\n“Where are you from?”\n\n\n\n“I’m from a little town in Kansas called Columbus. I moved here right after I finished college. I met my dear husband over there on a trip me and my friends took and I’ve been in love with him ever since.” She smiled at her husband who in return continued to rock in his chair as if he hadn’t heard a word that was said.\n\n\n\n“That’s sweet” I said to break the silence. \n\n\n\n“Even after all these years he refuses to learn English.”\n\n\n\nThe old man continued to stare blankly at the fire and rock back and forth in his chair.\n\n\n\n“Could I use your phone? To call the park rangers about my friends. I haven’t been able to get cell service since I got to the mountains.” \n\n\n\n“Oh we don’t have a phone dear, we don’t use any electricity here. I’m really sorry about your friends, but you’re welcome to stay here tonight and I’m sure Wilhelm here will go with you in the morning to look for them.” She gestured to her blank husband.\n\n\n\n“Oh uhh ok. Thank you. I really appreciate it.” I said with a concerned tone to my voice.\n\n\n\nI finished my coffee and after a hot shower, the old lady led me to their guest room where I’d be staying the night. As I crossed the hall from the bathroom to the bedroom, I could see into the living room, Wilhelm was still rocking in his chair, staring at the fire. As I laid down in the bed, I could feel an itch in my throat, you know the kind you get before you get sick. I figured being out in the freezing cold for so long would probably give me something so I just took a preemptive ibuprofen from my backpack and laid down to sleep. \n\n\n\nThat night, I awoke with terrible chills and my head pounding. The blanket that was draped over me was drenched with sweat. The ibuprofen I took before sleeping was the last one in my pack, so I wandered out of the bedroom, across the hall to the bathroom in search of more painkillers. I turned on the water and splashed some on my face. Opening the medicine cabinet, I was greeted with a very odd assortment of jars. They were filled with what looked like herbs and fungi. I figured since these people didn’t have electricity, they were probably the kind who grew their own natural remedies as well. The jars had labels on them that specified what they were and what they did. I searched for one marked painkiller or anti-inflammatory. Sure enough, there was one with just that inscribed with sharpie and masking tape. It had the appearance of some sort of mushroom. Cracking it open, a sharp and vulgar odor hit my nostrils. It smelled like burnt rubber. The scent immediately caused me to think twice about taking whatever this was. However, being in immense pain guided my decision more than the hideous smell of the mushroom. I made sure to write down the name of it before taking it though, so I could research it after rejoining civilization. When the fungi hit my tongue, the taste hit me like a truck, it was much worse than the smell and caused me to gag before choking it down. \n\n\n\nI drank an ample amount of water to try and wipe the memory of the taste from my mouth, but it persisted. The effects of the strange medicine were immediately noticeable. My body began to tingle and I became dizzy. Walking out of the bathroom to the bedroom, I took another look down the hallway to the living room and stopped dead in my tracks. The old man was no longer sitting in his chair. I could see only half of his body as the doorframe cut off my view from the rest of him, but I could tell that he was naked. I slowly made my way down the hallway towards the living room. The rest of the man’s body was revealed as I got closer and my viewpoint was no longer obstructed by the door frame. The old man was right in front of the fire, facing towards it. I continued into the living room.\n\n\n\n“Hey dude, are you alright?” I said with a nervous quiver in my voice.\n\n\n\nHe muttered something quietly in German I assume, but I couldn’t hear what it was. Something about him caught my attention though and when I saw it, my stomach dropped. On the man’s left shoulder was the symbol of an owl with a cross on its forehead, the same one I had seen on the tree. The room started to spin, I got lightheaded and fell to the ground. When I regained consciousness, I was back in the bedroom, lying down on the bed. The only light provided in the room was coming from the hallway. I tried to sit up, but I couldn’t. It felt like in those dreams where you try to run, but you can’t, your body is too heavy. As much as I tried, I couldn’t move. My struggle was interrupted by several people entering my room. I could only see their silhouettes created by the warm, yellow light peering in through the doorway. Counting them, there were upwards of 15 people, all of them nude. Among them, I could make out the elderly couple. I tried to speak and ask them what was going on, but I couldn’t. They slowly gathered on either side of the bed and began to raise their arms above me. Once their arms were perpendicular to their bodies, they slowly got down on their knees. I could feel their cold touch all over me. Their hands were wet with some liquid that I can only assume was vinegar, as the smell was overpowering. All of a sudden, it felt as though the bed underneath me had dropped and I had the sensation of falling, like my chest was tied to an anvil and there was nothing below to stop it. My eyes rolled back into my head and my nervous system became overwhelmed.\n\n\n\nI awoke what I presume to be the next morning to the pleasant touch of the sun warming my face. Immediately shooting up, I expected to see the mysterious figures from the night before, but I was shocked to find that I was laying in a patch of grass, my backpack to my right. It was a typical June day, the sun beaming down beating on my face. Warm, warmer than usual. No snow or any sign of snow around. My illness was seemingly gone, but I still felt drained from whatever happened. Shakily making my way to my feet, I scanned my surroundings, seeing that I was near a trail, but no cabin in sight. I put on my pack and walked towards the trail. The surroundings felt familiar, the rocks, the trees. As I approached the trail, the owl symbol I had seen earlier beamed from the tree, capturing all of my attention. I stopped mid-step and stared at the symbol, processing exactly what this meant. Questions raced through my mind. Had the occupants of the cabin carried me all the way back here? Had I gone in a big circle? Had I gone anywhere at all in the first place? I put my concerns to the side and turned my attention to what I wanted most at this point, to go home. I started down the path in the direction of where I initially thought the trailhead to be, determined to find it this time. After about 20 minutes of walking, I heard something out in the distance. \n\n\n\n“Trent! Treeent!”\n\nI recognized the voice immediately. I quickened my pace toward the source of the shouting. \n\n\n\n“Henry!” I shouted in return.\n\n\n\nRounding the corner of the trail, I almost wept when I saw Henry and Kyle walking towards me. When they saw me, they began to run towards me while I stood frozen, awash with relief. \n\n\n\n“Where the fuck have you been dude?” Kyle said when they finally got close. \n\n\n\n“You wouldn’t believe it man, there was this cabin and these old naked people and I woke up in the grass and– wait what about you guys, where the fuck have *you* been.” \n\n\n\n“We’ve been looking for you dude, you disappeared yesterday after you went to go take a piss.” Henry said with frustration in his voice.\n\n\n\n“No, you guys disappeared.” I retaliated.\n\n\n\n“We’ve been shouting your name for the past 24 hours, walking up and down the trail. Where did you go?” Kyle asked.\n\n\n\n“I tried walking back to the trailhead, I figured you guys ditched me as a joke or something and went on without me. How did y’all survive the snow, you guys didn’t pack tents or anything right?”\n\n\n\n“What snow?” Henry asked, with a confused look on his face.\n\n\n\nI returned his look with one of equal confusion.\n\n\n\n“The snow. It started snowing yesterday after we split up.”\n\n\n\n“What do you mean man?” Kyle chuckled.\n\n“After we split up it got hotter, dude. It’s June, there’s not gonna be any snow up here.”\n\n\n\nI explained the rest of my night to my friends, the cabin, the old couple, the ritual that was performed on me, but they didn’t believe me. They figured I was either lying or took too many mushrooms and had a bad trip or something. In reality, I wasn’t entirely sure what happened to me was real either, God knows I didn’t want it to be. \n\n\n\nWe made our way back to the trailhead and after about an hour and a half were sitting on a train on our way back to Zurich. The suite was quiet the whole way back. We were all fatigued from this trip and were looking forward to being home. I was resting my head on the window sill, trying to somehow find sleep after the horrific experience I had just endured. I was recounting the events that happened in the cabin when I suddenly remembered writing down the name of the fungus that I took before everything happened. I pulled out the slip of paper it was scribbled on as well as my phone and quickly googled “Mycoterra Maleficium”. I tapped on the wikipedia article for it and scrolled through. “Should not be ingested, could cause hallucinations, vomiting, seizures, and diarrhea. Known for being the substance ingested during the 1974 mass suicide of the Black Dawn cult.” This was deeply concerning to say the least, I could feel myself start to sweat and my heart beat increase. How could I be that stupid to take a mushroom that I found in a stranger's house? I was livid with myself, but that was quickly replaced with fear. I clicked on the link for the Black Dawn on wikipedia and nearly dropped my phone when the page loaded. What else was going to greet me but the same owl symbol from the tree and the man’s back.\n\n",

        "content": "Jhonny, Jhonny.\n\nMy mother was shouting \"Jhonny, Jhonny\" as she ran toward me, covering my eyes to prevent me from witnessing that scene which would haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\nI was on my way home after riding my bicycle. A few meters from home, I heard a sound, like paper tearing behind me. Instinctively, I turned around, but I saw nothing. When I looked ahead again, in that brief fraction of a second, a burned person appeared. They were naked, and their body was so charred that it was impossible to tell whether they were male or female.\n\nStartled, I came to an abrupt stop and fell on top of them. Their skin burned like a metal slide under the midday sun. In that moment, I got a burn on the palm of my hand and heard a whisper. That person lowered their gaze, and our eyes met. They, at the end of their life. Me, at the beginning of the end of mine.\n\nI could barely hear them. It was as if they were trying to scream, but their vocal cords were so damaged that all I could hear were moans. After the initial shock, I screamed like never before because of the pain from the burn, the macabre scene, and the sheer terror. My mother arrived running and took me home.\n\nNothing was ever discovered about that body. The investigations yielded no results. Days passed, and I began to hear that same moan again. That is when my torture began. Every day, the screams grew more vivid and more intense.\n\nMy mom tried to get help by taking me to various psychologists and even shamans, but no one could explain it. It wasn’t a mental issue. The screams were real. I learned to live with those screams, although every day they became even more terrifying. Despite the torment, I managed to graduate as a physicist from college. I wasn’t the best or the brightest mind of my time, but I did earn some merits during my studies.\n\nIt was in college that I met Dr. Hollis. He resembled my grandfather, and he used to say that I reminded him of his nephew. Gradually, we became friends, and over time I became his right-hand man. He offered to pay the rest of my tuition if I agreed to work with him as his intern. I refused because I wanted to stand on my own, but still, I became his assistant and he paid for my travel expenses.\n\nHe never believed my story about the screams, but he was always kind to me. He was the father figure I never had.\n\nOne night, Dr. Hollis called me excitedly. He wanted to speak in person. When I arrived, he told me he had found a possible solution for time travel. After many trials and errors, he managed to send a mouse a few minutes into the past. The first time, it vanished without a trace. The second time, it returned, but its body was charred as if it had spent hours in an oven. He wanted me to help him improve that invention, which would revolutionize humanity.\n\nHe asked me to work with him unofficially. So after our regular work, I would go to his house to continue the experiments. It had been fifteen years since that incident with the charred body, yet the screams had never stopped tormenting me. Even though I could sometimes tolerate them, they still remained as intense as ever.\n\nOne night, just as we were about to leave, the machine turned on. We had sent something from the future into the past. It was a body.\n\nDr. Hollis was frightened. We did not know at what moment in the future the trip had been made, nor who the person was. They were burned, parts of their body completely charred, yet the center bore only superficial burns.\n\nDays passed without us touching the machine until I discovered the reason the bodies were arriving like that. It was an energy cell, one that released an immense burst of heat within the machine. Once I realized this, I corrected the calculations.\n\nWhen we were about to test the adjustments with a mouse, the screams changed.\n\n\"Jhonny, don't do it, please.\"\n\nIt was my own voice.\n\nStartled, I stepped back and, unintentionally, pushed Dr. Hollis into the machine. He was sent into the past by mistake. He was the body we had discovered that night.\n\nI became obsessed with fixing my mistakes. I wanted to save the doctor, to avoid seeing that person that afternoon. If I hadn’t seen them, the screams would never have begun, and I would never have killed the only father figure I ever had.\n\nBut the more I adjusted the machine, the clearer the voices became. I begged myself to stop, to not continue. But I was stubborn.\n\nAfter two years since the doctor's death, I believed I had finally fixed the errors. I converted the machine into a clock so that the heat would disperse into the air. Or so I thought.\n\nI noted down the date of the trip: that afternoon. I would be there to avoid seeing that man. Finally, I understood the clock. The sound of tearing paper was heard once again, and I began to travel back in time.\n\nEverything was going well until the heat started to rise.\n\nI couldn't move. The suit that was meant to protect me began to disintegrate; then my clothes, my hair. I felt my skin swell, bubbles bursting underneath it. My nails detached one by one.\n\nI screamed as I watched myself trying to fix the errors. I screamed at myself not to do it, that it was a mistake. I saw my life in reverse as my body burned and continued screaming in pain. The smell of burnt flesh filled my nostrils, and moments later my lungs burned like hell; breathing was like dying, yet that pain was the only thing keeping me awake.\n\nI thought about my mother. They would never find my body. She would believe that I abandoned her, that I forgot about her. Then, Dr. Hollis crossed my mind. Had he suffered the same, or perhaps worse? He wasn’t even wearing a suit. Maybe his death was quicker, I hoped that would ease my conscience.\n\nThe journey lasted twenty minutes, and the entire trip was pure torment. My voice was shattered. I could only emit agonizing moans.\n\nFinally, I heard the sound of tearing paper once more. The same sound I had heard so many years ago when I was just a child.\n\nI fell, my flesh burning red, on the outskirts of my house. I saw a boy on a bicycle turning to look at me, terrified, and falling onto me, burning the palm of his hand with my own body.",

        "content": "I'm sitting here looking out the window of my childhood home and since yesterday and I can't see a way out. I suppose I am writing this just to get some perspective.\n\nYesterday the weather was like most early days, cool and damp. It still felt surreal, only a week ago I got the news, Mom decided to get a DNR order. I suppose I knew this was coming for awhile, she had been sick for some time but it still hurt. \n\nShe was still sleeping as I did my morning chores for her, the farm animals needed tending and I had yet to collect the mail down the hill. Something seemed to have spooked the animals, the horses were restless and the goats kept crying despite how  soothing I spoke, when I offered food or butt scratches. I figured some coyotes passed by last night as I heard their yipping and howling all night.\n\nAfter finishing up I made my way to the mailbox, mostly bills and junk as looked through them. Only looking up to see four horse riders making their way down the road at a trot. I gave them a nod before walking back up to the house. \n\nWashing my hands before finding the tv remote I turned it on. Despite her various states of lucidity mom liked to watch the news every morning. Some new war in the middle east, possible disease outbreaks, grocery prices on the rise, just another day in paradise.\n\nI sit on the bed with her, still sleeping, a picture of Dad on the nightstand, much happier times. It was a old photo back before he got seven bullets in him in a standoff outside a meth house he was clearing. Of course this was before both my brothers moved away, one to start his own family, the other to join the army.\n\nOne thing I didn't expect to see was a old stuffed rabbit, since I came home I just hadn't noticed it somehow. I stood and walked over to it. Picking it up the memories of when I was a young kid, anyone could see that it was loved with how ratty the fur is, one of its ears bent at a odd angle from falling asleep with it so many times. \n\nThe little rabbit was still wearing a little purple bow around its neck. Matthew 18 10 inscribed on it. Just then I heard a emergency broadcast on the TV.\n\nTurning to look dropping the toy to look. between beeps the news changed showing rolling text on screen.\n\n\"Shelter in place. Do not go outside until there in a all clear notice from the Federal government. Close all exits to your home. This is not a test.\" The text repeated over and over again through the beeps.\n\nI glanced at mom, I didn't see any tornado watches and the weather wasn't terrible just a moment ago.\n\n\"How the hell am I going to move you?\" I asked myself. Then I heard the screaming, rushing to the windows I saw the animals in the pasture writhing on the ground, screaming. The grass under them shriveling. The sky turned red. In tornado alley I was used to seeing the sky change color but my stomach sank. I could see the smoke coming from town in the distance. I couldn't see what it was but I could see things besides just the smoke floating up in the distantness. Yet all I could see was the writhing animals, I fell to my knees  covering my ears as they screamed. The land continued to shrivel up like unwatered house plant. Yet the horses were just screaming in pain.\n\nIt went on like that for who know how long before they stopped. I looked up to see the earth had turned ashy with the end of the screaming. I shakily stood up to check on mom. She was still sleeping but I could tell It wouldn't be long. I pulled out my phone, turning off the tv I tried calling my brothers. Both didn't answer, I tried my friends, it immediately went to voicemail. In desperation I dialed nine one one. I held my breath hoping someone would answer, someone could help.\n\nAfter a few rings I heard a woman's voice \"I'm sorry but all our lines are busy right now please wait.\" I held onto moms hand. I could tell she was struggling to breath as we waited. after a hour I got up to grab a bottle of water, after two I laid down next to her as she started to gasp. I held her hand as I cried into a pillow. next to my own mom as she slowly died. I don't know how long it was  until I passed out.\n\nI woke around one AM according to my slowly dying phone. The sky looked the same but as I glanced over seeing mom's chest wasn't moving anymore. I put my fingers to her neck, part of me hoping to to feel something. Yet I couldn't feel any heartbeat. I wiped my still wet face before getting out of bed with her. I was truly alone.\n\nSome time later I got up to get some more water, closing her bedroom door behind me. I didn't feel hungry but my mouth was dry. Yet as I walked I could see something out the windows. Some lights in the sky not matching the deep red. They were getting closer incredibly fast. I rushed to the basement, mom was gone but maybe I stood a chance. I punched in the code to the gun safe before pulling out some of the weapons and ammunition.\n\nI rushed back up the stairs quickly loading up the weapons. I could see the lights outside as I mentally prepared myself. Then I heard it. From mom's room I heard the floors creek. \"Mom?\" I asked in a whisper.\n\nAfter a moment I heard a knock coming from her door. \"Lets go outside sweetie.\" I heard her say. The knocks were gentle growing more forceful. \"It is ok, I am ok now and you will be too.\" My hands shaking as I raised a gun to the door. \n\n\"You aren't coming through that door!\" I said breathing heavy as I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins.\n\nI heard footsteps walking away from the door then a *Bang* then the sound of shattering glass. I slowly moved to the door, opening it to see the bed empty and the window shattered. keeping the weapon aimed I walked over peaking through to see footprints in the dirt a few paces out before disappearing. Yet I could see the strange lights above the porch overhang.\n\nThey let out a strange buzzing sounding, In a moment of frustration I shot at them *bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.* They didn't move but that buzzing(?) got louder in response. I backed out of the room closing the door before dropping the gun. and putting my head in my hands.\n\nSometime later as my stomach started to growl I picked myself up along with dads old gun. As I walked to the mostly empty kitchen I grabbed a apple. munching on it I walked around the house aimlessly. Eventually I found myself in the home office. Sitting at the desk I look out the window to see my old stuffed rabbit. sitting on the windowsill. Staring at its unblinking eyes for a moment before seeing the writing on the glass.\n\n\"Nolite Timere\"\n\nI looked back into the unblinking eyes of the stuffed rabbit before opening the cylinder of dad's old gun. I took out five of the spent bullet casings. I couldn't decide what a I was more afraid of, taking the bullet or walking outside.\n\nYet I hesitated, the computer was still running so I figured I would delay the inevitable. Maybe someone will read this. Maybe this is wasted words. Regardless I said what I wanted to. I think I can hear distant speaking, the lights around my house keep moving. I wish they would just break in. Then maybe I wouldn't be so scared to use my last shot.\n\nUpdate: Just as I worked up the courage and put the gun in my mouth, then I heard it. The voices, I could hear my family. All of them begging me to come outside. I cant see them through the windows but I can hear them. God I'm scared. I don't know how long I can last. They are getting louder.",

        "content": "My name is Eliot, and I live in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\n\nI don’t mean that in the way that I have other people living near me.\n\nNo, I don’t live in a small town.\n\nI mean it in a real, isolating way.\n\n\n\nMy house is about an hour’s drive to even the nearest small town, surrounded by miles of thick and tall trees, even the grass was a bit too tall, where roads seemed to stretch forever before fading into nothing.\n\n\n\nThere are no neighbors for miles.\n\n\n\nThe only other living creatures near me are the deer that wander into the yard once in a while.\n\nAnd sometimes the occasional coyote in the distance\n\n\n\nI never mind it though, it's peaceful.\n\nI’ve always liked the quiet—especially after living in a large city for years.\n\nSure, my place here is small, but I made it my home.\n\nIt’s a modest farmhouse with a few acres of land, the sort you would never find in a city,\n\nWith overgrown fields and a small, rambling garden, Ima be honest, I’ve barely kept up with it.\n\n\n\nOh and not to mention, I’m not entirely alone. I have Harley, she’s a Bernese mountain dog, thick fur with beautiful blue eyes.\n\nShe’s been with me for almost four years now, and she’s my only company out here.\n\nShe’s always been a loyal companion, even when it feels like the isolation is closing in.\n\n\n\nI love the way she nuzzles my leg when asking for a walk, or how she curls up beside me in the evenings, her head resting on my knee as if she could sense when something’s wrong.\n\n\n\nShe’s my best friend out here.\n\n\n\nBut last night, that's when everything started to go wrong.\n\n\n\nI had settled into the couch after a long day, just trying to relax with a book in hand.\n\nThe warmth of the fire crackling in the fireplace and the soft hum of the house made it easy to drift into that comfortable space between awakeness and sleep.\n\nHarley was there, of course—she had been lying beside me, the steady rise and fall of her chest soothing.\n\nShe had fallen asleep about an hour ago, her soft snores mixing with the crackling fire.\n\n\n\nThen I heard it.\n\n\n\nThe barking.\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t anything unusual at first. A sharp, echoing bark, like something was challenging the stillness of the night. But there was something off about it.\n\n\n\nI turned my gaze to Harley. She was still lying there, completely motionless.\n\n\n\nNo perked ears. No wagging tail.\n\n\n\nShe was out cold—not even reacting to the sound.\n\n\n\nThat didn’t make sense, Harley was always a vigilant dog, especially at night. She reacts to every sound—every rustle in the trees, every shift in the wind. But now? Nothing.\n\n\n\nI rubbed my eyes and listened again, the barking came from outside—distant but close enough that it felt like it was calling to me\n\n\n\nI stood up, my heart beating faster. Something wasn’t right. I walked toward the window, peering into the darkness. The barking kept coming. Louder now.\n\n\n\nI took a step back, my breath catching in my throat as the barking echoed through the still night. It was sharp, aggressive, and persistent, like something calling out for attention. \n\nA chill crawled up my spine, the sound piercing the quiet calmness of the house.\n\n\n\nI glanced over at Harley, her body still and motionless on the couch eyes closed.\n\n\n\nIt didn’t make sense.\n\n\n\nHow could she be so calm with that loud, persistent barking outside? She was usually the first to bark at anything, even the slightest disturbance. But now? Nothing.\n\nNot a twitch, not even a stir.\n\n\n\nThe sound seemed to grow louder with every passing second, its urgency building as if something—someone was growing desperate. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and a sense of dread settled deep in my stomach, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.\n\n\n\nMy legs became unsteady, my heart beating in my chest as I looked further outside.\n\nI had to see it. I had to know what was out there.  \n  \n\n\nThe window was cold beneath my fingers as I gently pushed the curtains out of view,\n\nWhen I opened the window, the night air crept inside with a soft, musty scent of earth and dampness.\n\nI peered into the darkness, the moonlight barely cutting through the thick trees that surrounded the house.\n\n\n\nI squinted into the darkness, and my breath got caught in my throat. The barking had grown louder, sharper, relentless.\n\nMy heart thudded in my chest, but then my gaze focused on a dog in the yard.\n\n\n\nIt looked like Harley.\n\n\n\nNo—it was Harley.\n\n\n\nBut something was wrong.\n\n\n\nI froze, feeling my pulse race as the reality of the situation began to claw at me.\n\nThe dog outside wasn’t moving, its fur, thick and dark, glinted faintly in the moonlight, just like Harley’s did. But.. no. No, it couldn’t be her. Could it?\n\n\n\nI turned quickly to look at Harley, who was still lying on the couch. Unmoving. Silent.\n\nHer eyes closed, her body stretched out in the same familiar pose.\n\nShe was there, she had to be there.\n\nBut the dog outside…\n\n\n\nThe bandana.\n\n\n\nThe pink bandana that I had never seen off of her neck, the one she always wore, was clearly visible around the dog’s neck in the yard.\n\n\n\nIt was Harley’s bandana.\n\n\n\nBut wait, Harley didn’t have it on right now. I looked back at the couch—she was still there, completely still.\n\n\n\nThe barking from outside was so close. Now it was real—I could feel it in my bones.\n\nI turned back to the window, but the dog outside was still there, frozen in place, its eyes seemed to glint in the darkness.\n\n\n\nThen I realized something, I didn’t take off Harley’s bandana nor was it in a place I would put it.\n\n\n\nThe dog outside was Harley.\n\n\n\nSo what was the dog inside?\n\n\n\nI could feel the air thicken around me, suffocating me, and my heart began to race faster, pounding so fast that I thought I might lose control of my thoughts, I started at the dog outside, frozen, staring at me. It didn’t move, but its eyes—those blue eyes—seemed desperate. As if it were waiting for something.\n\n\n\nI looked at Harley again.\n\n\n\nShe was still lying on the couch, perfectly still, her head resting on her paws, not moving an inch. No twitches. No little sighs. Nothing.\n\n\n\nWhat the hell is happening?\n\n\n\nI blinked hard, hoping to shake off the overwhelming sense of wrongness that had settled in my chest. I had to make sure. I had to confirm what I already knew deep down.\n\n\n\nslowly, I turned my back on the window and walked back to the couch. My legs felt like they were made of jelly, but I forced myself to move. I stood over her staring at the body lying there, unmoving.\n\n\n\nI reached down to touch her. I had to. I needed some reassurance that it was still her.\n\nMy hand hovered over her fur, and I hesitated. But then I placed it gently on her back, feeling the familiar warmth of her thick coat under my palm.\n\n\n\nBut something isn’t right.\n\n\n\nI pulled my hand away quickly, Her fur—it felt too stiff. Rigid. There was no softness to it like I remembered.\n\n\n\nMy breath got caught in my throat, and my heart skipped a beat.\n\n\n\nI staggered back, mind scrambling for an explanation that wouldn’t make me lose my sanity.\n\nI couldn’t think. I couldn’t breathe. The truth was too much to process. But the pieces were all there.\n\n\n\nThe dog outside. The one with Harley’s bandana. It was her.\n\n\n\nI stumbled back toward the window, my vision starting to blur as I tried to see past the creeping shadows. The dog outside was still standing there., unmoving, staring at me.\n\nThat was when I realized, it hadn’t been Harley in the house the past few days.\n\nIt had been something else. Something pretending. Something that had worn her skin and taken her place.\n\n\n\nI backed away from the window, my breath coming in short, shallow gasps.\n\n\n\nThe dog inside—that thing—wasn’t lying there anymore\n\n\n\nit was staring.\n\n\n\nSilent.\n\n\n\nWaiting.\n\n\n\nWatching.\n\n\n\nThats when I ran out of my house, I ran towards the yard, my legs heavy, each step feeling like it was dragging me deeper into some unseen nightmare.\n\nMy breath came in jagged gasps, my heart pounding so loudly it drowned out every other sound, including the relentless barking that seemed to come from nowhere.\n\nThe moonlight shone on the trees, casting long shadows across the yard.\n\n\n\nI reached the spot where I had seen the real Harley at, hoping against all reason that it was somehow a mistake, my mind playing a trick on me, thats right, maybe I had imagined it.\n\nBut when I got there, my feet suddenly stopped, and I froze in place.\n\n\n\nThe ground was cold beneath me, but it was the sight in front of me that froze me solid.\n\nThere I saw her pink bandana, bloodied.\n\n\n\nAs I stood there, staring at the bloodied pink bandana, my thoughts began to spiral. My mind tried to deny it, but deep down, I knew. I knew what I had seen outside—what I had thought was Harley—wasn’t a dog at all. It was a creature.\n\n\n\nSomething that had taken her form, wearing her skin like a twisted mask. And now, the truth slammed into me like a train—Harley’s spirit had been trying to warn me.\n\n\n\nI had no time to mourn, I had to get the fuck out of there, I didn’t have the luxury of understanding it fully before it all shattered.\n\n\n\nThen, around me the air grew cold.\n\n\n\nI didn’t hear it at first. There was no sound—just a presence, something thick and heavy in the air, but then, a low, guttural growl vibrated through the ground, like a dark, primal whisper of hunger.\n\n\n\nMy heart stopped.\n\n\n\nBefore I could turn around, I felt it. The breath, hot and rancid, on the back of my neck.\n\n\n\nI just ran. I ran as fast as I could.\n\n",

        "content": "I awoke with a start to a gnawing sensation below my diaphragm. I checked my phone. 3:42AM. I had to be up for class around 7AM, so I was irritated that my sleep had been broken so suddenly. That irritation was swiftly washed over by dread as the gnawing sensation gradually intensified.\n\nI groaned and rolled onto my side. My roommate, who likes to stay up late, threw me a worried glance from her side of the dorm.\n\n“Are you good? I thought you were asleep.” She inquired, looking back at me from her computer. I curled into a ball, but that only seemed to worsen the sensation.\n\n“Uh, I don’t know,” I said after a moment of hesitation as I mentally tracked the pain through my body. Appendicitis? Food poisoning? Cramps? Kidney stone? Intestinal issues? All the possibilities raced through my hypochondriatic mind. I tugged my phone from its charging cable and tried googling symptoms, but instead got lost in a rabbit hole of possibilities.\n\n“Well, I’ll be here if you need anything. Hope you feel better.” My roommate offered me one more sympathetic gaze before turning back to her computer.\n\nI returned to laying on my back, something that usually helps to subside the pain of a period cramp. How long would this have to go on before I was justified in calling for help? I couldn’t afford to miss class in the morning. I had a chem exam. Lowering my phone, I let my mind be engulfed by the pain as I again attempted to locate its source. \nI decided I would wait it out, a decision I would soon regret.\n\nThe next half hour was comprised of me stifling sobs as the pain traversed my abdomen. The sensation mimicked that of a bad period cramp, only it was a tad higher than a period cramp should be. It was hot and burning, like fingernails dragging on skin. Pushing and prodding. A sudden sharp jab in my lower left abdomen sent my mind into a panic. \n\nI snatched my water bottle from next to my bed and began to chug, hoping to flush out whatever was going on inside me. That’s when, thinking back, I heard what I can only presume was a voice. Soft and nearly unintelligible, but nonetheless a voice.\n\n“More…”\n\nI choked on my water at the sound. Looking over at my roommate, she was still hunched over her computer, headphones in. My blood  ran a cold blue that only for a moment distracted me from the searing red I still felt in my abdomen. After hearing nothing more, I took another swig and dismissed the sound as a manifestation of my dreary, pain-infested 4AM mind.\nAn hour later, it the pain became too much to bare and I had my roommate drive me to the hospital.\n\nI am a bit embarrassed to write this here, but the doctors decided to perform an endoscopy to see what was wrong. The process was difficult and uncomfortable. I almost regretted not trying to tough out the pain a little longer. Afterwards, I could hear murmuring from the other side of the door as the doctors paced between rooms, distress evident in their voices. When they finally entered to show me the pictures, I nearly fell to the ground.\n\nAmidst the flesh and tissue there were human-like bite marks.",

        "content": "[The Skyfall (Part 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/t1g6eYLwzk)\n[The Skyfall (Part 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/FJTgZn93CB)\n\nHello again.\n\nI don’t know if anyone is actually reading this.\n\nThe last post got 16 upvotes. No comments. Not a single reply, not even some hollowed-out attempt at reassurance. Just a number. \n\nEither no one has anything to say, or the comments won’t go through. Maybe the internet isn’t dead, not completely, but it’s been gutted, its insides picked clean. Maybe whatever ghosts still lurk in the wires are filtering words like bone from broth, stripping them down, leaving only husks behind.\n\nA number is simple, a number.\n\nBut a voice? A voice is a lifeline. A voice is proof.\n\nMaybe a voice is too much.\n\nOr maybe I really am whispering into the corpse of a world.\n\nBut I have to believe someone saw it.\n\nBecause if I let go of that—if I let myself think, even for a second, that I am speaking to no one—then what’s left?\n\nThe land is still rising. The earth is peeling itself upward in layers, swallowing what was built over it, undoing every attempt to carve it into something unnatural. \n\nThe roads are vanishing beneath moss and stone, breaking apart like old scabs. The highways have broken into ravines, veins of molten silver running through the cracks like liquid mercury. The cities—the ones still standing—are listing sideways, sinking, their bones too rigid to bend with the shift.\n\nEvery day, the world takes back more of itself.\n\nAnd Hawthorn and I build higher.\n\nBecause if we don’t, we will be swallowed too.\n\nThere is no moon anymore.\n\nAt night, the sky is bare—just an expanse of black. The stars are there, but they feel thinner, like light stretched too far over a void much too deep.\n\nThen morning comes, and the sun rises—too bright. It hangs in the sky like an exposed nerve, the light clinical, lacking the warmth it used to carry. The shadows it casts are too crisp, like there is no atmosphere left to soften them. It makes everything feel brittle, as if the whole world has been overexposed, one wrong move away from splintering apart.\n\nThe Skyfall, as we’ve started calling it, hasn’t stopped. The moon’s remains still drift in slow descent, twisting midair into fire, wind, and ruin. Some shards burn out before they reach the ground. Others don’t. \n\nThe land continues to rise—not in quakes, not in explosions of rock, but in slow hunger. It swells beneath us, reclaiming itself piece by piece.\n\nWe shouldn’t be here.\n\nThe old world—the one we paved and poisoned and choked beneath steel and concrete—doesn’t exist anymore.\n\nHawthorn, on the other hand, worked like a man with a wind-up key at his back. Every movement was a rhythm, a function of necessity—cut, lift, hammer, repeat. No wasted breath, just the steady percussion of survival. His sleeves were shoved up past his elbows, forearms streaked with dirt and sawdust, hands raw from rope and wood and the refusal to stop. Sweat gathered at his temples, darkening the edges of his hair, but he didn’t pause to wipe it away. His jaw was clenched in that way it always was when he was thinking but not talking.\n\nThe second floor was starting to take shape.\n\nA frame, a foundation, something resembling a future—not the kind we’d planned for, but the kind we had now. He was reinforcing the outer beams, securing what would be the walls once we had enough tarp and scavenged wood to seal them in. \n\nWe were climbing as the earth rose beneath us, a game of height and hunger, of fighting to stay above the ground before it decided we belonged to it.\n\nI watched him for a long moment, then exhaled. “Take a break.”\n\nHe didn’t. Of course he didn’t.\n\nThe hammer came down in another sharp crack, another nail driven deep.\n\n“You’re gonna burn out,” I muttered, dragging myself up from where I was securing a tarp to the railing. My body protested, still sluggish and sore, but I ignored it. The pain was an old companion by now. My muscles burned, my hands ached, my ribs were tight with the pressure of milk that had nowhere to go. \n\nThe thought lodged itself in my throat. \n\nHawthorn finally set the hammer down, exhaling through his nose. He swiped his wrist across his forehead, then gave me a look. “You’re telling me to take a break?”\n\nFair. I hadn’t really stopped either. Sleep didn’t come easy. \n\nMy body still expected to wake up for her, to answer her cries, to hold and feed and comfort her. But there was no cries. \n\nJust that constant feeling—like I’d left the oven on, like I’d misplaced my keys, like I was missing a limb but could still feel the ghost of it.\n\nI nodded toward the small pack of supplies near the ladder. “You eat, I eat.”\n\nHawthorn smirked, the expression small but real. “That an order?”\n\n“Damn right it is.”\n\nHe huffed a laugh, shaking his head, then crossed the half-built floor to grab the pack. He sank down next to me, the wood creaking beneath his weight, and dug through our rations—mostly canned goods and whatever dried food we’d salvaged. He tossed me a pack of jerky and a bottle of water, then cracked open a can of beans with his pocketknife.\n\nFor a moment, we just sat.\n\nThe wind sifted through tree branches, carrying with it the distant sound of something collapsing, something breaking apart in the ruins below. The world wasn’t done changing yet. The land was still rising, still shifting, still consuming. But for now, we were above it.\n\nHawthorn chewed, swallowed, then spoke. “You think she’s still in the NICU?”\n\nI didn’t answer immediately. I wasn’t sure what answer I wanted.\n\nInstead, I looked out over what remained of the world—the skeletal remains of buildings swallowed by earth, the distant glow of molten scars where the moon had punctured through the crust, the way the sky stretched on without its missing piece. I thought of the last post I made, of the hollow 16 upvotes and the silence that followed.\n\n“Yeah,” I murmured. “I do.”\n\nAnd then, quieter—almost too quiet to hear: “I just don’t know if I want her to be.”\n\nHawthorn handed me a strip of jerky and a bottle of water, the plastic cool against my palm. I twisted off the cap and took a sip.\n\n“Saw something move earlier,” he said, breaking the quiet.\n\nI paused mid-chew. The jerky was tough, the salt biting against my tongue. “Move?”\n\nHe nodded toward the horizon, where the land had begun to rise into something unrecognizable, hills swollen with silver scars, roads twisted into jagged veins. “Not the land. Something on it.”\n\nI followed his gaze, searching past the distant ruins, the glint of something metallic embedded in the shifting terrain. The world was still eating itself, digesting the things we built, spitting out something new. But for all the movement, for all the change, it had been empty. No birds. No animals. No bodies. Just us and the wind, and the groaning of the earth reshaping itself beneath our feet.\n\n“Animal?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.\n\nHawthorn shook his head. “Too big. Too fast.”\n\nA slow, creeping unease settled beneath my ribs. We hadn’t seen another living person since the first night. Not since the moon shattered, not since the first fragments speared through the cities like divine execution. It was just us and the land, breathing in what was left.\n\nBut I’d wondered—if the earth was reclaiming itself, if it was shedding our structures like old skin, then what else was it bringing back?\n\n“You think there’s others out there?” I asked, keeping my voice even.\n\nHawthorn didn’t answer right away. He unscrewed the water bottle, took a slow sip, rolled his shoulders like he was shaking something off. \n\n“Wouldn’t surprise me.”\n\nI tore off another piece of jerky, chewing slow.\n\nFor a while, we ate in silence. \n\nThe kind that felt wrong. Because how could we sit here, side by side, passing water and rationing food, while the world remade itself beneath us? How could I swallow while city blocks vanished, while roads turned to ravines, while the trees swallowed the remnants of steel and bone?\n\nHow could I sit here, eating dried meat and stale crackers, while my daughter lay somewhere far below, in a place that might not exist anymore?\n\nI closed my eyes. Exhaled.\n\nHawthorn shifted beside me, gaze still fixed on the horizon.\n\n“You ever wonder if we were supposed to make it?” he asked. His voice was much quieter than before.\n\nI swallowed, throat tight. “What do you mean?”\n\nHe exhaled through his nose, tapping his fingers once against his knee. “Just—if the land’s taking back what’s owed… why are we still here?”\n\nI didn’t have an answer for that.\n\nSo I just looked out at the horizon, at the swollen, shifting land, at the silver glint of something I couldn’t quite make sense of.\n\nAnd I kept chewing.\n\nHawthorn tossed the last piece of jerky into his mouth, chewing slow, eyes distant. Below us, the world shifted in quiet hunger, the land rising inch by inch, swallowing what it was owed. The tree we had made our home trembled with it, roots gripping soil that no longer wanted to hold steady.\n\n“We need a plan,” I said finally, pressing the heel of my hand into my forehead. The exhaustion was creeping in, threading itself into my skull, but I forced myself to sit straighter, to stay sharp.\n\nHawthorn stretched his legs out in front of him, leaning back on his palms. “We have a plan.”\n\nI scoffed. “Climbing is not a plan. It’s a stalling tactic.”\n\nHe raised a brow. “And you got a better idea?”\n\nI wanted to say yes. I wanted to tell him I had some genius revelation, some secret trick, some way out. But I didn’t.\nSo instead, I sighed, rubbed my temple, and muttered, “I just don’t want to die in a goddamn treehouse, man.”\n\nHawthorn chuckled—an actual laugh, a rare thing, something small but warm in the cold wreckage of our world. “Yeah,” he said. “Me neither.”\n\nWe watched the horizon as we finished eating, the sky vast and empty. Where the moon should have been, there was only absence—a hollow, yawning nothingness. No stars. Just the dark. And beneath it, the monoliths of moonrock loomed.\n\nMy skin prickled. The wind twisted around us, a breath too intentional, too present. I swore it was whispering.\n\nI shook it off, pushed forward. “Okay, so what happens when we run out of tree?”\n\nHawthorn was quiet for a moment. Then, he wiped his hands on his jeans and exhaled through his nose. “We build past it.”\n\nI gave him a look. “And attach it to what, exactly? The sky?”\n\n“No.” He nudged his chin toward the closest structure still standing—a water tower, its metal frame warped but intact, stretching above the ruins of a drowned town. \n\n“That.”\n\nI stared at it, chewing the inside of my cheek.\n\nIt wasn’t a terrible idea. If the ground was rising, then anything left standing would be worth climbing. The water tower had height, metal we could reinforce, an actual foundation—one not dependent on something that was still alive and could still fail us.\n\n“We’d have to get to it first,” I said.\n\nHawthorn nodded. “Yeah.”\n\n“And it’s, what? Fifty yards away? Over rising land and God knows what else?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nI groaned, raking a hand through my hair. Bad plan. Risky as hell. But if we wanted to keep breathing, we needed something better than ‘just keep climbing.’\n\nI bit my lip. “We’d need a bridge.”\n\nHawthorn smirked. “Now you’re thinking.”\n\nI ignored the warmth in my chest, the brief flicker of something almost like hope. “What do we even have for that?”\n\n“We can reinforce the platform here first. Make it wide enough to balance the extension. Then we salvage. Take wood from wherever we can get it, find metal where we can. Build in sections so we don’t waste material.” He tapped his fingers against his knee, already deep in thought. “We could use tension cables if we find any. If not, rope lashing, angled supports—hell, even sheets of metal for stability.”\n\nI stared at him. “How the hell do you just know this?”\n\nHawthorn gave me a dry look. “I’m a carpenter, Heather.”\n\n“Yeah, but—treehouses. Cabinets. Cool bookshelves. Not—” I waved vaguely at the apocalypse around us. “This.”\n\nHe huffed a laugh. “Building is building. Same principles apply. Just… bigger stakes.”\n\nBigger stakes. That was one way to put it.\n\nI swallowed, looking at the water tower again, at the way it stood against the sky like the last stubborn thing refusing to fall.\n\nI nodded. “Alright.”\n\nHawthorn pushed himself up, already reaching for his tools. “Then we start now.”\n\nI don’t know if I’ll be able to post again. The power here is unstable, something Hawthorn and I have been trying to patch together with whatever solar scraps we could find. We’re siphoning what little connection still crawls through the veins of dead cities. I don’t know if it will hold.\n\nBut if anyone out there is still listening—if anyone out there sees this—\n\nWe’re making our way higher.\n\nWe’re building.\n\nAnd the land is still coming.",

Just exhausted.\n\nI live alone in a third-floor apartment. Nothing fancy. Just a place to sleep, shower, and kill time before work starts again.\n\nAs soon as I locked the door and tossed my keys on the counter, I felt it.\n\nThe silence.\n\nNot the peaceful kind. The kind that’s **too heavy.** The kind where you suddenly become aware of the smallest sounds. The ticking clock. The refrigerator’s hum. My own breathing.\n\nThen, my phone vibrated.\n\n**1 New Message.**\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"Hey. Don’t scream.\"*\n\nI frowned. A prank? A wrong number? I almost ignored it.\n\nAnother text.\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"Put your phone down slowly. And don’t turn around.\"*\n\nI stopped breathing.\n\nBehind me, the hallway to my bedroom was pitch black. I didn’t move. I didn’t even blink.\n\nI typed back, my fingers shaking. “Who is this?”\n\nDelivered. No response.\n\nThen, my phone vibrated again.\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"You have* *10 seconds* *before he moves. Walk to the kitchen. Now.\"*\n\nI couldn’t help it. My eyes darted toward the darkness. And for a split second—\n\nI thought I saw something shift.\n\nNot a person. Not exactly.\n\nJust… something.\n\nMy pulse hammered in my ears. I didn’t know why, but I listened.\n\nI stepped into the kitchen, legs numb. The air was thick, pressing against my chest like I was drowning in it. My apartment suddenly felt wrong.\n\nAnother text.\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"Good. He didn’t see you move. Now, open the fridge. Make it look normal.\"*\n\nI hesitated. My fingers curled around the fridge handle. My phone vibrated again.\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"DO IT. Now.\"*\n\nI yanked it open. The white light **f**looded the dim kitchen. My heart pounded as I scanned the shelves—nothing was there except leftovers and some beer.\n\nI grabbed my phone, sweat slick on my fingers. \"What the hell is happening?\"\n\nA pause. Three dots appeared.\n\nThen—\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"I found your phone outside your apartment.\"*\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"The problem is… you’re still inside.\"*\n\nMy ears started ringing. My hands were trembling so hard, I nearly dropped the phone.\n\nAnother message.\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"There was a man standing by your door when I found this. I thought he was leaving. But he’s not. He’s still there. Listening.\"*\n\nI turned toward the door. Slowly.\n\nMy heart clawed at my ribs as I took one step forward. Then another. The air was suffocating now, thick with something unseen.\n\nI pressed my palm against the door. It felt… warm. Like someone had been touching the other side.\n\nI didn’t want to look.\n\nI really, really didn’t.\n\nBut I had to.\n\nI leaned into the peephole.\n\nFor a second—**nothing.**\n\nThen—\n\nA bloodshot eye.\n\nPressed so close, I could see every red vein bursting through the milky white\\*\\*.\\*\\* The iris was a sickly yellow\\*\\*.\\*\\* The skin around it—split open, raw, twitching\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nAnd then—\n\nIt blinked\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nNot normally. Not like a human.\n\nSideways\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nI stumbled back so fast I crashed into the counter. My vision blurred. My heart slammed against my ribs. My body went numb.\n\nThen—\n\n**Tap.**\n\n**Tap.**\n\n**Tap.**\n\nSlow, deliberate. Knuckles rapping against the wood.\n\nThen a voice—low, wet, and wrong.\n\n*\"I know you’re awake now.\"*\n\nThe doorknob twisted.\n\nNot a full turn. Just… testing.\n\nI wanted to run. Move. But my body refused to listen.\n\nThen—\n\nMy phone vibrated.\n\nThe buzzing echoed in the silence. I barely managed to look at the screen.\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"Don’t run. Don’t scream. Whatever you do—don’t look up.\"*\n\nI stopped breathing.\n\n**Don’t look up?**\n\nI wasn’t looking up. I was staring at my phone. But the moment I read those words; my brain started whispering:\n\n*\"What’s above you?\"*\n\nI didn’t want to know.\n\nI really, really didn’t.\n\nThen—\n\nSomething dripped onto my cheek.\n\nWarm. Sticky. Thick.\n\nI swallowed. My throat was dry. I forced myself not to move.\n\nAnother text.\n\n**Unknown Number:** *\"You looked, didn’t you?\"*\n\nMy blood turned to ice.\n\nBecause I had.\n\nAnd now—\n\nIt was **too late.**\n\nThe ceiling shifted.\n\nNot like a crack or a creak—like something crawling. Something unfolding, stretching, dripping. My breath caught in my throat. I wanted to scream—\n\nBut the sound wouldn’t come out.\n\nThen—\n\nEverything went black.\n\nNot the lights. Not my vision.\n\nSomething covered my face.\n\nCold, damp fingers pressed against my eyes, forcing them shut.\n\nI struggled. Clawed at my own skin. But the weight—it pressed down harder.\n\nI don’t know how long I was like that. Seconds? Minutes?\n\nThen, suddenly—I could see again.\n\nI was lying in the hallway.\n\nThe hard surface beneath me sent sharp, aching pain through my spine. My arms felt sore. My legs stiff. As if I had been lying there for hours.\n\nStill holding my phone tightly in my hand, which had a small crack on the screen.\n\nThe time read **7:00 AM.**\n\nBut this isn’t over. Not even close.\n\nBecause the moment I sat up—\n\nMy door creaked.\n\nNot from the wind.\n\nNot from me moving.\n\nFrom the inside.\n\nSomething left.\n\nI ran. I didn’t stop to check the apartment, didn’t stop to grab anything—just ran straight to my car.\n\nAnd now… I’m in my office, writing this.\n\nI haven’t been back since. My keys, my laptop, my clothes—my entire life is still in that apartment.\n\nAnd I know that if I go back…\n\nIt’ll be waiting.\n\nSo, tell me—\n\nWhat the hell should I do?",

        "content": "I was brushing my teeth when it happened. A quick, almost imperceptible flicker. I wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t been staring at myself, lost in thought.\n\nBut I *was* staring. And I *did* notice.\n\nMy reflection blinked.\n\nI didn’t.\n\nI froze, toothbrush clutched in my hand, heart hammering in my chest. The air in the bathroom felt thick, pressing against my skin. Slowly, I raised my hand. My reflection followed. I tilted my head. So did it. Everything was normal. Almost.\n\nI leaned in closer, eyes narrowing at the reflection. I studied every detail—the way the light from the bathroom overhead cast a soft glow across my face, the way my hair shifted as I moved. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.\n\nThen, I saw it. My reflection blinked again. And this time, I was sure—*I didn’t blink*.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat.\n\nThe reflection didn’t seem to be *me* anymore. Its eyes were too dark, its movements too fluid, almost like it was more *alive* than I was. I swallowed hard, trying to calm myself. Maybe I was imagining it. Maybe I was just tired.\n\nI stepped closer to the mirror, eyes locked with my reflection. The bathroom light flickered above me, and I noticed a strange unease crawling up my spine.\n\nI raised my hand again. My reflection did the same. But this time, there was a hesitation—just a beat too long.\n\nI tried to tell myself it was nothing, that I was just overthinking it. But I couldn’t shake the sense that something was wrong. *That wasn’t me in the mirror*.\n\nI leaned in even closer. The reflection mirrored my every move—until it didn’t.\n\nIt *smirked*.\n\nA slow, unsettling grin spread across my reflection’s face, its eyes glinting with a malevolent gleam. The grin wasn’t mine. It wasn’t something I would ever do. My pulse raced. I jerked back from the mirror, knocking over a bottle of shampoo in the process. My heart pounded in my chest.\n\nI stared at the reflection, waiting for it to return to normal. But the smirk remained, stretched across my reflection’s face like something out of a nightmare.\n\nIt blinked again. And this time, I *didn’t*.\n\nA cold sweat began to form on my skin. I reached for the light switch, but my hand trembled so violently I could barely grasp the switch. My reflection’s eyes never left me.\n\nI turned the light off, hoping that the darkness would make the unease go away, but as the room fell into shadows, I could still feel its gaze—cold and unblinking. The reflection’s eyes seemed to pierce through the dark.\n\nI rushed to leave the bathroom, but something stopped me. I don’t know what, but I felt compelled to look back.\n\nI turned. And there it was—*my reflection* still staring, but now, it wasn’t just a reflection. It was *waiting*.\n\nI stumbled back into the hallway, my hands shaking. My own footsteps echoed in the silence. The hallway light flickered above me, casting strange shadows that seemed to move on their own. But as I moved away from the bathroom, a faint noise reached my ears—a subtle tapping, like knuckles gently rapping against the glass.\n\nI turned around, my stomach twisting in knots, but the bathroom door was closed. I could still hear the tapping, though.\n\nIt wasn’t stopping.\n\nAnd the mirror on the other side of the door—*it wasn’t empty*. It was waiting for me to return.                                                                                                                                                 ",

I’ve got you covered:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/xEMd0Dexgb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpotent rage. \r\n\r\nIt’s a term I’m sure you’ve heard a million times by now. One you might even think you understand. I know I thought I did. Lack of memory aside that is. \r\n\r\nBut as I saw Alex fall. When I watched her young life snuffed out, I knew how wrong I was. \r\n\r\nWe’ve taken cover in the Western themed food stand. Will hasn’t taken any further shots. Wherever he is, he’s content to cackle at us through the overhead speakers as the things around us start to close in. \r\n\r\nI’m afraid, but more than that, I’m angry. I’ve seen a lot of shit at this point, but Alex dying, it was too much. Survival instinct can only go so far, eventually the beast inside wants to make things even. Evil doll or otherwise. \r\n\r\n\r\nLeo pops up from the counter, injured body making the movement as jerky as the small army of living movie paraphernalia getting ready to kill us all. \r\n\r\nThe shotgun is large, no doubt modified and enhanced by Leo himself, but the effect on the things out for our blood is minimal. \r\n\r\n“Fuck me, most of these bastards shouldn’t even be moving. They’re objects, for Christ’s sake. ” Leo says, taking cover again. \r\n\r\n“It’s Will, the guy is more than a creepy cowboy.” I reply. \r\n\r\nKaz is with us, body nearly reknit, his new flesh is a strange pink color. Sveta though…\r\n\r\nShe managed to come back from the brink after the newsroom. Forcing her body to calm itself down.  \r\n\r\nBut missing a decent portion of her shoulder and chest, she has no choice. \r\n\r\nShe thrashes and screams, more blood than could be possible pumping out of her gaping shoulder-wound. Those screams turn to growls, then barking, then a deep, rage filled howl. \r\n\r\nOnce her body is done the gory transformation, she looks different than she did last time. \r\n\r\nShe’s an emaciated, mange ridden thing. Exposed ribs and hips, patchy fur, and bloodshot, yellowed eyes. \r\n\r\nDying god is another phrase that gets thrown around like rice at a wedding. The sense of sadness and awe a real dying god creates is as unique as it is horrifying. \r\n\r\nShe can’t rampage through the creatures anymore, but she has the determination of a woman who has had her spouse murdered in front of her and the feral cunning of a starving wolf. \r\n\r\nShe strikes at outliers, stragglers, the brave and the weak. But despite the raw power remaining in her deific form, the objects, given drive and motion by Will refuse to stay down. Won’t shatter or bend.\r\n\r\n“Michael, loathe as I am to admit it, I think it may be time to make peace with Demetrious. He was nothing if not versed in the workings of esoteric objects.” Kaz says, not willing to make eye contact with Mike. \r\n\r\n “Fucking around with the void is what killed him, or did you forget that part? Decided to daisy chain a bunch of cursed objects and it left him as a mental parasite. \r\n\r\nThat option is off the table.” Mike says, wincing at broken ribs. \r\n\r\n“We both know you’ve got a card to play, Kaz. We’re surrounded by ingredients.” Leo says, pointing out the obvious. \r\n\r\n“Feel like cluing the rest of us in?” Mike says, a bottle shattering against the counter. \r\n\r\n“Candyman isn’t just a spooky name. \r\n\r\nWhen Kaz isn’t looking like a wax nightmare, he can make candy that does a lot of different things.” Leo says, as Kaz looks increasingly uncomfortable. \r\n\r\n“What you neglect to mention is that each piece of candy is made with a deal.” Kaz replies. \r\n\r\n“So, you give him the family and friends rate, what’s the issue?” I ask. \r\n\r\n“It’s not that simple. The toll is flesh or sorrow. And I’m bound to seek a beneficial deal for myself.” Kaz admits. \r\n\r\n“And I’m all out of flesh.” Leo adds. \r\n\r\n“Fuck.” Mike says, drawing the word out like a splinter, “Punch, real-talk time. \r\n\r\nYou and I are the little brothers here, and besides Alex, we’re the ones Will has an issue with. \r\n\r\nKaz, Leo, Sveta, Hyve, they need to make it out. They have a chance of stopping all of the crazy shit the bishop has planned. \r\n\r\nIf Will kills us, maybe they can make some kind of deal.”\r\n\r\nI’m shocked, Mike is a lot of things, but a quitter doesn’t seem like one of them. \r\n\r\n“So we just hand ourselves over? Are you serious?” I type. \r\n\r\n“Didn’t say that. \r\n\r\nWhat I’m suggesting is you and I cut a path from here to wherever the hell Will is. Hopefully on the way there we figure out a plan to put a dent in him. \r\n\r\nIf not, what happens, happens. We’re useless here, anyway.” Mike calmly replies. \r\n\r\nI don’t know if he’s right or wrong, but it beats sitting here trying to figure out something useful to do. \r\n\r\nThere’s no time to debate, with every passing second the newly animated statues, mannequins and animatronics are faster, more organized, more used to their newly granted mobility. \r\n\r\n“What is your vice?” Kaz asks Leo, the words sound formal, they have a spiritual weight.\r\n\r\nLeo steels himself. \r\n\r\n“Give me a bit of luck.” He says, with a tentative tone I’ve never heard from him. \r\n\r\nKaz starts to rummage through torn packages, decades out of date. Mixing various moldering snack foods together in a dented metal bowl. \r\n\r\nHis eyes begin to glow a dim, flickering black. \r\n\r\n“A proper treat for a proper hero.” Kaz says, orange fumes starting to come from the bowl. \r\n\r\nEven in the guise of an ancient man, something gives Kaz a sinister air. Watching him do what he does, even knowing him for this long, is scary as hell. \r\n\r\n“What’s the price?” Leo asks, the forces Kaz is wielding struggle against the chaos of the liminal space.\r\n\r\n“You have a heart attack. Younger than you’d expect. As things stand now, you survive, no long term effects  other than you easing up on the fast food. \r\n\r\nThat will no longer be the case if you accept my offer.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is one thread of the tapestry of time. But in any, where you are not cut down by the things you hunt, this thread will remain.” Kaz sounds almost like he’s reciting something being told to him.  \r\n\r\n“My vice will be indulged.” Leo answers. \r\n\r\nKaz begins to mix in packets of sugar and bits of debris. The fumes coming from the bowl begin to warp the metal. \r\n\r\n“I need you to keep those things back for a minute. Maybe slightly more, the energy here is making things difficult, and this isn’t something normally done in these kinds of conditions.” Kaz requests, small sparks starting to drift up from the concoction. \r\n\r\n“I can get you two, maybe. These things are shrugging off everything I can throw at them. ” Leo replies. \r\n\r\nKaz keeps mixing, folding and adding ingredients. Against all odds his small spark of power fans itself into a flame. \r\n\r\nLeo places his various firearms under the counter and takes a deep breath before carefully rising. He unleashes a torrent of gunfire, impacts from oversized bullets stagger, and knock the approaching horde down, but much like Sveta, he can’t seem to cause any permanent wounds. \r\n\r\nMike and I take this as our invitation to begin our own last stand. \r\n\r\n“My money is on  there being an AV room back by the exit that runs all of the screens and speakers. No one wants to lug 400 pounds of sound boards through a normal building, let alone this fucking nightmare. \r\n\r\nTake my lead.” Mike says. \r\n\r\nSomething about his tone of voice, the way he begins to move, speaks more to his nature than the costume, or the weapons he left at home. Clad in nothing more than some faded jeans and a Toy Dolls T-shirt, the man moves like an escaped lunatic. \r\n\r\nLeo unloads a set of pistols into the incoming esoteric nightmares. Before the smoke has cleared the barrels he’s dropped them and begins firing an unwieldy looking, short rifle. \r\n\r\nMike finds a service hallway, leading behind the attractions and stalls. Head twitching like a stimulant addict, skulking low enough to nearly be my height he navigates the pitch-black, cramped corridor expertly. \r\n\r\n“Now that we’re away from everyone else, we need to talk about something.” Mike says. \r\n\r\n“We’re marching to death and you want to have a heart to heart?” I type. \r\n\r\n“Something like that. \r\n\r\nNeither Demi or I know what happens to him when I die. It’s why this war between us has remained fairly cold so far. \r\n\r\nI don’t step in front of a train because the psychopath might gain control of the pieces. \r\n\r\nHe doesn’t make me black out on a highway because maybe that’s the end of the line for him. \r\n\r\nBut, chances are we’re going to find that out really soon. \r\n\r\nIf that evil old shit gets what he wants, you need to understand something. \r\n\r\nYou can’t trust him. He’s not Kaz, or you or Sveta. Power corrupts, and as far as regular people go, I don’t think anyone managed to amass as much power as he did.” Mike admits. \r\n\r\nAt first, I think it’s a redundant statement. Don’t trust Jack the Ripper. But reading between the lines, I get what Mike is saying. \r\n\r\nDon’t become numb to the paranormal. Don’t let the fact it seems to be around every corner blind you to it’s danger. \r\n\r\n  “Fuck sakes, he’s blocked the hallway. “ Mike says, pointing out a pile of debris. \r\n\r\n“Right by a door to a stall.” I reply. \r\n\r\n“It’s a trap, but I’m half-dead, and you’re three feet tall. We’re not getting through that crowd back there.” Mike says, preparing to open the door. \r\n\r\n“If we get out of this, maybe don’t leave your tools at home anymore?” I suggest as Mike tries, and fails to kick the door in. \r\n\r\n“Sounds like a plan.” Mike says, finally managing to break the lock. \r\n\r\nOnce the door swings inward a cloud of…something, escapes. Small fibres, enough of them to seem like a snow flurry. \r\n\r\nMike and I walk in, and we see the entire room is covered in the same material. Thick enough in some places to pile into drifts nearly as tall as me. \r\n\r\n“Dog hair?” Mike says, confused, “What the hell?” \r\n\r\nThe room itself, under the layers of fur is a mock up of an western themed home. We hear the noises of struggle and the paranormal outside, but can’t see a thing through the hair encrusted windows. \r\n\r\n“Mike, look to your left.” I request. \r\n\r\nWhat I’m seeing is the source of the room’s state. \r\n\r\nIt’s old, fat and decrepit. One eye missing, it stands like a statue, staring at us in a pile of fur up to it’s shoulders. \r\n\r\nIt begins to growl. \r\n\r\n“Kill it.” Mike says in a whisper. \r\n\r\nThe dog looks to him, cocking it’s head. \r\n\r\n“I’m not killing a dog.” I reply. \r\n\r\n“It’s not a dog, it’s clearly one of the things being kept here.” Mike says, slowly inching his way to the exit, watching the ‘animal’. \r\n\r\n“It sheds more than is possible, I don’t think that’s grounds for a death sentence.” I type, looking around the room for something we might be able to use against Will. \r\n\r\nMike laughs behind me, I didn’t think I was being that funny, but whatever keeps him on track, I guess. \r\n\r\nIf there’s anything important here, I’m starting to think my chances of finding it are slim to nil. We don’t have time to shift through every dander drift. \r\n\r\nI hear a chair fall over. \r\n\r\n“Fuck.” Mike grumbles, laughing some more. \r\n\r\nSomething catches my attention. It’s a small poster for some generic Lassie knock-off. But the frame it’s sitting in is off-kilter, almost as if it’s on a hinge. \r\n\r\nWith a hair clogged screech the poster swings aside, behind it is a laminated sheet of thick-stock paper:\r\n\r\nInstruction Booklet- Peons- Excerpt 1072-Hair of The Dog\r\n\r\nFirst discovered on March, 29, 1952 in *******. Originally, Peon simply seemed to be an average canine with an extended lifespan. \r\n\r\nA stunt double for the short lived television series *The Smallest Traveler* it’s unique qualities soon became apparent. \r\n\r\nLack of care during animal handling on set ( as was standard at the time) led to several accidents that should have lead to fatal outcomes for the Peon. After which the canine was surrendered to the Organization. \r\n\r\nOn or about the 23rd of December 1984, Peon appeared to expire for a period of 7 days. After this, it’s more problematic qualities began to manifest. \r\n\r\nExposure to secretions, dander, fur or other bodily waste causes human subjects to experience an extreme form of the condition colloquially known as “Brewers Gut” in which an individual’s digestive tract both produces and absorbs alcohol. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this peon ( Codename: Alpine.) produces waste of all forms at a rate of approximately ten times that of a normal canine. \r\n\r\nFirst aid can be administered with adequate hydration and removal of as much of the waste material as possible from contact with the subject. \r\n\r\nAddendum 2A:\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances should Alpine be……\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of the information sheet is torn off leaving me to wonder what further esoteric landmine is waiting for us on this battlefield. \r\n\r\nI hear Mike hit the ground, at first he retches, then coughs as he inhales what seems like a handful of dog hair. \r\n\r\nHe vomits till he coughs then proceeds to cough till he vomits.\r\n\r\nMike’s eyes are glassy, he tries to stand, then falls again. \r\n\r\n“Help.” He says, before a dry heave puts him into the fetal position. \r\n\r\nI grab Mike and start to drag him, but the layers of fur make it hard to get any traction. It comes up in disgusting, matted chunks as I slowly move my inebriated companion. \r\n\r\nInch by inch I drag the poisoned, retching man toward the exit. \r\n\r\nThis place has made me weak, but I have to get Mike out. We have to keep going, keep putting one foot in front of the other. \r\n\r\nI get Mike out of the door, under the clouded eyed gaze of that dog. \r\n\r\nNo time to think, I pull out one of my blades. I slice open Mike’s shirt and pants then roughly flip him out of them. He crawls away from the tainted garments as if they’re radioactive, wearing nothing more than a pair of clean but faded boxers and short black boots. \r\n\r\nLeo vaults the counter, eating something dark and misshapen. Thin, grey smoke starts to come from his mouth and nose in wisps for a brief second.\r\n\r\n  My attention is torn from Mike as the objects start to encircle Kaz and Leo. \r\n\r\nA wax figure of a child trips, it’s body going inert as an undersized, plastic cork-gun drops from it’s hands. For a second it glows a dim grey color. \r\n\r\nLeo grabs it before it hits the ground, putting one of the four corks into the end of the barrel. \r\n\r\nHe has trouble working the child-sized toy, but eventually manages to rack and fire it into the crowd. \r\n\r\nThe cork files about 5 feet, wobbling, and lifeless. It hits a clanking, rusted Mechanical cowboy, then a screeching horse holding a brown jug in its mouth before finally resting on the ground and being trampled by the oncoming horde. \r\n\r\nLeo’s face goes slack, death now within arm’s reach. \r\n\r\nBut then, in a flash of light I can only describe as ‘harmful.’ Everything the cork touched bursts into an almost sand-like consistency. \r\n\r\nWill’s tools fly from the force of the blast, struggling to rise as they experience a force as powerful as themselves. \r\n\r\nLeo smiles, “Guess it’s true what they say, it’s better to be lucky than skilled.”, he says, loading one of the remaining corks. \r\n\r\nEven the base, almost insect-like intellect of the animated objects knows to stay back from Leo now. But it’s a fleeting thing, three shots and dozens of objects closing in. It’s not a recipe for success. \r\n\r\nMike is standing now, looking dazed, and wiping as much of the remaining hair from his body as he can. He points to a recessed black door marked ‘ Employees Only’. Before gagging, and beginning to lope toward it. \r\n\r\n“Didn’t you say you were an alcoholic?” I say, more trying to keep my mind off of the impending doom around me than anything. \r\n\r\n“Was, now I’d be classified as a problem drinker. \r\n\r\nI haven’t eaten anything real or drank liquid without the word ‘ Extreme’ in the name in god knows how long. Not to mention no booze.  \r\n\r\nIt’s hitting me like a fucking sledgehammer.” Mike replies, shoulder charging through the locked door.\r\n\r\nWe’re back in the cramped hallway, Mike picking himself up from the floor. The exit sign is to our right about fifteen feet away, and just like Mike predicted the sound room sits just beyond that. \r\n\r\nI get a good look at Mike. In shorts and boots, just how bad he’s hurting is obvious. Torn patches of skin, ribs sticking out at odd angles, and enough bruising to seem like a terrible tattoo job. \r\n\r\nHis loping isn’t some affectation, it’s his left knee being roughly the size of a softball. \r\n\r\nAs we get to the exit Will reveals himself. \r\n\r\nHe doesn’t burst through the wall, or appear in a blast of energy. He simply walks, casually out of the soundroom. Something about that makes the fear worse. \r\n\r\nMike steadies himself against a wall. \r\n\r\nWill is leaning into the cowboy angle hard. Long, torn leather duster, moth eaten cowboy hat, and armed with a collection of no doubt esoteric western-themed equipment, from six shooter to lasso. \r\n\r\n“Thought I’d dress for the occasion. My old kit from the mountain, with a few bits and pieces from this place. \r\n\r\nWhen in Rome and all that.” Will says with a rotten toothed grin. \r\n\r\nAnd it hits me. \r\n\r\nWe’re fucked.\r\n\r\nMike tries to talk, coughs up a mouthful of blood, and leans against the wall. \r\n\r\n“I’m not going to have to do much more than wait, am I?” Will says smugly to Mike. \r\n\r\nMike wipes his mouth, I ready myself for the vitriolic tirade the clown surely has planned. Even if it is just a play for time. \r\n\r\n“Yeah, I’m out. You win. Fuck me, you won way back on the Mountain.” Mike slides down the exit door, hitting the ground roughly, “Any chance of a last smoke? It’s been a rough ride.”\r\n\r\nWill sneers at Mike, a look of superiority on his face, “Don’t leave home without ‘em.” He says, pulling a surprisingly modern looking pack of cigarettes  from a pocket of his duster. He lights one handing it to Mike. \r\n\r\nMy friend takes a few puffs, red tinted saliva now beginning  to drip from one side of his mouth. His countless wounds soon leave him sitting in a pool of blood.  \r\n\r\nWill stalks toward me. \r\n\r\n“Now, you on the other hand, little partner, I’ve got some long term plans for.” The cowboy grins, and I feel that familiar hold take over, that sense of my body no longer being my own, “Tell me how this idea grabs you. \r\n\r\nWe go back to my workshop, I break you down and reassemble you into something fun. A torture kit, maybe a chainsaw. I leave just enough meat in there that you know what’s going on. \r\n\r\nThen from now to the heat death of the fucking universe, I use you on the most innocent people I can find. \r\n\r\nThat tickle your fancy lil fella?” \r\n\r\nI have nothing to say, both figuratively and literally. This is the end of the line, Mike’s stopped breathing, I’m held fast, and Leo is trying to hold back the remaining animated objects with the threat of his last cork. \r\n\r\nI look upward, wanting to at least make eye contact with Will. It might be damn near homeopathic defiance, but it’s defiance none the less. \r\n\r\nBehind Will, he stands. \r\n\r\nNo less than seven feet tall, clad in an ancient looking pitch black raincoat and dark tweed suit. A tophat adds to the figure’s height. \r\n\r\nIt's Mike’s body, but it’s been changed, warped, features nearly cartoonishly redefined. Not a scratch nor bruise on it. \r\n\r\nI could spend ten pages talking about the minutia of the man standing behind Will, but I won’t. \r\n\r\nIt was, in no uncertain terms, Jack the fucking Ripper. \r\n\r\nHe bends low, putting his large nose nearly in Will’s cowboy hat and inhaling. \r\n\r\nWill is shocked, spinning around and drawing a pistol. \r\n\r\n“A revenant? I’d have expected more from something with such a pedigree.\r\n\r\nWilliam, correct? \r\n\r\nI’m sure I need no introduction.” Demetrious says. His voice, is an English accented bass rumble. Nothing like Mike’s Manhattan snark. \r\n\r\n“You don’t” Will says, seeming to have an ace up his sleeve, “But, I’m not seeing any of your trinkets hanging off that shitty suit.”\r\n\r\nWill cocks the pistol. \r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s true, a few years back my collection of esoterica was destroyed. Rather spectacularly, if I do say so myself.\r\n\r\nAnd alas, without it, I’m not half the man I was.” Demi laments. \r\n\r\nHe grins, perfect teeth nearly glowing in the dark hallway. \r\n\r\n“But, I can assure you, in any measure, half of mine, is worth two of yours.” Demi’s grin goes feral, red irised eyes widening as he casually flicks his wrist. \r\n\r\nWill slams into the walls and floors in succession. With one swiping motion Demi sends him crashing through a brick wall, hitting the back of his crowd of possessed objects like a cannonball.     \r\n\r\nThe possessed objects stagger as their master is disoriented, his concentration broken. \r\n\r\nDemi surveys the scene. Interest, even delight show clearly on his angular face. \r\n\r\nHe casually steps through the hole Will put in the wall. As he does, objects begin to gravitate toward him. They start to orbit around him like planets, the mannequins, and wax figures wielding them falling, inert to the ground. \r\n\r\n  When he speaks, walls shake, dim lights flicker, and he holds the attention of everyone in the room. \r\n\r\n“I am the prodigal son. I am the noble heretic.” Demi begins, more objects joining the orbit, “I am the wolf at the edge of fire. I am what none of you can be, I am the fucking…” \r\n\r\nThe force wielding Mike’s body is cut short. \r\n\r\nWill’s lasso ensnares him, in an instant there is no Demi. Just Mike, looking a little less banged up, but still naked, afraid and confused. \r\n\r\nWill lets go of the lasso, the now living rope starting to twist and constrict around the clown. \r\n\r\nThe things around us get their bearings, closing in like rolling fog. \r\n\r\nSveta is missing a limb, even her deific powers are at their limit.  Leo finds himself out of ammunition. Kaz and Hyve seem to be trying some kind of ritual, but the energy can’t find an anchor. We’ve played every card we have. \r\n\r\n“That there, is called a ‘Nope Rope’ don’t ask me why all of these things have to have some kind of a pun name, that’s for bigger minds than mine. \r\n\r\nBut the gist of it is, it stops shit from happening.” Will might as well be the devil himself. He walks through his army, fearlessly enjoying our impending death. “That being said, I think I should be hitting the old dusty trail. \r\n\r\nIf you got any last words, say ‘em now cowpokes.”\r\n\r\nWatching acceptance fall over the faces of my friends is the worst thing I’ve seen by far. \r\n\r\n“I do.” Says a small, warped voice from near the entrance. \r\n\r\nWill raises an eyebrow, looking toward the sound. \r\n\r\nShe walks out of the shadows, a heartbreaking, misshapen thing. An accident of reality. The result of too many people playing with too many forces of nature. \r\n\r\nIf I could cry, I would. \r\n\r\nHer torn eye is back, but it takes up a third of her face. A massive, diplopic thing, it flicks around wildly. \r\n\r\nHer entire body looks like someone tried to repair it in a rush. Shattered limbs have too many joints. Missing pieces plugged with tumorous growths or spurs of bone. \r\n\r\nWill starts to laugh, looking to us in turn, then back to Alex. \r\n\r\n“She’s a broken one, ain’t she? Never seen nothing like that. \r\n\r\nCome on over here darling.” Will says, beckoning Alex over. \r\n\r\nAlex mumbles to herself, her attention seemingly elsewhere. But slowly, like a stray cat, she makes her way over to Will. \r\n\r\nThe cowboy cocks his oversized handgun, pointing it at Alex’s head. I can’t help but think maybe what he has planned is the most humane option. \r\n\r\n“You guys think the sequel will be as good as the original?” Will taunts. \r\n\r\nShe grabs his wrist, faster than I can track. I brace myself for the gunshot.\r\n\r\nBut it never comes. \r\n\r\nWill’s eyes widen, then I see it too. \r\n\r\nWhere Alex is touching, isn’t leathery undead flesh, but healthy living skin. \r\n\r\nShe opens her mouth, revealing rows of needle like teeth. With a movement like a striking cobra she bites through the newly invigorated flesh. \r\n\r\nWill’s scream is high pitched and pathetic. The sound of something that has never known pain, getting a crash course in the subject. \r\n\r\nThe gun drops, the things around us begin to move erratically. \r\n\r\nAlex looks to Sveta, tossing Will’s blood dripping hand to her. The werewolf catches and swallows it in an instant. Her wounds go from pouring blood to merely dripping. \r\n\r\nWill stares at his bloody stump in disbelief, screaming, eyes wild with pain. \r\n\r\nThe things around us start to fall, flopping and crawling on the ground like dying fish. \r\n\r\nWill makes a break for the exit, his stride meandering, his arm spurting dark black fluid. \r\n\r\nMike escapes the rope, and tries to tackle will. His aim is off, his mind foggy from the brutal transformation. But will trips over the lunging clown. \r\n\r\nSveta charges, pushing herself as hard as she can. Will manages to get into the hallway by the exit, the canine deity too large to follow. \r\n\r\nAll of us are too wounded to quickly follow, the revenant turns to us, visibly pushing back pain. \r\n\r\n“It’s been slice rancheros.” He taunts turning the knob. \r\n\r\nThe door doesn’t move.\r\n\r\n“Three things a smart man doesn’t leave the house without. Multitool, WD-40, and threadlock.” Mike says, shakily getting to his feet and using me for balance, “I figured you’d have a plan for Demi. And a big enough ego to turn your back to me.”\r\n\r\nWill tries to run down the hallway, Sveta’s remaining arm plunges through the hole in the wall, blocking his path. \r\n\r\nLeo, Kaz and Hyve join us. \r\n\r\nThe look of fear on Will’s face almost makes everything worth it. \r\n\r\nHe begins to beg as Alex walks over. There’s recognition somewhere deep in her misaligned eyes. \r\n\r\n“Nine corners, nine cats lives, nine chances.” Alex mumbles, almost skipping toward will. Her limbs moving almost spider-like. \r\n\r\n“Listen, I can tell you where the bishop is going to be!” Will pleads. \r\n\r\n“I can do that.” Leo says, the look on his face dark. \r\n\r\n“I help you kill him!” Is Will’s next attempt. \r\n\r\n“I’ve got a whole army of spooky crap just waiting for the word go. Try again.” Mike says a maniac grin creeping up his face. \r\n\r\n“I can tell you *how* to kill him. How to do it without his people coming after you.” Will stammers. \r\n\r\nAlex is inches from him, her twisted form almost his height. \r\n\r\n“I became two, you become five. I’ll leave you your voice, and leave you alive.” Alex says, putting one hand on each of Will’s shoulders. \r\n\r\n“Sure, anything, just let me go.” Will’s tone is hopeful. \r\n\r\n“No.” Alex says, drawing out the word as Will’s eyes widen in horror. \r\n\r\n Somewhere in that thin form is strength that rivals anything I’ve seen. She tears both limbs free of Will’s body. \r\n\r\nThe undead bastard screams loud enough to tear apart his vocal cords. Hitting the ground, able to do nothing other than wail in agony. \r\n\r\nWhat Alex does to him isn’t right. Not by any stretch of the imagination. It’s vengeance by way of mutilation. Acts brutal enough, I’m not going to tarnish her memory with describing them. By the end Will sits in five pieces. \r\n\r\nMike is working on unfucking the door, the rest of us are trying to get or keep our shit together. But if Will isn’t lying, were going to be bringing hell to the bishop. \r\n\r\nOnce he stops screaming long enough to tell us anyway. \r\n\r\nTill next time. \r\n\r\nAvoid the darkness. \r\n\r\nPunch.\r\n",

        "content": "**I was peacefully taking a shower when I noticed something strange. The side of my upper thigh was bleeding, but it wasn’t just a cut. It was worse—far worse.**\n\n**I leaned in closer, my hand shaking as I touched the skin. A deep, jagged hole, like something had torn through the flesh, leaving a raw, exposed wound. The edges weren’t smooth—they were shredded, as if they had been gnawed or ripped apart. The skin around the hole was a sickly shade of pale, almost white, like it had been drained of color, and blood pooled around the edges, dark and viscous.**\n\n**I froze, my breath catching in my throat. The pain was sharp, but distant, like it didn’t quite belong to me, like it was something I should’ve felt earlier but hadn’t. I pressed my fingers into the hole, feeling the raw, soft tissue, slick with blood.**\n\n**The water from the shower kept flowing, turning a disturbing shade of red as it mingled with the blood on the floor. The scene felt almost unreal, like I was standing outside of myself, watching this horror unfold.**\n\n**I tried to pull my hand away, but my fingers were sticky with blood, clinging to the wound as if it didn’t want to let me go. A wave of nausea hit me, my stomach turning, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the gruesome sight. It wasn’t right. This wasn’t just an injury. This wasn’t something that could happen by accident. I couldn’t remember how it had happened, why it was happening, but the reality of it—the visceral horror of seeing my own flesh torn open like that—was impossible to deny.**\n\n**I stumbled back, my head spinning, feeling dizzy and disoriented. The cold water continued to run, mixing with the blood on the floor, but it did nothing to calm the rising panic that was choking me. My hand trembled as I reached for the towel, unable to shake the feeling that I wasn’t just bleeding. I was being consumed by something darker than I could understand.**\n\n**As I was processing what had happened, I screamed for my husband, Steve, who quickly came running to help me. \"What happened?\" Steve asked, his voice cracking as his eyes fell on the huge wound on my body.**\n\n**I could see his skin lose color, his face going pale as if the blood had drained from him. His lips trembled, but his eyes were wide with panic. I could hear his breath getting shallow, his heart hammering so loudly it seemed to echo in the room. I watched him stumble back, as if the sight of me was too much, too real. His hands shook as he gently moved me, trying to wrap me in a towel.**\n\n**He wasn’t speaking anymore—just moving mechanically, as if he were on autopilot. His touch was cold, too cold for comfort, and I felt a strange distance between us, like I was drifting away from him. I couldn’t help but wonder: Was this real? Was this really happening?**\n\n**As Steve dressed me and hurriedly got me into the car to take me to the doctors, my 7-year-old son, Tommy, walked into the room. His small feet made almost no sound on the floor, and I didn’t even realize he had entered until I saw him standing there, staring at me with wide, curious eyes.**\n\n**Tommy saw the wound. His eyes flicked over it briefly, but his expression didn’t change. He didn’t gasp, didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. It was as if he was seeing something as normal as a scraped knee. No fear. No confusion. No concern. He didn’t ask questions, didn’t show a hint of worry. He just stood there, his hands casually clasped in front of him, like he was watching me as if nothing unusual was happening. His reaction, or lack of, haunts me to this day. It was almost as if he’d seen something like this before.**\n\n**It should have terrified me, the way he acted—how calm and detached he was. But it wasn’t the wound that left me shaken—it was the cold emptiness in his eyes. The fact that he didn't even think it was strange.**\n\n**As I got to the hospital, the nurse who saw my wound looked confused, but also strangely intrigued. \"What happened?\" she asked, her voice calm but tinged with disbelief.**\n\n**\"I don't know,\" I whispered, still dazed. \"I didn’t even notice the wound until I took a shower.\"**\n\n**She frowned, her eyes narrowing as she examined me more closely. \"You didn’t notice something like that?\" She shook her head, her expression turning from concern to doubt. \"This isn’t just a simple injury. This looks... unusual.\"**\n\n**I couldn’t understand what she meant, but the way she looked at the wound made my skin crawl. She cleaned it gently, her hands moving with care, but I could feel the weight of her gaze. She seemed almost fascinated, like this was some kind of puzzle she couldn't solve.**\n\n**After a long pause, she finally spoke again. \"The wound... it looks like a laceration, but it’s deep, and the edges are ragged, like something with a sharp, serrated edge tore through your skin. It could be an animal bite, or maybe something mechanical...\" Her voice trailed off, as though she was unsure herself.**\n\n**\"An animal bite?\" My mind raced. I couldn’t remember anything—no animal, no sharp object, nothing. It felt like a bad dream, but I was awake, and the wound was real. Too real.**\n\n**The day passed in a blur, and we returned home. As I tried to settle into some semblance of normalcy, my husband Steve noticed something else that made my blood run cold. There was blood on the sheets. Not a lot, but enough to leave a dark stain on the fabric.**\n\n**\"Whatever happened,\" he said, his voice tight, \"was when you were sleeping. It must’ve been.\" His eyes flicked to me, and I could see the concern etched deep on his face, but there was something else there too—something I couldn’t name. Fear.**\n\n**\"Are you feeling any better?\" Steve asked, his voice gentle, almost hesitant.**\n\n**\"Yeah,\" I lied, forcing a smile, though every inch of my body was screaming at me. I wasn’t feeling better. I wasn’t sure I would ever feel better again.**\n\n**My fears were all gone as soon as I fell asleep. I woke up with a strange sensation of relief, as if the sleep I just had was liberating, like I was somehow freed from whatever had been suffocating me. I didn’t even remember the wound anymore. It felt as though it never existed.**\n\n**Steve wasn’t there. He had woken up earlier than me to go to work. I sat on the edge of the bed, feeling almost brand new, as if I had been reborn overnight. I turned my body to position my feet on the floor, but when I went to stand up—**\n\n**CRACK!**\n\n**A terrifying, sickening sound, the kind you never forget. The floorboards splintered beneath me, and I collapsed, the impact jarring my entire body.**\n\n**I looked down at my feet. It was gone.**\n\n**A wave of cold panic flooded my chest. My foot—my fucking foot—was missing. The spot where it should have been was just a raw, empty space. Some blood. No flesh. Just a jagged, smooth stump where my foot used to be. How? I tried to scream, but the sound wouldn’t come.**\n\n**I couldn’t comprehend it. I reached down, my hands trembling, trying to feel the phantom foot that should have been there. But all I touched was skin—soft skin, unnaturally cold, like a part of me had been removed in my sleep. My stomach twisted in disgust. My mind refused to accept what I was seeing.**\n\n**I glanced at the sheets, and my heart stopped.**\n\n**Something was there.**\n\n**Bones.**\n\n**Foot bones. And blood. Flesh missing, pieces torn away as though something had violently stripped it from me while I lay unconscious. My own flesh. My own body.**\n\n**The stench of it all hit me, sharp and foul, and I couldn’t stop my body from convulsing, the nausea rising in my throat. I backed away, stumbling over the remnants of my own body, unable to make sense of what I was seeing. Was this real? I could feel my pulse racing in my throat, my mind spiraling into chaos. That didn’t make sense... how could I have lost a foot overnight?**\n\n**I closed my eyes, trying to steady myself. The questions were consuming me. But there was only one truth I knew: Something was horribly wrong, and I wasn’t in control of it.**\n\n**Tommy came inside the room, holding his bunny toy tightly in his small hands. His eyes met mine, and I swear, for a brief moment, I saw something in them—something not quite right. It wasn’t the innocent look of a child. No, it was colder. It was knowing.**\n\n**He smiled, but it wasn’t a normal smile. It was unsettling. He stood there, watching me, frozen in my fear, struggling to comprehend what was happening. His smile stretched wider, his eyes glinting in a way that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.**\n\n**“It’s nice to see you happy, mommy,” he said, his voice too calm, too knowing.**\n\n**His words crawled under my skin like worms, and for a split second, I couldn’t breathe. Happy? How could he think I was happy? My foot was gone. I was bleeding. What the hell was he talking about?**\n\n**I opened my mouth to say something, but the words stuck in my throat. I couldn’t even form a coherent sentence as I watched Tommy move slowly toward me. Every step he took seemed deliberate, as if he was savoring the moment, his gaze fixed on me.**\n\n**He stopped right in front of me, crouching down to my level. His fingers gripped the bunny toy tightly, his knuckles white with tension. He didn’t flinch when his eyes dropped to the bloodstained sheets around me. I swear, he didn’t even blink.**\n\n**Then, he slowly placed the bunny toy on the bed beside me. But there was something wrong with it. The fabric, once soft and clean, was now darkened. It was stained with something... something that wasn’t just dirt. It was soaked in blood, the edges of the fabric frayed as though something sharp had torn through it. I couldn’t look away from it. I felt a sharp pang in my stomach.**\n\n**Tommy tilted his head slightly, his smile still fixed in place. It was like he was studying me, waiting for me to react, but all I could do was stare, unable to move.**\n\n**\"You’re okay, mommy,\" he whispered, so quietly I could barely hear him, but the words sank deep. \"We just have to wait.\"**\n\n**I felt the room close**\n\n**I finally managed to compose myself, but my body felt like it was falling apart as I tried to stand. My left foot felt heavy, and I was only able to hobble on the other. With every step, the raw pain from my wounds sent jolts through my body. As I slowly made my way toward the mirror, I couldn’t avoid the horror that was about to unfold.**\n\n**I stared at myself. What I saw was beyond recognition. My skin was an unnatural, mottled color, half-decayed, with patches of blood and open sores that hadn’t been there before. My body was no longer just a wound — it was a decaying, living corpse. I couldn’t even comprehend how far my flesh had rotted away. The wounds... they were more than just cuts. There were chunks missing, like pieces of me had been violently scraped off, leaving behind exposed, yellowed muscle and bone. My face was unrecognizable; the once smooth skin now hung loosely, discolored and wrinkled, as if someone had tried to peel it off. I could smell the rot.**\n\n**This time, I knew I needed more than just medical help. I needed answers. I had to call the police. I had to understand what had happened to me. But even as I dialed, the confusion set in deeper. How could I not have noticed any of this? How could I have missed the fact that my body was being consumed, piece by piece? There was no way this was normal. I couldn’t trust myself.**\n\n**The ambulance arrived, and the nurses were horrified. They wrapped my foot, but their expressions were blank, filled with disbelief. They kept asking the same question over and over, like they couldn’t quite make sense of it: How had I lost my foot and not even realized it? The words echoed in my head, spinning. “I must have been drugged,” I muttered, but even as I said it, it felt like a lie. No one was buying it.**\n\n**I was barely aware of time passing as I was transported to the hospital. My head was spinning, and I felt like I was floating through everything, detached from reality. Then I saw him — Steve. He looked frantic, his face pale as he rushed to my side. I wanted to reach for him, but the pain was unbearable, and my body was giving up on me.**\n\n**Before I could speak, the police were swarming the room. They started questioning me, their eyes wary, but there was something else there. Confusion. Why was I still conscious? Why hadn’t I noticed the damage being done to myself?**\n\n**The questions didn’t stop. My thoughts were all over the place. I didn’t know what was real anymore. But then, something else happened. The police turned to Steve. Their tone changed. I heard the words \"major suspect,\" and my mind spun.**\n\n**Suddenly, they arrested him — right there in front of me.**\n\n**What the hell?**\n\n**My heart raced as the truth slammed into me. My husband… arrested for cannibalism. Cannibalism. The word reverberated in my ears, and everything went cold. How could this be? My own husband, eating me alive?**\n\n**I wanted to scream, to tell them they were wrong, but the words were trapped in my throat. I couldn’t believe it. Steve would never.**\n\n**As they dragged him away, my mind raced. Something wasn’t right. Why would they accuse him? Why now?**\n\n**I glanced at Tommy, who stood at the edge of the room. He was silent, his eyes empty, like he was in another world. It sent a chill down my spine. What if... What if Tommy was somehow involved? He wasn’t acting like my son anymore. He seemed... different. Out of control.**\n\n**I begged the officers to reconsider, but they wouldn’t listen. They told me Steve was a threat, that he was dangerous, and they wouldn’t release him until the investigation was over. They said it was for my own safety.**\n\n**My sister offered her house to me and Tommy, a place to stay after everything we’d been through. The air was thick with tension, and the silence between us was deafening. There were no long conversations, no gossiping, no laughter — not a single trace of happiness. My sister, who I once shared everything with, now looked at me with a mix of concern and fear. I could see it in her eyes, the way she tried to keep a distance from me, as if she could smell the decay on me — both physical and mental.**\n\n**“I can’t believe Steve did this to you... I’m so sorry,” she said, her voice trembling as she tried to comfort me. But the words hit me wrong. They didn’t feel real.**\n\n**“Steve didn’t do anything to me,” I replied coldly. There was a venom in my voice that surprised even me. But it wasn’t Steve. I knew that much. There was something else going on. Something more sinister.**\n\n**Tommy was acting strangely too. He was quiet, but his discomfort was obvious. He didn’t like my sister’s house. He kept asking to go back home. I couldn’t bear the thought of returning to the place where everything had gone wrong, especially without Steve. The house was empty, and it felt wrong to be there. But my sister’s place had security cameras. If anything happened, at least I’d be able to see it, to prove Steve’s innocence.**\n\n**I didn’t want to sleep. Every part of my body ached with exhaustion, but the fear inside me wouldn’t let me rest. What if something happened while I slept? What if I woke up… dead? The thought didn’t seem as crazy as it should. I’d already lost pieces of myself in ways I couldn’t explain. My mind was unraveling, and I didn’t know what was real anymore.**\n\n**I was scared of my own son. Tommy wasn’t the same. He was different. Corrupted. He watched me in a way that made my skin crawl, his eyes cold and distant. I couldn’t bring myself to sleep next to him. Every part of me screamed that he could hurt me, even though I knew he was just a child. But the paranoia was too strong. He wasn’t my Tommy anymore.**\n\n**And still, despite my fear, my body betrayed me. The painkillers I took earlier kicked in, making my eyelids heavy. I tried to fight it, but sleep dragged me down anyway.**\n\n**I managed to stand on one foot, the pain unbearable. My vision was blurry, and every step felt like I was being torn apart from the inside. I stumbled through the dark, falling multiple times but pushing myself up again each time, desperate to reach the room with the security cameras.**\n\n**When I finally reached the door, my hand shook as I gripped the doorknob. I could see my reflection in the polished surface—a grotesque, barely recognizable face staring back at me. My skin was stretched thin and mottled, hanging loosely in some places while other areas were raw and torn. My hair was sparse, falling in clumps. It looked like I had been ravaged by something monstrous.**\n\n**I shoved the door open and stumbled into the room. The video from last night began to play, flickering as the screen filled with static before the image settled.**\n\n**And then I saw it. THE MONSTER. It moved with a grotesque, inhuman grace, its body twisted and malformed—half-human, half something worse. Its jagged, trembling hands dug into my flesh with savage hunger, ripping it apart as if the very act of tearing was a need more primal than hunger itself. The sickening sound of flesh being torn away echoed in the room, each gnashing bite a violent, brutal noise that drowned out everything else. I could hear the wet snap of skin, the grotesque crunch of bone breaking, the desperate, hungry gulps as it swallowed chunks of what could only be pieces of me.**\n\n**The sound was unbearable—wet, slopping, tearing, as if the very fabric of my body was being shredded in real-time. Every single bite felt like a piece of my soul was being consumed, each pull of its hands leaving a trail of agony that seared through every nerve in my body. It wasn’t just my flesh it tore at—it was everything. My insides twisted and writhed in horror as I watched it devour me, my skin falling away in strips, my muscle exposed in ghastly rawness. The blood—so much blood—spilled out, a flood of crimson pooling on the floor as I gasped in horror, but the monster never stopped.**\n\n**Its mouth... God, the mouth. It stretched impossibly wide, wider than any human mouth could open, as it gorged itself, sucking down mouthfuls of my flesh. Each time it bit into me, it felt like my very bones were being pulled from their sockets. I could feel the sharp, excruciating pain of each bite, the pressure of its teeth sinking deep into me. The wetness, the warmth of my own blood trickling down my body, felt like it was drowning me. The taste of my own body being consumed filled my senses with a nauseating, impossible feeling. I could almost hear it—my own blood being swallowed, my skin scraping away in agonizing waves of horror.**\n\n**I wanted to scream, but the terror had stolen my voice. Every part of me fought to move, to escape, but my body was failing. It was breaking apart, each piece of me becoming a feast for something that couldn’t possibly be real, couldn’t be happening. My limbs were being torn from me—my foot, my arm, pieces of my torso—and still, it devoured me, as if nothing mattered but the hunger.**\n\n**I could feel the blood rushing from me, could hear the cracking of bones, the tearing of flesh, the sounds of my body breaking apart under the relentless, mindless assault. I was drowning in it, the dark pit of terror pulling me down.**\n\n**The monster never stopped, never hesitated. It feasted on me with a twisted, insatiable hunger that made my insides writhe in horror. The worst part—the absolute worst part—was how calm it seemed, how it went about its grotesque meal without a single flicker of hesitation. There was nothing humane in that hunger. It wasn’t just feeding—it was devouring me with the frenzy of something starved for years, a monster with no mercy.**\n\n**I felt the last remnants of my strength fading. My body could no longer fight, and my mind was collapsing under the weight of what was happening. There was no escape. No way out. Every movement it made, every tear of my flesh, every bit it consumed... It was all a reminder that this wasn’t a nightmare. This was my reality, and it would never end. There was no ending to this—only more. I would never escape.**\n\n**And then, with a sickening clarity, I realized the truth.**\n\n**The monster is myself.**",

        "title": "I saw an eye in the sky during the eclipse",
        "author": "georgedoesntwantto",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "The partial sun eclipse reached its peak on Saturday at about 2 pm. Our eldest son had talked about it in school (seems to be a big deal in second grade) and then infected our two younger boys with his enthusiasm. They were ecstatic to see it. Even persuaded me to get them some of these paper glasses with extra-thick dark foil, after they had learned that it would be dangerous to stare into the sun without protection. Admittedly, I was a little excited as well. I mean, it’s nothing spectacular per se, but it would be cool to see. So far, I had only ever seen the sun in its usual round shape.\n\nChecking the weather for the day right after waking up, I learned that we would indeed have a chance at a good look.  \nThe time of the eclipse came and there were only very few clouds to be seen. Pretty good conditions. The boys and I climbed up the stairs of our apartment building – the top floor has a type of viewing platform. While we stepped out, the daylight seemed to fade a little. It was noticeable even without having to look directly into the sun. We put on our cheap glasses and checked it out. At that moment, I absolutely forgave my boys for more or less forcing me to buy them. It was spectacular. Mesmerizing to see change in something that has been a constant throughout all of your life. I mean, it was still *just* the sun, but... well, just different.\n\nAnyway, I was fascinated as I first saw it. My boys as well. They were just staring, mouths open. After a few seconds had passed, my youngest pulled at my shirt. “It looks weird, dad.” “That’s the point. It’s something that doesn’t happen very often. It looks weird, because we are witnessing something the sun usually doesn’t do\", I replied.\n\nHis brothers had explained the science behind it all morning; we now knew all about solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, partial and annular eclipses and whatever else you could wish for.  \n“No, I mean the eye. Can’t you see it?” He sounded freaked out. Now he had my attention. I took off the glasses and looked at him. He wasn’t staring at the sun anymore, but in an entirely different direction. “But Mark, you’re missing out on it.” I gently grabbed his shoulders and tried to turn him back around. He jerked a little in order to move my hands away. “No. Please look, dad. What is that? It is staring at me!” His voice sounded urgent.  \nObserving the sky in the direction he was facing, I couldn’t see much. A few clouds – no clusters, just individual fluffy chunks. Otherwise, the sky was blue. I didn’t know what he meant. I then looked at my son again and saw him slowly removing the special glasses. He looked pale. He continued to stare into the blue sky for a moment and then informed me: “It is gone now. That’s good. I didn’t like it.” I assured him that everything was fine and that we would continue to watch the eclipse for a few minutes. The enthusiasm that had filled him all morning seemed to be swept away. He quietly sat on the ground and stared at his shoes. “It’s okay if you continue with the eclipse, but I don’t really want to look anymore”, he said.  \nA little bit of color had come back to his face, so I assumed that he would be fine. Kids sometimes make up weird stuff. Their imagination goes crazy, and they somehow manage to scare themselves. I put my glasses back on and decided that we could talk about whatever had scared him as soon as we were back in our apartment. For the moment, I didn’t want to miss the moon revealing what it had covered before.\n\nThen I saw it. It was just a blink of an eye. Literally. I was still facing away from the sun. There was – I don’t know. Like a crack. A vertical crack in the sky. It was enormous.  \nIt ripped open further, the two sides sliding away into the blue sky, like upper and lower eyelids do. What was revealed by this motion looked at me. At us. At everyone in our hemisphere, I’d guess. The pupil was dark, but not lifeless. It moved. I could sense its power. For the lack of a better word – it felt *mighty*. I think I stood there just as stunned as my son did moments ago. It looked. Stared. *Observed*.\n\nThen it disappeared again. The rip closed back up, as fast as it had opened. Like a blink. The sky turned back to being *just* the sky.\n\nI took the glasses off. Mark was fiddling around with his shoelaces. His brothers still staring at the sun. A few seconds passed, while I scanned the sky. Nothing. It was normal. The longer I looked at it, the more I felt like the thing I had seen must have been an illusion or something. The urge to go back inside was strong, nonetheless. My voice was a bit shaky, as I suggested having a sweet treat back in our apartment.\n\nThe sun was pretty much back to normal, and the boys lost interest with every centimeter revealed by the moon. We went back in.\n\nI put the special glasses into the very back of a junk drawer. And that was it. Mark seemed to have forgotten about whatever we had seen, or maybe he was also intentionally repressing the thoughts about it. I thought about it all day. At times, I managed to nearly convince myself that I must have made that thing up – maybe Mark’s fear had caused me to. But then again... I saw it. It was there. Just for a moment.\n\nMaybe it is a bit ridiculous, but for the rest of the weekend, we’ve stayed inside. I’ve also avoided looking at the sky. I feel like that’s best for now.",

        "content": "It started small. A tiny flicker of doubt.\n\nThe first time I noticed, I was brushing my teeth before bed, half-asleep and running on autopilot. I turned my head to spit into the sink, and for the briefest moment, I thought—no, felt—that my reflection moved a fraction of a second too late.\n\nIt was so minor that I brushed it off. Maybe I was tired, maybe I had zoned out. But the next morning, it happened again. This time, I was shaving. I swiped the razor along my cheek, and out of the corner of my eye, I swore my reflection was just slightly behind. It wasn’t an obvious lag, just the faintest delay, like a poorly synced video. I tested it, waving a hand, shifting my head side to side. Everything seemed fine. Still, something felt wrong.\n\nBy the third day, I started paying closer attention. That’s when the little details started piling up.\n\nMy reflection blinked, but I was certain I hadn’t. I leaned in, studying my face, my pulse quickening. I tried to trick it—moving fast, then slow, making sudden gestures. Nothing. It was perfect. Too perfect. But every now and then, I’d catch it—an extra blink, a hesitation, a moment where its expression wasn’t quite mine.\n\nThen, one morning, I caught it smiling.\n\nNot a full grin. Just the ghost of one.\n\nAnd I wasn’t smiling.\n\nMy stomach turned to ice. I stepped back, heart hammering in my chest. I stared at the reflection, willing myself to believe I had imagined it. I forced a grin, testing myself against the mirror. It copied me exactly. No delay. No smile of its own.\n\nBut I knew.\n\nFrom that moment on, I avoided mirrors. I turned my bathroom mirror to face the wall. I kept my phone screen dimmed, barely glancing at it when I texted. Shop windows, darkened TV screens, even the gloss of my coffee table—I avoided them all.\n\nBut the more I avoided them, the more I felt it watching. Waiting.\n\nOn the fifth night, I woke up gasping, heart pounding in my throat. The room was dark, silent, but something felt wrong. A heaviness in the air. A pressure, like a pair of unseen eyes drilling into me.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nMy bedroom mirror had moved.\n\nIt was no longer bolted to my closet door. It stood, impossibly upright, at the foot of my bed. Angled just right so I could see myself lying there.\n\nNo. Not myself.\n\nThe thing in the mirror was already sitting up.\n\nIt wasn’t mimicking me. It wasn’t frozen. It was awake. Watching me. Smiling.\n\nThe terror that gripped me was unlike anything I’ve ever felt. My body locked up, every nerve screaming at me to move, but I couldn’t. I was paralyzed, staring at it, as it stared at me. Then, in the dimness, I saw it lift a hand.\n\nI felt the cold rush of adrenaline, but before I could react—\n\nThe light flicked on.\n\nI gasped, my body jerking as if I had been yanked from a nightmare. The mirror was back in its normal place. My reflection looked normal. My pulse thundered in my ears as I scrambled out of bed, chest heaving. But I know what I saw.\n\nThat was two days ago. I haven’t slept since.\n\nAnd now? Now I think it’s getting stronger.\n\nThis morning, I forced myself to check the bathroom mirror. Just a quick glance. Just to make sure.\n\nMy reflection didn’t move at all.\n\nIt just stood there. Watching me. Smiling.\n\nI don’t think I have much time left.\n\nIf you’re reading this, check your mirrors.\n\nMake sure you’re still the one on the right side.",

        "content": "The sky was that kind of flawless blue that you only see in paintings, the pretty flowers so shocking orange that they almost gave off heat.  Or maybe it was just the sun, up there on that mountaintop, as close to God as you can get without burning to a crisp.  We had been blessed with a glorious day, as fine as you could ask for.\n\n \n\nIf we were going to have to kill my sister, this day was as good as any.\n\n \n\nI had known, as soon as Mary Katherine started having her fits, that it was going to come to this.  The same thing had happened to our mother, when I was only five, and to her sister and my grandmother and any number of the womenfolk in our family.  It was the source of much of our shame and dishonor, and even though nobody ever came out and said something about it to any of us, you could still feel it in their stares.  The way that people would hush up and stop talking when we came in to the daily service, looking at us out of the corners of their eyes.  You could hear it in whispers floating behind your head as you walked through the general store, buzzing around you like flies buzz around our old nag Deuteronomy.  You knew without hearing what they were saying, what you had been born into, the blood red stigma that you wore like the mark of Cain.  All of us, the entire Tourette clan, were spoiled, cursed, dirty, and impure.\n\n \n\nBrother Jakob stood next to the highest rock on the altar, sun shining yellow through his hair and his beard and smoldering in his eyes.  He was a tall man, with a face like the rock cliffs down the valley, hard and worn smooth by the years.  The rest of the town waited on the plains below him, all through the orange flowers, silent and patient, waiting for the great man to speak, and after a long time he finally did.\n\n \n\n“Brothers and sisters,” he began, lifting his arms over his flock.  “We are gathered here today to…”\n\n \n\n“SUCK COCKS!  PISS ON YOUR MOTHER’S FACES!  SHIT!  SCABIES!”  Mary Katherine’s entire body shook and bucked against the leather straps holding her to gray rock altar, spit flying in every direction as she screamed obscenities and rolled her eyes and lashed her tongue in an awful manner.  “TITS AND WHORES!  DWARF DICKS!  YOU ALL EAT CUNTS FOR…”\n\n \n\nBrother Jakob turned on his heel, raised his fist, and slammed it down into Mary Katherine’s stomach and face, over and over, until she finally stopped thrashing and lay there whimpering to herself.  When she turned her head, I could see her looking at me, her voice so small, so scared.  “Samuel…brother… please…” she sniffled the blood and snot from her nose.  “Please help me…”\n\n \n\nI did nothing.  I turned my eyes away, and back to Brother Jakob.\n\n \n\nHe waited for a second, watching Mary Katherine, and when he saw that she would be quiet, he turned back to us.  “We are gathered here today, brothers and sisters, because of a great evil.”  He swept his arm over my sister, trembling and crying there on the rock.  “An evil that has manifested itself within the flesh of this little girl, one of the Lord’s innocent lambs.  Satan himself has…”\n\n \n\n“FUCKED ME HARD WITH HIS BIG OLD DEVIL DICK!”  My sister slobbered all over herself and strained her neck up to look at Brother Jakob, veins and tendons bulging, her eyes the size of saucers of milk.  “YOUR MOTHER TOO!  SHE LOVES IT!  SHE HELD THE VIDEOCAM…”\n\n \n\nAgain Brother Jakob’s fists rained down on Mary Katherine’s head and body as she screamed and hollered and talked in languages that none of us had ever heard before.  This continued on for several minutes until finally Brother Jakob sagged and put his hands on his knees, breathing hard for a long time.  Once he was able, he wiped his hands on his vestments, leaving red streaks on the starched white, and motioned to two of our strongest men, Eli and Ezekiel.  They stood on each side of my sister and held her down as she screamed and tried to bite the men, teeth snapping so hard that I could her them smash together from where I stood, fifty feet away, on the very edge of the towns people. \n\n \n\nBrother Jakob wiped his brow on the sleeve of his vestment and looked down at my sister, who had stopped screaming and started to cry, her little body racked with sobs.  He just stood there, as if frozen.  After a long time he turned back towards us, and his voice sounded more like a croak.  “This evil that has manifested itself in this little girl is an abomination before God.  An abomination that we know all too well.  One that has plagued our people for hundreds of years, one that preys on the weakest in our flock.  But one that we have stopped before, and will stop again, every time.  With the power of our Lord, we will rid ourselves of this evil, and release the soul of this poor little girl.”  He reached beneath his vestment and pulled out the dagger of St. Barnabus, that which had laid down my mother and her sister and many of the women of our family.  It glinted white in the sun as Brother Jakob turned toward Mary Katherine and raised his arm.  “In the name of the Father, the ruler of Heaven and Earth…”\n\n \n\nAll of a sudden there was a sound like a thunderclap.  The back of Brother Jakob’s robes turned bright red and St. Barnabus’ dagger fell out of this hand, clattering on the rocks below.  As he fell, Eli and Ezekiel held up their hands and slowly backed away from the altar.  My father was there, waving his shotgun, turning towards all of us in town, making us move away.  His eyes passed over me, but I do not think that he saw.  After making sure that no one would attempt to stop him, he ran up to that gray stone altar.\n\n \n\nMary Katherine saw him.  “Oh, Papa!  Papa!  You saved me!”  She was barely able to get out the words.  Without thinking, I moved closer to them, to my family.  Our father was crying too, which I had never seen, not even when our mother had been taken.  He loosened the straps holding my sister and pulled her to him, holding her as she wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist, both of them unable to speak, so overcome with joy and relief.\n\n \n\nI was about five paces away when Mary Katherine looked at me, smiled, and sunk her fangs into my father’s throat.",

        "content": "It started a few years ago, YouTube recommended me a weird video- A video about unboxing a “dibbuk box”, I had no idea what the video was about at first, since it had no title or description.\n\nI watched the video, the person in the video was unboxing a “dibbuk box” … you know, it was obviously fake.\n\nThe box was covered with red wax, like many others, and when he finally opened it, I had a chilling sensation.\n\nWell, I don’t believe in these things, and it’s just a video on my phone, so it’s his problem anyway.  \nHe opened the box, and inside was a mirror, so the one and only thing that he saw inside the box, was his own face, then- he flipped the mirror, and behind it there was one word “deus”.\n\nThe video ended shortly after, it had no title, and I forgot about it and went to work.  \nI couldn’t get this video out of my head, I kept thinking about it, obsessively.\n\nEventually, I decided to look at the video again, I couldn’t find it, not in history, not with keywords like “dibbuk” and “unbox”, nothing, and it wasn’t in anonymous mode, so it should have appeared in history tab.\n\nWeird, I had to go again and I kinda forgot about it.  \nWe later had dinner together, then I heard a faint noise, like if someone has pressed a few notes on a piano altogether. I asked everyone at the table about it, nobody heard anything.\n\nI left the table, rushed outside the front door, nothing, no sound, all looks normal now.  \nI went back to the table, they asked me if I am feeling alright, I told them I do.\n\nA few days later, it happened again.  \nI was sitting with a friend at a restaurant, and then I heard it again… the same noise, it wasn’t a nice or normal noise, it was a low-tone noise, again the same musical notes, this time somewhat louder.\n\nI have a friend who has a lot of knowledge in music, and he plays a piano. I pressed on the piano keys to try and mimic what I hear… he was in shock, he rushed away and brought a book with him, and he told me that it resembles “Hell Waltz”, which was made in the 1600s about a creature named “Asmodeus”.\n\n>*”Asmodeus”? What is that?*\n\nHe explained to me that it’s a demon, the worst one, but that’s just a myth, a legend. He kept asking me about the noise that I heard, and if I kept hearing it.  \nI lied, I told him no, that it only happened once and never again, but it did… and the noise became more audible.\n\nFast forward, 2 weeks, I am alone at my house.  \nI get a flashback from the video, it said “deus” on the back of the mirror… but it made no sense. That’s a legend, and either way, I was just watching it on my video.\n\nI tried to focus on other things, tried to ignore it, but the noises kept coming. I went to a hearing doctor, no issues, no tinnitus.  \n\nI am not sure what is happening, but I am the only one to hear that noise, and I don’t understand what’s happening!\n\nAfter 2 days it happened again, I went back from the mall, put my stuff on the floor and went to take a shower, and before I could even realize- the noise happened again, stronger than ever, crippling, I then decided that I have to learn more about the meaning behind “Asmodeus”.\n\nIt wasn’t like in the movies, there are no wikipedia guides on how to tell a demon to leave you alone. That wasn’t a Hollywood movie. I couldn’t find the video, I couldn’t find anything about the “deus” noise, all I knew was that I need help. I then went to the bathroom to wash my face, and I saw that I was bleeding… from the ears…. \n\nWhatever that noise was, it started to take effect on my body, I washed it off but then the noise came again, and the bleeding was even more intense.\n\nPanicking, I went to the ER, they had no idea what happened, I never told them about this, they ran every test and couldn’t find any medical explanation for it.\n\nI went back home, tired and scared. Googling for hours, eventually I found someone in a forum, in the deeps of the internet, having the same story as mine, he kept saying:\n\n>*”If you hear it, don’t answer, don’t make a sound- don’t let him know you are listening, you have to survive 50 days.”\n\n“50 days?” I thought to myself, it’s already been around a couple of weeks, I must gather my strength and keep going, at least there’s hope.\n\nThe noises kept coming, back and forth, sometimes for longer times, sometimes louder, it really distracted me, I was having ear bleed often, but my only goal was to end those 50 days.\n\nIt’s the last day of this nightmare, it will be over soon.  \nI kept silent, waiting for it to end, not telling anyone about this, it’s almost 50 days, just a few more minutes.\n\nThen it happened, the loudest noise I have ever heard, I could swear that it could have shattered windows, I couldn’t even hear afterwards, the noise lasted for a minute or two, it stopped, it ended, the 50 days are over, or at least I hoped so.\n\nA month went by, no noises since, no devil’s notes… nothing.  \nI have completely forgotten about it, I opened youtube to watch a video, and then it happened… youtube recommended me a new video from the same creator, no title, it was just another dibbuk box in the thumbnail.\n\nI pressed “Do not recommend me of this channel”.  \nI put my phone on the table and left the house for a walk outside.",

        "content": "The farmland surrounding my grandparents’ ranch was dry and torn open by deep cracks within the once so fertile ground. There was nothing to be harvested, sown, or watered anywhere in sight. It was the summer of ’95, in which the view over this barren piece of land was what greeted me every morning, as I drew open the curtains of the small upstairs room I inhabited. My grandparents couldn’t manage the stairs on their own anymore, so I practically had all the second floor for myself – even though I didn’t knew what to do with that much space.\n\nAfter a failed attempt at a college degree – I had overestimated my interest in literature by much – helping out my family was the least I could do. I hadn’t managed to secure a job anyway. When my mother asked me if I would mind supporting my grandparents on their remote piece of land for some time, I enthusiastically agreed. This way I would feel a little less useless, I hoped. In my youth, I had enjoyed the visits to their farm. I clearly remembered how amazing it had felt to explore the fields, barns and secret paths around the house.\n\nUpon my return, I was confronted with a first impression that differed much from what I remembered. The land was barren and dry – no corn obstructing the view, the windows of many of the farms I passed by nailed shut. It hadn’t rained in a long time. My mother had already told me that my grandparents wouldn’t have a chance in harvesting anything that year, even if they would magically regain all their youthful strength. The weather was putting the residents of the area to the test.\n\nTo me, it didn’t matter much. My grandparents had saved up quite a bit during their lifetime of work. They weren’t harvesting anymore anyway. Now they simply wanted to live in peace in the beloved surroundings of their home for the rest of their days. No matter how much the few relatives we had had urged them, no one could convince them to move out of the remote house. My grandma has been a bit weak and fragile ever since I can remember, but my grandfather’s recent stroke had changed their lives a lot. They needed someone to fix things around the house, buy groceries, make dinner and so on. So that was my job now.\n\nWhile their bodies were slowly giving in to their age, mentally my grandparents had stayed surprisingly fit. This was a very pleasant surprise. I didn’t feel much like a caretaker, and more like a friend staying over. While we had quite some fun playing boardgames and sharing stories in the late hours of the evening, I especially enjoyed the quiet beers I sometimes had with my grandfather after I rolled his wheelchair out onto the porch at sundown.\n\nThe evening I want to tell you about had started exactly like that. The day had been especially hot and muggy. I watched the drops of condensation roll down the can in my hands. It felt just right. I actually thought that I hadn’t been this satisfied with my life in a long time.\n\nThe sound of liquid dripping onto the wooden floor ripped me out of my thoughts. My grandfather was often a bit shaky, but that day it was more intense. Some of his beer had slopped out of the can. The moment I noticed, the stains on the wooden floor had\n\nalready begun to dry. He looked at me, his lips pressed together tightly. Something felt oI. I took another sip and then decided to ask.\n\nMy inquiry as to what was wrong was answered only after a long pause. “It smells like rain”, he said. “I think we shouldn’t stay outside much longer.” I hadn’t seen a drop of rain in the two weeks of my stay so far.\n\nI expected the thunder that I heard soon after. The air had been charged with that certain kind of electricity for a few hours by then. If you have ever experienced a thunderstorm in summer, I think you know what I mean. I had brushed my teeth and was now standing at my bedroom window. A cool breeze was moving my curtains. Just as I was turning towards my bed, I felt as if I saw something out of the corner of my eye. Lightning. But not simply that. The lightning was carving out the shape of something in the sky. It was just a split second, but I was sure. Now wide awake, I pulled a chair next to the window, sat down and waited. I tried not to blink. The next lightning came.\n\nI could make out a gigantic shape. It moved. It moved within the dark clouds that drew thicker by the minute. Every lighting was like a snapshot of this silhouette. I will try to describe it as best as I can.  \nEven though the incident happened 30 years ago, these images will forever be burned into the trenches of my brain.\n\nIt must have been a hundred meters big, give or take. It sounds crazy, I know. But the thing was there, up in the sky. The lightning became more frequent. Its limbs moved in different directions. There were many. I first thought they were arms, but it could also have been something tentacle-like.\n\nThe rain had started to come down by then. Some of its limbs were reaching downwards, breaking through the barrier of clouds. It looked like they were searching for something. I was startled. Previously trying my best not to blink, I was now more than afraid to do so. Slowly, I realized that the clouds were moving towards the house. It felt like minutes, before I finally managed to move. I grabbed the curtains and drew them shut. While I did so, I caught one last glimpse of it. Or better, of one of its... limbs. It quickly moved over the field... the road... searching... it got caught on a telephone pole. In one quick motion, it wrapped around the pole and ripped it out of the ground.\n\nThat was it. I pressed my eyes shut and practically fell to the floor. Hunched up in fetal position, I lay there for a long time.  \nAn hour passed, maybe even two, before I felt like the growling of the thunder became less frequent. The sound of the heavy rain had turned softer.\n\nI managed to crawl into my bed, hid under the covers and eventually fell asleep.\n\nThe next day had started quietly. There was nothing to be heard outside.  \nMy body hurt as I got up. Because of the tension my muscles had been in all night, I think.  \nI peeked out between the curtains. Fields. Still a bit wet. In some spaces, the ground looked as if something big had plowed over it. About fifty meters away, the telephone pole lay on the ground.\n\nAs I entered the kitchen, my grandfather greeted me. “What a storm. I think there are some fences that need to be repaired. Can you do that later?”\n\nI stayed for the rest of the summer. It was diIerent now. We talked less. In September, I decided to go back to the city – even though my grandparents were sad to see me go.\n\nIn 1998, they both died. My mother sold the house.\n\nI can’t let go of the memories of this night. As I said, it feels like it is burned into my brain. I still wonder what I saw. Maybe there is a rational explanation... a gas leak causing hallucinations or something? I really don’t know.\n\nThank you so much for reading. Maybe this story reaches someone who has experienced something similar.  \nHave a good night.",

I tried to convince myself it was from a streetlamp outside, from my alarm clock, from anything other than that door. But I knew better.\n\nBecause I could hear it. The slow creak of hinges straining. The almost imperceptible shuffle of something shifting in the dark. The whispering. Always the whispering.\n\nBy dawn, my mind was made up. I needed to leave. Permanently.\n\nI didn’t bother packing much—just grabbed a duffel bag, stuffed it with clothes and my laptop, and made for the front door. But the moment my hand touched the knob, I heard something behind me.\n\nNot knocking this time.\n\nBreathing.\n\nIt was slow, heavy, deliberate. Right behind me.\n\nI turned.\n\nThe door in the hallway was open.\n\nNot just a crack. Not just a sliver of darkness peeking through. It was wide open, revealing that same impossible hallway stretching far beyond what my apartment should contain. The stale scent of damp earth and dust rolled over me. The whispering had stopped.\n\nAnd then, from the shadows, something stepped forward.\n\nI didn’t wait to see what it was.\n\nI bolted.\n\nI sprinted down the hallway, yanked open my front door—\n\nAnd ran straight into my landlord.\n\n“Oof—hey, hey, where’s the fire?” he asked, steadying himself. His face twisted in irritation as he took me in—disheveled, wide-eyed, breathing like I’d just run a marathon. “You look like hell.”\n\n“There’s something in my apartment,” I gasped.\n\nHis eyes narrowed. “What kind of something?”\n\nI turned to point—\n\nThe door was gone.\n\nJust smooth, blank drywall.\n\nI swallowed hard, my pulse a chaotic drum in my ears. I stared at the empty space where it had been, my mind struggling to make sense of it. The hallway, the whispering, the thing that had been right there—\n\nGone.\n\nJust like that.\n\nMy landlord sighed, rubbing his temples. “Listen, I don’t know what’s going on with you, but you’re scaring the other tenants. Maybe take a break, get some fresh air. Sleep.”\n\nI wanted to argue. To make him believe me. But what could I say? That a door had magically appeared and led to an impossible hallway? That something had been breathing behind me, whispering to me from the dark?\n\nI shook my head. “Forget it.”\n\nI brushed past him and left the building.\n\n\n---\n\nFor three days, I stayed away. Crashed at a friend’s place, avoided my apartment like it was cursed—which, for all I knew, it was. I ignored the calls from my landlord, the texts from my neighbor asking if I was okay.\n\nI almost convinced myself that I’d imagined the whole thing.\n\nUntil the fourth night.\n\nWhen I came home.\n\nI shouldn’t have. Every instinct screamed at me to stay away. But I was tired. I wanted my own bed. Just one night. Just to grab some real clothes and find a hotel.\n\nI stepped inside cautiously. The apartment was silent. Normal.\n\nThe door wasn’t there.\n\nI exhaled, almost laughing at myself. Maybe I really had imagined it. Maybe it had been exhaustion, stress, a waking nightmare.\n\nThen I saw my phone.\n\nIt was still on the floor where I’d dropped it in my rush to leave. I picked it up and tapped the screen. The battery was dead, but before it blacked out completely, I caught a glimpse of the last photo I’d taken.\n\nThe one of the door.\n\nBut it wasn’t just the door in the picture anymore.\n\nThere was something standing in the doorway.\n\nTall. Thin. Limbs stretched too long.\n\nAnd it was smiling.\n\nThe knocking started again that night.\n\n",

        "content": "The average person did not wear a two-piece suit to a dinner with someone he’s about to divorce, but if I was leaving Grace, I might as well play the role of the high-class husband for a last time.\n\nUsually in these scenarios, the mere sight of one’s partner could vex a person, and I did not expect Grace to be the kind who wanted to end things on cordial terms. She had always been the sentimental type and held grudges with half the people she knew. But considering the things her family was capable of; a dinner didn’t seem so bad. It was rather good that I was getting a closure of the whole damned affair.\n\nOf course, Tracy was hesitant about me going. I had to swear on our child to assure her that I would indeed come out alive. ‘Keep texting me, ok?’ she said, stroking her belly. I kissed it. ‘You both can bet on it. I’ll be back by ten.’\n\nSaying this, I left for the devil’s lair.\n\nMy marriage to Grace was the perfect example of an underdog triumph. While she was an amicable woman, I couldn’t say that I married her for love. The truth was that I badly needed the money. How many marriages were based on love anyway? Even after my need subsided, I didn’t think my being with her would harm anybody. That is, until it started harming me. I still don’t understand what happened with her, but every day turned into a slow torture. Her presence became such a beastly source of irritation and unpleasantness that it could be ignored no longer. I was an outcast in her world with nobody to lean on. Except perhaps Tracy.\n\nWhen I stepped into the dining hall after months, nostalgia hit me. Far from the flaunting of sophisticated elegance I knew it as, it was dimly lit, quiet, and intimate. She rose from her chair and hugged me- the kind of hug she would give if we were still together.\n\n‘Thank goodness! For a moment, I feared that you wouldn’t come,’ she said cheerily. I took her hands off me, smiled, and sat down on the chair opposite her.\n\nShe had dressed for this occasion- a mauve gown, styled hair and bright, scarlet lips. The red of the lips was in fact so bright that it made me nauseous, reminding me that everything around was artificial. Her saccharine voice and grateful face was even more pathetic. I was glad that this was the last time I was seeing her.\n\nThe waiter poured champagne in our glasses and served us a plate of steak. Quite odd, considering that one of the habits Grace had developed simply to catch up on the trend was veganism. Since I knew her, she abstained from touching meat, saying that she cared about the well-being of animals. Well, did she care about people as much?\n\n‘How come you’ve started eating meat?’ I asked casually.\n\nHer eyes lit up, almost surprised that I’d said something to her. ‘I grew out of it. You loved steaks. My beliefs were nothing in front of the wish to hold on to your memory.’\n\nI ignored her response and resumed eating. I didn’t know whose steak it was of, but it was scrumptious. Rich, tender, and much more pleasant than the woman before me could ever be.\n\nPerhaps she sensed my displeasure, for she shifted the subject. ‘How is Tracy?’\n\n‘Good.’\n\n‘When are the two of you getting married?’\n\n‘We’ll set up a date as soon as our divorce gets finalized. She is nearing six months and I don’t want her to be uncomfortable at the wedding.'\n\n‘God bless you all.’ She fidgeted with the folds of her dress. ‘I know that I can never bear you a child, and how much it means to you…b-but I can’t help I have polycystic ovarian syndrome! I tried. I wish I could be a normal woman for you, but I can’t. I’m sorry that I can’t be the wife you need- ‘\n\n‘I never said it was your fault. Tracy…’ I breathed deeply, ‘she is the one meant for me. She’s the love of my life.’\n\nThere was a pause. Grace’s eyes stayed fixated on her plate, but the fork in her hand was shaking. ‘Is that the case? Then why did you marry me, you betraying, unfaithful idiot!’\n\nI flinched. The fork was thrown onto the nearby wall, from which it fell to the floor with a clang. She looked like she would scream more but restrained herself. The waiter brought another set of cutleries to replace the discarded fork.\n\n‘I’m sorry,’ she said, sitting down. ‘I cannot lie to you.’\n\n‘Nor can I.’\n\n‘I’ve always loved you.’\n\n‘I never did.’\n\n‘And when I found about you and Tracy…I refused to believe that you really did it. If it was just being with her, maybe I would’ve still forgiven you, but having a child? I can’t remember whether I wanted to cry or strangle you.’\n\n‘Grace, I have apologized. I never meant to hurt you, but we cannot be. I just am not made for your sort of world. And now, it’s far too gone. It would be an injustice to the baby if I even see you again.’\n\nShe lowered her head, and soon, a strange, cruel smile took over those scarlet lips. It was a smile I’d never seen on her before. Only her gaze lifted to look at me- and what a gaze it was! The soft blue of her eyes had turned cold as ice. ‘Oh, how can I believe another word of you ever again?’\n\nI felt a sense of unease. ‘What do you mean? I *do* love Tracy. Nothing will change that.’\n\nShe turned back at the food. ‘I just thought that you would want your child to be well-provided for. Can you manage it with her?’\n\n‘Since when did you start caring?’ I said dryly. She didn’t reply. My heart rate was quickening. I took large bites of the steak and washed them down with champagne. Then she chuckled.\n\n‘Do you have confidence that you’ll find a good job without me by your side? I wouldn’t be so sure. What will Tracy think of you then? Maybe she would wish that you never left me. That way, you could’ve spent your life without worrying about money again.’\n\n‘I will find some way. I must, for our child…’ the words weakly escaped my mouth. ‘No matter how hard it is, I’ll find something.’\n\nGrace nodded. ‘I root for you. Well, in that case, there’s no need for me to bring up the settlement.’\n\nI stopped eating. ‘Wait, what settlement?’\n\n‘You are determined to find a job. You wouldn’t need it,’ she said casually.\n\n‘No.’ I put down the cutlery on the table and looked at her with complete attention. ‘Tell me. What settlement had you planned?’\n\nThe look in her eyes grew soft. For a moment, she struggled to answer my question, then said, ‘Tear the divorce papers. Do not marry Tracy.’\n\nI blinked. ‘Do not marry her? But she’s carrying my child- ‘\n\n‘Keep her believing that you’re going to marry her till the child is born. Delay the divorce, make excuses about legal complexities or something…but don’t marry her. After the baby is a couple of months old, bring it here. We shall raise it as our own. It’ll be like nothing ever happened.’\n\nAnother long pause. I stared at Grace. She shrugged her shoulders.\n\n‘It’s the best for everyone involved. I will not beat around the bush. Once news spreads that you are in a relationship with our house help, you’re done for. There will be scandal, and it’s you who shall suffer. People shall call your child a bastard. Let me not mention what they’ll call Tracy. As for you, no firm will hire the man who ruined our family name. Is that what you want?’\n\nI did not know what to say. My voice had gotten stuck inside my throat. Grace was right; yes, for once in her life she was absolutely right. I never should’ve messed with a family as influential as hers. My career, my dreams, my ambitions…all would go to waste if I left her now. This wasn’t fair. I’d worked to get this far, and I couldn’t ruin my child’s future due to my mistake. I couldn’t.\n\nI sank into the chair. Sweat formed and fell down my temples in the form of beads. It seemed like even the half-eaten steak and the glass of hurriedly-drunk champagne were staring at me, waiting for my decision.  I couldn’t bear her presence. I couldn’t bear it. But it was the best for me. For my future. For my child. For my child’s future. It was the best for everyone.\n\n‘Don’t you love Tracy?’\n\nGrace’s tone was dripping of mockery and derision at my helplessness.\n\nTracy wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. She was young, she was naïve, and she had faith in me. But hearts got broken every day. She was my support in the days I’d been forced to spend with Grace…but what was she more than that? Grace just wanted me married to her. Even as I had to bear her presence, I could continue loving Tracy in secret. Or better, I could find another woman to love me unconditionally, whom I could start afresh with. A woman who had no clue of the sins I’d committed to survive in this world.\n\n‘I,’ my throat croaked. I cleared it. ‘I accept your proposal.’\n\nAs if by cue, the waiter walked up to the table and served something which wasn’t food. I bent forward to see that it was some sort of document. The divorce papers.\n\n‘Are you certain?’ asked Grace sweetly.\n\n‘Absolutely certain.’\n\nI held the papers and ripped them till they were but white ribbons and threw them in the fireplace. They caught fire immediately and turned an ugly red before becoming ash.\n\nGrace was satisfied. ‘Good choice. Finish up your meal now.’\n\nI picked up the fork and knife. ‘Have I just sold my soul to the devil?’\n\n‘What you have to decide now is if the price was worth it.’\n\nI chuckled slightly and focused on the steak. It had gone cold by now, but was no less tender. Such succulent meat! Chefs at this place never skimped on seasonings as well. I made a mental note to have it made regularly once I returned to the house.\n\nI had taken in the last bite, when she whispered, ‘Darling, do you have love for anybody at all?’\n\n‘Why?’ I asked midway chewing. Something hard hit my teeth. I wrinkled up my nose. After swallowing whatever meat there was, I put my hand to my mouth and spitted the thing out.\n\nIt was a ring. A ring made of rose gold with a studded diamond in it worth 1.5 carats. I knew this information, for I had bought that ring.\n\nIt was an engagement ring.\n\nTracy’s engagement ring.\n\nA chill rushed through my spine. The fork began trembling and soon dropped to the floor. My stomach churned. I knew it was too late to throw it up but I tried anyway. Grace laughed; her lips as bright of a scarlet as ever.\n\nI couldn’t believe it. As the horror seeped in, I found the hall spinning around me, engulfing me into a world where there was only the feeling of regret and the sound of Grace’s laugh. Then came a cry which was too bloodcurdling to be mine.\n\n‘How dare you…IT WAS MY BABY!’",

        "content": "This happened when I was in my teen years, back when I lived in an apartment complex with a huge patch of dirt behind it—probably five miles of nothing but cracked ground. No buildings, no trees, nothing. I always thought it was weird that no one had built anything there, but I never really questioned it.\n\nIt was around 6 p.m. The sun was starting to dip, but it wasn’t dark yet—just that in-between time. I was on my back patio, sweeping off the dirt patch. At first, it was faint, so quiet I almost didn’t notice it. A low electric hum, like a distant buzz, but it wasn’t from my phone, or my neighbors, or anything I could explain. It felt like it was coming from the dirt patch itself.\n\nI thought maybe it was just me. Maybe I was imagining it. But it wasn’t. The sound got louder, sharper, until it was undeniable. Something wasn’t right.\n\nI looked out at the dirt field, but nothing seemed out of place.\n\nAnd then—it just appeared.\n\nNot with a beam of light. No crash, no explosion—just a low, metallic hum. A saucer-shaped craft, hovering about two feet above the ground, just sitting there, no lights, no windows, no indication of anything but dull matte black.\n\nI didn’t move.\n\nThe buzzing sound faded, and then what seemed like an invisible doorframe popped open. It was so perfectly made that at first, I didn’t notice it, like it blended into the craft itself. Then, metal stairs dropped down.\n\nAnd then—something stepped out.\n\nIt was tall, black, and thin, but not fragile. Its skin had that same matte black sheen, reflecting the last bits of daylight. It had small, pure white eyes that darted all around. One second, it was looking at me, the next second, it was staring at the ground. Then it looked up at the sky, then at the neighbor’s apartment complex. It just kept looking around, like it didn’t know what to focus on.\n\nFor a moment, it just stood there, staring around. Then, without warning, it was right in front of me.\n\nIt didn’t walk. It just… appeared.\n\nIt raised the black stick and pointed it directly at my forehead.\n\nAnd then—\n\nIt spoke. Not out loud, but inside my head.\n\n“You are nothing but a passing shadow. You exist because we allow it.”\n\n“The veil is thinning. The sky will break. The cycle must continue.”\n\n“You will not remember this in the way you wish to.”\n\nI felt a sharp pressure in my skull, like something was squeezing my brain, forcing the words into me. It wasn’t a voice, it was like it was pressing its thoughts into me.\n\nAnd then—\n\nI somehow woke up, lying in my bed. I didn’t know how I got there. My head was spinning. I had a very bad migraine, one that didn’t go away until the next morning.\n\nI ran back outside to the patio. Everything was normal. There was no one. No ship. Just the same boring patch of dirt.",

        "author": "_Marvin35",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "Part 1 \\[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jhl4af/the\\_boiler\\_room\\_at\\_our\\_school\\_wasnt\\_for\\_boilers/\\]\n\nA few days ago, I wrote a post about the basement of our school—the one that officially doesn't exist. I thought that was the end of the story.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIt won't leave me alone. The construction site, the barricades... it feels like they're hiding something. Something that shouldn’t be found.\n\nSo, I went back.\n\n**Day 1**\n\nI snuck into the construction site. The entrance I found last time was still there. This time, it was quiet. Not a single sound breaking through the basement, no voices echoing in the air. It was like the place itself grew quieter with every step I took.\n\nThe metal doors I had seen before were wide open again. I went deeper.\n\nThe room with the table was still there, but it was positioned differently. Further from the wall, in the center of the room. I didn’t want to know why. But I had to search the room again.\n\nIn one corner, I found an old photo. It was faded, almost eaten away by time, but it showed a group of students I didn’t recognize. But the image was unsettling. A man stood in the middle—I couldn’t make out his face, but the look in his eyes… It was like a shadow that almost felt too real.\n\nI took it with me. I felt uneasy, but I couldn’t stop searching. The notebook I found in the same corner was covered in dust, like a relic. The pages were full of numbers, names, and strange notes. Some pages were almost completely illegible, as if they had been deliberately destroyed. But something wasn’t right. These names… I didn’t know them. And yet, it felt like I had seen them before.\n\nI left the room and kept going. The feeling of not being alone grew stronger. I heard footsteps behind me, but every time I turned around, no one was there. I stayed calm, tried not to get distracted, but it was getting harder.\n\n**Day 2**\n\nI just couldn’t stop. So, I went back tonight. This time, I took everything I could find—the notebook, the photo I mentioned yesterday. I needed to know more. I had to understand what was really going on here.\n\nI went deeper into the basement than ever before. There were more hallways than I originally thought. Each led to a different room, and each felt emptier than the last. But then I found one room that was different. The walls were covered in black lines, like strokes that crossed and layered over each other. The walls themselves looked like they had changed over the years—they were weak and cracked, as if they were carrying the weight of something.\n\nIn the center of the room was something I didn’t recognize at first. It was a chair—old, rusted, with leather padding. But something about this chair was wrong. The room suddenly felt tighter. The air thicker, and I had the sense that the walls were closing in.\n\nI wanted out.\n\nI ran back toward the exit, but as I climbed the stairs, I heard those footsteps again. This time, they were too close. I turned around, but no one was there. Just the darkness.\n\nWhen I finally made it to the surface and walked away from the ruins, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It was like someone was still down there.\n\nI thought it was over.\n\nBut when I got home, my phone suddenly buzzed. The message was short and unmistakable:\n\n*“You’ve seen too much.”*\n\nI stared at the words. My heart was pounding. Who had sent this? And what did it mean?\n\nI tried to stay calm, but the feeling of threat only grew. It couldn’t be a coincidence that this message came right after my last visit to the basement.\n\nSo, I decided to look up the company working on the construction site. They had to know what was going on there. Maybe I would find something that gave me more answers.\n\nI began digging into “Oldstone Construction,” the company responsible for the project. At first, I found little—just a small, unassuming company that mostly handled renovations and rebuilds. But then, I came across an old press release that made my blood run cold.\n\nIn the press release was the name of the director. And to my horror, it was the same person who was the principal of my school.\n\nHe was the owner of the company.\n\nThe company that was currently rebuilding the property.\n\nIt wasn’t a coincidence. The principal knew more than he was letting on. He was deeply involved in this mysterious project.\n\nI started digging even deeper. On the next pages, I found more clues—buildings that had been “renovated” but had no official records. Everything seemed to be connected. And it was clear: The principal didn’t want me to find out.\n\nI was getting closer to the truth.\n\nBut then, as I continued my research, something happened that almost made me lose my mind: A message appeared on my phone.\n\n*“You need to stop. You don’t know what you’re doing.”*\n\nIt didn’t come from an unknown number, but from a company I had never seen before: “Oldstone Construction.”\n\nI knew I had gone too far.",

        "title": "My Current Research Project into Dark Energy has Hit a Snag",
        "author": "emflux",
        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "No, I do not mean dark energy as in spooky energy or eldritch energy or any other sci-fi mumbo jumbo bull-crap out there.\n\nDark energy is theorized to be the largest form of energy that exists in this universe. It makes up roughly 68% of the total energy here, in this universe, as of now. It is so powerful that it causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.\n\nThat's right. The universe does not expand at a constant rate! How cool is that?\n\nWell, I must be careful. I am a scientist, so we always have to take everything with some degree of uncertainty, and the topic of dark energy is no different. Especially since the evidence for dark energy that we currently have are indirect observations from the cosmos.\n\nNow, before I tell you about the snag that I encountered, I must inform you that everything coming out of my mouth is confidential. You must swear to your God or various Gods that you will never tell a soul about it. Otherwise, well, you know.\n\nOn top of that, my supervisor has forbidden me from disclosing any technical details about the experiment. Only the aftermath of the problem. So, I will only be referring to this experiment as Operation Dark Radar.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can describe to you at a high-level what Operation Dark Radar is all about.\n\nOperation Dark Radar is, well was, our ambitious attempt to directly detect and measure dark energy. We have developed a sophisticated array of instruments designed to capture the faintest signals that might indicate the presence of dark energy. Our goal is to understand its properties and behavior, and ultimately, to unlock its secrets.\n\nIn short, we have two questions that we want answered: What the hell is dark energy? And why does it exist?\n\nThe superiors, on the other hand, want another question answered: How can we harness and use dark energy?\n\nThis should be sufficient for you to understand what Operation Dark Radar is all about. Now, I will describe to you the lab. Again, at a high level.\n\nThe facility is huge and located 2.3 kilometers underground. This serves several purposes.\n\nThe first one is to shield our instruments from external radiation emitted from human-made sources. For example, we want to limit radio waves, microwaves, x-rays, gamma rays, and other forms of radiation produced in cities from affecting our instruments.\n\nSecondly, we don’t want the public to find out. None of that pseudo-scientific journalism sensationalizing this important research. We also don’t want foreign or domestic actors stealing or interfering with our research.\n\nAnd last, but certainly my favorite, we need to monitor the equipment 24/7. That’s right. We get to live here! Like mole people! I know many people here hate that, but I love it.\n\nThe day-to-day? What’s that like? Hmmm.\n\nThe equipment needs to be checked every 30 minutes as even a temperature change of a single degree Celsius will ruin everything and cause a 24-hour downtime just to get everything back to optimum levels. And the temperatures we are reaching are near-zero, close to 10 degrees Kelvin or -263.15 degrees Celsius.\n\nSo myself, Kristoff, Hamil, Erica, Sabrina, and Arnold rotate between shifts to monitor the system. Kristoff and I monitor the morning shift, between 00:00 and 08:00. Hamil and Erica monitor the system between 08:00 and 16:00. And Sabrina and Arnold monitor the system between 16:00 and 00:00.\n\nMonitoring procedures are pretty standard, you know. Check temperature. Check electronics. Check that controlled measurements match calibration.\n\nAfter that, we can finally check the equipment to see if it has picked up any anomalies. For us to be sure that the measurements are meaningful, we need to ensure that the confidential metric is six standard deviations away from the baseline. My apologies, I see that you are anxious and want to know more about it, but I am afraid that this technical detail is on a need-to-know basis.\n\nEvery so often, our equipment picks up massive events in the universe. Do you recall the massive gamma-ray burst that hit Earth on October 9, 2022? It was one of the brightest events of all time, if not the brightest. And no, it wasn’t because of the gamma rays—they cannot penetrate 2.3 kilometers into the Earth. The collapse of the star that caused that massive burst also emitted both neutrinos and gravitational waves, which Dark Radar can detect. Unfortunately, due to the sensitivity of our equipment, everything got destabilized. It took us at least a week to return everything back to normal.\n\nThis is as far as I am willing to go in terms of day-to-day details. Both of our lives are on the line in terms of what information we exchange here today. But to be honest, only yours is truly at risk. \n\nLet’s move on to the problem we encountered a week ago, March 16, 2025.\n\nKristoff and I were in charge of monitoring the tools in the morning. Precisely at 03:18, our equipment detected an extremely powerful anomaly. We were afraid of our equipment destabilizing, so we put the lab on high alert and woke everyone up.\n\nErica and Arnold checked the internet using a secured computer with several layers of security. They found nothing from the public that could explain our equipment issues.\n\nSabrina and Hamil ran diagnostic scans on the equipment to ensure that everything was stable. Sure enough, the equipment’s temperature was stable, and the controlled measurements did not deviate from the calibration.\n\nKristoff was manning the classified metric monitoring while I was checking the radar component to determine approximately where the anomaly occurred.\n\nAfter the initial radar scan, I had to check again. I found that the anomaly occurred inside the lab. After running this scan maybe five, six times, it was all consistent—it was right here in this lab. Looking at the screen, it appeared very small. Kristoff checked the metrics and found that this thing, whatever it was, was emitting power at roughly the same amount as the collapse of a star that emitted that massive gamma-ray burst back on October 9, 2022.\n\nThis was when we called headquarters, notifying them of our findings. They decided to send a huge detachment of security and technicians to help protect the equipment. Within 15 minutes, a detachment of 20 soldiers arrived, along with 17 technicians.\n\nWithin one hour of receiving the detachment, there was an incident with one of the security teams. At the northwest corner of the lab, we heard loud screams. And it wasn’t just the typical screams of fear you hear in the movies. It was horrible. They sounded as if they were in a tremendous amount of pain. On top of that, we also heard the sounds of bones snapping and cracking. The strangest part was that the screams would gradually rise to a higher pitch, then, silence.\n\nWe, as in the research team—all six of us including myself—could hear the security leader use the radio to inquire a report from team Epsilon. We only heard silence as a response. This was when he ordered an evacuation of the facility. I could see why the leader was promoted to his position. I think his name was Andrew.\n\nStubborn me demanded that this facility be secured. That he needed to send his soldiers to investigate. Andrew replied to my demand, stating that further casualties must be avoided, and that at least the equipment can be replaced but good people cannot.\n\nThinking about it now, I was a fool, but a lucky fool. He was gathering everyone to go up the huge service elevator to make it to a safe place, in the security headquarters near the surface. However, I decided to grab the handgun on the corner of the monitoring table while no one was looking, and I snuck away from the group.\n\nMy goal? Well, I guess at the time it was to look for this thing, kill it, and secure my lab. Like I said, I was a fool.\n\nBut lucky though. Sadly, five minutes after sneaking off, I could see everyone on the elevator going up. However, I saw this black thing forming at the ceiling of the elevator just above Andrew’s head. Black is not the right word; while I was looking at this thing form, it looked like it was sucking all color around it. So, I think the correct thing to say is the lack of color rather than black, as that’s what it looked like to me.\n\nThat’s when I could see everyone in the elevator appear to slowly get sucked into this thing. The best way to describe this is the effects of an object going into a black hole. As they were drawn closer, their bodies began to stretch and elongate, a process known as spaghettification, caused by the intense tidal forces. Limbs and torsos extended grotesquely, their forms becoming thin and distorted as if they were being pulled apart like strands of spaghetti.\n\nThey crossed what seemed like an event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing can escape. The light around them started to shift to a deep red, a gravitational redshift, making them appear dimmer and more distant. Their screams appear to fade while their pitch appears to increase, swallowed by the darkness. As they were sucked into this black hole-like phenomenon, time itself seemed to slow down for them, a phenomenon known as time dilation, until they appeared to freeze in place.\n\nFinally, they were pulled towards the center, where the gravitational forces were infinitely strong, crushing them into an infinitely small point, much like the singularity at the heart of a black hole. Their bodies compressed into a singularity, an unfathomable point of infinite density, where the known laws of physics ceased to exist. \n\nI won’t go further into the gory details. After viewing this horrible thing for roughly five minutes, I decided to turn around and hide. I dropped the gun and hid under my desk, trying to use my chair to conceal my body.\n\nIt must have felt like an hour or so of sheer silence after the entire team’s death. I was contemplating what to do next. That’s when I saw the table in front of me slowly start to lose color. The vibrant hues drained away, leaving behind a dull, lifeless gray. Then I saw this thing, made out of a lack of color, walk through it, towards me. It was as if the very essence of color was being consumed by its presence, creating a void that seemed to absorb all light and life around it.\n\nIt looked human, but there was something profoundly unsettling about its appearance. Its entire body was made out of a lack of color. It had arms and legs, but they were smooth and featureless, devoid of any distinguishing marks or textures. There were no fingers or toes, just blunt, rounded ends where they should have been. Its head was equally featureless—no hair, no eyes, no ears, no mouth, nothing. It was as if someone had sculpted a human form out of pure darkness, erasing all traces of individuality and expression.\n\nAs it moved closer, the air around it seemed to grow colder. It stopped a few meters in front of me. Then it pointed towards me with one of its featureless limbs. I wanted to run, but instead, I left my hiding place and stood still. I knew there was no way to escape this thing. All I could do was wait and accept my fate.\n\nI started to receive visions in my head. It appeared as if it was showing me a civilization made of the void. It was a realm of emptiness, where light and color were swallowed by an all-encompassing darkness. The beings that inhabited this place were shadows, entities formed from the very essence of the void. They were not humanoid; their shapes were fluid and ever-changing, shifting between forms that defied comprehension. They moved with an eerie grace, reminiscent of laminar flow or water flow without turbulence.\n\nIt walked around the lab, inspecting the equipment. Well, walk is not the correct word—more like moved or flowed. Its movements were fluid and seamless, as if it were gliding through the air. That’s when it sent me another set of visions.\n\nIn these visions, I saw how our equipment had somehow managed to make a connection between Earth and the void world. It was as if a beacon of light had pierced through the impenetrable darkness, creating a bridge between our reality and theirs. The instruments, designed to detect the faintest signals of dark energy, had inadvertently tapped into the fabric of the void, opening a gateway to this shadowy realm.\n\nThis thing, this entity made of the void, was an emissary of sorts. It had crossed over through the connection we had established, drawn to the light that had penetrated its world. It moved with purpose, inspecting the equipment and the staff that had facilitated its arrival. \n\nThen, the next set of visions flooded my mind. I saw the fate of my colleagues, their demise a result of their unworthiness. The emissary had judged them, finding them lacking in the qualities necessary to continue the experiment and strengthen the connection between our worlds. Their screams and suffering were a testament to their failure to meet the standards of the void.\n\nIn stark contrast, I saw myself in these visions, singled out as the only one worthy of continuing this experiment. The emissary conveyed a sense of purpose and expectation, indicating that I possessed the qualities needed to bridge the gap between Earth and the void. It was a heavy burden, but also a strange honor. I was chosen to strengthen the connection, to delve deeper into the mysteries of dark energy and the shadowy realm it inhabited.\n\nAs the visions faded, the emissary's presence loomed over me. I knew right then and there what needs to be done. I didn’t care about my survival at that point, only to continue where I left off. I bowed to it as gesture of good will, indicating to it that I agree to its request.\n\nHowever, it seemed like it wanted further assurance from me. It wanted to show me the price of failure. \n\nSuddenly, I felt an overwhelming force pulling me towards the entity. The room around me distorted, and I was drawn into a vortex of darkness. I experienced the black hole phenomenon firsthand. My body began to stretch and elongate, the intense tidal forces causing a sensation of being pulled apart. The pain was excruciating, unlike anything I had ever felt.\n\nAs I was drawn closer, I crossed what seemed like an event horizon. The light around me shifted to a deep red, and my screams were swallowed by the void. Time itself seemed to slow down, each moment stretching into an eternity of agony. I felt myself being compressed, crushed towards an infinitely small point, the singularity at the heart of this dark realm.\n\nAs I felt myself being compressed towards the singularity, the pain and terror reached an unbearable peak. Just when I thought I could endure no more, the process began to reverse. The crushing force started to relent, and I felt my body slowly decompressing. The intense tidal forces that had stretched and elongated me began to ease, allowing my form to return to its normal shape.\n\nThe darkness that had enveloped me started to recede, and the deep red light shifted back to its original hue. Time, which had seemed to stretch into an eternity, began to flow normally again. My screams, swallowed by the void, faded into silence as the vortex of darkness released its grip on me.\n\nI found myself standing in the lab once more, right in front of it, just as before. The room around me returned to its familiar state, the equipment and surroundings no longer distorted by the black hole phenomenon.\n\nIt didn’t need to do that. I was already a scientist, driven by discovery, not by greed. But this nightmare it showed me made me realize how powerful this thing was. It was able to suck me into a black hole, never to be seen again, in the most painful way possible. And it was able to somehow reverse that process, perhaps reverse time itself. It was truly horrifying. And fascinating.\n\nBut throughout this entire process, I respected it. Not just feared it.\n\nAfter that, it disappeared.\n\nBut it did not leave. Oh no. It is now one with this world.\n\nThis left me with one thing: to finish what I started.\n\nThinking about this now, I realized that there were so many people holding me back. My research team had a secret agenda that they tried to hide from me, driven by greed. The higher-ups, too, kept me back, reducing my funding and only limiting me in areas where profit could be made.\n\nThis is not science. This is some sick, twisted perversion of it. This cannot stand.\n\nOh right. I digressed.\n\nBy the way, have you noticed how personnel have suddenly disappeared? Including the higher-ups and executives?\n\nWell, you know who to thank.\n\nNow that you’ve heard this story, I need you to take care of this company. You see, I do not have time for this, and I need someone to do it. Someone to oversee the equipment procurement and staff replacement.\n\nYou have been chosen.\n\nAre you up to it?\n\nIf you are, great! Welcome aboard!\n\nIf not, too bad.\n\nYou don’t believe me? Well, turn around.",

        "content": "Being a light sleeper has its problems. Waking up to the chirping of the crickets or when someone walks past my bedroom door. It’s almost a nightly occurrence, so I didn’t think any differently when I woke up in darkness.\n\nI laid still, wondering why I woke up. Listening to my surroundings, I didn’t immediately hear the noise. I waited, expecting to hear the flushing of a toilet or a car beeping outside, but everything was silent.\n\nAfter laying awake in bed for a couple minutes, I shrugged off the anticipated noise and closed my eyes, waiting for sleep to take over.\n\nThen, I heard it.\n\nIt sounded like a faint wisp, a current of flowing air. It wasn’t constant, it came then stopped, came then stopped.\n\nwhat could that sound be? \nI don’t have anything in my room that makes a sound like this.\n\nI consider my options.\n\nCould it be me breathing?\n\nTo test my theory—I hold my breath hoping the noise was simply me breathing myself awake.\nThe noise is still in my room.\n\nWhat…the hell?\n\nNot just because I still hear the noise, but because it sounds exclusively like someone breathing. \nI sit up, simultaneously hearing the air pockets escaping my spine, breaking the rhythmic breathing.\n\nThe first thing I see makes me choke on my breath.\n\nAt the right bottom corner of my bed, there’s a dark outline of a head. \n\nMy eyes haven’t adjusted and I desperately want to rub them, hoping that would help them adjust, but I was frozen. It was the middle of summer, the nights never went below 75, but I couldn’t stop shaking. I couldn’t take my eyes off of the thing that stared back.\n\nThe breathing sound was the same pace as when I first heard it, in, out, in, out. \n\nAfter what felt like a lifetime, I forced my rigid arm to grab my phone. I missed the nightstand a number of times before I found it, refusing to look away from the head. After finally grabbing it, I quickly turned on the flashlight and shined it on the bed’s corner.\n\nNothing. \n\nI hastily shined the light all around my room, hoping that the head was somewhere to be seen. The more I found nothing, the more frantic I became shining my light around the room. Hyperventilating.\n\nI couldn’t find it. \n\nImmediately I stopped.\n\nWas that even real or did I imagine it?, I thought to myself.\n\nThat alone brought me down from my frantic state and I was almost back to breathing normally.\nAfter doing one final shine at the spot where the head was and a final sweep around the room. I had to conclude that it was all my imagination.\n\n“Thank god”, I breathed out as the crushing weight of terror left my body. I reluctantly turned off my phone’s light and put it back on the nightstand. \n\nLaying my body back down, I still felt a tingling of fear from what I’d saw. Deciding I’d rather see nothing than anything if I woke up again, I brought my head under the covers and tucked the blanket’s opening under my head. Turning my whole body away from where I saw the head, now I could be somewhat comfortable.\n\nFinally, I was able to close my eyes and attempt to drift back to sleep.\n\nThat was until I heard the breathing again, louder than before—closer than before. \n\nI felt it. \nI FELT IT..\n\nThe hot, raspy breathing hitting the back of my neck. All I could do while frozen in terror, was whimper.",

        "content": "I don't scare easy. I’ve seen more horrors than any mythos’ demons could conjure up, man is always worse than devils, but I’m also not a liar. So I won’t sit here and tell you that: The eyes that peek over the foot of my bed every night don’t rattle me. Well, currently it’s eyes, three nights ago it was the top of a swollen bald head, and 2 weeks ago it was just fingers.\n\n\n\nI suppose the best place to start is about 2 month ago. \n\n\n\nI had finally finished moving into my new place, it was small but it was better than rotting barracks surrounded by 18 other delta force meatheads. I was alone in that crowd, a former French Foreign Legion “tourist.” of the 3rd infantry regiment, and was the only one who maintained some semblance of a sense of humor. I’m on a tangent, apologies. Vermont wasn’t my first pick, I’d much rather be sipping my brandy on the balcony of a cabin in Alaska, even if the visitor at the foot of my bed nightly was still included. But, it was close to family. And, then again at least is not some where completely without hunting opportunities like fucking California.  \n\n\n\nI digress. My brother, bless his heart, tried helping me get the moving process hurried along but he ain’t used to the prosthetic yet and so I had to take it on alone. I guess the creature had some manner of patience because only after all my shit was comfortably moved in did he make his presence known. In high sight, the knocks coming from the closet were likely the entity’s doing and those began a month before the fingers first showed up. \n\n\n\nEach night, while the moon laid still, the lunar monolith reflecting solar rays to drip feed light into my room, the tapping would start. *Tap tap tap.* Three rhythmic taps muffed by the sliding oak closet door and that was all. Three and done. Like someone knocking, waiting for the door to be opened and invited in, but giving up quickly. A week later the knock now came in a pair: *tap tap tap… tap tap tap.* This is where I started to get tickled by a bit of concern. Three taps at the same time of night, everynight wasn’t of worry, I thought it was the water heater or another piece of cheaply constructed equipment actuating in some way. But these taps were more deliberate, desperate. Pining to enter. \n\n\n\nI sat up, unable to sleep. Another week passed and skipping straight passed three sets of tap, the tapping was now constant, every three seconds: *tap… tap… tap.*\n\n\n\n“Hey! Someone there?” *Tap… Tap… Tap.* “Ay! Who the fuck is there?” I shouted. It took me a moment to realize my hand had instinctively opened my nightstand drawer and gripped the Sig Sauer 1911. I slid out of bed silently and stepped patiently across the specific floor boards that I had nailed down to make sure they wouldn’t creak. *Tap.* I threw the door open. \n\n\n\nHollow darkness hung calmly. I flicked the light switch and cleared the closet swiftly. I sighed in confusion. I had no mental ailments, every airhead they had said so, but still, it was hard to not question my own sanity. As I turned off the light I jumped, something brushed past my feet. The feeling was like standing in a flow of snakes in January. Something frigid and slithering. It flowed over my feet and underneath my bed. I clicked on the flashlight mounted on the bottom of the Sig and searched the ground. Nothing. \n\n\n\nDelusions aren’t foreign to me. The tides of combat kept my brain awake for 82 hours once and the auditory, visual, and kinetic hallucinations I experienced were far worse than this, but… the difference there is I knew that they were false. This felt so real, and I had no reason to attribute this experience to a bout of disillusionment. My breath remained steady as I toiled in thought. \n\n\n\n“Must be a dream.” I said to myself softly. “Yeah fucking right.” I opened my gun safe and moved a small portion of my arsenal around my bed. Paranoia has saved my life a thousand and one times, why fix what ain’t broke. The morning after spending all night keeping my finger steady on the trigger of the Mossberg 500 packed full with 10 gauge slugs, was my first hunting trip in Vermont since I was 12. My Father, Brother and I were heading out to some private land to get at least a buck each. I packed my Smith & Wesson model 1854 and the warmest clothes and set out.\n\n\n\nThe road was lined by centurion trees that stood guard the entire trip. Yellow strikes of paints guided the lanes but eventually faded away as the road descended further into the belly of the forest. A small red, crumbled splotch of rotting viscera wriggled on the side of the road. A small raccoon, its guts splattered and feasted on, its stomach popped open like a gory balloon. A colony of maggots had carved a freeway road to hasten the meal throughout the poor thing. It’s eye twitched, flicking to meet mine as I drove. \n\n\n\nMy tire misted the rodent as I sped up and adjusted my car to paste it. The rest of the trip was uneventful.\n\n\n\n“Hey pops.”\n\n\n\n“Ay, Melonhead! How you been kiddo?” My father snatched me up into a bear hug and squeezed as much air out of me as he could. My brother arrived about 15 minutes late but he had jerky so he was spared. \n\n\n\n“Gimpy, grab up the stool, nook is about a quarter mile deep.” My father ordered my brother like he had all throughout our childhoods. The spot was nice, not massive, but a rich bit of land for sure. \n\n\n\nWe hauled out shit through the woods and made it up into the nook with little more than a twig snap. Pops dropped a 6 pointer and Gimpy, my brother's nickname for this story, popped a 4 pointer. They headed down to get their bucks as I scanned the land with my binoculars.\n\n\n\n“Bingo.” I whispered, as I spotted an 8 point buck 130 yards out. He was broadside and still, almost begging me to drop him with a clean shot. *Tap… Tap… Tap.* The rattle of a loose pin smacking the steel frame of the nook beat in the same rhythm as the taps from the closet. I bit down on my gums. My finger hovered over the trigger as the tapping continued. What a perfect shot on a perfect buck. A shot I knew I shouldn’t take, so I didn’t. That made it angry. \n\n\n\nI switched on the safety and stewed in the silence of the nook, watching that buck through my binoculars. Still as a fucking statue.\n\n\n\nThat was the same night the fingers first appeared. I was writing in my journal, taking an intimate detail of that statuesque deer and every second before and after I spotted it. A captain’s log parse. *Tap.*\n\n\n\nThe sullen thud of the bony finger closing their grip around the edge of my bed frame. My pen froze instantly as my eye flew from the paper to the baseboard. Slender, skin and bone dark blue fingers clutched the foot of my bed with a death grip. I cocked the hammer of the revolver I had tucked into my pillow case and leveled it on the place I gauged the head was at. “Wanna say hi?” I asked and was answered with silence. I eased myself out of bed and held my aim steady as I crept closer. I took a large step, rounding the corner of my bed frame. Rail thin arms stretched all the way into the pitch black under my bed, the skin clung to the bones. I chewed on my cheek, thinking of what to do next.\n\n\n\nWhether my next course of action was stupid or not, I knew it likely wouldn’t go well. I kicked the arms, hard. The long noodle-like bone snapped and something screamed like a cat being skinned. The wailing shook my house to its foundation. “Shut up!” The house steadied to silence. “Can the bitching and moaning! If you're gonna be in my house, you’re gonna stop this creepy shit. I don’t know what you are and I don’t care very much, but as long as you are under there, you're gonna be quiet. Got it?”\n\n\n\nOnce more, I was answered with silence. \n\n\n\nThe week passed without incident. Each night I would hear the tap and sure enough the fingers would be gripping my bed frame, but it never escalated beyond that. Until that week passed. I wrote peacefully in my journal, the fingers had already appeared and I was fixing to get ready for bed soon when the boards creaked. I hurriedly grabbed the Sig under my pillow, I put the revolver in the nightstand, and clicked on the flashlight. Peaking just a few inches over top the edge of the baseboard was the bald blue head of whatever this thing was. I launched out of bed and rushed to the foot of my bed. Joining its grotesquely stretched arms was now its forehead, equally stretched to impossible proportions. I gently pressed the barrel of my pistol against it. “Don’t be stupid now.” \n\n\n\nCurrently I’m in the process of resetting my sleep schedule, sleeping in the day and staying awake all night to watch. The eyes crested over the edge a little less than three nights later. They, much like the arms and head, were stretched far under bed. The room smells like sulfur now. It’s repugnant and impossible to escape.\n\n\n\nUpdate: It’s been a few days and quite a bit has happened.\n\n\n\nLast night, as I sipped a boiling hot cup of coffee, my eyes shifted over to the window. I stared through the glass and caught the sight of something illuminated by the moonlight. A deer. No cross reference with my journal was needed, it was the same deer as the one from the woods 50 some miles away. It was just as still. Frozen in place as if time had paused. My eyes only broke away from it as I heard the floorboards shift. \n\n\n\nIt’s mouth was now visible, distended and drooling, it’s chin rested near my feet and its cheeks were pulled back to masquerade as a smile. Met with this terror I did the only reasonable thing. I shot it.\n\n\n\nIt’s left eye exploded in white fluid and strands of red threads flew into the air. Its eye twitched and so I dumped three more rounds into its face, leaping from my bed to follow its falling body. Little pisses of blood spurt out from the holes in its face. I dove forward, digging my hawk-bill knife into its eye socket and dragging it out from under my bed. Its torso was full out from under the bed and I could see its legs stretching into the inky darkness. It was fighting, the legs though scrawny fought hard to pull itself back under. I emptied my clip into its skull and chest then ditched the gun to bury my hand into its other eye socket for better grip. \n\n\n\n“Nope, you wanted fuck about, come on out!” I heard the bones of its legs crack as I slowly won the tug of war. The bones gave way and I dragged out the creature in one final painful tug. “Prick!” I grunted as I rammed my knife into its throat. Cutting through the bone and skin until its head rolled off its shoulders. \n\n\n\nI flopped to my butt as my heart slammed. I hopped to my feet, grabbed my gun, and reloaded it. I emptied that mag into the head as well and finally took a moment to calm down. I was soaked head to toe in red gore and blood from the butchering of the creature and as cold air from the AC rolled over me I shivered. \n\n\n\nCleaning up the body took longer than actually killing it. Nests of webs were formed under my bed like it had made its home there. Nothing a shop-vac can’t fix. Bleach and Lysol were the key players. Lots of bleach and hours of scrubbing. Though, having time to catch up on Creep Cast was a nice bonus. I hauled the beast out to the incinerator and tossed in manageable chunks of the nearly half ton monstrosity. \n\n\n\nAs it stands now, the thing is gone, quite literally dust in the wind, less literally water under the bridge. I’m fixing my sleep schedule, have made the crushing financial decision of buying two fresh boxes of .45 ACP, and I am still seeing that deer.\n\n\n\nI don't know what it is, but if it’s anything like whatever was under my bed, I can handle it. \n\n\n\nThat’s all for now. I don’t know if I’ll have a need to post here again, only made this in case I got killed by the bed troll or whatever. But, If I do, I'll be sure to post about it. \n\n\n\nWho knows, maybe my land is cursed. It’d sure be good for stories.\n\nLink to part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jo7gf7/my_land_is_cursed_part_2_trees_on_my_land_move/",

        "content": "There’s a moment I asked myself to never forget.\n\nI was five years old, standing in a quiet apartment not far from the school I would later attend. I don’t remember if we were moving in or moving out. The room was empty, quiet, and warm in that strange way afternoon light sometimes feels. A single bulb glowed above me, that older kind of filament light, soft and amber. Sunlight slipped through the blinds, striping the carpet with gold.\n\nThe closet was simple. Wide. Not too deep. A single shelf ran across the top. Off-white walls, a few paint chips, some shallow scuff marks on the inside. Just a closet. Nothing strange about it. But I remember standing there, looking in, and thinking something I’d never thought before.\n\n\"Remember this. Don’t forget this moment.\"\n\nI said it in my head like a promise. Not because something scary had happened. Not because I was sad or excited. I just felt something... settle. Like the air paused for a second and everything inside me stopped rushing.\n\nI stood still, staring at the empty space, and told myself to hold onto it. Forever.\n\nThat’s the part that’s always stayed with me. That a five-year-old version of me could somehow decide that this exact moment, this one quiet second in front of a nothing-special closet, needed to last a lifetime.\n\nThere were toys nearby. I think one of those old Starbright boards sat on the floor, where you plug in little lights to make glowing shapes. I also remember discovering an Etch-a-Sketch around that time, maybe in the same room or the one across the hall. I don’t remember if those memories came before or after. They just float near this one like soft little echoes. But the closet is the core. That’s the moment I chose to carry.\n\nBack then, I had trouble speaking. I won’t go too far into that now. It wasn’t something I was fully aware of yet, but I could feel the weight of it sometimes. The way it made me quiet. The way it separated me from other kids. But none of that was in the room with me that day.\n\nThat day, there was no noise inside me. Just the light, the closet, the warmth, and the decision.\n\nSometimes I think about it and wonder why I remembered. Why that moment held.\n\nAnd more than that, why I felt the need to remember it.\n\nIt was just a closet. Just a room.\n\nBut even now, after all these years, I can still feel the carpet under my feet, the way the light spilled across the floor, and the shape of the air in that quiet space.\n\nMaybe some part of me knew I’d need to come back to it.\n\nNot in person.\n\nJust here.\n\nIn memory.\n\nSometimes I wonder what would’ve happened if I hadn’t told myself to remember.\n\nWhat if I’d let that moment disappear, like all the others?\n\nI think... maybe I wasn’t supposed to forget.\n\nBut I don’t think I was supposed to remember alone...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I know she existed, I have pictures of her on my phone, hundreds. Or, I did. They're all gone now. Every trace of her has vanished and I couldn't understand why.\n\nI tried to lose myself in work, shelving books, helping customers, just keeping myself on autopilot but on the one day I was praying for a rush the store was practically a ghost town. My boss, Maddy's her name - I don't know if I mentioned that. But Maddy had me go home early, no sense hanging around with nothing to do.\n\nWhen I got home though, still on autopilot I dug my keys out of my pocket and slammed them into the lock—except there was no lock. Just smooth, painted-over drywall. I stepped back, heart hammering. This had to be some kind of sick joke. I wasn’t gone for that long, barely three hours. Just three fucking hours. But my door was gone, and in it's place was a wall, just an ordinary looking wall that blended with the rest of the hallway.\n\nI pressed my ear to its pitted surface and just listened. I don’t know what I expected. My TV playing? The hum of my fridge? Anything at all. But there was nothing, at first. Except, the longer I listened, ear pressed firm against the wall, the more I picked up a faint, distant sound. It sounded almost like breathing. Like something large, something far larger than my apartment could have held was inside it, hidden within the wall where my home used to be, was just waiting. Listening. Breathing.\n\nI stood there for minutes, just staring at that goddamned wall. It had scuff marks on it, like it had been scratched in the past by furniture being dragged down. There were stains from, something, I don't know what. It looked like it had always been there. Like the door to my home, my fucking home itself, had never even existed. Running my fingers over it, I searched the area where my door had been, where the doorknob had been. All I felt was slightly cool wall, and the occasional  dent or scratch as if it had been weathered by the passage of time and people.\n\nMy neighbor walked by just as I started kicking and pounding on that fucking wall. I didn't know what I had heard, maybe it was just a trick of my imagination, my anxiety over everything fucking with me. What I did know was that I wanted my home back. I wanted lay down in my own bed, and just curl up until everything was normal again.\n\nThat...that didn't work, obviously. My neighbor - except he's not my neighbor anymore, never was according to him called the cops. He'd never heard of me, never seen me before in his life. Neither had my landlord. I called him up begging him to explain what was going on, but he just thought I was a random lunatic. None of them knew who I was, something they both made certain to tell the cops when they showed up. As far as anyone was concerned I was just a random dude that had walked in and immediately tried to tear a wall down.\n\nThe cops, well one in particular, they seemed sympathetic to my situation. Told me they were going to let me go but I had to stay away from the apartment building. It was easy enough to agree to. Everything I owned, every memory I'd collected over the years, it was all gone. Like it never existed. My landlord...or, the man that had been my landlord, he was kind enough to not press charges against me, just told me I needed to get help.\n\nOne of the cops, the one that had been surprisingly kind, gave me his card and told me to give him a call later. It wasn't a suggestion, the way he said it - it was urgent, there was this kind of intensity behind the words I didn't understand. I nodded all the same, tucked the card away and got into my car.\n\nI didn't go anywhere, mostly I just drove around town thinking about what to do, where I'd spend the night, and listening to music.\n\nMy back was aching at the very idea of spending the night in my car, so that was out of the question. More troubling...besides every single fucking thing that had happened so far that day, while I was listening to music my favorite song came on. I've loved this song since I was a kid I'm not joking when I call it my favorite song. But as I was listening to it, it sounded...off. Like note were just slightly wrong, a lyric here or there was different. Worse, her voice itself was just...off. So close, but still wrong enough to be uncanny. Like I was listening to someone do an \\*almost\\* perfect impression of the artist I knew.\n\nIt sounded close enough to my favorite to be recognized, but different enough to leave my brain buzzing and itching with the wrongness of it. After that I had to turn off the radio, and just drove in silence, and eventually I found a decent motel on the outskirts of town. It was cheap enough that I was able to pay for a week, taking one small worry off my mind, if only for a little bit.\n\nOnce I was settled in the first thing I did was what I'd wanted to do all day. I called my mom. The second I heard her voice I was crying, and everything I'd been going through, everything that had happened to me, came out in a jumbled rush of words. That she was able to understand anything I was saying was a minor miracle in and of itself. But she did, she understood and listened and shushed me, telling me everything was going to be okay.\n\nThen she asked me something that...it confused me, made my blood run cold. She asked if I was finally ready to take her up on her offer to move in. She said she hated hearing me like this, and she thought it would do me good to have a stable living situation. When I asked her what she meant it was her turn to sound confused. Worried. She told me I'd been homeless for a while, living in my car. When I asked for how long, she couldn't say. She wasn't sure. When I asked her about my cat, she thought I meant I'd just adopted one, and immediately started scolding me for taking in a pet when I was barely taking care of myself.\n\nHearing that, I had to hang up. Before today I've always been known as someone dependable. I don't get out much, I don't do much beyond work and catching up on shows and books. But I'm always there if someone needs help, and I've always, \\*always\\* had my shit together. But the way my mom talked, it was like she thought I'd always been flaky or unreliable, things I'd proven myself not to be over and over throughout my life.\n\nI just sat there on the edge of the bed for a while staring at my phone. I started scrolling through pictures I had saved, little funny memes I traded back and forth with friends, when I noticed one in particular was missing. The only reason I noticed is because it's one I've been trading back and forth with my best friend for nearly two years now. It's just a stupid inside joke, but it makes me laugh every time it shows up. But it was gone, along with any signs of it in our message history.\n\nI texted, then tried calling, but he didn't answer and I wound up leaving a message that, in retrospect, probably sounded a little insane. Right after that I called the cop. He answered on the second ring, and as soon as I spoke he interrupted me with a brusque, \"Took you long enough.\"\n\nI had no idea what he meant by that, and said as such with an articulate, \"What?\"\n\n\"Look, I’m gonna keep this brief, kid.\" A pause. I heard muffled voices in the background. The sound of a car door slamming. \"It’s not safe to talk too long.\"\n\n\"Not safe? What the hell does that mean?\"\n\nA long, exasperated sigh was my only answer, at first. \"It means you’ve caught something’s attention. And it is very much not something you want eyeing you up.\" In the background I heard paper rustling, and a sharp, indrawn breath. Almost like he'd been on the verge of gasping, and caught himself. Then, quieter -almost a whisper - came his next question \"Are you alone?\"\n\n\"Am I - yeah, yes I'm alone. I'm in my motel room. What does that even matter?\"\n\nI asked him that at least twice, tried to ask him more questions, demanded answers. But once he was certain I'd written the address down he hung up. I tried calling again several times, but each time they went directly to voicemail. I got the hint. And I had the address. It all sounded batshit fucking crazy to me, but it felt like I was out of options. My apartment had just fucking vanished, my goddamned cat had gone the same route. I wanted my home back, my cat back, I wanted my life back. Whatever, or whoever, was at that address might have answers, solutions, so it seemed worth the risk to go.\n\n[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jnonc9/missing_fragments/)\n\n  \n[Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jpc3mk/found_and_lost/)",

        "content": "\n\nThe narrow alley folded in on itself. Each twist showing more vending machines, old wooden doors, lanterns buzzing yellow in the Tokyo night. Kenji led with that confidence locals have. I followed with the other backpackers from the hostel. Only known them three days. Kenji for barely 48 hours.\n\n\"You sure this is right?\" Emma asked, her Australian accent cutting through the humid air.\n\n\"Trust me,\" Kenji said without looking back. \"Tanaka-san's place is the best sushi in Shinjuku. Maybe all Tokyo. But tourists never find it.\"\n\nI wiped sweat from my face. Six months ago, I wouldn't have done this. Six months ago, before Sarah left and took half my life with her, I planned everything. Now I'm following strangers through back alleys in a foreign city. Saying yes to everything. Trying to outrun the hollow feeling that followed me from Chicago.\n\n\"Here,\" Kenji stopped at an unmarked door. Just a small blue curtain hanging above it. No sign. No menu. Nothing to show it was even a restaurant.\n\nInside was smaller than I expected. Just a simple counter with eight seats. The chef's workspace behind it, perfectly organized. Bare wood walls. Dim lighting focused on the counter. Tanaka-san nodded as we entered. Old man with forearms like rope. Face giving nothing away.\n\n\"Told you it was hidden,\" Kenji whispered as we sat. \"No reservation needed because tourists don't know it exists. Only locals and people who know locals.\"\n\nI felt it then. That flash of belonging. Of being special. These people had included me. The chef started working without a word. His knife catching the light.\n\n\"We'll do omakase,\" Kenji explained. \"Let the chef decide. It's traditional.\"\n\nFirst course came without fanfare. Glistening fish on small rice mounds. Texture unlike anything I'd ever had. Dissolving on my tongue like sea foam.\n\n\"This is incredible,\" Emma murmured. Everyone nodded, lost in the food.\n\nThat's when I noticed the window.\n\nHadn't seen it when we entered. Large window facing the alley. And there, pressed against it, a face. My face. But wrong somehow. Watching us eat. When I stared at it, it didn't look away.\n\n\"Do you see that?\" I asked. But the others were busy with Kenji's explanation of soy sauce technique.\n\nBy second course—Tanaka-san splitting open a sea urchin, orange insides vibrant under the light—there were three versions of me at the window. All slightly different. One smiling too widely. One with empty eyes. One just staring with such longing it hurt to see.\n\nThe chef worked with perfect precision. Hands certain as they gutted a squid. Translucent flesh quivering. Tentacles still curling even separated from the body. He arranged the pieces carefully, dabbing sauce so dark red it was nearly black.\n\nI tried focusing on the food. But the window had become a gallery of my own face. Five versions now. Seven. Some smiling slightly. Some looking lost. All me, but not me. Watching myself eat with these strangers.\n\n\"Guys,\" I said louder. \"Why are all those... people watching us?\"\n\nThe group turned, then looked back at me, confused.\n\n\"What people?\" Lisa asked.\n\n\"The window—there's like ten of me staring through the window.\"\n\nKenji glanced at the window, then back. \"There's nobody there, man.\"\n\nI turned again. My reflections pressed closer. Some smiling now. Some looking angry. Some with tears streaming down their faces. One mouthing words I couldn't understand.\n\n\"Are you serious? You don't see them?\"\n\nEmma touched my arm. \"Ryan, there's nobody there. Just the alley.\"\n\nNext course arrived—a fish still twitching as Tanaka-san drove his knife behind its gills. Its eye staring directly at me. Blood in delicate lines across the cutting board, which the chef wiped away with practiced efficiency.\n\n\"Maybe you're more jet-lagged than you thought,\" Diego suggested. Concerned but somehow distant.\n\nThe crowd at the window had grown. Twenty versions of me now. Some laughing at me. Some crying. One pressing his palm flat against the glass, leaving a foggy handprint. Another writing something in the condensation, backwards so I could read it from inside: \"SHE'S NEVER COMING BACK.\"\n\nSweat beading on my forehead. Am I hallucinating? The chef sliced the fish's belly, removing organs with two fingers. The blood so bright against white porcelain.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I stood suddenly. \"Bathroom?\"\n\nTanaka-san gestured toward the back without looking up from his work. I walked unsteadily, feeling my own eyes following me from the window.\n\nIn the tiny bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face. My reflection looked wrong—too pale, eyes too wide. I'd been so open with these people. Told them about Sarah that first night over beers. How she said I was too intense, too needy. How I'd smothered her. How I'd come to Japan to find something new, to become someone new.\n\nHad they been laughing at me? Pitying the sad American with his broken heart story?\n\nWhen I returned, the chef was blowtorching salmon skin, fat bubbling under blue flame. The window now completely filled with versions of me. Some had phones out, recording my humiliation. One wore the exact outfit I had on the day Sarah left. Another looked like me but successful, confident, everything I wasn't.\n\n\"Better?\" Lisa asked as I sat down.\n\n\"Do you think I'm crazy?\" I blurted out.\n\nThey exchanged glances.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Diego said carefully.\n\n\"Then why won't you acknowledge what's in the window? Is this some joke?\"\n\nKenji put down his chopsticks. \"Ryan, I promise, there's nobody at that window. Just glass reflecting the inside of the restaurant.\"\n\nI turned again. A sea of my own faces stared back. More than could possibly fit in the narrow alley. Some looked concerned now. Some mouthed \"GO HOME.\" Some wore expressions of pity that made me want to scream.\n\nThe chef placed another piece before me. This fish's eye followed me, accusing me of something I couldn't name.\n\n\"Maybe the sake was stronger than you thought,\" Emma suggested gently.\n\n\"I've had one cup,\" my voice rising. \"I'm not drunk. I'm not crazy. I'm seeing myself—all these versions of myself—and you're all pretending not to see them.\"\n\nThe laughter from outside grew louder. I could hear my own voice, multiplied, mocking me.\n\n\"Ryan,\" Kenji said quietly, \"there's no one there.\"\n\n\"Then what's that noise? The laughing?\"\n\nThey looked confused. \"What laughing?\" Lisa asked.\n\nThe chef continued working, unbothered. Preparing fugu now, the poisonous blowfish that could kill if cut wrong. His knife moved with surgical precision, separating toxic organs from edible flesh. I watched, transfixed, as he arranged paper-thin slices in a chrysanthemum pattern.\n\nMy reflections pressed against the glass, breath fogging it in patches. Some were tapping now, trying to get my attention. One wore the sweater Sarah had given me last Christmas. Another held up a photo of her with someone else.\n\n\"I need to go,\" I stood suddenly.\n\n\"But we're only halfway through,\" Diego protested.\n\n\"I can't—I need air.\"\n\nI fumbled for my wallet, dropping yen notes on the counter before pushing past the others. Felt their eyes on my back as I headed for the door, heard their concerned murmurs.\n\nOutside, the alley was empty. No reflections, no watchers, just humid night and distant street sounds.\n\nI spun around, looking everywhere. Nothing. Moved to the window and looked inside. Could see my new friends, their faces concerned, Kenji saying something with a worried expression. Tanaka-san continued his meticulous preparation, unfazed.\n\nBut there, at the end of the counter where I had been sitting, was another version of me—but different. This one looked calm. At peace. Connected with the others in a way I couldn't manage. He turned slowly to face the window, looking directly at me with perfect understanding. Then smiled, raised his sake cup in silent toast, and turned back to watch the chef's knife flash in the light.\n\nI backed away from the window, heart racing. The reflections I'd seen—had they been warning me? Showing me what I'd become? Or what I could be?\n\nLeaned against the alley wall, breathing hard. I could go back inside, rejoin the group, pretend everything was fine. They'd welcome me back with concern, inclusion. Connection. Isn't that what I traveled halfway around the world for?\n\nBut as I looked through the window once more, all I saw was my own face reflected in the glass—alone, fragmented in the panes, watching myself with countless versions of my own eyes. The version sitting at the counter, integrated with these new friends, seemed more real than the me standing outside in the dark.\n\nWhich was the real me? The one who could connect, or the one forever watching from behind glass?\n\nI turned and walked quickly away into the maze of alleys, alone with the sound of my own laughter echoing off the walls.",

        "subreddit": "nosleep",
        "content": "It was a fun little adventure. Exploring through the trees, hearing all kinds of birds and insect life. One big problem with Vietnam is there are always mosquitos everywhere, and surprise surprise, the jungle was no different. I still had a hard time getting acquainted with the Vietnamese heat, but luckily the hottest days of the year had come and gone. It was a rather cloudy day, but I figured if I got too hot in the jungle, I could potentially look forward to some much-welcomed rain. Although I was very much enjoying myself, even with the heat and biting critters, Aaron’s crew insisted on stopping every 10 minutes to document our journey. This was their expedition after all, so I guess we couldn’t complain. \n\nI got to know Aaron’s colleagues a little better. The two guys were Steve (the hairy guy) and Miles the cameraman. They were nice enough guys I guess, but what was kind of annoying was Miles would occasionally film me and the group, even though we weren’t supposed to be in the documentary. The maroon-haired girl of their group was Sophie. The two of us got along really great and we talked about what it was like for each of us back home. Sophie was actually raised in the Appalachians in a family of all boys - and already knew how to use a firearm by the time she was ten. Even though we were completely different people, I really cared for her, because like me, she clearly didn’t have the easiest of upbringings – as I noticed under her tattoos were a number of scars. A creepy little quirk she had was whenever we heard an unusual noise, she would rather casually say the same thing... ‘If you see something, no you didn’t. If you hear something, no you didn’t...’ \n\nWe had been hiking through the jungle for a few hours now, and there was still no sign of the mysterious trail. Aaron did say all we needed to do was continue heading north-west and we would eventually stumble upon it. But it was by now that our group were beginning to complain, as it appeared we were making our way through just a regular jungle - that wasn’t even unique enough to be put on a tourist map. What were we doing here? Why weren’t we on our way to Hue City or Ha Long Bay? These were the questions our group were beginning to ask, and although I didn’t say it out loud, it was now what I was asking... But as it turned out, we were wrong to complain so quickly. Because less than an hour later, ready to give up and turn around... we finally discovered something... \n\nIn the middle of the jungle, cutting through a dispersal of sparse trees, was a very thin and narrow outline of sorts... It was some kind of pathway... A trail... We had found it! Covered in thick vegetation, our group had almost walked completely by it – and if it wasn’t for Hayley, stopping to tie her shoelaces, we may still have been searching. Clearly no one had walked this pathway for a very long time, and for what reason, we did not know. But we did it! We had found the trail – and all we needed to do now was follow wherever it led us. \n\nI’m not even sure who was the happier to have found the trail: Aaron and his colleagues, who reacted as though they made an archaeological discovery - or us, just relieved this entire day was not for nothing. Anxious to continue along the trail before it got dark, we still had to wait patiently for Aaron’s team. But because they were so busy filming their documentary, it quickly became too late in the day to continue. The sun in Vietnam usually sets around 6 pm, but in the interior of the forest, it sets a lot sooner. \n\nMaking camp that night, we all pitched our separate tents. I actually didn’t own a tent, but Hayley suggested we bunk together, like we were having our very own sleepover – which meant Brodie rather unwillingly had to sleep with Chris. Although the night brought a boatload of bugs and strange noises, Tyler sparked up a campfire for us to make some s'mores and tell a few scary stories. I never really liked scary stories, and that night, although I was having a lot of fun, I really didn’t care for the stories Aaron had to tell. Knowing I was from Utah, Aaron intentionally told the story of Skinwalker Ranch – and now I had more than one reason not to go back home.  \n\nThere were some stories shared that night I did enjoy - particularly the ones told by Tyler. Having travelled all over the world, Tyler acquired many adventures he was just itching to tell. For instance, when he was backpacking through the Bolivian Amazon a few years ago, a boat had pulled up by the side of the river. Five rather shady men jump out, and one of them walks right up to Tyler, holding a jar containing some kind of drink, and a dozen dead snakes inside! This man offered the drink to Tyler, and when he asked what the drink was, the man replied it was only vodka, and that the dead snakes were just for flavour. Rather foolishly, Tyler accepted the drink – where only half an hour later, he was throbbing white foam from the mouth. Thinking he had just been poisoned and was on the verge of death, the local guide in his group tells him, ‘No worry Señor. It just snake poison. You probably drink too much.’ Well, the reason this stranger offered the drink to Tyler was because, funnily enough, if you drink vodka containing a little bit of snake venom, your body will eventually become immune to snake bites over time. Of all the stories Tyler told me - both the funny and idiotic, that one was definitely my favourite! \n\nFeeling exhausted from a long day of tropical hiking, I called it an early night – that and... most of the group were smoking (you know what). Isn’t the middle of the jungle the last place you should be doing that? Maybe that’s how all those soldiers saw what they saw. There were no creatures here. They were just stoned... and not from rock-throwing apes. \n\nOne minor criticism I have with Vietnam – aside from all the garbage, mosquitos and other vermin, was that the nights were so hot I always found it incredibly hard to sleep. The heat was very intense that night, and even though I didn’t believe there were any monsters in this jungle - when you sleep in the jungle in complete darkness, hearing all kinds of sounds, it’s definitely enough to keep you awake.  \n\nEarly that next morning, I get out of mine and Hayley’s tent to stretch my legs. I was the only one up for the time being, and in the early hours of the jungle’s dim daylight, I felt completely relaxed and at peace – very Zen, as some may say. Since I was the only one up, I thought it would be nice to make breakfast for everyone – and so, going over to find what food I could rummage out from one of the backpacks... I suddenly get this strange feeling I’m being watched... Listening to my instincts, I turn up from the backpack, and what I see in my line of sight, standing as clear as day in the middle of the jungle... I see another person... \n\nIt was a young man... no older than myself. He was wearing pieces of torn, olive-green jungle clothing, camouflaged as green as the forest around him. Although he was too far away for me to make out his face, I saw on his left side was some kind of black charcoal substance, trickling down his left shoulder. Once my tired eyes better adjust on this stranger, standing only 50 feet away from me... I realize what the dark substance is... It was a horrific burn mark. Like he’d been badly scorched! What’s worse, I then noticed on the scorched side of his head, where his ear should have been... it was... It was hollow.  \n\nAlthough I hadn’t picked up on it at first, I then realized his tattered green clothes... They were not just jungle clothes... The clothes he was wearing... It was the same colour of green American soldiers wore in Vietnam... All the way back in the 60s. \n\nTelling myself I must be seeing things, I try and snap myself out of it. I rub my eyes extremely hard, and I even look away and back at him, assuming he would just disappear... But there he still was, staring at me... and not knowing what to do, or even what to say, I just continue to stare back at him... Before he says to me – words I will never forget... The young man says to me, in clear audible words...  \n\n‘Careful Miss... Charlie’s everywhere...’ \n\nOnly seconds after he said these words to me, in the blink of an eye - almost as soon as he appeared... the young man was gone... What just happened? What - did I hallucinate? Was I just dreaming? There was no possible way I could have seen what I saw... He was like a... ghost... Once it happened, I remember feeling completely numb all over my body. I couldn’t feel my legs or the ends of my fingers. I felt like I wanted to cry... But not because I was scared, but... because I suddenly felt sad... and I didn’t really know why.  \n\nFor the last few years, I learned not to believe something unless you see it with your own eyes. But I didn’t even know what it was I saw. Although my first instinct was to tell someone, once the others were out of their tents... I chose to keep what happened to myself. I just didn’t want to face the ridicule – for the others to look at me like I was insane. I didn’t even tell Aaron or Sophie, and they believed every fairy-tale under the sun. \n\nBut I think everyone knew something was up with me. I mean, I was shaking. I couldn’t even finish my breakfast. Hayley said I looked extremely pale and wondered if I was sick. Although I was in good health – physically anyway, Hayley and the others were worried. I really mustn’t have looked good, because fearing I may have contracted something from a mosquito bite, they were willing to ditch the expedition and take me back to Biển Hứa Hẹn. Touched by how much they were looking out for me, I insisted I was fine and that it wasn’t anything more than a stomach bug. \n\nAfter breakfast that morning, we pack up our tents and continue to follow along the trail. Everything was the usual as the day before. We kept following the trail and occasionally stopped to document and film. Even though I convinced myself that what I saw must have been a hallucination, I could not stop replaying the words in my head... “Careful miss... Charlie’s everywhere.” There it was again... Charlie... Who is Charlie?... Feeling like I needed to know, I ask Chris what he meant by “Keep a lookout for Charlie”? Chris said in the Vietnam War movies he’d watched, that’s what the American soldiers always called the enemy... \n\nWhat if I wasn’t hallucinating after all? Maybe what I saw really was a ghost... The ghost of an American soldier who died in the war – and believing the enemy was still lurking in the jungle somewhere, he was trying to warn me... But what if he wasn’t? What if tourists really were vanishing here - and there was some truth to the legends? What if it wasn’t “Charlie” the young man was warning me of? Maybe what he meant by Charlie... was something entirely different... Even as I contemplated all this, there was still a part of me that chose not to believe it – that somehow, the jungle was playing tricks on me. I had always been a superstitious person – that's what happens when you grow up in the church... But why was it so hard for me to believe I saw a ghost? I finally had evidence of the supernatural right in front of me... and I was choosing not to believe it... What was it Sophie said? “If you see something. No you didn’t. If you hear something... No you didn’t.” \n\nEven so... the event that morning was still enough to spook me. Spook me enough that I was willing to heed the figment of my imagination’s warning. Keeping in mind that tourists may well have gone missing here, I made sure to stay directly on the trail at all times – as though if I wondered out into the forest, I would be taken in an instant. \n\nWhat didn’t help with this anxiety was that Tyler, Chris and Brodie, quickly becoming bored of all the stopping and starting, suddenly pull out a football and start throwing it around amongst the jungle – zigzagging through the trees as though the trees were line-backers. They ask me and Hayley to play with them - but with the words of caution, given to me that morning still fresh in my mind, I politely decline the offer and remain firmly on the trail. Although I still wasn’t over what happened, constantly replaying the words like a broken record in my head, thankfully, it seemed as though for the rest of the day, nothing remotely as exciting was going to happen. But unfortunately... or more tragically... something did...  \n\nBy mid-afternoon, we had made progress further along the trail. The heat during the day was intense, but luckily by now, the skies above had blessed us with momentous rain. Seeping through the trees, we were spared from being soaked, and instead given a light shower to keep us cool. Yet again, Aaron and his crew stopped to film, and while they did, Tyler brought out the very same football and the three guys were back to playing their games. I cannot tell you how many times someone hurled the ball through the forest only to hit a tree-line-backer, whereafter they had to go forage for the it amongst the tropic floor. Now finding a clearing off-trail in which to play, Chris runs far ahead in anticipation of receiving the ball. I can still remember him shouting, ‘Brodie, hit me up! Hit me!’ Brodie hurls the ball long and hard in Chris’ direction, and facing the ball, all the while running further along the clearing, Chris stretches, catches the ball and... he just vanishes...  \n\nOne minute he was there, then the other, he was gone... Tyler and Brodie call out to him, but Chris doesn’t answer. Me and Hayley leave the trail towards them to see what’s happened - when suddenly we hear Tyler scream, ‘CHRIS!’... The sound of that initial scream still haunts me - because when we catch up to Brodie and Tyler, standing over something down in the clearing... we realize what has happened... \n\nWhat Tyler and Brodie were standing over was a hole. A 6-feet deep hole in the ground... and in that hole, was Chris. But we didn’t just find Chris trapped inside of the hole, because... It wasn’t just a hole. It wasn’t just a trap... It was a death trap... Chris was dead.  \n\nIn the hole with him was what had to be at least a dozen, long and sharp, rust-eaten metal spikes... We didn’t even know if he was still alive at first, because he had landed face-down... Face-down on the spikes... They were protruding from different parts of him. One had gone straight through his wrist – another out of his leg, and one straight through the right of his ribcage. Honestly, he... Chris looked like he was crucified... Crucified face-down. \n\nOnce the initial shock had worn off, Tyler and Brodie climb very quickly but carefully down into the hole, trying to push their way through the metal spikes that repelled them from getting to Chris. But by the time they do, it didn’t take long for them or us to realize Chris wasn’t breathing... One of the spikes had gone through his throat... For as long as I live, I will never be able to forget that image – of looking down into the hole, and seeing Chris’ lifeless, impaled body, just lying there on top of those spikes... It looked like someone had toppled over an idol... An idol of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ... when he was on the cross. \n\nWhat made this whole situation far worse, was that when Aaron, Sophie, Steve and Miles catch up to us, instead of being grieved or even shocked, Miles leans over the trap hole and instantly begins to film. Tyler and Brodie, upon seeing this were furious! Carelessly clawing their way out the hole, they yell and scream after him.  \n\n‘What the hell do you think you're doing?!’ \n\n‘Put the fucking camera away! That’s our friend!’ \n\nClimbing back onto the surface, Tyler and Brodie try to grab Miles’ camera from him, and when he wouldn’t let go, Tyler aggressively rips it from his hands. Coming to Miles’ aid, Aaron shouts back at them, ‘Leave him alone! This is a documentary!’ Without even a second thought, Brodie hits Aaron square in the face, breaking his glasses and knocking him down. Even though we were both still in extreme shock, hyperventilating over what just happened minutes earlier, me and Hayley try our best to keep the peace – Hayley dragging Brodie away, while I basically throw myself in front of Tyler.  \n\nOnce all of the commotion had died down, Tyler announces to everyone, ‘That’s it! We’re getting out of here!’ and by we, he meant the four of us. Grabbing me protectively by the arm, Tyler pulls me away with him while Brodie takes Hayley, and we all head back towards the trail in the direction we came.  \n\nThinking I would never see Sophie or the others again, I then hear behind us, ‘If you insist on going back, just watch out for mines.’ \n\n...Mines?  \n\nStopping in our tracks, Brodie and Tyler turn to ask what the heck Aaron is talking about. ‘16% of Vietnam is still contaminated by landmines and other explosives. 600,000 at least. They could literally be anywhere.’ Even with a potentially broken nose, Aaron could not help himself when it came to educating and patronizing others.  \n\n‘And you’re only telling us this now?!’ said Tyler. ‘We’re in the middle of the Fucking jungle! Why the hell didn’t you say something before?!’ \n\n‘Would you have come with us if we did? Besides, who comes to Vietnam and doesn’t fact-check all the dangers?! I thought you were travellers!’ \n\nIt goes without saying, but we headed back without them. For Tyler, Brodie and even Hayley, their feeling was if those four maniacs wanted to keep risking their lives for a stupid documentary, they could. We were getting out of here – and once we did, we would go straight to the authorities, so they could find and retrieve Chris’ body. We had to leave him there. We had to leave him inside the trap - but we made sure he was fully covered and no scavengers could get to him. Once we did that, we were out of there.  \n\nAs much as we regretted this whole journey, we knew the worst of everything was probably behind us, and that we couldn’t take any responsibility for anything that happened to Aaron’s team... But I regret not asking Sophie to come with us – not making her come with us... Sophie was a good person. She didn’t deserve to be caught up in all of this... None of us did. \n\nHurriedly making our way back along the trail, I couldn’t help but put the pieces together... In the same day an apparition warned me of the jungle’s surrounding dangers, Chris tragically and unexpectedly fell to his death... Is that what the soldier’s ghost was trying to tell me? Is that what he meant by Charlie? He wasn’t warning me of the enemy... He was trying to warn me of the relics they had left... Aaron said there were still 600,000 explosives left in Vietnam from the war. Was it possible there were still traps left here too?... I didn’t know... But what I did know was, although I chose to not believe what I saw that morning – that it was just a hallucination... I still heeded the apparition’s warning, never once straying off the trail... and it more than likely saved my life... \n\nThen I remembered why we came here... We came here to find what happened to the missing tourists... Did they meet the same fate as Chris? Is that what really happened? They either stepped on a hidden landmine or fell to their deaths? Was that the cause of the whole mystery? \n\nThe following day, we finally made our way out of the jungle and back to Biển Hứa Hẹn. We told the authorities what happened and a full search and rescue was undertaken to find Aaron’s team. A bomb disposal unit was also sent out to find any further traps or explosives. Although they did find at least a dozen landmines and one further trap... what they didn’t find was any evidence whatsoever for the missing tourists... No bodies. No clothing or any other personal items... As far as they were concerned, we were the first people to trek through that jungle for a very long time...  \n\nBut there’s something else... The rescue team, who went out to save Aaron, Sophie, Steve and Miles from an awful fate... They never found them... They never found anything... Whatever the Vietnam Triangle was... It had claimed them... To this day, I still can’t help but feel an overwhelming guilt... that we safely found our way out of there... and they never did. \n\nI don’t know what happened to the missing tourists. I don’t know what happened to Sophie, Aaron and the others - and I don’t know if there really are creatures lurking deep within the jungles of Vietnam... And although I was left traumatized, forever haunted by the experience... whatever it was I saw in that jungle... I choose to believe it saved my life... And for that reason, I have fully renewed my faith. \n\nTo this day, I’m still teaching English as a second language. I’m still travelling the world, making my way through one continent before moving onto the next... But for as long as I live, I will forever keep this testimony... Never again will I ever step inside of a jungle... \n\n...Never again. ",

Em học đại học theo diện sư phạm Ngôn Ngữ và ở thành phố nhỏ chi tiêu thấp, lương làm thêm giờ ở đây cao, em có khả năng giao tiếp tốt song hành với hướng ngoại, cộng thêm ngoại hình ưa nhìn nên em có nhiều cơ hội vậy nên về học phí và phí sinh hoạt bố mẹ em không cần lo quá nhiều. Bản thân em có nhiều sở thích cá nhân, em thích đọc sách, nấu ăn, trồng cây, chạy bộ, nuôi cá, du lịch, học ngoại ngữ….em thích ngắm mây, ngắm trời, ngày nào cũng thưởng thức hương vị ấm áp của cuộc sống. Vì không cần chi trả học phí nên tiền em phần lớn dồn vào các lớp học năng khiếu và đi du lịch tự túc. Một buổi sáng thức dậy, em kéo rèm, mở cửa sổ, ánh nắng ấm áp chiếu vào, em ra ngoài tưới cây và cho cá nhỏ ăn, em ngắm nhìn bầu trời xinh đẹp sau đấy chợt nghĩ đây chẳng phải cuộc sống trước nay mình mong muốn sao? Sau đấy em đi học với tinh thần hân hoan chào ngày mới, em không mất năng lượng ở trên trường, sau khi về nhà em đi chợ và nấu ăn chờ bạn về, trong lúc đó em đọc một chút sách, nghe thời sự, học một vài tiếng. Em đi ngủ trong khi đầu không có một chút vướng bận hay lo lắng nào, em vui vì em kết thúc một ngày ý nghĩa cho chính mình và mọi người xung quanh mình. Nhưng em vẫn đang tự hỏi em đang thiếu tham vọng hay sao ạ? Sao có thể có người vừa lòng với mức sống này ạ🥹",

Mọi người cũng khuyên nên quen gần nhà cho tiện nên em có đi tập gym, chơi cầu lông đồ nhưng cũng không hiệu quả lắm.\n\nVì em đi gym lúc 5h30 sáng, mà giờ đó toàn gặp mấy cô, chú dễ thương thôi :> Cầu lông thì cũng chỉ chơi cho vui, xong thì về. Cuối tuần em cũng đi cà phê học bài với bạn (mà quán cũng toàn mấy bạn gái đẹp gái chụp hình, chứ chẳng thấy nam nào 🥹), còn đi ăn thì cũng toàn mấy quán lề đường, mà ở đó lại chủ yếu là các gia đình đi ăn với nhau.\n\nEm không chơi dating app vì không tin tưởng được các mối quan hệ qua mạng. Mọi người cho em xin lời khuyên với, bây giờ em nên chủ động tìm người yêu ở đâu, hay cứ để duyên tự tới? Sao em cứ cảm giác mình mới 22 tuổi mà đời sống tinh thần như 42 tuổi vậy😭😭😭",

Tôi chỉ bị cảm giác này đúng 2 lần vì hầu như các cô gái khác mình đều không thấy hứng thú nhưng cô gái mà tôi bị ở lần đầu cách đây cũng vài năm tôi lỡ đẩy láo tỏ tình và thất bại. Sau này tôi cũng được tỏ tình bởi 1 cô gái không quan trọng ngoại hình  yêu nhau sâu đậm rồi cũng chia tay. Đến tận bây giờ tôi mới có lại cảm giác gọi là “đêm không ngủ được vì nhớ hình bóng nàng”, “ mơ về ngôi nhà và những đứa trẻ”. Thực sự là tôi rất bực mà không phải bực vì crush mà bực bản thân vì tôi tự nhủ rằng không người này có người khác và tìm đủ mọi cách mà không có tác dụng vì khi tôi mà dính cảm giác đó thì khó mà bỏ được. Bạn ấy cao cỡ 1m57 mình thì cao 1m63 và xấu trai nhan sắc cỡ trung bình yếu, bạn ấy dùng đt XS max mình thì còn đang dùng ip 7plus, bạn ấy thì đi xe vision 2023 còn tôi thì vision 2016. Hồi còn làm thì tôi cũng có nói chuyện với nhắn tin qua lại chủ yếu tính chất công việc. Bây giờ đã hơn 1 tuần rồi tôi chưa nhắn tin với bạn ấy liệu tôi có nên tiếp tục nhắn tin lại và có cách nào để tiến triển xa hơn được không ?\n",

        "content": "Xin chào mọi người, em là nữ 21 tuổi, đang ở giai đoạn chuẩn bị cho bảo vệ đồ án tốt nghiệp ra trường. Dạo gần đây em không ổn về tâm lý, không có ai để bày tỏ được, ngoi lên đây để chia sẻ chút.\n\nBắt đầu từ đâu nhỉ…. Từ nhỏ em đã có những trauma, vì lớn lên trong một môi trường không thoát khỏi được những toxic. Không chỉ bố mẹ, mà còn là bà nội, họ hàng tác động nhiều vấn đề. Nhận thức được điều đó, thay vì nghĩ rằng mình thiệt thòi, cũng không đòi hỏi được sự thông cảm và bao dung từ mọi người, em buộc bản thân em phải cố gắng để thích nghi trong môi trường toxic ấy. Từ nhỏ em ít chia sẻ với mn xung quanh, kể cả bạn thân chơi theo nhóm 7 đứa nhưng em vẫn thấy lạc lõng. Em là một đứa thích trải nghiệm, nên cũng dám trải nghiệm nhiều thứ mới khi lên đại học, tham gia nhiều hoạt động để gặp được nhiều ng mới hơn, và em cũng thấy bản thân khá đc giải phóng. Và em gặp được một đứa b tưởng chừng soulmate ( gọi tắt là A) có thể chia sẻ tất cả mọi thứ cho nhau, từ những trải nghiệm dù n tệ, dù n ngớ ngẩn, dù n đúng kiểu “ kệ mình còn trẻ mà” ấy. Và n coa khả năng kết nối mọi người, khi chơi với n em cảm giác được healing dã man.\n\nNhưng ng đến r người đi. Đứa b tưởng chùng như soulmate kia n dần có đức tin vào Chúa.  Em đã từng theo n đi nhà thờ hay tìm hiểu cùng, nhưng em vẫn chưa cảm nhận được Chúa. Và tới tđiểm h em vẫn vô thần. Trong khoảng tgian ấy em có quen 1 bạn nam, và em vs b đó yêu nhau đến h được hơn 1 năm. Vấn đề là ny em muốn em tách khỏi A vì sợ ảnh hưởng tôn giáo tiêu cực. Mặc dù rm có giải thích rất nhiều lần sẽ không có gì ảnh hưởng, em vẫn rất tỉnh táo để phân biệt đúng sai. Nhưng không, ny em cấm chơi. Gọi là chính thức cấm từ khi A sang Mỹ. Nếu bắt được em nói chuyện qua lại thì sẽ tức giận. Theo quan điểm của bạn ấy thì “ nếu chơi tiếp với nó, nó toàn chiều theo ý em, toàn làm hư em”. Bởi vì, A trước khi tin vào Chúa, n đã có những lần abc bậy bạ. Và bh em đang sống cùng ny em, bạn ấy đến tđiểm hiện tại em cho là rất tốt. Dù có những lúc nói chuyện sâu với nhau, nhưng em vẫn k thấy thoải mãn đứa trẻ bên trong em => em hay xảy ra mâu thuẫn về quan điểm với ny, hay dễ nổi cáu, bực tức.\n\nĐỉnh điểm cái nóng tính ấy n dần lớn lên, em mâu thuẫn với bố, cãi nhau rất láo, bị bố đấm cho vì láo, nhưng sau vẫn phải xin lỗi bố, vì bố là ng nuôi mình lớn. Cảm xúc tiêu cực ảnh hưởng đến việc học hành của em.\nDạo gần đây em đang bị mâu thuẫn trong làm việc nhóm đồ án. Không phải mâu thuẫn cãi nhau gay gắt, mà cno sử dụng silent treatment với em. Đúng hơn là em bị cô lập trong nhóm. Mặc dù trc đó bọn em có những chuyến đi chơi cùng nhau, khá vui nhưng toàn là em phải cố gắng kết nối mn lại, gắn kết hơn ( như cái cách em được chữa lành từ bạn A). Sau chuyến đi choie đó, các bạn còn nhắn tin bày tỏ quý em. Tuy nhiên, em bỗ lực gắn kết nhưng k ai hỏi han em thật sự em muốn gì. Cũng một phần em cảm thấy không được tôn trọng, tự tách ra khỏi tập thể. Và không còn sự gắn kết từ em, nhóm lạnh đi như những người lạ trong nhóm. Về công việc nhóm, phân chia phần ai ng nấy làm, hoặc cno n làm việc với em nhiều, hoặc cno làm việc ở một nhóm chat khác mà k có em. Em cảm thấy trống rỗng vô cùng, cảm thấy khi mình k nỗ lực, chủ động thì ng bị bỏ lại chính là mình. Biết những mqh chỉ gắn liền với nhau bằng lợi ích, nhưng dù vậy em cảm thấy rất buồn, tổn thương. \n\nBuổi học cuối cùng, các bạn đều đăng chụp cùng bạn bè. Nhìn lại mình, không có ny thì chắc mình cô đơn lắm :(. ( em vẫn có bạn đi aen đi chơi cùng nhưng chỉ dừng ở mức vui, xã giao)\n\nEm muốn hỏi mn khách quan nhất về vấn đề của bản thân, có phải do em hay khôgn. Cái nóng tính của em làm em mất nhiều quá. Nhưng em không thể nhịn được. Hoặc anh chị nào có cách nào để rèn được tính đó không, chia sẻ em với ạ. Em cứ một mình là em lại khóc, em k thể dừng suy nghĩ, k thể khiến bản thân vui lên.\n\nDù hơi dài nhưng em cảm ơn mn đã đọc đến đây. ",

Tụi em yêu nhau thì cũng như các cặp đôi khác thôi ạ, bạn ấy cũng có lúc hờn dỗi thì em cũng dỗ dành. Tối nay bạn ấy nói chuyện có vẻ nghiêm túc lắm ạ, kiểu như bạn ấy thích một người trưởng thành, có thể là chỗ dựa cho bạn ấy. Bảo em dạo này như con cô ấy hơn là bố cô ấy, ý là không được như bố cô ấy lo lắng che chở cho cô ấy. Tụi em còn hẹn nhau tầm tháng 7 này sẽ gặp nhau, nay thì cô ấy cũng nói luôn nếu lúc gặp mà em kiểu dựa dẫm cô ấy thì lúc em về cô ấy sẽ bảo chia tay luôn. Em cũng không hiểu ý cô ấy dựa dẫm đây là như nào, là kiểu không chuẩn bị hết mọi thứ hay sao ạ. Em thì cũng là lần đầu yêu ạ, chưa từng trải qua mối tình nào. Các dịp lễ thì em cũng chuẩn bị quà, nào bạn ấy thèm gì thì em cũng đặt app. Thỉnh thoảng em cũng muốn kể chuyện đùa hài hài, hồi trước em kể 1 lần bạn ấy bảo không thích, như thế trẻ con nên từ lần đấy em cũng chả dám đùa nữa. Kế hoạch ra HN gặp bạn ấy thì em cũng lên hết, từ ăn gì đi đâu, khi em ngỏ ý bạn ấy cùng nhau lên kế hoạch thì bạn ấy nói kiểu như việc đấy là của em, em phải tự làm lấy. Bạn ấy thì hay dỗi cực kì, ngày dỗi như chục lần, em luôn dỗ dành bạn ấy mà không bao giờ em tỏ thái độ hay gì cả. Tối hôm trước thì bạn ấy ốm thì em cũng call rồi động viên thôi ạ, cũng chỉ mấy từ như em cố gắng thêm xíu nhá mai nó lành rồi, hoặc là anh thương em lắm hay gì đó thì bạn ấy bảo nghe chán lắm rồi, anh chả quan tâm yêu thương em. Bạn ấy về quê mà ở quanh đấy chả có cái gì nên em cũng chả đặt đồ được, bố mẹ bạn ấy còn nghiêm khắc nên bạn ấy cũng chả kể bạn ấy có người yêu rồi. Mọi người cho em hỏi là em nên làm gì ạ. Em có trẻ con quá không ạ, em phải làm gì để trưởng thành hơn ạ, trong lời nói hay hành động ạ, em thấy em nói năng cũng đàng hoàng lễ phép, hứa với bạn ấy điều gì em đều thực hiện. Còn trong suy nghĩ thì phải thế nào gọi là trưởng thành ạ. Em viết hơi dài với hơi lan man, em cảm ơn mọi người đã dành thời gian đọc tới đây ạ",

Khi về nhà thì người ta báo cho gia đình tôi rằng ông ấy uống phải dầu hoả, sắp không sống được nữa.  Tôi đã khóc rất to và ôm chân ông ấy, ông ấy nói với tôi rằng:\" thấy con khóc như này bố càng thương con hơn\". Sau đó ông ấy ho ra máu và được đưa đi. Sau đó tôi mơ thấy tôi nhìn thấy máy bay chở ông ấy  bay quyệt va phải chiếc xe màu đỏ và phát nổ. Tôi thấy bản thân đã khóc rất nhiều và bị chảy máu mũi. Khi tôi nằm mơ , tiếng khóc âm ỉ đã đã được tôi nghe thấy khi mơ màng. Điều này xảy ra có ý nghĩa gì?

Thường những ngành hẹp như bọn em thì việc học lên cao ở các nước phát triển là rất quan trọng, vừa chứng minh năng lực lại vừa thoả đam mê nghiên cứu khoa học cơ bản. Em thấy tình hình đào tạo sau đại học trong nước cho nhóm ngành STEM vẫn ba chấm quá, chưa thật sự gọi là tốt ( cảm nhận của riêng cá nhân em thôi ạ ).\n\nTuy nhiên thì GPA em không gọi là cao ( 3.41/4 ), thành tích đi học lại không quá nổi bật ( chỉ ăn với học suốt 4 năm trời mà không tham gia các HĐXH hay các phong trào SV gì cả ). Em đã có tiếng anh ( 7.0 Ielts không brand nào dưới 6.5 ). \n\nEm hiện đã tích cóp được 265 tr, và đang cân nhắc việc đi học ThS ( và xa hơn nữa là PhD nếu có khả năng ) ở Pháp, Bỉ, hoặc Đức vì chi phí sinh hoạt không quá đắt cũng như chất lượng đào tạo rất tốt và chương trình đào tạo ThS sử dụng tiếng anh.\n\nEm có 2 câu hỏi muốn hỏi đến các thím, những người đã có kinh nghiệm đi học ở trời Âu.\n\n1 là về chi phí sinh hoạt trong một tháng của các thím tầm khoảng bao nhiêu nhỉ ? \nĐể em có thể bước đầu mường tượng và ước chừng chi phí sinh hoạt mà bản thân cần phải lo.\n\n2 là về scholarship cho nhóm ngành STEM, thím nào  từng được nhận có thề chia sẻ và kinh nghiệm săn học bổng của các thím có được không ạ ? \nVà liệu với profile như tờ giấy trắng của bản thân thì em có thể làm gì để tăng cơ hội được không ?\n\nP/S: Gia đình em được cái không phải quá lo về tài chính. Bố và mẹ cũng dự trù budget tầm 20.000 - 40.000 € per year ( bao gồm cả học phí lẫn sinh hoạt phí ). Tuy nhiên nếu dùng tiền của phụ huynh bản thân em cũng khá áy náy vì thú thật, em cũng chưa mường tượng được ra công việc sau khi em học xong. Rất sợ không có khả năng trụ lại. Thế thì rất phí công sức cả đời tích cóp của 2 người. Nên em đang suy tính cách tiết kiệm nhất để tiếp tục con đường học vấn ạ.\n\nEm xin cám ơn mọi người rất nhiều. Mong được nghe chia sẻ từ các bác.",

Em nhận thấy bản thân có khả năng thích ứng vấn đề nhanh, có khả năng giao tiếp, nắm bắt tâm lý đối phương khá tốt. Bản thân em thì thích những ngành áp dụng được kiến thức về nghệ thuật, tâm lí, xã hội ở mức vừa phải (theo khối ngành KHXH em thấy khá mông lung) Tuy vậy, khả năng ghi nhớ của em khá kém, bản thân cũng yếu các kiến thức liên quan về khối công nghệ (không biết các ngôn ngữ SQL hay về CNTT).

Wouldn't using primary keys be the same? Is there any case in which surrogate keys are the way to go?\n\nP.S: Both surrogate and primary keys are auto generated by DB. Right?\n\nP.S.1: I understand that a surrogate key doesn't necessarily have to be the a primary key, so considering that both have no real meaning outside the DB, then I wonder what the purpose of surrogate keys are.\n\nP.S.2: At work (in different projects), we mainly use natural keys for analytical workloads and primary keys for uniquely identifying a given row. So I am wondering on which kind of cases/projects these surrogate keys will fit. \n\n",

So, I decided to start building one...\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1jnh7pu/video/wcl9lru6zure1/player\n\nYou can find the repo [here](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage), and the package on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-col-lineage/0.1.1/)\n\n**Under the hood**\n\nBasically, it works by combining dbt's manifest and catalog with some compiled SQL parsing magic (big shoutout to sqlglot!).\n\nI've built it as a CLI, keeping the syntax similar to dbt-core, with upstream and downstream selectors.\n\n    dbt-col-lineage --select stg_transactions.amount+ --format html\n\nRight now, it supports:\n\n* Interactive HTML visualizations\n* DOT graph images\n* Simple text output in the console\n\n**What's next ?**\n\n* Focus on compatibility with more SQL dialects\n* Improve the parser to handle complex syntax specific to certain dialects\n* Making the UI less... basic. It's kinda rough right now, plus some information could be added such as materialization type, col typing etc\n\nFeel free to drop any feedback or open an issue on the [repo](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage/tree/main)! It's still super early, and any help for testing on other dialects would be awesome. It's only been tested on projects using Snowflake, DuckDB, and SQLite adapters so far.",

Really liked what I saw. Super Pythonic, easy to set up locally, modern UI - just felt right from the start.\n\nBut the problem is: the open-source version doesn’t offer user management or logging, so we’d need the Cloud version. Pricing would be around 30k USD per year, which is way above what we pay for Airflow. Even with a discount, it would still be too much for us.\n\nIs there any way to make the community version work for a small team? Usermanagement and Audit-Logs is definitely a must for us. Or is Prefect just not realistic without going Cloud?\n\nWould be a shame, because I really liked their approach.\n\nIf not Prefect, any tips on making Airflow easier for local dev and testing?",

But I figured it is indeed a very broad certification and so it can give a \"grounding\" scope in Azure D.E.\n\nAlso, I think it's still super early to go full Fabric (DP-600 or even DP-700), because the job demand is still not really there. Most jobs still demand strong grounding in Azure services even in the wake of Fabric adoption (POCing…).\n\nSo of course here, it’s retiring literally tomorrow unfortunately. I have passed the exam with a high score (900+). Also, I have worked (during internship) directly with MS Fabric only. So I would say some skills actually transfer quite nicely (ex: ADF ~ FDF).\n\n---\n\n### Some notes on resources for future exams:\n\nI have relied primarily on [@tybulonazure](https://www.youtube.com/@tybulonazure)’s excellent YouTube channel (DP-203 playlist). It’s really great (watch on 1.8x – 2x speed).  \nNow going back to Fabric, I have seen he has pivoted to Fabric-centric content — also a great news!\n\nI also used the official “Guide” book (2024 version), which I found to be a surprisingly good way of structuring your learning. I hope equivalents for Fabric will be similar (TBS…).\n\n---\n\nThe labs on Microsoft Learn are honestly **poorly designed** for what they offer.  \n**Tip:** @tybul has video labs too — *use these*.  \nAnd for the exams, always focus on **conceptual understanding**, not rote memorization.\n\nAnother **important (and mostly ignored)** tip:  \nFocus on the **“best practices”** sections of Azure services in Microsoft Learn — I’ve read a lot of MS documentation, and those parts are often more helpful on the exam than the main pages.\n\n---\n\n**Examtopics** is obviously very helpful — but **read the comments**, they’re essential!\n\n---\n\nFinally, I do think it’s a shame it’s retiring — because the “traditional” Azure environment knowledge seems to be a sort of industry standard for companies. Also, the Fabric pricing model seems quite aggressive.\n\nSo for juniors, it would have been really good to still be able to have this background knowledge as a base layer.",

In my previous role, I gained some experience as a Data Engineer, but in my current position, I have been working with a variety of different technologies and skill sets.\n\nAs I am now looking for a job change and aiming to strengthen my expertise in data engineering, I would love to work on a real-time data engineering project to gain more hands-on experience. If anyone can guide me or provide insights into a real-world project, I would greatly appreciate it.\nI have total 4+ years of experience including Python development and some data engineer POC.\nLooking forward to your suggestions and support!\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I could really use some advice from fellow engineers. I'm pretty new to the data world — I messed up uni, then did an online analytics course, and after about a year and a half of grinding, I finally landed my first role. Along the way, I found a real passion for Python and SQL.\n\nMy first job involved a ton of patchy reporting because of messy infra and data. I started automating painful tasks using basic ETL pipelines I built myself. I showed an interest in APIs and, out of nowhere, 6 months in, I was offered a data engineering role.\n\nFast forward to now — I’ve been in the new role for a month, and I’m the company’s only data engineer. I’m doing a data engineering apprenticeship at the same time, which helps, but the imposter syndrome is real. The company’s been limping along with a 25-year-old piece of software that populates our SQL Server DB, and we’re now migrating to something new. I’ve been asked to learn MuleSoft for ETL and replace some existing pipelines that were built in Python.\n\nI love the subject — I’m genuinely passionate about programming and networking — and I’m keen to take on new tech, improve the infra, and build up strong skills. But I’m not sure if I’m going too deep too fast. For example, today I was learning Docker to deploy Python scripts, just to avoid issues with hundreds of brittle batch files that break if we update Python.\n\nMy boss seems to think MuleSoft will fully replace Python, but I see it more as a tool that complements certain workflows rather than a full replacement. What worries me more is that I don’t really have any technical peers. Most people in my team only know basic SQL, and it’s hard to communicate strategy or get proper feedback.\n\nMy current priorities are getting comfortable with MuleSoft, Git, and Docker. I’m constantly learning, but sometimes I leave work feeling overwhelmed. There’s so much broken or duct-taped together, I don’t even know where to start. I keep telling myself I don’t need to “save the world,” but I really want to do a good job and come away with solid experience.\n\nLong term, they want to deploy this new software, rebuild the database, and eventually use AI to help employees query the business. There’s a shit ton to do, and I’m still figuring out basics — like setting up a VM just so I can run Docker.\n\nAm I jumping the gun with how I’m feeling, or is this as wild a situation as it seems? Any advice for a new engineer navigating bad infra, limited support, and a mountain of work would be seriously appreciated.",

Planning to integrate Jenkins in offline mode somehow, tsqlt for unit testing seems like a decent choice as well. dbt-core and airflow was on my list as well but my colleagues don't know any python so they are not gonna be on this list.\n\nDo you have any other suggestions? Have you ever used a set-up like mine? I would love to hear your previous experiences as well. Thanks",

This happened during a market downturn and layoffs, so I was grateful to still have a job.\n\nNow, after two years in this role, I feel stuck. I struggle with coding, don’t enjoy Java, and constantly feel like an imposter. I know for sure that I don’t want to continue in Java and Spring Boot. However, I’ve stayed in this role because it’s high-paying, and I have family responsibilities (supporting a family of five).\n\nI want to transition back into Data Engineering, but now the job market expects a higher level of expertise given my experience and salary range. I’m unsure about the best way to upskill and make this switch without a major setback.\n\nHow can I strategically transition back into Data Engineering while balancing financial stability?

I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). \n\nThe position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?\n\nFurthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). \n\nUltimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position? Personally I am a bit reluctant to switch simply since I have already dedicated 2 years to growing as an DE, but on the other hand I also see how much more and more of my tasks can be automated.

The challenge is that they come with very **different interfaces and authentication methods** (e.g., HAWK, API keys, OAuth2, etc.).

        "content": "Hey folks, I’ve been diving into RAG recently, and one challenge that always pops up is balancing **speed, precision, and scalability**, especially when working with large datasets. So I convinced the startup I work for to start to develop a solution for this. So I'm here to present this project, an **open-source framework** written in **C++** with **python** bindings, aimed at optimizing **RAG** pipelines.\n\nIt plays nicely with **TensorFlow**, as well as tools like **TensorRT**, **vLLM**, **FAISS**, and we are planning to add other integrations. The goal? To make retrieval more efficient and faster, while keeping it scalable. We’ve run some early tests, and the performance gains look promising when compared to frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex **(though there’s always room to grow)**.\n\n[Comparing CPU usage over time](https://preview.redd.it/39dx1ulhvfre1.jpg?width=2038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30e300cf136ea603a8d749b7593b19b696e1a2ac)\n\n[Comparison for PDF Extraction and Chunking](https://preview.redd.it/qib47ulhvfre1.jpg?width=2038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e2a9dbc09b336d5f6ed359289ca1fdfd5716e9e)\n\nThe project is still in its early stages (a few weeks), and we’re constantly adding updates and experimenting with new tech. If you’re interested in RAG, retrieval efficiency, or multimodal pipelines, feel free to check it out. **Feedback and contributions are more than welcome**. And yeah, if you think it’s cool, maybe drop a star on GitHub, it really helps!\n\nHere’s the repo if you want to take a look:👉[ **https://github.com/pureai-ecosystem/purecpp**](https://github.com/pureai-ecosystem/purecpp)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or ideas on what we can improve!",

        "author": "ssinchenko",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am re-implementing ideas from GraphFrames, a library of graph algorithms for PySpark, but with support for multiple backends (DuckDB, Snowflake, PySpark, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, etc.. - all the backends supported by the Ibis project). The library allows to compute things like PageRank or ShortestPaths on the database or DWH side. It can be useful if you have a usecase with linked data, knowledge graph or something like that, but transferring the data to Neo4j is overhead (or not possible for some reason).\n\nUnder the hood there is a pregel framework (an iterative approach to graph processing by sending and aggregating messages across the graph, developed at Google), but it is implemented in terms of selects and joins with Ibis DataFrames.\n\nThe project is completely open source, there is no \"commercial version\", \"hidden features\" or the like. Just a very small (about 1000 lines of code) pure Python library with the only dependency: Ibis. I ran some tests on the small XS-sized graphs from the LDBC benchmark and it looks like it works fine. At least with a DuckDB backend on a single node. I have not tried it on the clusters like PySpark, but from my understanding it should work no worse than GraphFrames itself. I added some additional optimizations to Pregel compared to the implementation in GraphFrames (like early stopping, the ability of nodes to vote to stop, etc.) There's not much documentation at the moment, I plan to improve it in the future. I've released the 0.0.1 version in PyPi, but at the moment I can't guarantee that there won't be breaking changes in the API: it's still in a very early stage of development.\n\nI would appreciate any feedback about it. Thanks in advance!  \n[https://github.com/SemyonSinchenko/ibisgraph](https://github.com/SemyonSinchenko/ibisgraph)",

As you might have guessed, I started running into memory issues pretty quick. My natural course of action was to try and batch load the data. While this does work, it’s still pretty slow and not upto the speed I’m hoping for. \n\nSo, I started considering using a data ingestion tool like Airbyte, Fivetran or Sling. Then, I figured I could just try implementing a rudimentary version of the same, just without all the bells and whistles. And yes, I know I shouldn’t reinvent the wheel and I should focus on working with existing solutions. But this is something I want to try doing out of sheer curiosity and interest. I believe it’ll be a good learning experience and maybe even make me a better engineer by the end of it. If anyone is familiar with the internals of any of these tools, like the architecture, or how the data transfer happens, please help me out. ",

        "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm an solo developer (previously an early engineer at very popular ELT product) who built an ELT solution to address challenges I encountered with existing tools around security, performance, and deployment flexibility.\n\n**What I've Built:**\n- A hybrid ELT platform that works in both batch and real-time modes (with subsecond latency using CDC, implemented without Debezium - avoiding its common fragility issues and complex configuration)\n- Security-focused design where worker nodes run within client infrastructure, ensuring that both sensitive data AND credentials never leave their environment - an improvement over many cloud solutions that addresses common compliance concerns\n- High-performance implementation in a JVM language with async multithreaded processing - benchmarked to perform on par with C-based solutions like HVR in tests such as Postgres-to-Snowflake transfers, with significantly higher throughput for large datasets\n- Support for popular sources (Postgres, MySQL, and few RESTful API sources) and destinations (Snowflake, Redshift, ClickHouse, ElasticSearch, and more)\n- Developer-friendly architecture with an SDK for rapid connector development and automatic schema migrations that handle complex schema changes seamlessly\n\nI've used it exclusively for my internal projects until now, but I'm considering opening it up for beta users. I'm looking for teams that:\n- Are hitting throughput limitations with existing EL solutions\n- Have security/compliance requirements that make SaaS solutions problematic\n- Need both batch and real-time capabilities without managing separate tools\n\nIf you're interested in being an early beta user or if you've experienced these challenges with your current stack, I'd love to connect. I'm considering \"developing in public\" to share progress openly as I refine the tool based on real-world feedback.\n\nThanks for any insights or interest!",

It wasn’t tech, but it involved everything from dealing with clients to organizing international trade shows, handling logistics, and just generally being the person who gets stuff done.\n\nPost-COVID, I moved back to Portugal with my family. I’ve since gone back to uni — I’m close to finishing a degree in Computer Science — and have also done some short courses, bootcamps, and certifications. I’ve been getting hands-on with Python, SQL, cloud stuff (mainly GCP), and have been building up towards a career in data.\n\nI’ve also worked in project and operations management in real estate during this time — again, not tech, but full of useful skills.\n\nNow, here's where I'm at:\n\n* I’m super motivated to work in data engineering, ideally combining my experience with new skills.\n* I’m anxious about breaking into the industry “later” in life.\n* And I’m not sure how to best present myself when I don’t have the standard junior dev/bootcamp-to-job pipeline behind me.\n\nSo I’d love to hear from folks who:\n\n* Switched careers later in life\n* Broke into data without a super traditional tech background\n* Or even just have thoughts on how to position yourself in this space\n\nWhether it's advice, honest feedback, your own story, or just a “you’ve got this, old-timer!” — I’m open to hearing it all.\n\nThanks in advance.",

The company's policy regarding operating systems the employees are allowed to use is strange and unfair (IMO). All software engineers get access to Macbooks and thus, to MacOS while all other employees that have a differnt job title \"only\" get HP elite books (that are not elite at all) that run on Windows. WSL is allowed but a native Linux is not accepted because of security reasons (I don't know which security reasons).\n\nAs far as I know the company does not want other job positions to get Macbooks because the whole updating stuff for those Macbooks  is done by an external company which is quite expensive. The Windows laptops instead are maintained by an internal team.\n\nA lot of people are very unhappy with this situation because many of them (including me) would prefer to use Linux or MacOS. Especially all DevOps are pissed because half a year ago they also got access to MacBooks but a change in the policy means that they will have to change back to Windows laptops once their MacBooks break or become too old.\n\nMy question(s): Can you choose the OS and/or hardware in your company? Do you have a clue why Linux may not be accepted? Is it really not that safe (which I cannot think of because the company has it's own data center where a lot of Linux servers run that are actually updated by an internal team)?",
