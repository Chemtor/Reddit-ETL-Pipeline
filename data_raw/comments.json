There is this almost indescribable stillness/heaviness to what you can see. It is so dark. I used to fixate on the sonar returns because every once in a while there would be a few sweeps where something big would register and then disappear. One time we keep getting returns that were always 270 degrees offset from our heading. Happened enough that I started to become concerned that something was falling to the ocean floor. So I think I set the hover height like 30 ft from the seafloor, turned all auxilary pumps off and only had the low vis bumper lights on. Sonar would give a slight return, then a strong, then weak until finally whatever it was fucked off into the wild black unknown.",

I had to learn and hear some really hard truths to get to the point that I am now. The hardest truth i ever learned was that all of the fire in me that burned against her, that I felt drove me, all of that fire was just burning my insides to scorched earth - to a place where nothing can grow - no bad, but also no good either. I learned that the only one I was hurting was myself because my mother is selfish and incapable of thinking of anyone else, so, while I obsessed over her trauma, I wasn't even a speck on her horizon. She forgot about me while I let her haunt me. I put a lot of work into stopping that. It won't ever fully go away and I won't ever say I've forgiven her, but, I also refuse to let her scorch my entire life away the way she did so much of it already. \n\nTo waste a wish so hard fought on somebody who could never love you the way you deserved is pathetic and weak.

All we had to dodge were coyotes though...\n\nI do distinctly remember a stretch of the Alaska Highway, through Northern BC, somewhere between Fort Nelson and another frozen community. Most times I drove that long straight stretch, it was late late night, full dark, no stars, but eerie lights off in the obscure distance, the car radio would suddenly flip out, like 100 stations competing for our attention all at once without touching the tuner. 100 stations broadcasting 100 different languages, nothing pushing through quite clear enough to distinguish. I don't think it lasted long, maybe 10-20 minutes driving at highway speeds in the dark. The time or 2 I traveled there in daylight, it didn't happen, and I couldn't see any towers or buildings in the area to account for the lights visible at night. Mind you, the day driving was summer. Night driving across that region was always winter. Too cold to stop the car and go looking for the sources of the random lights.",

The way the pleasure demon comes back unexpectedly, in good or bad times, like cravings and dependency.\n\nThe prices are like how drug addiction takes from you. \nMissing finger = Accident. \nNo dreams = Bad sleep. \nMissing flesh = Self mutilation, maybe due to paranoia or delusions. \nLosing chunks of your life that you struggle to remember, but occasionally flashes of what you did during it, losing your job, friends, and (nearly) your home. That's just just spot on what happens with addiction.\n\nAlso struggling to remember things, lying about how injuries happened, covering up to hide evidence of drug use. Unexplained puncture marks. Even the old lady who heard of this thing, and said it always ends badly, just matters how fast. And the way it will always be with you for the rest of your life. \n\nThe parallels are chilling!",

I feel bad for Jimbo and Ramirez, alone out there at sea, lost without a purpose. I feel bad for Captain Larsson, he was a good man, a wise man. But he wasn't right about everything. As I sit here writing this, I stare down at the softly glowing purple crystal. The captain didn't notice that it had fallen loose when I dropped the stone on the deck, he didn't notice me slip the crystal into my pocket before throwing the stone overboard. I am so very glad that he didn't notice. At the time, I just thought it might be valuable, something to make a quick buck on. I have since learned so much. It has shown me such beautiful things, unimaginable things. I am truly blessed, for I have been given a gift from beyond the stars. I have so much work to do, so much to prepare. Come and find me friends, for I have seen the end, and it will be glorious. ",

                "body": "23 tuổi và mình cũng cùng suy nghĩ với OP.\n\nMình sinh ra và lớn lên ở SG, tuy nhiên vì nhà mình ở Thanh Đa nên cuộc sống mình tương đối cũng yên bình so với những nơi khác trong thành phố. Bạn bè và mình đều sống gần nhau, đi lại trong Thanh Đa thì hoàn toàn có thể gặp được người quen nào đó. Mình nghĩ nó cũng tương đối giống với cuộc sống của miền quê HN (mình có người quen sống ở ngoại thành HN nên cũng ghé thăm và trải nghiệm). Mình rất thích cuộc sống đó.\n\nTuổi thơ mình không được hạnh phúc khi phải lớn lên cùng với những kỳ vọng từ gia đình và xã hội. Một phần vì gia cảnh mình khá giả hơn so với những người đồng trang lứa, một phần vì bản thân mình cũng thể hiện năng lực cá nhân tuy không quá xuất sắc nhưng vẫn rất tốt. Có lẽ trong mắt của người nào đó, mình là \"con nhà người ta\" trong truyền thuyết. Gia đình luôn nói rằng họ muốn điều tốt nhất cho mình nên mới luôn thúc và đẩy mình tiến bộ hơn, nhìn xa hơn, vươn cao và bay xa hơn. \n\nThế nhưng mình đã luôn có một câu hỏi lớn mà không thể hỏi ai cũng như khó mà tự giải đáp: Làm sao họ biết được điều tốt nhất cho mình khi họ không phải là mình?\n\n\"Vì người đi trước đã có kinh nghiệm nhiều hơn nên họ biết\" là câu trả lời mình nhận được, và cũng là điều mình muốn tin. Nhưng bây giờ, sau khi tốt nghiệp Đại học và đã trải qua nhiều thứ, mình đã câu trả lời riêng cho bản thân rồi.\n\nNhững gánh nặng cảm xúc thuở bé đã khiến mình phải học cách tự lập sớm. Nó cũng hướng mình đến với những con người đồng khổ, và mình đã có được những tình bạn và một mối tình rất tuyệt vời. Bọn mình đều hiểu sự cô đơn khi không được ai lắng nghe và thấu hiểu, để rồi trao niềm tin cho nhau và nâng đỡ nhau trong cuộc sống. Sự yên bình khi những tiếng nói trong đầu \"phải làm xyz\" biến mất và biết được mình có thể trao niềm tin cảm xúc mình cho ai đó, đối với mình hiện tại, là điều vô giá.\n\nMình không cần giàu nứt vách. Kinh tế là nền tảng để xây dựng cuộc sống bền vững, và mình chỉ cần tiền mình kiếm ra được làm được điều đó. Dư dả hơn một chút thì sẽ vui hơn nhiều. Mình cũng có nhiều thứ muốn mua - cho mình và cho người khác - nên mình cũng hướng tới điều đó. Chỉ vậy thôi. Chỉ cần đủ để giữ được một cuộc sống bình yên và dư một ít để xài là quá hạnh phúc rồi. Và mình đã nghe đủ nhiều và trải qua đủ nhiều để có thể tin chắc nịch vào lý tưởng đó của bản thân.",

B đang trong honeymoon stage ó =)) Mình cũng từng đi kha khá nước cả du lịch lẫn học, nói sao nhỉ khi bạn đến 1 nước với tư cách khách du lịch, nó sẽ có 1 độ lạ lẫm nhất định nên trải nghiệm không phải là 10/10. Bạn đi 3 tháng là khoảng tgian vừa đủ để quen mọi thứ mà chưa thấy được bất cập của 1 đất nước, nên về sẽ rất chán nè. Mình đi cũng thích Nhật lắm, nhưng mình nên hiểu thực tế khi ở lâu dài sẽ phát sinh những vấn đề khác lớn hơn mà bạn không thấy hết được. Đừng quên nước Nhật áp lực lớn ntn để có tỉ lệ tự tử cao vậy nha. Thực ra cá nhân mình thấy Nhật là 1 nc sống 1 mình cực ok, hạ tầng cho phép mình làm điều đó, nhưng con người sống 1 mình lâu quá sẽ có nhiều vđề.\n\nLời khuyên của mình là bạn tìm cơ hội du học ngắn hoặc tích tiền đi du lịch thì ổn, còn cái bạn đang trải qua nó là post-vacation blues, hết sức bình thường nha b. Chúc bạn sớm process đc cảm xúc này ;)",

Kết quả của quá trình trước hôn nhân nó sẽ là khởi đầu của quá trình hôn nhân.\n\nVì sư tương quan này, kết hợp với nhu cầu của 2 bên khá là khác nhau nên quan điểm dẫn đến khác nhau\n\n\\- Về phía con trai: cái nhu cầu mong muốn nói chung của các ông là 1 người vợ 'tốt', đứng sau hậu phương cho các ông, chăm con - chăm cha mẹ - chăm các ông, cơm nước, vuốt ve cái tôi thô ráp của các ông, túm lại là cần 'dâu hiền - vợ đảm'. Và để làm được cái nhiệm vụ đó thì còn cần cái đức tính là toàn tâm toàn ý, 'trung thành'. Nhưng đồng thời các ông còn có thêm cái bản năng nữa là 'đảm bảo truyền lại gen' nên nhiều ông có cái thói đi gây giống nhiều nhất có thể aka lăng nhăng. À cũng nói thêm là cái nhu cầu ve vuốt cái tôi khiến nhiều vụ mà bé 3 nhìn tởm vãi trong khi bà vợ ngon đét, khiến nhiều ông cũng nhắm mắt đưa chym đc.\n\n\\- Về phía con gái: nói chung đều là cần sự che chở, bảo vệ và đảm bảo về mặt vật chất cũng như tinh thần. Vì cái nhu cầu vật chất, phụ nữ nói chung không hề muốn bị 'chia' về mặt quyền lợi nên sinh ra kha khá các vụ ghen hay quan hệ mẹ chồng nàng dâu (bản chất cũng là 2 bà cùng yêu 1 ông thôi). Và cũng vì cái nhu cầu này mà phụ nữ nói chung sẽ tìm các đối tác cung cấp cho họ tốt nhất. Cao to đẹp zai (gen tốt, nhìn sướng mắt), giỏi giàu (vật chất + gen tốt), chung thủy (không bị chia quyền lợi), yêu thương họ (cũng là 1 đảm bảo về mặt tinh thần). Và để tối đa hóa khả năng thì date nhiều ông rồi chọn ông oke nhất là giải pháp của họ.\n\nTúm lại, các ông các bà đều nên tém tém lại, biết thế nào là đủ, tự thân, hoặc là cùng nhau bàn bạc, đưa ra các vấn đề nhu cầu kể trên xem có giải quyết được cho nhau ko, nhu cầu cơ bản giải quyết được thì đến cam kết, kiểu anh không tia gái thì em cũng ko đc nghía trai ấy, cam kết ok và duy trì được thì tiến vào hôn nhân. Đấy, 2 bên tương xứng, tôi cần bạn có và cam kết thì mới bền được.",

Nhưng tốc độ tăng lương ko ăn lại đc tiền nhà. Cho nên sang đấy kiếm tiền cũng chỉ để trả tiền nhà thôi.

Đúng là AI không thể thay thế con người hoàn toàn, nhưng đó là những vị tri then chốt, chuyên gia, không thuộc về số đông và ít người làm được. Và câu “thế thì m phải cố gắng mà đạt được vị trí đó” thì là EQ thấp và tư duy cũng kiểu nhanh nhảu, thích tóm gọn, phiến diện nên mới nói được như vậy.\n\nCái mọi người đang lo lắng chính là nhu cầu tuyển dụng của các công ty hiện vốn đã ít vì nền kinh tế xấu, giờ có thêm con AI, các công ty lại càng có ít lí do để tăng nhu cầu tuyển dụng hơn. Xin việc làm đang khó khăn hơn rất nhiều là thật, do nhiều yếu tố nhưng AI chắc chắn cũng có góp phần và một điều mọi người vẫn xem thường và hay quên đó là TỐC ĐỘ PHÁT TRIỂN của AI rất nhanh và các công ty thì luôn hướng tới tối ưu hoá chi phí - ko một công ty nào là không thấy được lợi ích từ AI - dẫn đến xu hướng giảm tuyển dụng, cắt giảm nhân sự, hoặc vẫn vị trí đó trước đây nhưng giờ họ tuyển dụng và trả một mức lương thấp hơn nữa, khối lượng công việc thì tăng - Đây mới là cái thực tế, hiện hữu và rõ ràng nhất và là thứ mọi người đang bàn tới/nên bàn tới ở hiện tại vì nó đang bám sát với thực trạng bây giờ nhất\n\nTưởng tượng với tốc độ phát triển của AI thì tương lai nó còn cắt giảm đáng kể nhu cầu tuyển dụng đến thế nào. Thậm chí các thread bàn về vấn đề này ở nước ngoài cũng không còn dám chắc chắn để mà nói AI sẽ không thay thế con người nữa. Tầm 2021 thôi mọi người vẫn còn đang coi thường và xem những gì AI làm như là một cái tiêu khiển hơn thì 3 năm sau thôi mọi người đã thực sự bắt đầu nhìn nhận được vấn đề và xuất hiện những thread như thế này còn nhiều hơn nữa…Và vẫn lại thấy câu nói kinh điển “AI không thể thay thế được con người” đọc chỉ biết ngán ngẩm vì họ vẫn đang lệch vấn đề và vẫn không chịu nhìn nhận thực tại hoặc có lẽ họ nhận thức được nhưng phải tỏ ra tích cực như vậy cũng là để tự nhủ với bản thân.\n\nTrên thế giới điều này đang diễn ra và mọi người cũng đang tìm hướng giải quyết, nó không dễ và cũng chưa có đáp án nào chắc chắn cả. T không viết comment này với ý muốn làm nản lòng mà t muốn chỉ ra là mọi người vẫn còn ignorance và thậm chí còn không muốn nhìn nhận vấn đề luôn. Vấn đề này khó có lời giải nhưng chi ít phải nhận thức được vấn đề thì mới có cơ hội giải quyết. Nếu câu trả lời luôn là “giỏi k sợ”, “AI ko bao h thay thế hoàn toàn được con người” (chưa kể những lối suy nghĩ đấy còn thuộc dạng phản trí thức, gạt phăng vấn đề), thì mấy thread như thế này lập ra là vô nghĩa và tốn thời gian.",

Rồi tìm hiểu xem họ có học bổng nào cho trường hợp của mình không rồi em nộp thì em sẽ đỡ hơn nhiều. Nhưng mà chắc chắn sẽ rất competitive nên em phải chuẩn bị khá kỹ á. Như điểm thi GRE, IELTS, với statement of purpose phải đẹp thì mới có cơ hội.\n\nCòn để tiết kiệm nhất thì anh nghĩ em nên chọn ở những bang như Texas, Florida vì những nơi này có mức sống thấp hơn so với mặt bằng chung.\n\nCòn việc định cư thì bây giờ anh thấy khá khó. Tại bản thân anh cũng gần 10 năm, đến khi đi làm rồi thì anh bị lay-off và quay về Việt Nam. Nên em hãy cân đo đong đếm thật kỹ nhé.\n\nEm cũng có thể tham khảo những nước như Canada, Úc, hoặc những nước ở Châu Âu thử xem.\n\nGood luck em🤞.",

Nếu bạn học app mình nghĩ chắc là cũng ok nhưng nên tìm speaking partner hoặc join các CLB Tiếng Anh để hiểu thực sự \"giao tiếp\" là như thế nào (nếu bạn là người đi làm chắc bạn cũng đã hiểu giao tiếp là như nào rùi, kiểu nchung nó phải 2 chiều á).   \nAnw, 1 phút pr cho AMA sắp tới của tôi (Ask me anything): làm sao để học TA từ số âm. nếu bạn quan tâm thì inbox kín mình ạ.",

Đi theo tour thì chỉ được đi vài nơi trong lịch trình lên sẵn, trải nghiệm chung và chung xe với những người khác khiến mình ko thoải mái lắm, thời gian trống cũng có nhưng thường ngắn cũng chả đi khám phá được nhiều. \n\nNếu được thì trải nghiệm đi phượt bằng xe máy cũng rất thú vị, nhưng nhớ chú ý tốc độ vì thời điểm này giao thông họ bắt tốc độ rất căng",

                "body": "Mình là một người đã từng du lịch cả tự túc lẫn theo tour kha khá nhiều, đã từng làm hướng dẫn viên tập sự cho 1 tour ngắn ngày ở Vịnh Hạ Long, mình sẽ đúc kết cho bạn một số điểm:  \n1. Du lịch theo tour, hay còn gọi là du lịch kiểu công nghiệp. Đã là công nghiệp thì bạn sẽ được tối ưu chi phí, tối ưu thời gian, tối ưu trải nghiệm. Bạn sẽ không phải lo việc lên kế hoạch, lịch trình, không phải lo đặt phương tiện di chuyển, không phải nghĩ xem ăn gì ở đâu, không phải tìm hiểu trước phải đi những đâu cho phù hợp. Mọi thứ sẽ được setup sẵn. Bạn đến điểm du lịch, sẽ được thưởng thức đúng đặc sản ở đó, được du ngoạn những địa điểm nổi tiếng và đặc trưng, được nghe những câu chuyện, truyền thuyết, được hoạt náo, giao lưu với những người đi cùng. Nhưng cũng chính vì vậy, bạn sẽ ít có trải nghiệm của riêng bạn. Vì mọi thứ được tối ưu nên nhịp điệu của các tour thường sẽ khá nhanh. Đôi lúc bạn sẽ cảm thấy như những con trâu đi cày, bị xích cổ kéo đi liên tục, chỗ đẹp thì không được ở lại lâu mà chỗ xấu thì sao mà dừng lại lâu thế. Bạn chưa kịp trải nghiệm hết không khí ở nơi bạn tham quan thì bạn đã phải rời xa nó mất rồi. Đấy là chưa kể, các địa điểm được chọn sẽ là những điểm du lịch nhiều ng biết đến, bạn đến nơi thì thấy toàn người là người chứ không nhìn được cảnh vật gì hết, không khí cũng toàn hơi người. Đi tour sẽ hợp với đi nước ngoài hơn.",

Bạn được tự do lựa chọn địa điểm, tự do lựa chọn phương tiện, tự do lựa chọn cái bạn bỏ vào mồm. Và quan trọng hơn, bạn được tự do hít thở không khí của những nơi bạn đến một cách tự tại nhất, không phải lo việc hít cho nhanh để còn đi tiếp. Bạn có thể trải nghiệm đồ ăn cao cấp, nhưng hoàn toàn có thể đến một quán cơm bụi bình dân để trải nghiệm một bữa ăn bản địa. Bạn đến một địa điểm, thấy đông quá không thích, bạn có thể về ngay tức khắc. Bạn đến một nơi bạn thích, bạn có thể lăn lê bò toài ở đó đến khi nào chán thì thôi, hít thở mùi nước, mùi cỏ, mùi đất, mùi gió, mọi thứ nguyên bản. Và tất nhiên, bạn du lịch tự túc thì hoàn toàn có khả năng vỡ kế hoạch, gặp những trường hợp tréo ngoe như khách sạn có vấn đề, đồ ăn có vấn đề bạn bị đau bụng, không có phương tiện để đi, hoặc phương tiện gặp vấn đề gì đó. Hay tệ hơn bạn có thể gặp nguy hiểm đến bản thân nếu xui xẻo. Và ngược với du lịch theo tour, mình khuyên nếu đi trong nước, hãy đi du lịch tự túc, đất nước mình, mình tự tìm hiểu khám phá, ít nguy hiểm, có xui xẻo mà gặp tình huống gì tréo ngoe thì biết đâu, đó lại là những trải nghiệm không thể quên trong đời.",

Obviously, this wouldn't have been published if everyone beat us (the headline of \"hey everyone, we're slow\" is allegedly not good for business), but once we ran it and saw the ratios, we didn't do any optimizations or cooking or cherry-picking to improve things from there.

I used to work in a non-tech related field and had exactly the same feelings.  Turns out I didn't enjoy the field I was in anymore which is tough to say about something you have sunk ten years of your life into. \n\nSometimes, it's about work life balance.  If you're working constantly and don't get a break, you are going to feel stressed.  No time for hobbies or relationships also leads to stress.\n\nTake this with a pinch of salt although the biggest demographics are young men from the US and India who prioritise work over everything else and then wonder why they're feeling depressed, stressed, unfulfilled etc.  Driven by social media selling lies about retiring at 40 if you waste your entire 20s working.  Broader advice to anybody reading this post - retiring at 40 isn't that much different to retiring at 50.  Everything in your 20s is completely different than being in your 40s.  Dating, travelling, responsibilities, health, what you're physically capable of.  \n\nYou can always prepare to retire whether that's at 50, 60 or even beyond.  You can never ever be young again so don't waste it.  Don't be that person in their 40s with loads of money and even more regret.",

                "body": "Think of it this way.\n\nDatabases store data. Sometimes, tables. Sometimes, not. They require a way to store data (should be immaterial, except to performance) and a way to retrieve it (an API, or a query language). There are two flavors, OLAP (On-Line Analytic Processing) and OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing). On-Line refers to it being \"interactive\" and allowing a user to issue queries ad-hoc (please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nA data warehouse is a database, always. It's a special kind of database that isn't there to process credit card transactions (OLTP, transactional). It answers analytic questions, like how many purchases were made in Harrison County, Indiana within 45 days of a full moon at a Marathon gas station that also sells cigarettes.\n\nThat's called OLAP (analytical) and involves much, much more complex calculations and operations than does a simple OLTP (transactional) query. An OLTP query generally deals with tracking changing values (account balance, for example) or history (what did this look like at this point in time). Neither of those are exclusive to OLTP, but are examples of common use-cases.\n\nOne consequence of this is that the API and Storage mechanism may be drastically different for OLAP vs OLTP. OLTP is generally changing very fast, and can't handle the pressure of dealing with lots of data, or large data loads. OLAP, by contrast, isn't meant to be \"interactive\" in the same sense. It's queries can sometimes take hours or days, whereas an OLTP system is often measured in queries per second (or, more precisely, transactions per second, though it's a different kind of transaction).\n\nHere's an analogy: I have a shit-ton of CD's. Logically, I can find a CD very quickly if I order them alphabetically. I can very quickly find a single album with the minimum of filters. I can also do that alone, and enlisting a friend would simply increase my QPS (queries per second). That's OLTP.\n\nAlternatively, I like to average the song lengths on albums and compare those values. I can do this manually, album-by-album, or I can enlist a bunch of friends and pay them to help. This \"parallelism\" is typical of OLAP workloads, and underpins the entire premise: I need to do a TON of math as fast as possible.\n\nIt's worth noting, parallelism isn't the only way to achieve this goal, as there exist single-threaded DW's. However, it hints at the difference in problem: Look something up (OLTP) vs calculate a big math problem (OLAP).\n\nHope that helps. It's a fun exercise to try to explain that succinctly.\n\nDon't use a single-threaded DW, though. That's mostly a joke.",

Products should be unique in a dimension.  The part number stamped on the product is a unique identifier of the product and a natural key. So you make it your primary key. But what happens when something about that product changes, like the way your company categorizes it? Suddenly all of history just reflects the current value in your dimension table. \n\nIf you had created a surrogate key, you could create a new record with the same part number that has the new details.

They're useful when your records essentially have no natural key (such as a Person table, since it's possible for two people born on the same date to have the same name, or records in a log, since it's possible for two events to happen such they they carry the same timestamp). Most often you'll see these implemented as integers in an automatically incrementing field, or as GUIDs that are generated automatically for each record. ID numbers are almost always surrogate keys.\n\n> Unlike primary keys, not all tables need surrogate keys, however.

Recognize and report issues early so we can fix it.\n- testing - able to write and perform (if not automated) test cases for your requirements and communicate results \n- documentation - be able to clearly document what was done.

The core aspect of Data Engineering is the automation of ingesting, cleaning, and curating data. Python and shell scripting are two very common tools.\n\nLastly, I’d get familiar with Data Warehousing/data modeling. The field of Data Engineering is a spectrum ranging from a Data Architect (purely focused on the data modeling/warehousing and how to structure data for ease of management and usage) to Data Platform/Pipeline Engineering where you are focused on writing code/using tools to ingest data, clean it up, and transform it so it fits into the appropriate data model. A lot of people just focus on the Data Platform/Pipeline side but without the data modeling experience, you are only a bit better than a Software Developer at doing Data Engineering work.\n\nEdit: spelling",

                "body": "So this has turned into a lot of debate about what it means to be a Data Engineer. So being someone who comes from a Data Analyst background and have worked at shops that value that on a resume but have also worked in SE shops now and am beefed up SE skills. \n\nRecently I was hired to clean up a team that doesn't value Software Engineering principles though my manger was just reorged so I might leave as new manager doesn't see the problems yet. \n\nHere's what it looks like if your company doesn't value SE principles:\n\n1. Unreadable shit code everywhere. Only people that have been working on the codebase for years can read it. They often value ability to decipher unreadable code rather than write good code.\n2. Everyone is absolutely paralyzed to deploy code because there is no Unit or Integration testing. The code base is a mess and repo design and linting was not even considered so dependencies are ????.\n3. Things are constantly breaking and since theres no observability, code is unmaintainable and everyone is paralyzed to deploy on-call leads to making the smallest change possible with poor documentation until your stakeholders leave you alone. This generally leads to unknown tech debt captured throughout your data.\n4. Everything is constantly breaking, data is garbage and no one understands why so the business requires the only fix they know more QA.\n5. No one can accomplish anything ever because everything is such a mess but no one knows why. They just decide this is the way things are meant to be and shrug their shoulder as budget balloons due to every project being a completely isolated project. \n6. Finally the business decides the problem is Snowflake, Databricks, AWS or whatever platform a VP can blame, so they justify a huge spend to shift platforms without changing the underlying culture.",

I agree with the other commenter you have a lot of work to do on the fundamentals of python.\n\nv0 is 100% terrible for many reasons, some of which people have not mentioned:\n\n\\* added cognitive complexity to read\n\n\\* silent side effect mutation of the type of x -- you're spared from consequences here because strings are immutable and so python's pass by reference won't modify the original object, but this is a bad pattern to get into\n\n\\* increased time to execute, as you are repeatedly creating instances of pd.Series objects. That's not a free operation.\n\n\\* The return statement makes the conversion pointless. It's saying \"if x was originally a series, return x, otherwise if x \\*was\\* a string, return the first element of the newly created series.\" The first element of the newly created series is still the string itself.  So why then did you do the conversion?\n\n\\* No type hinting on the return type to indicate how the different types of inputs (str vs series) affect the return type (str vs series). See TypeVar: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)\n\nIf one of the pipelines has string inputs why not convert those string inputs to a single pd.Series of strings first? then call v1 on it\n\nIf I have missed anything about how you intend to use these, it's probably because you should also add doc strings to your functions.\n\nAdditionally, pandas is not a great choice for a production pipeline.",

One approach we are considering is having a setting on each field that makes it \"shared\", so that any stream that also enables that setting on the same field will use the same value, and editing that value in any such stream will cause the value to change for all streams that have enabled sharing for the same field.\n\nWhile this achieves a fairly straightforward UX, the drawback is that you can only have one \"shared\" value for each field. It sounds like you would like to have multiple different shared values for a single field that are shared by different groups of streams.Would the \"single shared field\" approach still solve most of your use case, or does it seem too limiting?",

First thing I would do is a look at the requirements and understand exactly what is required on this new platform. Who will be accessing the data? How much data are you expecting to process? Do you need scalability? etc\n\nWork on defining what is required first and then look into solutions that will solve those requirements.\n\nYou should make sure that if you're struggling that you escalate it within the company. Do not be afraid of saying  you need additional resources/help. If they don't give it and you fail, you can always refer back to the point that you asked for help and got none. Make sure you audit everything!\n\nAdditionally, are there any other Data Engineers within the company? I know you mentioned that they don't have any, but how have they got an existing database setup with MySQL and MongoDB? Did software engineers set this up? Can you contact the team that setup the existing infrastructure and see if they can offer advise/help?\n\nI can't give much more advise than that because it will be very specific to how your company is operated, budget etc and I don't think a reddit thread could really guide you through how to do this. Realistically you need experienced engineers to help you with this and you should really make it clear to the organisation that this is a major risk allowing a junior engineer to design their data platform.",

Begin identifying your key sources of data. What does the top management consider important in terms of KPIs, where are these coming from? Sit down your stakeholders and get a good pulse of the most important parts of the business.  I'm guessing they have a future vision of what they would like to see. \n\n\n2. Map out the existing reporting processes. Are any reports being built out manually? Do a quick audit, those are opportunities for you to automate the process and familiarizing with the organizations data.\n\n\n3. From a governance process, is the company fairly data literate? Do they understand the value of having proper clean data? Do they just need data fast even if it's dirty? This may inform you how you need to approach conversations and how much other people within the org are going to be able to help you.\n\n\n4. When you say you have historical data, I'm assuming this is operational reporting correct? What size of data are we talking about? If it's relatively small, you can probably get a way with one of the migration techniques which simply dump data into Redshift and begin working from there rather than doing something like CDC. \n\n\n5. Stick with managed services where possible as you begin setting up your work. For now it seems like you're a one person shop so once you've identified your solutions and pain points, don't break your head with trying to operate infrastructure. As the company becomes more mature, components are probably going to change over and that's okay. \n\n\n6. Lastly, if you really don't know where to start, it's okay to start with the most basic proof of concept with just spreadsheet with manual data imports. The keys to begin understanding the business rules and what they need. \n\n\nIt's okay in a grand scheme to think of architecture, but the end of the day your job is to deliver value to the company through data. \n\n\nIt's okay to start small, make plenty of errors and readjust as you go. That's the nature of things so don't be too hard on yourself, you've been given a big ask.",

It’s an evolution to reintroduce classic DWH functionality into a ‘big-data’ append only file format optimized for writes where storing everything in a DBMS was not an option anymore.

This still isn’t acid and Iceberg pretty much adds that back in by adding a transaction log to a columnar store. \n\nIf your data is mostly structured and fits nicely into a RDBMS using SQL and all is running smoothly that is perfectly fine and will save you some very annoying headaches.\n\nIf you need to pull in lots of sources and need to do a lot of processing before you can start actually using it then it makes sense to use intermediary stages using parquet, iceberg , delta etc in your bronze and silver layer before you bring it into gold which can be your RDBMS again.",

In that case you're (sort of) right in the naive case that you just need one \"final step\" to trunc and load an OLAP format to serve.\n\nBut most data warehouses have multiple systems feeding them, with different speeds, shapes... many of them are just API calls or file extracts. It's not practical to manage them transactional because of the dependencies.\n\nThen on top of that, data warehouses are also managing things like master data management and slowly changing dimensions, which require history, snapshot management, deduplication across the whole set of data, etc.\n\nSo OLTP system handles writes transactionally.\n\nBut OLAP systems typically do scheduled large batch operations to reconcile their multiple source systems and manage history. They're not concerned with reconciling every transaction across every system they manage at the time it happens.",

                "body": "There's more nuance here than what you seem to be expecting.\n\nData lakes and lakehouses aren't really \"slow\" on write, they can actually handle enormous volumes quite quickly. What they can't do is write an individual record with very low latency, and if it had to update a single row it would have enormous overhead.\n\nFor an analogy imagine needing to get a package delivered to the other side of town - you could just get in your car and drive over there. If you needed to move 50 tonnes of cargo across town then you're going to get it done much faster by booking a trailer and packing everything on pallets and loading with a forklift. Of course it would be wasteful and silly to send packages one-at-a-time using a trailer.\n\nSo these systems are built with a few different write methods depending on where you are in the process.\n\nIn the 'medallion architecture' you are taking a fast-write approach where you do not do any updates and you don't (generally) do any comparisons with existing data. You just dump everything into storage as you receive it. This could be batch, or it could even be streaming with a bit of buffering between writes. You can handle essentially any frequency of incoming data.\n\nAfter that you get to pick your own schedule, so you might have a daily batch that does a single bulk reload of everything. I've found on some of these systems that it is faster to rewrite an entire table than it is to do a merge update on 10% of records, so a lot of underlying processes are designed around simply rewriting all the data. If you were to update individual rows at a time that would be enormously wasteful, so you simply don't do it.\n\nReferring to the 'medallion architecture' again, as you move through it spend more and more effort on your write operations to make your read operations as efficient as possible. If someone wants an SCD2 table with effectivity ranges because it suits their query model, then you'll build all the steps to - as efficiently as you can - build a table with that model. The idea being that for every write process you have here, you will have many many reads, and optimising those reads is more important.\n\nOr in short...\n\n> Isn't there a large performance issue when you need to update individual records in columnar storage?\n\n\"We don't do that here\"",

No one here is suggesting ways to achieve this in your current role but there absolutely are ways.\n\nSounds like you are mostly just using SQL which is fine, it will always be a useful skill. One thing you could try is to use snowpark to build some of your datasets. That allows you to use python, scala, or Java to write procedures. This gives you experience with spark and a language other than SQL which also has the benefits of being more testable, easier to read and maintain etc. If you want to take that a step further you can fully productionalize your snowpark by getting it into version control and set up CI/CD to deploy your snowpark code to snowflake after passing tests. \n\nThis all allows you to stay in your current role but leverage your situation to learn new skills that I think are valuable to data engineering and really software engineering as a whole.\n\nWith all that said, depending on your engineering team these options may not be available to you.

What files are we talking about, models? Configuration? Ingestion? \n\nIn any case even DBT requires a degree of manual maintenance of your file ecosystem but again it has prepacked tools and extensible packages to trivialize these constraints.\n\nSnowflake has also increased their pythonic capabilities native in the platform to top everything off.

If you're strong in Math or Science then go for ML/DS otherwise I have seen people with pure programming background struggle in those fields since they don't understand what, when and how to apply the Math/Stats concepts in the right scenarios. \n\nPure programming is shit for those fields and many are moving into DE fields for that matter coz pipelines are shitty, so DE's needs to clean that up in order for DS folks to do any predictive model. Since you're in DE area, try upgrading your skills to distributed processing like Snowflake, Databricks, learn data modeling or enhance skills in those areas. SQL is here to stay and that is required for any data field. Perhaps look for new DE job where you can find more of modern data pipelines being build but even those all rely on foundations like data modeling, sql, security concepts. \n\n  \nI work purely as a Data Modeler doing modeling using Data Vault and Dimensional frameworks. There's so many aspects of data modeling that I haven't touched in terms of building a model for peta bytes of data and so far only worked for mid-scale companies. I want to get into DE space but modeling is extremely hard skill to master and can only get better by experience. Many DE's fail the modeling interview round despite of their strong SQL and DSA skills. \n\nI ignore the full AI noise out there coz I know 95% of the companies still don't have proper pipelines build. Only small portion of the companies use AI but they're making the loud noise, like the FAANGM companies and that's scaring people that AI is going to take over jobs sooner but that's not true at all. The current AI is no where close to what humans have been doing for decades in tech field, but surely, we can use that to become more efficient and get suggestions. I use Chatgpt occasionally to get suggestions on sql queries and stuff.",

However, for all that time, I was working in a domain I never truly enjoyed. It was a situation of just showing up, doing the bare minimum, collecting a paycheck, and that was it. There was no interest in deeper learning or contributing meaningfully.\nBut then, a year ago, I discovered Data Engineering, and it sparked a real passion! I took the initiative to learn everything I could about it – taking courses, building projects, and fully immersing myself. And guess what? All that hard work paid off! I just landed a fantastic job in Data Engineering and am absolutely thrilled about this new chapter.\nSo, the takeaway here is clear: do what genuinely excites you and don't be afraid to make a change. It's never too late to switch paths and pursue something you're truly passionate about. Go for it! 😉",

Airflow is getting constantly updated where as SSIS is literally getting zero updates and given free when you buy SQL Server. If it was that good, Microsoft would introduce a \"capacity\" or subscription model and sell it like they did with ADF and Fabric.\n* Making Marc Lamberti smile.

SSIS has the best third-party ecosystem around it and that's what matters. When you combine SSIS with the extensions, that is  the best ETL platform on the market. Fast, affordable and hybrid.\n\nThe main reason why SSIS was not enhanced to work naturally in the cloud is because of the stupidity of Microsoft. The recent ADF death proves that.

You're not just transforming data - you're creating something with UX, SLAs, and customers.\n\nThat means (at least in my head, lol):\n\n* Gold should be opinionated, purposeful, and scoped to actual business questions.\n* It should not be generic, versatile - don't try to put everything there. The best gold layers are boring, reliable, unambiguous.\n* It should be versioned like any proper product\n* It needs feedback loops with your users\n\nYou're in the perfect spot to ask dumb (read: brilliant) questions. What decisions will this dataset support? What's the business logic underneath that transformation? And don't just document what a dataset contains - capture why it exists. Because one day someone will ask, \"Why do we use revenue\\_calculated\\_3\\_final again?\" and everyone will stare at the ceiling",

Data engineering is a hot field right now, and BigQuery is a powerful tool for handling big data. Its all about designing, building, and maintaining the systems that collect, store, and process data. If you enjoy problem-solving, working with large datasets, and staying up-to-date with the latest tech, you might find it super rewarding. Plus, the demand for data engineers is high, so there are plenty of opportunities out there. Just be prepared to learn a lot about data warehousing, ETL processes, and maybe even some SQL and Python.

You would actually have the opportunity to shape things to your own cohesive vision if you join a start up later in your career, but at that point you may be more risk averse because you have family and responsibilities to look after.

                "body": "In my experience, as soon as you start to build off of other team's operational data, it's very unlikely to reach a good ROI, especially as the data problem scales. In a \"normal\" environment I believe it's nearly impossible to make a good ROI using MDS model, and in your environment you've already been forewarned \"that they have a lot of problems with data structure changes\".\n\nLots of assumptions and missing information, so please ignore me if I'm off the mark, but as soon as you start to build on other teams operational data you need to understand their domain as well as they do. Does your team have the headcount to do this?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/5ZtQkQv](https://imgur.com/a/5ZtQkQv)\n\nYour other warning is that the data frequently changes. How do you handle this with LH, DWH strategy? Even if you isolate the structural changes to an early layer in the processing how do you actually handle this? Are there rules to the changing? Is backwards compatibility ensured? Can you enforce it before ingestion? Can you define \"valid\" data and reject \"invalid\" data? Or does it fall on your team to just make sense of data that doesn't follow any formally constrained structure?\n\nThe way I've explained this in the past is:\n\n**Imagine that you just purchased a cloud vendor, like mixpanel, or AWS, or any other cloud vendor. That vendor exposes a real structured interface into their system. The vendors don't say: \"Just send us anything you want! We'll figure it out!\" but most data orgs are expected to just somehow accommodate arbitrary unstructured data!**\n\nWhat sort of outcome do you think systems like this produce? In my experiences (\\~5 Years in the data space space and 16 years total exp) the outcomes are really really poor. 10's of millions a year wasted in really suboptimal data outcomes. The best use cases for data warehousing I've worked with, establish structured interfaces into the system, through actual APIs. The product submits data to those APIs , it either submits valid data and the data is ingested, or invalid data and the data is rejected back to the product teams.\n\nSorry for the ranting dump but the fact that you haven't committed yet to a solution I think puts you in a really advantageous position :)\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/draining-data-lake-part-1-3-problems-danny-mican-twjle/?trackingId=is9EOqN2CO82XMDL5G2UXw%3D%3D](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/draining-data-lake-part-1-3-problems-danny-mican-twjle/?trackingId=is9EOqN2CO82XMDL5G2UXw%3D%3D)",

Some tips from my exp: \n\n- FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS AND START WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS FIRST\n\n- GREAT THINGS COME WITH ITERATION\n\n- Get a rough idea of your requirements, how many sources? Where are those sources? How much data?\n\n- Pick a warehouse and design your architecture\n\n- Don't worry about picking the absolute perfect thing and spend 6 months choosing a warehouse. They all mostly do the same shit and that's all time you could actually be building. Build a POC with postgres, start getting shit built, obviously be smart ab it but if you absolutely need to use something else after a month or two? - boo hoo you have to migrate like 5 or 10 data pipelines and if both platforms are ANSI SQL you'll basically just be copy pasting.\n\n- remember that building something scalable doesn’t just mean “can this handle terabytes of data”... or whatever \"big data\" means to you, But also “will this be absolute hell to organize when i have hundreds of data pipelines”\n\n- Name and organize your tables/views/dbt models/stored procs (god forbid), etc... well. think to yourself \"will i be able to make sense of what this thing is just from the name of it after i havent looked at it in years\". Imagine being a new dev and seeing your stuff. \n\n- People love to give shitty unclear requirements and then act surprised when the thing you deliver isn't exactly what they want and then they don't use it. If you find someone in your company who is smart and business savvy and knows how to provide good requirements - cherish them lmao. And literally have them teach the rest of the business stakeholders how to give good requirements. \n\n- “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” - Bruce Lee. spending a ton of time honing in on one area of the business, having one incredble dashboard for it and just absolutely nailing that one dashboard or report or whatever... is WAYYYY more valuable than making 10 reports or dashboards or whatever that are half assed and no one uses. Took me way too long to learn this bc all I cared about was how sick my architecture was and cloud and python and docker and blah blah blah nobody gives a fuck about any of that that - they care about what THEY see which are the dashboards (or products or reports or whatever it is) that are supposed to help THEM do their job easier or better.\n\n- Don't use Fabric",

I’ll always argue that “working code is the best code” and “it depends on your team skill set.”\n\nWhen comparing approaches, especially when it involves changing technologies, the first thing I want to understand is the following:\n\nWhat is wrong with the current approach that is warranting a change that is as drastic as migrating your existing pipelines to a new tech stack.\n\nOnce you have established that answer, you can then start exploring new technical solutions and make sure it checks all of the boxes of what is wrong with the current approach. But it’s important to go in eyes wide open because no approach is perfect, there is always a trade off. Such as with your proposed change, while yes, Dagster + dbt could be a better approach if you are wanting to modernize your ETL pipelines and gain better visibility into runtime metrics and issues, but it comes at the cost of now having to use an external service (that your team may or may not know) and then port your Stored Procedures into dbt code (again, your team may or may not know).\n\nAlso, need to keep in mind other business factors such as you will be splitting your development time between the migration and normal feature requests and maintenance. While you may get some approval to slow down until you get the new system up, it is hard to justify to leadership why they can’t get “x” feature.\n\nLastly, there are always hidden “gotchas” in a migration so always plan for extra time than you would expect to prevent an expectations mismatch between what you expect the migration to take and what it will actually take. And “trust” in data is always key so there will be some amount of time you will have to run both, validate the migration is producing the same results, and then you can deprecate the prior solution. This carries an increased cost because you are running double the infrastructure while mid-migration.",

It has built in support for multi page applications, and the learning curve is minimal compared to alternatives, you can build functional dashboards with just Python knowledge. For handling your star schema with millions of rows, Streamlit's session state and caching features help manage the data flow efficiently. You can load your dimension tables once and filter fact tables as needed, keeping your dashboard responsive.\n\nIf you need more customization while still maintaining rapid development, Plotly Dash is a solid alternative. It offers more control over the UI but requires slightly more setup time for multi page functionality. The callback system works well for interactive filtering and can handle large datasets effectively. Panel with HoloViews is powerful but has a steeper learning curve that might be challenging given your one-month timeline.\n\nFor connecting to your data warehouse, consider using SQLAlchemy for database interactions, which integrates well with all these frameworks and allows you to efficiently query only the data you need for each view. If you're working with marketing data as part of your warehouse, Windsor.ai provides pre built connections that could save you significant development time integrating those specific data sources.",

Sources send data/message (records, state updates, errors) to a worker service is responsible to decode the message and take action (send record to destination, stop the sync because an error, etc).\n\nI believe one of the best benefits of using a data ingestion tool is its connectors and data transfer methods, such as incremental syncs and schema changes. If you have a defined project, you can likely create a smaller version of it. One example as you mention is OOM, the current database CDK (connector dev kit) has a dynamic batch adjust every read to not throw such error).\n\nIf you want to have a simple/minimal data pipeline you can try use PyAirbyte to ingest data and orchestrate your jobs using Github Actions or Airflow.\n\nLet me know if you need additional information or want to dive deeper into a specific topic.",

You could definitely do dbt core practice on local and it will help you get ready for deployment but as someone starting out it's not bad to start out fully on rails. And eventually for a portfolio project you should probably deploy the cloud anyways.\n\nMy actual recommendation is to just use BigQuery, Redshift or Azure Synapse. I used BigQuery. BigQuery's free tier is MORE than enough even once your GCP trial is over. I know because I used the BQ free tier post GCP trial.\n\nI'd recommend MotherDuck their free tier is great but you have to get used to working with dbt core to do it, it doesn't work with dbt cloud. I know this because I did a project a couple of months back with DuckDB local and MotherDuck for \"production\" for the project with the DuckDB adapter, that's how I know. \n\n\n\nEdit: meant any of the big 3",

                "body": "Let's take a step back here and mention one fundamental truth: you cannot succeed in data or tech without constantly learning and keeping your skills up to date. This is the bare minimum. \n\nThis is an industry constantly changing. You have to be constantly learning to keep up with it. With that said: job titles are not standardized and therefore they're all over the place and the job descriptions aren't much better. This means the old advice of \"it's a numbers game\" with job applications doesn't often apply anymore. You have to be intentional and surgical with the roles you apply for because there's such a wide umbrella of data skills these days. \n\n\nPlenty of jobs out there that don't need ci/cd or cloud experience, but analyst roles as a whole will continue to take a hit as companies try to replace them with self service tools. Data science roles have already exited the market in much of the industry.\n\nYou should understand the role cloud plays in data and the role CI/CD plays. You should understand the full data analytics lifecycle, how pipelines work, and basic data modeling information. Hope this helps.",

While you don’t need to be a full-fledged data engineer, having a working knowledge of tools like SQL, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure), and some data pipeline concepts (Airflow, dbt, etc.) can give you an edge in the job market. The key is to focus on the essentials rather than trying to master everything.\n\nInstead of feeling overwhelmed, try to approach it strategically—pick up just enough data engineering to be self-sufficient in handling and transforming data without relying entirely on a data engineer. This will make you more valuable as a data scientist or analyst while still allowing you to focus on insights, modeling, and business impact.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to stay ahead of the latest trends in data roles and how to navigate these shifts, [this](https://data-comeback.beehiiv.com/) has some great insights on what actually matters in the industry. You're not alone in this shift, and companies still value strong analysts and data scientists who can work with engineers rather than become them!",

I recall Apple not offering much of a discount either if you had a corporate account whereas HP or Dell wanted business bad and would give pretty good discounts. As far as Linux being unsafe in my current company I believe there were discussions around it being harder to keep Linux machines up to do date with some sort of centralized patching solution. Also there were concerns on immediate patching for vulnerabilities. I don’t know if all that is true to be honest but those were a few things I recall being mentioned in discussions.",

The ATMs ran an Oracle front end.\n\nThere were a couple of saas products for commercial loans, and Oracle DB for consumer loans.\n\nThings eventually flowed into one of several analytics warehouses.\n\nThe warehouses were specific to different groups across the bank...for example risk datamarts (loan payments and default ratings) were in SQL Server with special risk modelling done in both COTS software and using SAS (not Python).  ETL used SSIS.\n\nThe main warehouse started in DB2, then moved to another IBM appliance with hardware aggregators, and when that couldn't keep up with demand it eventually moved to Redshift....but in my experience the main takeaway is they're never cutting edge, rarely want to heavily invest in tech and often choose based on their vendor relationships rather than technical requirements, or TCO...",

If you need a connector for application, you can be sure it is already available.  \n\\* Mostly no-code or low-code development. If you need custom code, there is scripting available, too.  \n\\* Can be used both on-premises and in managed cloud environment.  \n\\* Solid with more than 20 years of many successful projects in production.",
