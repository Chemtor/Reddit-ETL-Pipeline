1kwiihm,I just nuked all our dashboards,SocioGrab743,dataengineering,"This just happened and I don't know how to process it.Context:I am not a data engineer, I work in dashboards, but our engineer just left us and I was the last person in the data team under a CTO. I do know SQL and Python but I was open about my lack of ability in using our database modeling too and other DE tools. I had a few KT sessions with the engineer which went well, and everything seemed straightforward.Cut to today:I noticed that our database modeling tool had things listed as materializing as views, when they were actually tables in BigQuery. Since they all had 'staging' labels, I thought I'd just correct that. I created a backup, asked ChatGPT if I was correct (which may have been an anti-safety step looking back, but I'm not a DE needed confirmation from somewhere), and since it was after office hours, I simply dropped all those tables. Not 30 seconds later and I receive calls from upper management, every dashboard just shutdown. The underlying data was all there, but all connections flatlined. I check, everything really is down. I still don't know why. In a moment of panic I restore my backup, and then rerun everything from our modeling tool, then reran our cloud scheduler. In about 20 minutes, everything was back. I suspect that this move was likely quite expensive, but I just needed everything to be back to normal ASAP.I don't know what to think from here. How do I check that everything is running okay? I don't know if they'll give me an earful tomorrow or if I should explain what happened or just try to cover up and call it a technical hiccup. I'm honestly quite overwhelmed by my own incompetenceEDIT more backstoryI am a bit more competent in BigQuery (before today, I'd call myself competent) and actually created a BigQuery ETL pipeline, which the last guy replicated into our actual modeling tool as his last task. But it wasn't quite right, so I not only had to disable the pipeline I made, but I also had to re-engineer what he tried doing as a replication. Despite my changes in the model, nothing seemed to take effect in the BigQuery. After digging into it, I realized the issue: the modeling tool treated certain transformations as views, but in BigQuery, they were actually tables. Since views can't overwrite tables, any changes I made silently failed.To prevent this kind of conflict from happening again, I decided to run a test to identify any mismatches between how objects are defined in BigQuery vs. in the modeling tool, fix those now rather than dealing with them later. Then the above happened",387,0.96,154,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kwiihm/i_just_nuked_all_our_dashboards/,2025-05-27 08:58:31,2025-06-01 01:58:22

1kwy13s,"$10,000 annually for 500MB daily pipeline?",quasirun,dataengineering,"Just found out our IT department contracted a pipeline build that moves 500MB daily. They're pretending to manage data (insert long story about why they shouldn't). It's costing our business $10,000 per year. Granted that comes with theoretical support and maintenance. I'd estimate the vendor spends maybe 1-6 hours per year doing support. They don't know what value the company derives from it so they ask me every year about it. It does generate more value than it costs.I'm just wondering if this is even reasonable?

He mentioned that using DBT led to the creation of many more steps or models, since best practices in DBT often encourage breaking large SQL scripts into smaller, modular ones. However, he also said this made the process slower overall, because the Oracle query optimizer tends to perform better with larger, consolidated SQL queries than with many smaller ones.Is there some truth to what he said, or is it just a case of him not knowing how to use the tools properly",82,0.95,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kxb3ip/dbt_slower_than_original_etl/,2025-05-28 07:33:44,2025-06-01 01:58:22
1kych1l,Team wants every service to write individual records directly to Apache Iceberg - am I wrong to think this won't scale?,AlternativeTwist6742,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I'm in a debate with my team about architecture choices and need a reality check from the community.**The Setup:** We're building a data storage system for multiple customer services. My colleagues implemented a pattern where:* Each service writes individual records directly to Iceberg tables via Iceberg python client (pyiceberg)* Or a solution where we leverage S3 for decoupling, where: * Every single S3 event triggers a Lambda that appends **one record** to Iceberg * They envision eventually using Iceberg for everything - both operational and analytical workloads**Their Vision:*** ""Why maintain multiple data stores? Just use Iceberg for everything""* ""Services can write directly without complex pipelines""* ""AWS S3 Tables handle file optimization automatically""* ""Each team manages their own schemas and tables""**What We're Seeing in Production:**We're currently handling hundreds of events per minute across all services. We put the S3 -> Lambda -> append individual record via pyiceberg to the iceberg table solution. What I see is lot of those concurrency errors: CommitFailedException: Requirement failed: branch main has changed: expected id xxxxyx != xxxxxkkMultiple Lambdas are trying to commit to the same table simultaneously and failing.**My Position**I originally proposed:* Using PostgreSQL for operational/transactional data* Periodically ingesting PostgreSQL data into Iceberg for analytics* Micro-Batching records for streaming dataMy reasoning:* Iceberg uses optimistic concurrency control - only one writer can commit at a time per table* We're creating hundreds of tiny files instead of fewer, optimally-sized files* Iceberg is designed for ""large, slow-changing collections of files"" (per their docs)* The metadata overhead of tracking millions of small files will become expensive (regardless of the fact that this is abstracted away from use by using managed S3 Tables)**The Core Disagreement:** My colleagues believe S3 Tables' automatic optimizations mean we don't need to worry about file sizes or commit patterns. They see my proposed architecture (Postgres + batch/micro-batch ingestion, i.e. using Firehose/Spark structured streaming) as unnecessary complexity.It feels we're trying to use Iceberg as both an OLTP and OLAP system when it's designed for OLAP.**Questions for the Community:**1. Has anyone successfully used Iceberg as their primary datastore for both operational AND analytical workloads?2. Is writing individual records to Iceberg (hundreds per minute) sustainable at scale?3. Do S3 Tables' optimizations actually solve the small files and concurrency issues?4.

Even if you can, there’s the compliance overhead, opaque usage policies, and the quiet reality that all your data and models sit in someone else’s walled garden.This centralization creates 3 big issues:* Cost barriers lock out innovation* Surveillance and compliance risks go up* Local/grassroots AI development gets stifledI came across a project recently, Ocean Nodes, that proposes a decentralized alternative. The idea is to create a permissionless compute layer where anyone can contribute idle GPUs or CPUs. Developers can run containerized workloads (training, inference, validation), and everything is cryptographically verified. It’s essentially DePIN combined with AI workloads.Not saying it solves everything overnight, but it flips the model: instead of a few hyperscalers owning all the compute, we can build a network where anyone contributes and anyone can access. Trust is built in by design, not by paperwork.Has anyone here tried running AI jobs on decentralized infrastructure or looked into Ocean Nodes? Does this kind of model actually have legs for serious ML workloads?

1kz2e4c,What's up with the cloud/close source requirements for applications?,unhinged_peasant,dataengineering,"This is not just another post about 'how to transition into Data Engineering'. I want to share a real challenge I’ve been facing, despite being actively learning, practicing, and building projects. Yet, breaking into a DE role has proven harder than I expected.I have around 6 years of experience working as a data analyst, mostly focused on advanced SQL, data modeling, and reporting with Tableau. I even led a short-term ETL project using Tableau Prep, and over the past couple of years, my work has been very close to what an Analytics Engineer does—building robust queries over a data warehouse, transforming data for self-service reporting, and creating scalable models.Along this journey, I’ve been deeply investing in myself. I enrolled in a comprehensive Data Engineering course that’s constantly updated with modern tools, techniques, and cloud workflows. I’ve also built several open-source projects where I apply DE concepts in practice: Python-based pipelines, Docker orchestration, data transformations, and automated workflows.I tend to avoid saying 'I have no experience' because, while I don’t have formal production experience in cloud environments, I do have hands-on experience through personal projects, structured learning, and working with comparable on-prem or SQL-based tools in my previous roles. However, the hiring process doesn’t seem to value that in the same way.The real obstacle comes down to the production cloud experience. Almost every DE job requires AWS, Databricks, Spark, etc.—but not just knowledge, production-level experience. Setting up cloud projects on my own helps me learn, but comes with its own headaches: managing resources carefully to avoid unexpected costs, configuring environments properly, and the limitations of working without a real production load.I’ve tried the 'get in as a Data Analyst and pivot internally' strategy a few times, but it hasn’t worked for me.At this point, it feels like a frustrating loop: companies want production experience, but getting that experience without the job is almost impossible. Despite the learning, the practice, and the commitment, the outcome hasn't been what I hoped for.So my question is—how do people actually break this loop? Is there something I’m not seeing? Or is it simply about being patient until the right opportunity shows up? I’m genuinely curious to hear from those who’ve been through this or from people on the hiring side of things.",11,0.77,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kz2e4c/whats_up_with_the_cloudclose_source_requirements/,2025-05-30 11:59:21,2025-06-01 01:58:22

Code-first approach to API workflows.Hey r/dataengineering,We built Sequor to solve a recurring problem: choosing between two bad options for API/app integration:1. Proprietary black-box SaaS connectors with vendor lock-in2. Custom scripts that are brittle, opaque, and hard to maintainAs data engineers, we wanted a solution that followed the principles that made dbt so powerful (code-first, git-based version control, SQL-centric), but designed specifically for API integration workflows.**What Sequor does:*** Connects APIs to your databases with an iterator model* Uses SQL for all data transformations and preparation* Defines workflows in YAML with proper version control* Adds procedural flow control (if-then-else, for-each loops)* Uses Python and Jinja for dynamic parameters and response mapping**Quick example:** * Data acquisition: Pull Salesforce leads → transform with SQL → push to HubSpot → all in one declarative pipeline.* Data activation (Reverse ETL): Pull customer behavior from warehouse → segment with SQL → sync personalized offers to Klaviyo/Mailchimp* App integration: Pull new orders from Amazon → join with SQL to identify new customers → create the customers and sales orders in NetSuite* App integration: Pull inventory levels from NetSuite → filter with SQL for eBay-active SKUs → update quantities on eBay**How it's different from other tools:**Instead of choosing between rigid and incomplete prebuilt integration systems, you can easily build your own custom connectors in minutes using just two basic operations (**transform** for SQL and **http\_request** for APIs) and starting from prebuilt examples we provide.The project is open source and we welcome any feedback and contributions.**Links:*** Website: [https://sequor.dev/](https://sequor.dev/) (includes code examples)* Quickstart: [https://docs.sequor.dev/getting-started/quickstart](https://docs.sequor.dev/getting-started/quickstart)* GitHub: [https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor](https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor)* Examples of prebuilt integrations: [https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor-integrations](https://github.com/paloaltodatabases/sequor-integrations)**Questions for the community:*** What's your current approach to API integrations?* What business apps and integration scenarios do you struggle with most?* Are there specific workflows that have been particularly challenging to implement?",10,0.87,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kxo58r/sequor_an_open_source_sqlcentric_framework_for/,2025-05-28 18:11:03,2025-06-01 01:58:22
1kut9e6,Ideas on how to handle deeply nested json files,BlueAcronis,dataengineering,"My application is distributed across several AWS accounts, and it writes logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in the `.json.gz` format.

The difficulty arises because the JSON files are deeply nested (up to four levels deep) as shown in the example below. I would like to hear suggestions on how to handle this.

Ive recently discovered that the team managing this process takes only ""changes"" in salesforce (I think this is called change data capture..?), using the salesforce record's last modified date to determine whether we need to load/update data in salesforce.

We’ve successfully flattened the arrays into a tabular model, but the resulting tables are huge — both in terms of columns and rows — and we can’t run dbt models efficiently on top of them.We attempted to create intermediate, smaller tables in BigQuery to reduce complexity before loading into AWS, but this introduced an extra transformation layer that we’d rather avoid, as it complicates the pipeline and maintainability.I’d like to implement an incremental model in dbt, but I’m not sure if that’s going to be effective given the way the GA4 data is structured and the performance bottlenecks we’ve hit so far.Has anyone here faced similar challenges with integrating GA4 data into an AWS ecosystem?How did you handle the schema explosion and performance issues with dbt/Redshift?Any thoughts on best practices or architecture patterns would be really appreciated.Thanks in advance!",6,0.88,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kxsxqv/integrating_ga4_bigquery_into_awsbased_data_stack/,2025-05-28 21:20:48,2025-06-01 01:58:22

1kylamm,SQL vs PySpark for Oracle on prem to AWS,Immediate_Cap7319,dataengineering,"Hi all,I wanted to ask if you have any rules for when you'd use SQL first and when you build tooling and fuller suites in PySpark.My company intend to copy some data from a very small (relatively) Oracle database to AWS. This won't be the entire DB copied, it will be just some of the data we want to use for analytical purposes (non-live, non-streaming, just weekly or monthly reporting). Therefore, it does not have to be migrated using RDS or into Redshift. The architects planned to dump some of the data into S3 buckets and then our DE team will take it from there. We have some SQL code written by a previous DE to query the on-prem DB and create views and new tables. My question is: I would prefer no-SQL if I could choose. My instinct would be to write the new code within AWS in PySpark and make it more structured, implement unit testing etc., and move away from SQL.

So there are probably things I don't know that I don't know! I've been doing this for about 8 years but only recently learned about DBT and SQLMesh, for example._I'm working on an ELT pipeline that converts input files of various formats into Parquet files on Google Cloud Storage, which subsequently need to be loaded into BigQuery tables (append-only).- The Extract processes drop files into GCS at unspecified times.- The Transform processes convert _newly created_ files to Parquet and drops the result back into GCS.- The Load process needs to load the _newly created_ files into BigQuery, making sure to load every file exactly once.To process only new (or failed) files, I guess there are two main approaches:1. Query the output, see what's missing, then process that. Seems simple, but has scalability limitations because you need to list the entire history. Would need to query both GCS and BQ to compare what files are still missing.2. Have some external system or work queue that keeps track of incomplete work. Scales better, but has the potential to go out of sync with reality (e.g. if Extract fails to write to the work queue, the file is never transformed or loaded).I suppose this is a common problem that everyone has solved already. What are the best practices around this? Is there any (ideally FOSS) tooling that could help me?",5,0.86,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kvqajs/how_to_know_which_files_have_already_been_loaded/,2025-05-26 09:36:25,2025-06-01 01:58:22

1kvbr5b,"Learning About GCP BigQuery Table Schema - Please help me understand the real world use cases of when and how often you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" and ""normalized relational schema"" when constructing your GCP BigQuery tables.",Original_Chipmunk941,dataengineering,"**Question:**I am currently learning Google Cloud Platform for data engineering. I learned that there are three types of schemas that I can use when constructing tables in BigQuery: 1) Normalized relational schema, 2) Nested & Repeating Schema, 3) Denormalized schema. I am trying to understand when I will realistically use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" instead of ""normalized relational schema"" for the tables that I construct in BigQuery.Please answer both of these questions below:1. When do you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" over ""normalized relational schema"" when you construct tables in BigQuery?2. When constructing tables within BigQuery data warehouses, how often do you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema""? How often do you use ""normalized relational schema""? If possible, please provide me a ballpark percentage (Ex. 40% Nested & Repeating Schema vs. 60% normalized relational schema). **My Current Rationale:**I understand that BigQuery is a columnar oriented database. I learned that ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" is a more cost-effective for querying and more efficient than ""normalized relational schema"". However, even after researching it, I do not fully understand the real life advantages of ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" over a ""normalized relational schema"".Although ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" is more efficient and cost-effective for querying, I think a ""normalized relational schema"" makes more sense because it allows you to update records more easily like a traditional SQL RDBMS.I understand that columnar oriented databases are great when your historical data within the BigQuery table does not change. However, from my experience on working as a data analyst, historical data frequently needs to change. For example, lets say you have an external OLTP RDBMS that feeds into BigQuery daily. This external OLTP RDBMS contains a table named sales data. This table contains a column named ""Member Status"" and returns either one of two outputs: ""Active"" or ""Inactive"". ""Member ID"" 123456 has a ""Member Status"" of ""Active"". The data for that daily load is sent from the external OLTP RDBMS to the BigQuery table containing the data of ""Member ID"" 123456 with a ""Member Status"" of ""Active"". Three months later, the ""Member Status"" of ""Member ID"" 123456 changes to ""Inactive"" within the external OLTP RDBMS.From my understanding, now I cannot change that data easily within the BigQuery table if it has ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" . If my BigQuery table had ""normalized relational schema"", it should be able to update the ""Member Status"" of ""Member ID"" 123456 very easily.This is my rationale on why I think a ""normalized relational schema"" is better than ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" for the majority of real world use cases. Please let me know if you agree, disagree, etc. I would love to hear your thoughts. I am still learning GCP and data engineering.

1kwbj94,Leetcode is not for the majority of software developers. Do not make it your core focus.,-LinusMechTips-,learnprogramming,"A little advice to developers who are starting out from a software architect with 15 years experience and a 2:1 Computer Science degree. Today was the first time I've ever seen Leetcode whilst I was watching a few YouTube videos about some updates to C# (My language of choice). For me, Leetcode is definitely not reflective at all of what you would do in the majority of programming jobs and is very algorithmically heavy. Most of these algorithms you will not need to know at all most of the time as most languages contain core libraries that do this stuff way more efficiently than most developers will be able to do. Case in point, I was stuck on the first question today for about 45 minutes mainly because the question was worded really badly. I managed to solve that pretty quickly after I understood what it was asking for although I will admit I did it in my IDE rather than in Leetcode as nobody codes in the equivalent of Notepad anymore (although that's how I started back in the day). The second question I was completely stumped and gave up because it was more maths than programming (and believe it or not, you do not need to be good at maths to be a good developer). It's really going to depend on what you end up doing as an actual job. If you are writing drivers or doing anything mathematically heavy in your job then yes Leetcode might be a good fit but mostly it's algorithmic nonsense that most developers will never even use. I've worked for some of the biggest banks, insurance providers doing APIs hooking up to some pretty complex business logic and never have I had to use anything close to Leetcode level solutions. My point is, don't be disappointed in yourself if you struggle with Leetcode. You can still be a success. Lead teams.

1kwfq72,"I'm SLOW, am I doomed?",Nullify_Undefined,learnprogramming,"I'm a freshman last year (well, not quite now). I had my first performance review with just about 6 months of experience, and the feedback was that I'm slow — I take more time to complete tasks compared to others, sometimes even exceeding the defined deadlines.After 1 year (1 year and 6 months of experience), I had another performance review. This time, I received a good review, possibly even being considered for promotion. No more comments about being slow.However, just 3 months after that latest performance review (at 1 year and 9 months of experience — which is now), I received feedback again from others saying that I'm slow. These comments came from a few different sprints, and possibly from different people as well.For more context, the ""slowness"" now refers to me taking a longer time to complete relatively simple tasks. I was asked why I needed so much time to finish a task that others completed in much less time. (Even though the task was simple, I still completed it on time.) While working on it, I encountered some hiccups — which were simple to fix — but it still took me some time to figure out the solutions. This might be because the issues were new to me, I quickly got the grasp of where are going wrong, but finding the workable fix take me sometime, or maybe because I'm just not good enough at logic or programming, which makes me slower than others.What can I do now?I'm starting to question myself about pursuing a career in programming.

I've been self-studying HTML, CSS and PHP, but I keep hitting these mental blocks that make me feel like I'm not making progress or that I'm too dumb to ever get this.My question is: Does anyone have experience with or know platforms where I can hire an online tutor? Like, private PHP lessons? Would it be worth it?If anyone's been through this or has tips to overcome these blocks, I'd really appreciate the help!So here's my story... I started by training my programming logic and spent about 3 months watching video lessons and studying basics: operators, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, arrays. Up to that point, it was okay - I could do exercises (some were hard, but I could work through them).The problems started when I got to callbacks, Promises, async/await and try/catch. These concepts just wouldn't click no matter how many explanations I watched.I got so tired of just doing exercises and watching videos that I switched to PHP (because I wanted to build something real to stay motivated). The basics (operators, loops, functions) were fine since they're similar to JS. (Not sure if this was the right choice, but I thought about creating a login system and saw PHP would work well - just needed to download Laragon and start, and I'm actually liking PHP.)But when it came time to actually code and start the project, I froze. I'd search online, I could understand what the code was doing - like I understood how the database connection worked conceptually - but when I went to type it out, I just couldn't remember the whole code. I felt like I was just copying and pasting, even if the code worked in the end, and everyone says this hurts real learning.To make it worse, a coworker (who also studies) told me that in 3 months he was already way beyond this and that I should try harder.

I’ll also work on creating a resume and 2-3 projects , then eventually start applying in late August/early September. I wanted to know if this 11-week plan makes sense and is realistic — spending the first 5 weeks learning Python and core programming concepts(ex. Cs50, freecodecamp), then the next 6 weeks focusing on learning dsa/LeetCode and building projects. Is this a realistic/solid approach for someone starting from zero to become interview-ready and landing an internship in just 11 weeks?Worst case scenario, I’m prepared to keep applying until the latest which from what I’ve seen will be January. By then I should hopefully be fully ready for interviews with a complete resume ? I know the importance of applying early in august/early September so I was also wondering if applying in January would even be worth applying since it might be too late.Sorry for the long post, I’ve been thinking about this a lot and i feel like more experienced peoples opinion on this would help me gauge my situation better.

1kwtdzp,Need assistance with Bad DB design,Quin__Decim,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone, I am going through a bit of confusion. Previously I worked with educational institutions with focus on ML. So everything I designed and created including DB was under me and I used every naming conventions that is standard when designing a SQL DB. Now that I have moved to a small startup,this is the first time I am building something where DB design wasn't done by me so I am not even sure if this is the correct way but all these years of Machine Learning I have never seen a DB design like this.There is around 500 tables on the DB with no naming conventions, barely any primary key or foreign key. So I decided to do a compare to find common column names so it makes my work easier to extract the data, but turns out even the names of the columns that are joint is different it could be subscription_id in one column and original_subscription_id somewhere else. So many inconsistency that I am not able to find proper relationship. To further this issue many tables are many to many relationship. My question based on everything is1. Is there true in other organization? 2. Is there a way to fix this without refactoring the entire DB?3. As ML guy I rely on DB so pulling them and finding relationship is important. I thought of brute forcing the relationship by finding such similarities but the DB is vast.So I am not even sure how to approach it. 4. The last option is to build the entire DE pipeline and fix this but given that I am the only there and building it will take time,I am planning to do it on the sideThank you everyone for your assistance.P.S.:I tried asking this question on Software Engineering but it got removed.",8,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kwtdzp/need_assistance_with_bad_db_design/,2025-05-27 17:32:44,2025-06-01 01:58:24

I am considering Golang at the moment, and I would really not be against Rust or something purely FP even (I have played around with Elm a bit and damn does that thing seem immune to errors)But, once again, realities of job market.

The latter seems boring, to just sit through hundreds of docs and I genuinely doubt people actually do that, but when I try to make stuff by myself, I don't know if it will become hard to manage slop the more features I add and by the time I realise I will have wasted all that time to then rewrite the entire structure of the program. For a more specific example, I am writing a javaFX app. I'm currently trying to make a modular design where I will have one master controller which is responsible for showing or hiding elements of the UI and a bunch of sub controllers to handle those separate UI menus. I made it such that each sub controller holds a reference to its master and runs some kinda update function of the master so that the master is also informed of all UI changes and can evaluate some stuff or facilitate communication between the sub controllers. Technically this works and I understand it well because I had this idea myself. But then I read somewhere that this is bad because it couples the different components too much and may become unwieldy or whatever, and that maybe I should look into something like Google Guava EventBus, but that's another hour of learning where I could just think of stuff on my own instead.Basically, is there any value in using minimal dependancies and just making shit up to learn, or should I follow stricter guidelines on established solutions, even though it's boring?",4,0.71,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kypx73/when_should_i_create_my_own_solutions_and_when_do/,2025-05-29 23:50:13,2025-06-01 01:58:24

The main reason is that in the 3rd semester, we have to study DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) using Python and C.But here's where I'm confused:Everyone is saying ""Don't waste time relearning basics, start with DSA directly in one language. Once you master DSA in one language, switching to another isn't a big deal.""Some suggest doing DSA in Python, and others say C++ is better for DSA.As someone who's just starting out and hasn't really explored much in the coding world yet, I’m feeling stuck.

1kxkbsi,"I just bombed a first round technical by over-preparing, and I think a lot of you need to hear about it.",garyspzhn,cscareerquestions,"I’m a 10YOE dev who talks a big game, i fail interviews from time to time like anyone else but my success rate in recent years is particularly high, so I just tried my hand at a company whose job posting was way too good to be true, passed the initial screener and coding assessment with flying colors, but fumbled the opportunity in the most disheartening way. Here’s the story: The CS job market isn’t as black-and-white as you may imagine, there are still a lot of companies that don’t exactly know what they’re doing, they’ll offer you a competitive salary and put you through the ringer, but they’ll still manage to cut through candidates just by following due process and putting the pressure on them. I’ve been writing PHP for 13 years, and up until 2 years ago I’ve done PHP in production, on-and-off for 10 years, but I naturally moved on to JavaScript, Python, and Java because nobody wants us. In other words, I thought I’ll never see another PHP role again, so I stopped searching for them, stopped calling myself a PHP specialist, stopped reading up on latest versions, and got rusty, then a company that uses PHP found me, and they were offering me an insanely good deal, so I jumped at the role. The online assessment was easy, it was medium leet code that required PHP, and I’m great at PHP, so it took me 10 minutes. The screening interview was even easier, we were supposed to talk for 30 minutes, we spoke for 90 minutes, the guy told me what to expect in the technical interview (because I asked), he mentioned all the standards buzzwords like system design and application design, then went into the details, got more particular, told me to brush up on my redis and Java, MVC frameworks, MySQL and security protocols, so I did that - huge mistake. The technical interview was far more like a “screener” than anything else, we didn’t cover system design as intricately as I thought, a lot of what transpired was a pop quiz with questions like “do you know what traits are?” and “do you know what anonymous functions are and how they’re used?” This was supposed to take 45 minutes, I had him on the video chat for 2 hours, I acted clueless the whole time, not because I didn’t know what half the answers were, but because I didn’t study for a pop quiz, i was shocked, I was nervous, I was stressed, I was angry, and most importantly, I was disappointed in myself, because this was the luckiest break ever, and I ruined it. At one point I was so lost, I was second guessing myself, so he did me a favor and shared a codepen, I passed the little “coding challenge” he looked relieved, said “okay so you know this” then resumed the pop quiz, which again, I bombed. Guess what I did to prepare for this interview? Yep, you guessed it! Leet Code and online lectures. Why did i go this route? Tech forums convinced me the job market is an AI-driven rat race and the hiring manager confirmed the bias for me, but I would’ve passed the technical if I just opened and read PHP documentation like the good old days. So the moral of the story is, do all your general interview prep periodically, and when you get the actual interview, just read the documentation, because you never know what kind of interviewer you’re gonna get.

I learned so much in such little time and picked up so many soft skills, such as how to consult different engineers and compile their knowledge to properly add new features to infra way too big for any 1 dev to have 100% knowledge on.But my manager squeezed and sucked all of that passion out of me. I’ve tried my best to work on our relationship, but he’s spent all year treating me with explicit disdain, not making eye contact, and ignoring whatever I say in team lunches.I buckled down as much as I could to do better, but every 1:1 became a condescending berating session and I never felt like I truly belonged on the team.Whenever features were delayed, the majority of the time it was because of consistently broken infra, incomplete features from sister teams that mine depended on to start, or inaccurate guidance from dev’s I was asked to consult. I accepted the weaknesses within my control and improved them, but no matter what I did, I could never beat the narrative.Anything I did good was sarcastically devalued and whenever anything went wrong, my manager would tell me I should’ve taken X action that I wouldn’t have known to do at the time without privileged knowledge or time travel (hindsight advice).Coworkers and mentor repeatedly told me I was doing fine, but I just had our first performance review, and I’m being offered 2 things:**PIP vs Severance.**This severance side offer is brand new this year and our company has had huge layoffs.The actual meeting was another vague collection of criticisms, in which, when I asked him what I could’ve ideally done differently, he said “I’m not here to give specific edge cases for you to iterate literally off of and am just looking for high level resourcefulness from you”.When he would list specifically delayed features, I would tell him how I did everything in my power, including implementing his advice (which I can prove), only for the infra related reasons to delay it.When I tried to show areas I’ve improved in, he would agree but then re-insist how below the mark I am even though I’m never been sure what a “Meets Expectation” counterpart of me hypothetically looks like all year. His goalpost for me always felt fictional.Now, I feel extremely jaded and demotivated being forced into this job market.

Those that have been working for a few years now, what are your future plans for your career as we face the incoming AI onslaught? It's wild witnessing such a paradigm shift that will literally affect almost every aspect of our lives. We got a bit of a sneak preview, working in tech. Now AI tools are becoming more mainstream and everyone that's trying to make a buck is rushing to either incorporate AI into their product, or make a new AI product. At some point the barrier to entry for coding will be completely mitigated by AI. As long as you can articulate the concepts in natural speech, your idea can be created. We're not there yet, but quickly trending toward it. I personally try to take all the AI hype with a grain of salt, especially with claims like ""AI wrote 30% of Google's new code"" and such that talk up the very same products they're trying to sell.

1kwu66r,How to Nail Any System Design by a Staff Engineer at OpenAI,Organic-Pipe-8139,cscareerquestions,"I just did another mock interview with another Staff Engineer from Open AI I’d argue this is the near perfect solution for Design K Leaderboard for Facebook comments or videos. To be honest the design was so impressive, I was struggling to keep up.Here is the full video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyzIBVEIjo&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyzIBVEIjo&)So this is exactly how a person of this caliber nailed the interview step by step:What I really liked is how he handled the ambiguity of the problem. He kept asking clarifying questions, gradually narrowing down what exactly the system needed to do. He started by defining the scope, deciding to track trending content globally and focusing mainly on real user reactions (ignoring edge cases like bot farms). He emphasized the need for real-time or near real-time updates, especially important when people refresh their pages a lot.He moved on to data modeling and decided to track each event (like user reactions) with details like user ID, post ID, reaction type, and timestamp (this one was critical as he spent an incredible amount of time later on discussing how bad clocks really are in a distributed system). Importantly, each user only has one reaction per post at any time, which simplifies some of the complexity.Then he dove into the scaling challenges. He chose a regional approach for data handling, using local timestamps for consistency within each region, and came up with this clever ""hot/cold"" key strategy. Basically, popular (""hot"") posts update almost instantly, while less popular (""cold"") posts don't need frequent updates. Regions share their top posts periodically to keep the global leaderboard updated.Interviewee didn't tie himself down to a specific database or any tools in general. Unlike mid level engineers, he actually used zero tools at all and just kept the interview on the conceptual level. He even mentioned a custom solution might be better than something traditional, highlighting using write-ahead logs and processing events separately from aggregating them. I bet this might be because he spent most of his career at Google (Youtube & Spanner) as well as Meta and OpenAI where tools are mostly proprietary and made in house.He implicitly acknowledged the CAP theorem, but explained that real systems don’t work like research papers referring to CRDB aka CockroachDB, which claims to be both available & consistent. Even when it “feels like” consistency is important, you almost always want to prioritize availability and default eventual consistency rather than absolute consistency. This practical decision means the system stays reliable even if it's not theoretically perfect.He showed how practical trade-offs matter more than absolute precision. Losing or misordering a small percentage of events is okay if it means the system stays fast and scalable.Interviewee leveraged the idea of data distribution, noting most posts have low engagement, while a few blow up. This influenced his ""hot/cold"" strategy, optimizing resources.One subtle yet powerful idea he stressed was ""monotonicity."" By ensuring updates always move in one direction (like engagement always increasing), the system becomes much simpler to reconcile and scale.Finally, his incremental approach to design really stood out. He started broad, refined step by step, and wasn't afraid to revisit decisions. Overall, it's one of the best example of how real-world system design works and how a true staff engineer really behaves like. Managing complexity and making smart trade-offs rather than trying to build a theoretically perfect system. I definitely learned a ton from this one as an interviewer, but curious to hear what you all might think. TL;DR\- Ask questions, don't make assumptions, don't use tools mindlessly, and use the experience you got on the job to impress the interviewer on the design.",166,0.88,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kwu66r/how_to_nail_any_system_design_by_a_staff_engineer/,2025-05-27 18:03:07,2025-06-01 01:58:25

Back in 2022, I was interested in Computer Science, so I chose the nearest college that offered a new BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence. In hindsight, I realize the course was more of a marketing tactic — using the buzzword ""AI"" to attract students.The curriculum focused mainly on basic CS concepts but lacked depth. We skimmed over data structures and algorithms, touched upon C and Java programming superficially, and did a bit more Python — but again, nothing felt comprehensive. Even the AI-specific modules like machine learning and deep learning were mostly theoretical, with minimal mathematical grounding and almost no practical implementation. Our professors mostly taught using content from GeeksforGeeks and JavaTpoint. Hands-on experience was almost nonexistent.That said, I can’t blame the college entirely. I was dealing with a lot of internal struggles — depression, lack of motivation, and laziness — and I didn’t take the initiative to learn the important things on my own. I do have a few projects under my belt, mostly using OpenAI APIs or basic computer vision models like YOLO. But nothing feels significant. I also don’t know anything about front-end or back-end development. I’ve just used Streamlit to deploy some college projects.Over the past three years, I’ve mostly coasted through — maintaining a decent GPA but doing very little beyond that. I’ve just finished my third year, and I have one more to go.Right now, I’m doing a summer internship at a startup as an ML/DL intern, which I’m honestly surprised I got. The work is mostly R&D with a bit of implementation around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and I’m actually enjoying it. But it's also been a wake-up call — I’m realizing how little I actually know. I’m still relying heavily on AI to write most of my code, just like I did for all my previous projects. It’s scary. I don’t feel prepared for the job market at all.I’m scared I’ve fallen too far behind. The field is so saturated, and there are people out there who are far more talented and driven. I have no fallback plan. I don't know what to do next. I’d really appreciate any guidance — where to start, what skills to focus on, which courses or certifications are actually worth doing.

1kzkic1,Some things I've learned recently in the current job market,Ok-Process-2187,cscareerquestions,"Some of these may be obvious but I guess it wasn't for me.1.) during coding rounds, verbalize to confirm understanding not to express thinkingI used to think that I should vocalize all my thoughts and avoid any silence. This has proven to be problematic for a few reasons. First, when you're initially reading the question, vocalizing will unnecessarily slow you down. Second, you probably don't sound very smart when you're quickly reading the question like that, you might start looking for ways to condense sentences, skip over certain sentences, etc. It's all unnecessary.The time to vocalize your thoughts is after you've read it and to then confirm your understanding of the question with the interviewer.Then instead of brainstorming out loud the very first thing that comes to mind. I would ask for another minute to think of how you'd approach the question. The problem with saying the very first thing that comes to mind is that if it's obviously wrong then the interviewer may correct you which would be interpreted as giving you a hint which would count against you. After you've wrestled with the idea for a bit only then share your solution out loud with the interviewer.I wouldn't even bother mentioning an obvious brute force solution if you already have a better idea in mind since talking about the brute force will cut into your time.So the TLDR here is to be more strategic about when to vocalize your thought process.2.) during non-coding rounds, wait for your turn to talk, never interrupt the interviewerThis will probably be obvious to most but I used to interrupt the interviewer near the beginning. Not intentionally. If they said something that I thought would make for a really interesting question, then I would ask it right there when there was a natural pause in the conversation.I now realize this is very bad. It's always better to wait till you're sure that they are done speaking or until they ask you if you have any questions. You gain nothing by interrupting them but can easily make a bad impression and decrease the signal you give from your question by asking during a time in which they aren't fully ready to evaluate you since they still need to get through the rest of what they wanted to say. Plus, they might have brought up an even better point later on.3.) during a hiring manager round, to express that you're serious about the role, interview the interviewerYou can't tell the interviewer that you really want the position. That you've deeply thought about staying at the company in the long term. That you are a top candidate.You can only express these things by asking tough questions that make the interviewer think and possibly feel like they're being interviewed. Obviously you don't want to take this too far. You should ask questions that show you've deeply thought about the company's business model and how the role you're being hired for aligns with that. You should ask questions to see how clearly the hiring manager understands what will be needed for the role. It is genuinely a red flag if you're being hired for a role in which the hiring manager is not sure about what you'll be working on. Think about what other things could be red flags as well and ask some pointed (but still polite) questions about those.My current strategy for this is to split my preparation for this part of the interview over 2 days. On day 1 I learn as much as I can from quick online research about the company and do my best to come up with questions of substance. On day 2 I try again and this is when I come up with much higher quality questions.",40,0.89,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kzkic1/some_things_ive_learned_recently_in_the_current/,2025-05-31 00:53:15,2025-06-01 01:58:25

I have 11 distraction free weeks before the fall semester starts, and I plan on dedicating 7-9 hours 6 days per week for this. I’m starting completely from zero with no coding experience, so my plan is to spend the first 5 weeks learning Python/core programming concepts, and then spend the next 6 weeks learning DSA and beginning Leetcode problems for interview prep. I’ll also work on creating a resume and 2-3 projects , then eventually start applying in late August/early September.

Cs50, freecodecamp), then the next 6 weeks focusing on learning dsa/LeetCode and building projects. Is this a realistic/solid approach for someone starting from zero to become interview-ready and landing an internship in just 11 weeks?

1l0b85b,How do you deal with resentment and lack of motivation due to feeling undervalued by the company?,noko12312,cscareerquestions,"During the really rough job market in 2023 I finally managed to land a job as a software engineer after 10 months of searching. I was hired on at an very low salary ( 60,000 ), but I was desperate to find any job to get some experience.I have now been at the company for a little over a year and a half. My previous manager left this year right before the annual review period which was instead handled by my new manager. I had talks with my previous manager about feeling undervalued and my concerns with my salary. He was saying that due to my great performance he was going to get me a promotion to SE2 and a large compensation bump due to me being hired on at such a low salary. We were talking around 72,000 which I know is still pretty low, but i would have been a lot more happy with it. Then he left and the new manager had to handle all the performance reviews and promotion / raise decisions. I had conveyed what me and my manager discussed. My previous manager left notes on all of us and had me in Exceeds Expectations in all categories. At first the new manager was not planning on giving me a promotion, but after talking to him about my manager's notes he agreed he thinks I deserve one. This leads me into my next issues.It has been a 2 months since I was supposed to receive my promotion and it has still not processed. I talked with my manager about it and he says that he recommended me for one but HR is slow. His wording though sounds like it is not a sure thing though even after he had explicitly said he was giving me a promotion. Every one else on my team had their promotions go through instantly. Before you say that 1.5 years is too soon for a promotion, someone who was hired as SE1 5 months before me is already an SE3. I am almost feeling like I am being led on by this guy and don't have complete assurance of my promotion.Another issue is I only received a 5% raise which I find ridiculous for a promotional raise and after the talks with my previous manager with him assuring me there would be a substantial compensation adjustment. For my state I am in the lowest 1% for software engineers according to Indeed and Levels. I brought this up with my new manager and he says that the company is not giving big raises due to uncertainty currently, even though they continue to boast about all the new customers and sales they have obtained in each company wide meeting. I feel that he didn't even fight to get us better raises like my old manager would have.All of this has left me completely demotivated and feeling resentment towards the company and my new manager. I have let my manager know that I feel disillusioned with this whole job and am very disappointed in the raise / lack of a promotion. I feel like I am doing the bare minimum at work just to keep a job since I know it might take a while to find another. I figured working really hard and getting a perfect annual review would get me somewhere but I feel I am in the same place where I started. Any tips or advice on how to handle this? I am assuming I just have to start looking for a new job at this point.TLDR: Low compensation and lingering promise of promotion I earned has me feeling resentment and unmotivated.

1l01qc5,I don't know if IT profession is for me anymore. I don't know what to do...,Transparent_Prophet,cscareerquestions,"I love technology akin to a child who loved going to candy land. That's what made me aspire for the profession. I wanted to be involved in it, specially the software - the coding, testing, studying, whatever else. Basically, I'm a nerd. But reality is harsher and often more disappointing than fantasy. My first job and my current one completely and utterly killed any sort of passion I had for the profession. I was squeezed dry with nothing left to give... and I feel so lost. I've been asking myself the past few months - Where do I go? What should I do?My first job was a software dev in a small 50+ company. They say your first job out of college is always an experience, for good or ill, which I agree. I learned a lot and realized some things about myself. I made great memories with my former colleagues. However, more than a year, I was forced to consider the decision to leave due to several reasons - I love coding as much as the next guy but the company is too disorganized. We had to change tech stack twice in just a few months. I also got somewhat disillusioned at the realization that projects never truly end - I love learning as much as the next guy, but all the endless studying that ends up becoming obsolete too quickly... got to me somewhat. It's weird given why I wanted to become a dev in the first place, but it feels like, in a sense, I developed a depression in futility. It's like none of things I did would matter in the next few months. I would've been fine with it. But it's too quickly in my opinion...My second job was in a corporate bank as an SRE junior officer. I like how organized it is. How much less pressure there is on me. I can safely take a Leave when necessary without the threat of on-call. Odd because this job IS an on-call. High salary. Great benefits. I also thought trying a different job might grant me new perspective. Switching from development to operations. It's not a total career switching, but it's different enough.I was optimistic... and got punished for it. After I got regularized, my workload gradually increased. I can normally handle it but the issue is the way things happened.I currently live in a solo apartment, on-call hybrid setup (just this month, I had to work outside my hours many times, some on weekends). There's so much to learn, so much to do, so much juggle... I *can't*. I can't keep up. I realized a fundamental fact about myself - I'm not a great multitasker. I'm a deep thinker (which is why I aspired to be a dev in the first place). I can multi-task, but not so often and not so fast-paced. It's not sustainable. And now, I'm falling apart.My routine was ruined. I don't eat as much. I have inconsistent sleep hours (too few or too much sleep). I don't even leave my apartment in the weekends because I'm too tired and I have housework to do. The salary is great but I doubt it's worth how disorganized I've become. I've become obsessed with completing my tasks. I don't respond to my parents' calls and messages anymore. It hasn't even been a year and I'm already crushed under pressure.Things became so bad my work performance plummeted - lapses in judgement, slower memory, increasingly ""closed-off"" behavior, breathing problems, headaches, constant exhaustion... I pretty much decided to screw it and go home this weekend. I want to see my family and de-stress. But I know fully well that won't be enough.I don't know what to do. I want to job hop but even THAT is an effort in itself in my current situation. I'm too tired for it. I took Leave once a month, but it's not enough.I made enough savings and my family is not financially struggling. My sister already has a job and graduating in a month or two. I feel guilty for the idea nonetheless because I'll become a burden and is using them to cushion me, but I'm so lost.I also don't know where I want to go, what I want to do. Do I leave IT profession entirely? Or is it a case of having terrible work-life balance and hope the next one would be the golden goose? I'm being pessimistic right now and believe that's just perpetuating the cycle.I'm at a point where I'd probably be happy with a lower paying job with less stress and pressure on studying off-hours like my experiences forced on me.",5,0.67,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l01qc5/i_dont_know_if_it_profession_is_for_me_anymore_i/,2025-05-31 16:51:58,2025-06-01 01:58:25

1kx27zb,What should I study/do to improve myself as a backend engineer ?,jetfire2K,cscareerquestions,"I'm currently working as a junior full-stack developer, but I’ve realized that I enjoy backend development much more. Over the past few months, I’ve been focusing on backend fundamentals to deepen my understanding and prepare for interviews. I’ve revisited and studied in depth key topics like SQL, databases, system design, object-oriented programming, design patterns, relevant networking concepts and important backend (middleware, authentication, authorization, etc...) most of which I had already studied at university. I've also studied lots of interview questions as a way to make sure I didn't miss any core concepts or information regarding those topics.I practice LeetCode regularly and my resume is in good shape, not exceptional at all since I only have 9 months of work experience, zero internships and 0 unique projects but what I do have is well written.Right now, I feel a bit lost on what to pursue next. I’ve gone through several backend roadmaps and found that I’m familiar with most topics (I'm not familiar with Kafka/RabbitMQ for example but that's about the only core thing I found that I didn't know about in the roadmaps) to some degree. For example, I use Docker at work but have never built a container from scratch. I know Redis is used for caching, but I’ve only interacted with it indirectly — I’m aware it’s there but haven’t configured or used it myself.I wouldn’t call myself an expert, and while I’m willing to dive deeper into tools or concepts if the need arises, I don’t want to study things “just to know them.” Recently, I’ve shifted my mindset to studying topics that genuinely interest me (with the exception of LeetCode, unfortunately). This approach has helped me avoid burnout and actually enjoy learning, I’ve had fun practicing some complex SQL queries and exploring system design lately as an example.Some options I’ve considered:* Learning AWS: I’ve only had minimal exposure to AWS. While it's useful and often mentioned in job listings, I don’t feel drawn to it, especially since I’m unlikely to use it in personal projects.* Building personal projects: I struggle to come up with backend-focused ideas that I’m genuinely excited about. Most of my current projects aren’t particularly unique. I tend to use AI for frontend work because I don’t enjoy it, but I’d prefer to avoid relying on AI in personal projects as the goal is to improve my skills.* Exploring Java & Spring Boot: Since I primarily use the MERN stack, learning Java Spring Boot could open up more job opportunities. I’ve considered making projects with it and creating two tailored resumes (one for Node.js, one for Java). However, the idea of learning a whole new stack solely for the resume is demotivating — it feels like something I have to do, not something I want to do. I’ve also heard it’s better to stick to one stack and get really good at it, and while I’m not an expert in Node.js, I know it well enough to build things and fill gaps as I go.* Learning React.js: This is probably the last thing I want to do which is to learn proper frontend to qualify as full stack engineer instead of using AI for frontend, I really enjoyed frontend at work because it had minimal css and minimal design implementation, most of the time I was working on things related to logic.

1kwwy5g,"Hate working in banks, wanna bust out",billytimmy123,cscareerquestions,"Excuse me if I come across as whining, immature and/or petty. My thoughts are all over the place. I have been working for a large bank for nearly 4.5+ years up until now, ever since I graduated from college in May 2020. I was working in a Teradata Dev role nearly 4 years and internally transitioned to on Observability Engineering role about 2 months ago. I primarily accepted the opportunity to switch internally because it was offering a fat pay raise in my base comp, and I didn’t want to pigeonhole myself in one tech stack and get chance to learn new skills in the observability world and I also thought this role would be less red tape as my previous role.But now 2ish months into my current role, I can see similar patterns of corporate BS from my prior role: shaky communication with scrum masters, shitty documentation, lack of documentation for critical initiatives, a bit of unclear direction in certain tasks I’m working on, and being thrown into tasks without additional support, slow traction and approval for in POCs which my manager said would be in the pipelines, SREs trying to dump their work on Engineering side. Amidst this, I feel like I’m kinda forced and forcing myself to just maintain the optics of seeming like I’m doing work(proposing new initiatives, exploring self initiated POCs to bring to table, partaking in meetings, asking questions, engaging in code reviews/pull request reviews and trying to do the work assigned me to even if it entails some level of handholding). My team manager and tech leads who interviewed me , I clearly told them I don’t have experience in this stack being used in this role , and despite that they still offered the position and for the most part I’d say I’m pretty active in ramping up quickly and continuing to learn the tech stack used in this role. But right now my scrum master is kinda gate keeping some of the deliverables in our engineering team and I feel he’s sorta pushing tasks to me which he wants to be prioritized more heavily , but those certain tasks they’re kinda outta my reach and there’s very limited internal support to lean onto and shadow along side with them. All in all, I really came excited into this new role to really be plugged in to high impact work, with little to no corporate BS, red tape , crystal clear communication, and tasks where new onboarded folks can gradually pick up and ramp . But right now I feel like I’m thrown into a deep end and barely floating and treading water. I feel like even though I’ve delivered some tasks and my tech leads are supportive, my scrum master assigns certain in which there’s no meaningful documentation on nor internal support and I can’t seem to move much forward without butting heads into him (in a neutral manner)Overall what I’m trying to convey is , I feel like shit and I think I’m going to be perceived as a phony , regardless of how proactively I’m putting effort in.This is really taxing and taking a toll on my confidence in how I can deliver in a highly regulated ass environment like banking. Id really like to jump ship by next 4ish-6ish months by the end of the year and would love to work outside a banking environment , preferably a startup or industry outside of banking altogether.I need help fam. Idk what I just spilled. For those of whom were in similar situation or circumstances as me, what did you do ? Did you move out to a different industry altogether or a startup ? Is it possible to avoid these in a startup",5,0.73,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kwwy5g/hate_working_in_banks_wanna_bust_out/,2025-05-27 19:51:18,2025-06-01 01:58:25
1kwwcy0,Pigeonhole question,BrbGettinCoffee1sec,cscareerquestions,"I have reached 2yoe working on a hardware focused company as a software developer. My primary language is C/C++ and some python for data analysis. At the time of performance reviews and promotions I was at 1yr 6mos so was not selected to the next level. I was then talking with my fiance and it seems like most jobs I see available are frontend/backend using Javascript, react, Django, etc. I do enjoy the work I do and the product I work on as the code is used on hardware which is really neat and fulfilling. My role is safe since it is a smaller company but if I ever want to switch paths I think it will be difficult. For example if companies require 2+yoe on web development or database knowledge, I will not have any experience on my resume to showcase that.I guess my question is, would it be a good idea to brush up on my full stack and leetcode to round out my experience? Or what other jobs require C/C++ development? Would this be robotics and other hardware focused companies?

1kye9d1,Undergrad in US vs. Australia for CS,andy_fs,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone.I'm an Indonesian international student planning to pursue a B.S. in computer science and I'm hoping to eventually work abroad. I've been accepted to the University of New South Wales (Sydney), University of Maryland, UW-Madison, and NYU.I understand that the US offers the best opportunities in terms of building a career in tech, but on the other hand, I see that Australia's visa process is far more friendly towards international graduates looking to stay for work. This is on top of the added immigration uncertainty and concerns about safety with regards recent events in the States.I have to add that I'm young and inexperienced, and that I have very little knowledge about immigration or the state of things in either country. I'd appreciate any insight - whether job prospects, quality of life, to how realistic it is to stay after graduation.Thanks!",2,0.54,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kye9d1/undergrad_in_us_vs_australia_for_cs/,2025-05-29 15:50:41,2025-06-01 01:58:25

But, there were speculation regarding the overflow of people into these fields ( ML researchers, S/W devs etc and i dont have a nick for web dev).

Ik cloud architect is one of them but they are mostly for experienced individuals.
