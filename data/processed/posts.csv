1n1hy4g,How do you handle your BI setup when users constantly want to drill-down on your datasets?,JustASimpleDE,dataengineering,"Background: We are a retailer with hundreds of thousands of items. We are heavily invested in databricks and power biProblem: Our business users want to drilldown, slice, and re-aggregate across upc, store, category, department, etc. it’s the perfect usecase for a cube, but we don’t have that. Our data model is too large to fit entirely into power bi memory, even with vertipaq compression and 400gb of memory. For reference, we are somewhere between 750gb-1tb depending on compression. The solution to this point is direct query on an XL SQL warehouse which is essentially running nonstop due to the SLAs we have. This is costing a fortune. Solutions thought of:- Pre aggregation: great in thought, unfortunately too many possibilities to pre calculate - Onelake: Microsoft of course suggested this to our leadership, and though this does enable fitting the data ‘in memory’, it would be expensive as well, and I personally don’t think power bi is designed for drill downs- Clickhouse: this seems like it might be better designed for the task at hand, and can still be integrated into power bi. Columnar, with some heavy optimizations. Open source is a plus. Also considered: Druid, SSAS (concerned about long term support plus other things)Im not sure if I’m falling for marketing with Clickhouse or if it really would make the most sense here. What am I missing? EDIT: i appreciate the thoughts this far. The theme of responses has been to pushback or change process.

I’ve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what [r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/) thinks.The basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:1. Download and extract bill data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS3. In parallel, extract member data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) API, concatenate, upload to GCS4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.A few observations / questions that came to mind:\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?https://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I’m not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it’s applicable to my day job.Thank you if you’ve made it this far.

My passion lies in data and AI, not necessarily in core engineering or people management. My background leans more toward the “type B” data engineer, I have an analytical, business-focused mindset and a love for working with data, rather than being deep into systems or heavy software engineering.Lately, I’ve been considering a few possible paths:* Pivoting into product management for data/AI products* Transitioning into AI engineering and building more ML-focused skill sets* Becoming a more well-rounded data engineer by leaning into software engineering skills* Or perhaps focusing on strategy and leadership roles where I can influence how businesses create value with data rather than being hands-on with execution.Ultimately, I know I want to become a leader in data or AI in 5 years issh (head of data, director of AI team), someone shaping direction and strategy rather than just pipelines, but I’m still unclear on what the right stepping stones are to get there.If anyone has been through a similar crossroads, or has insights on the best ways to transition toward more strategic, data-driven leadership roles, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.Thanks in advance!",24,0.89,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mznsrq/career_path_after_senior_data_engineer_seeking/,2025-08-25 11:22:58,2025-08-30 01:23:47

Dip in and out of Leetcode for SQL and Python3. Finish setting up Iceberg in my K8s cluster4. Learn about different databases (duckdb etc) 5.

This approach works, but it’s error-prone — for example, manual updates or overlooked changes sometimes don’t update these columns, causing data to be missed in our loads.On the other hand, there are many streaming CDC solutions (Debezium, Kafka Connect, AWS DMS) that consume binlogs, but they feel overkill for small teams and require substantial operational overhead.This leads me to wonder: why isn’t there a **more lightweight, batch-oriented binlog reader and parser** that could be used for incremental processing? Are there any existing tools or libraries that support this use case that I might be missing?

Catalog (Silver): Datasets people are going to use. These are not always just whatever is from the source data, it can start to be things like joining different data sources together to create more complex stuff, but they are generally not report specific (you can create whatever reports off of them).4. Reporting (Gold): Datasets that are more report specific.

(1 TB of storage costs 20 USD/month, whereas 1 TB of processed costs 6.25 USD and sometimes forcing BQ to utilize partition is not so straightforward (but we use capacity based pricing to utilize slots).So my question is, has any body crossed the Rubicon and made this change ?",12,1.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n0el52/bigquery_dwh_get_rid_of_scd2_tables_daily/,2025-08-26 06:37:24,2025-08-30 01:23:47

1n31ztv,Apache Pulsar experiment: solving PostgreSQL multi-tenant pain but...,ephemeral404,dataengineering,"**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).Now that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.### What I liked about Pulsar:* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).### What's painful about Pulsar:* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debugWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. P.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost).

Features like materialized view or aggregating mergetrees seems also super interesting to us.We have made the decision to incluse CH into our infrastructure, knowing that it's gonna be a key part for BI mostly (metrics coming from sensors mostly, with quite a lot of functional logic with time windows or contexts and so on).The question is: how do we host this?There isnt a single chance I can convince my boss to use a managed service, so we will use resources from a cloud provider.What are you experiences with self-hosted CH? Would you recommend a replicated infrastructure with multiple containers based on docker-compose ? Do you think kubernetes is a good idea?Also, if there are some downsides or drawbacks to clickhouse we should consider I am definitely up for some feedbacks on it![Edit] our data volume is currently about 30GB/day, using Clickhouse it goes down to ~1GB/dayThank you very much!",4,0.76,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mzx5ei/selfhosted_clickhouse_recommendations/,2025-08-25 17:38:06,2025-08-30 01:23:47

That means your Pinecone index lags behind—new events, chats, or documents aren’t searchable until the next sync. For live systems (support bots, background agents), this delay hurts.To solve this I've developed a streaming pipeline that takes data directly from Kafka, generates embeddings on the fly, and upserts them into Pinecone continuously. With Kafka to pinecone template , you can plug in your Kafka topic and have Pinecone index updated with fresh data. - Agents and RAG apps respond with the latest context - Recommendations systems adapt instantly to new user activityCheck out how you can run the data pipeline with minimal configuration and would like to know your thoughts and feedback.

The problem is that everything is urgent so it’s impossible to prioritize.-A lot of these requests is just manual crap that no one else wants to do.-A lot of deck formatting/power point monkey work where I spend more time aligning logos than doing actual analysis.-Since I’m the only data person, no one really understands my struggles or can support my tasks, and when something that is easy on paper but tricky to implement, I cannot really easily pushback or manage expectations.-Due to this chaotic environment, a lot of times I feel very stressed and overwhelmed.-In summary, I feel more like a glorified commercial assistant or data-ticket monkey than a proper (aspiring) data professional.That said, I do get some exposure to more interesting data topics. I collaborate with the central data team on things like dbt models, Power BI dashboards or Airflow orchestration, which has given me some hands-on experience with the modern data stack.On top of that, I’m currently doing a Master’s in Data Science/AI which I’ll hopefully finish in less than a year.

My dad's a programmer and dealt with carpal tunnel in his 40s, so I'm trying to be proactive about this stuff.Here's what I've started doing that seems to help:Taking breaks: Set a timer for every 45 minutes, get up and stretch for 5 minutes. Actually doing this consistently has been harder than I expected but it makes a difference. This is necessary, the rest will pay off in the ling run guys. Wrist stretches: Found some good ones on YouTube. The prayer stretch and wrist flexor stretches seem to help the most.Better posture: Raised my monitor so I'm not hunching over. Best way to go about it is a standing desk but I don't have enough to invest in an automatic one (Magnus Pro looks so so good!) yet so I haven't gotten one yet. On the other hand, I am still working on keeping my shoulders relaxed, the anxiety I feel constantly keeps them clenched.Split keyboard: This was probably the biggest change. Switched to a NocFree Lite about 4 months ago and honestly my wrists feel way more natural now. Takes some getting used to but the angle just feels right. NocFree Lite is just so light and easy to carry around. You'd think that the carrying part was annoying because of the 2 piece product but they provided a carrying bag with the board as well. Proper mouse positioning: Moved my mouse closer and have been on a lookout for a vertical mouse. I've been checking out the Anker wireless vertical ergonomic mouse as well as the Logitech MX vertical, which one is better? Any other ergonomic mouse that I should check out?Anyone else dealing with this early in their programming journey? What's worked for you?

1mz75nx,Why do I Learn Math Better When Programming Than When I'm in School?,aerialdoesreddit,learnprogramming,"I'm not sure if I'm the only person this applies to, but it's certainly very weird for me. For context, I am a sophomore, and in my two math classes Honors Algebra 2 and Honors Geometry, the concepts in there are not exactly impossible to understand, but a bit more difficult to grasp. However, when I learn mathematics for programming, it's much easier compared to math inside school. For more context, I am an ML Engineer, and I've learned much harder topics such as matrices, partial derivatives, derivatives, vectors, and overall just a good amount of calculus and linear algebra for programming. Although it's obvious that I'm not going into incredible depth with those topics, and it's only a basic understanding for what I need, I have created an entire AI from scratch before, and I'm creating another one with a shitty Scratch ripoff called MIT App Inventor, and for any AI nerds out there, that is not an easy task. You must be proficient in your understanding of programming & math, so how the hell can I do that but I can't learn what a domain and range is??I'm not exactly sure why this happens to me, but it certainly is weird. I should also mention that I learn much better when watching YouTube videos on math compared to learning math in school, so maybe it's just the way I learn. I have an Honors Algebra 2 test on domain and range and a bunch of other things tomorrow such as like increasing intervals and stuff like that, so I'm going to try and figure out a way that I can implement those concepts into programming somehow. If anyone wants an update, I'll post it here. Edit: I tried implementing programming into my studying, but by the time I did I had already understood everything so there was no need (I'm not sure that makes sense, but when studying how to implement it into code I just eventually learned it so there was no need to..? It's hard to explain.) I was also learning on little sleep & food for the past few weeks or so, so that's probably another factor that should've been mentioned before.

I'm a slow learner with severe anxiety and often surrounded by young people (often men) that are way ahead of me. This ofc shouldn't be a request for reassurance, but I'm pinning my hopes on feelings less insecure once I've become sql certified. I'm hoping for a \*click\* that hasn't happened yet. A half year in front-end, someone with experience said 'perhaps it's not for you if it hasn't clicked yet'. Beside it hurting, I'm also wondering if I'm not realistic, but I really think the job fits me despite that learning it is a struggle.

1n30ku6,What do you think??,No0bC0d3R,learnprogramming,"In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?This is a surprisingly controversial question in the programming world because different people value different aspects of coding when it comes to a beginner’s first step. Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it’s simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.There are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.Beyond that, there’s the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they’ll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?The answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.So, the debate is not just “Which language is best?” but also “What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”",6,0.87,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1n30ku6/what_do_you_think/,2025-08-29 07:07:29,2025-08-30 01:23:49

Now I’m wondering with all the AI hype and the tough job market if it’s still worth going deep into software engineering, because ideally I’d like to land a dev job (preferably web or mobile) while also launching my own apps on the side. For context, I know Python/JS/C/C++, built some games in Godot, made a Chrome extension and some simple web apps (mainly using django), done a fair bit of LeetCode, and I’m already comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS/SQL. The thing is I’m not sure how to take it to the next level — is it just “keep building projects” or is there more to it?

I was thinking about wether I could build a free alternative to Synthesia, a midi visualizing learning tool for the piano, so I gave it a whirl, and it turned out to be much more fun (and painful) than I anticipated.

The most painful thing was probalby getting the synthesized audio and the visuals to sync, it took me weeks to figure out and it felt great :D I wanted to share this for anyone who might be struggling right now with a personal project or feel like they've hit a wall, sometimes it just takes time.

1my45y1,"Reminder: Software engineering is still one of the happiest careers in 2024/2025, based on data.",cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"This subreddit has a huge FAANG obsession, and it completely distorts the perception of software engineering. Every other post seems to be about insane comp packages, grueling interviews, layoffs, or burnout stories. But if you look at the actual data, the reality for most developers is completely different.[Resume.io (2025)](https://resume.io/blog/which-professions-are-the-happiest-at-work) found that 87 percent of software developers reported being “very happy” in their jobs, the highest of any profession surveyed. [Career.io (2024)](https://career.io/career-advice/careers-that-make-americans-happiest) analyzed nearly 756,000 job ratings and found software developers among the most satisfied six figure earners, with a median salary around 130K. [Market.biz (2025)](https://market.biz/job-satisfaction-statistics/#job-satisfaction-statistics-in-different-industries) reported that 74 percent of tech professionals worldwide are satisfied with their jobs. So why does this subreddit feel so negative compared to those numbers? Because the voices dominating here are FAANG engineers or startup employees, and their experiences are extreme. Life inside FAANG is often miserable. Long hours, constant pressure to ship, endless internal politics, and the looming threat of layoffs make it feel like a treadmill you can never step off. Software is the company’s entire product, so everything you do is under constant scrutiny and pressure. Burnout is common, and that is exactly what this sub amplifies.Meanwhile, the average developer lives a completely different life, and that is what drives the high happiness statistics. Most are not in San Francisco or New York. They live in mid sized cities or suburbs where their salary goes much further. They are not chasing the next billion dollar app. They work at hospitals, insurance companies, banks, logistics firms, or government agencies. The work is steady, respected, and meaningful, even if it never makes headlines.They make 100K to 130K, comfortably above the national median. Their hours are closer to forty a week. They get PTO. Their managers are competent but not tyrannical. And because software is a support function rather than the company’s core product, the pressure to grind nonstop is low. That is why surveys consistently show high satisfaction.The quiet majority of developers who live this life rarely post here. Nobody makes a thread to say “My job is stable, I like my team, I worked normal hours, and I had a great weekend hiking.” The loud minority who post are often FAANG engineers or startup refugees talking about their misery. That is why this subreddit can make software engineering seem miserable, even though for most people it is not.The truth is that chasing FAANG is often what ruins people’s perception of software engineering. It is the exception, not the rule. The average developer is happy, balanced, and living a peaceful, stable, and well-compensated life. Even in 2024 and 2025, software engineering remains one of the happiest and most rewarding professions you can choose, as long as you understand that most developers do not live the FAANG nightmare that dominates this subreddit.",705,0.87,163,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1my45y1/reminder_software_engineering_is_still_one_of_the/,2025-08-23 15:18:51,2025-08-30 01:23:50
1n2lcmr,Laid off after 5 years at Microsoft. Need help landing a new role.,WahooWhatt,cscareerquestions,"5 years at Microsoft out of college. It’s been a few months and I haven’t received any offers. I was wondering what helped to those that have had success. Interviews seem to go well, made it to several final rounds. It got to the point where multiple interviewers told me they would start using some of my methods in their own work (SLA management and stuff). And then I get ghosted. By the recruiter and all that interviewed me. So I never get any feedback on what I could do better. The only interviews I’ve gotten were from recruiters reaching out. My resume and cold applying has gotten me nowhere. And this is after several resume reviews and refactors. Does anyone know what could help me here? Even seemingly successful interviews go nowhere.

1n2ap76,Why are so many Software Engineers burnt out?,SomeRandomCSGuy,cscareerquestions,"Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.I can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I’d also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I’d ever stand out in any way.What surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.That shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.I know it’s tough because “just do more tickets” feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.Curious if anyone else has felt the same?

I want to share what I learned over 10+ years that could save you from making the same mistakes I did.The Reality Check:When I started, I thought being a good developer meant:\- Memorising every framework and language\- Writing perfect code from day one\- Working insane hours to ""prove myself""\- Never admitting I didn't know somethingAll of this was wrong and held me back for years.What Actually Matters:For Job Applications:You don't need to meet 100% of job requirements. I got interviews, meeting 60-70% of the requirements. Companies hire for potential and problem-solving ability, not just current skills.For Learning:Stop trying to learn everything. Focus on core concepts (data structures, algorithms, design patterns) and learn specific technologies as you need them. The best skill is learning how to learn quickly.For Career Growth:You'll never feel ""ready"" for the next level. I spent 2 years over-preparing for senior roles I was already qualified for. Apply anyway, volunteer for challenging projects anyway, give that tech talk anyway.For Productivity:Working 45 focused hours produces better results than 70 exhausted hours. Burnout isn't a badge of honour, it's a career killer. Take breaks, have hobbies, maintain relationships outside tech.For Code Quality:Nobody cares about your clever algorithms. They care about solutions that work and code that's maintainable.

HAF had earlier tried to intervene in the Cisco case but was denied by California state courtsFour key outcomesThe court’s 31-page judgement outlined four major outcomes:> Affirmation of state authority: The CRD has the constitutional right to enforce anti-discrimination laws, including against caste-based discrimination.> Legitimacy of CRD actions: The lawsuit against Cisco Systems, a major California tech firm, was found to be a legitimate public enforcement action, not a private legal dispute.> Rejection of religious freedom argument: The court ruled that the CRD’s enforcement did not violate any First Amendment rights of Hindu Americans, dismissing the argument as “entirely unpersuasive.”> No standing for HAF: The court held that HAF does not represent all Hindu Americans and failed to show concrete links to the broader community. “Plaintiffs have shown no facts demonstrating actual activities, engagement, or funding mechanisms,” the judge wrote.https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/us-federal-court-backs-californias-fight-against-caste-discrimination",343,0.89,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n20hx8/us_federal_court_backs_californias_fight_against/,2025-08-28 02:28:07,2025-08-30 01:23:50

1n1cgjh,"Hundreds of Applicants, One Role: A Tech Hiring Bloodbath",CrazyStuffy,cscareerquestions,"I work at a tech company in London, UK, and we recently opened up a junior developer position, which we posted online. Within minutes, applications started pouring in, tens of them right away, and within just two hours, we had hundreds. The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.This really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there’s a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it’s unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.If you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between £30k to £40k.\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company’s internal recruitment information on the internet.\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best.

What should I do?",The_Beep,cscareerquestions,"Before I start ranting, this situation is my fault. It's been over a year since I graduated in Computer Science. I have little to nothing to show for it. I know the job market is ultra-competitive right now but it's still my responsibility to work with what I have, and I haven't been.I realized during the five years I've studied Computer Science that even though I love video-games and thought robotics was alright (I did robotics programming in highschool & during my senior project, mentored by AmazonRobotics), I have no confidence in programming, and frankly, problem-solving in general. Everything is so reliant on connecting/social engineering now that my anti-social ass hasn't been doing. My parents have gotten people from my church and extended family, to give advice to me and frankly I've mostly been ignoring them when they repeat the same stuff I've been hearing for a while now. I apply to X position a family/family friend tells me to apply to, I get rejected/ghosted, repeat ad-nauseam until I stopped applying months down the line out of frustration, lying to them saying ""yeah I applied to plenty of places"". Confidence is at an all-time low.Today my mom yells at me on how much I've been freeloading and threatens to kick me out, and I couldn't talk back at her because I know she's right. **For the short-term,** I have $2,700 in my bank account, pretty much nothing to live on my own for. I hate being around my family but really want a remote position to show to my parents ASAP, so I don't get the boot. At this point I don't care what field it is, it doesn't have to be CS/programming--I really want to get a remote job in SOMETHING I can tolerate, in the next couple weeks or so while I try and gather my bearings for my future, or else I am likely getting kicked out. Preferably something that doesn't get too in the way of me studying for certs.**For the long-term,** If it helps, again, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, and am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification because I figured maybe I can try the IT space if I hate programming so much (already paid for a voucher, planning to take the exam in \~2 weeks). Unfortunately had no real work experience/internships in the Comp. Sci. field as I was too busy just trying not to drop out; took me 5 years to graduate. I've worked Doordash for a couple months using the family car, until my parents forbade me from doing so (for asinine reasons but it's their car so I can't talk back). I thought I was passionate in programming, I'm not. I have pretty much no passion in anything except games and anime, both industries sound awful to actually work in. Last week I started brainstorming a Unity game since I randomly thought it would be nice to work on something, anything, and put it on GitHub. **I'm well-aware that my story is not rare. Again, this is my fault. I've been too passive, and arrogant. But today I might as well ask for advice, both for the short and long-term.

1my8mct,What’s with the elitism?,yolthrice,cscareerquestions,"When someone at work doesn’t know something, I don’t judge them for that. If I can, I explain it to them in a way that hopefully makes sense to them, so that they can take the information and run with it. Most people don’t operate this way, though. What I see instead is this sense of, “I’m better than you because you don’t know X, and I do”. It’s like people are just waiting, frothing at the mouth for their chance to elevate themselves over another person, instead of just helping that person learn, or at the very least not shaming and degrading them for not knowing something. The reality is that many things are easily teachable and once you get it, you get it. Most people can learn if the information is presented to them in the right way. So why isn’t that approach adopted in today’s working world, to build happier, healthier teams? What is with all the elitism? Don’t these people realize that the second someone else knows more than they do, that person is then considered “better” by the rules of this stupid game?

1mz81ay,How to upskill as a mid to senior level software engineer?,gunk_of_gamers,cscareerquestions,"I am a backend software engineer with 6.5 years of experience. I think that skills as an engineer are becoming dull everyday as the projects in my team are not interesting and I have been mainly getting migration/maintenance work despite my protests. Also, I am not getting enough opportunities to interview for other companies because of the shit job market. I want to upgrade and sharpen my skills as a dev and improve my resume at the same time, my resume since my current work is not anything too special to highlight. But I am confused on what direction I need to take in order to improve as a mid level to senior level developer. I don’t think building some boilerplate projects like a to do list or a note taking app would be helpful for my skills or resume, since I am not at entry level(though I doubt if it even works for them these days). Nor would leetcode. I do study system design on the side, which might help me if I get some interesting work or while interviewing, but it does not help in strengthening my resume. What should I do then in order to get noticed more for opportunities while also improving my skills? Some people have advised to build software projects to solve problems that I personally face and not some common course project. But I am completely out of ideas and inspiration to solve any issues that I might face. I can’t think of any problem that I need to desperately solve by building an app. What else should I do?

As I go through my classes though I'm finding a hard time with getting the motivation to actually code. I've met a lot of smart and wonderful people in my major and a fair share of them are very passionate and enjoy coding, whether it's reading a research paper about a specific topic they're interested in, making side projects for fun, joining a club for it, making a startup, etc. I just feel like I'm not into it as much as them and seeing this discrepancy daily makes me wonder if computer science just isn't for me. I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.Maybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.So I guess my question is, how do you know when computer science as a career just isn't for you?

I'd take a bit of time each week to dig into the technologies I was using at work to try and find non-functional areas we could improve in as I was grinding out functional stuff. over time this built up to an okay understanding of the SDLC overall.there are plenty of areas I'm still not very strong, but at this point I have enough experience with enough different things that its relatively uncommon i encounter problems totally out of band from what I've seen before, and have a fairly decent understanding of many of the popular technologies used today across a wide span of problems. Ive worked in a lot of different domains over my career. ive generally left most of the parsing of those domains to domain experts. sure, I'd pick up things here or there, enough exposure to particular verticals will do that, but I generally focused my time and energy on developing my tech knowledge, as it is more portable between jobs than domain specific stuff.that said, I can now see the limits of this approach. I've been working in the same shop now for four years and I wish I had spent a little bit of time each week better learning the domain I am working in from first principles. I dont feel like I am lacking in technical ability. I have enough technical tools at my disposal. I feel I am lacking in domain specific insight, and so are the others surrounding me. If i had been studying my current domain a little bit more here and there over the past 4 years, I suspect I wouldn't feel this way. I suspect I would be able to crack some of the tough nut problems we've been dealing with sensibly.looking back, there were plenty of times in past roles where I wasnt able to see the forest for the trees as a result of a little too much domain blindness & outsourcing of that knowledge to others who perhaps didn't know the domain all that well either.anyways, the advice I wish I had gotten was to carve out a bit of time for myself to learn the domain I was working in outside of the context of tech and programming. SWE skills are important, and most of the time we can learn the bits and pieces of a domain we need at the time, but some insights are locked behind both a general understanding of the tech and the domain.",30,0.81,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mz307z/15_years_experience_something_i_wish_i_started/,2025-08-24 18:13:45,2025-08-30 01:23:50

I have been working in tech support since 2019, primary in the web-hosting space. While it's always been a grind with the nonstop chats/calls/tickets, I legitimately enjoyed it at first for the first two years or so. My first company was awesome. They are one of the best web hosts to work for. I was a level 2 tech and a top performer, easily knocking out 80+ chats a day. My manager would constantly tell me how good of a job I was doing. Despite that, I struggled to afford living in the city the company was based in. I eventually asked for a raise and was offered a one thousand dollar per YEAR raise. It wasn't sustainable to keep waiting around for an actual raise, so I quit very shortly after that to move to a major cloud computing company as a cloud support engineer. I ended up hating that company almost immediately because of their lack of training, vague protocols, poor documentation and how they clearly viewed their support department as an after thought. Only 2 or 3 months out of training, they laid off 10% of their staff including me.I've since landed a different job at another web host as a support manager. I thought I would enjoy this role but truth be told I absolutely despise my job and my company. I feel that my work is meaningless and repetitive. The agents under me are basically un-coachable and uninspired. The tech debt is immense. The higher ups are too focused on pushing out half baked products that barely work. Our back end infrastructure is a nightmare. I spend most of my time troubleshooting stuff that should have been fixed years ago, yet engineering has no plans of doing so. Essentially, I'm stuck in support hell.I really like working with computers but the past three years have left me feeling so drained that I hardly have the energy to upskill and find a better, non-customer facing role. I don't like working in tech support and I don't like working in tech support management. I constantly think about working on certs to get a job as an SRE or DevOps engineer, but I'm worried that I'd find myself in the same position of not finding any satisfaction in it. Plus the tech market is so competitive now that I feel like I don't know where to even start.

I’ve got an associates degree and about two years of internship experience, but I’m still not getting callbacks. I’ve done a bunch of personal projects, but it feels like no matter how many I build, it’s never enough. Even if I can get in front of a recruiter via networking, it feels like I get shot down before getting the chance to interview.That’s what got me thinking, what kind of project actually turns heads anymore? Making a CRUD app or even building your own neural network doesn’t really seem to cut it these days. It feels like I have to use the latest AI tech (RAG for example) in some crazy way to get noticed. For context, my side projects include a Sentence Toxicity Classifier (using a RNN), a SIEM/SOAR pipeline to test things with Splunk, a Discord music bot, and a handful of other projects I thought were pretty solid. I always figured showing that I work on stuff in my own time would help me stand out, but if everyone’s doing the same, how do I actually separate myself? Do I really need to go all out and build a full blown website with the latest AI tech just to get a call from a recruiter? What projects are actually impressive in today’s job market?

1n2890a,Is it normal for managers/CEOs to always rush deployments?,Ok-Bullfrog925,cscareerquestions,"I’ve been working with a client for the past 7 years. The pay is decent and there used to be a fair amount of flexibility, but there’s always this constant rush to deploy things.Two years ago, two new devs joined the team. The client is the CEO of the company, not very technical, but he often pushes “shortcuts” to speed up development. Usually they’re hacky and add technical debt. Because he messages devs individually instead of going through a single point of contact which should be one of the devs that can convert his request into a technical solution, the result is a messy codebase where people step on each other’s toes. One of the newer devs is inexperienced and sometimes pushes changes that break other people’s work. I do code reviews on his work whenever we have time, but those are happening in a rush because I always have something that I need to deploy myself asap.On top of that, there’s never enough time to write clean code. Almost everything is for a demo or “needs to be deployed ASAP.” We start working on big changes on reporting a week before the end of the month, with the target of having it ready at the beginning of the next month. We end up doing daily production deployments on a fairly large app. This app is used by big company clients' employees, the entire marketing team which is the main activity of the company, and even manages customer relationships, so it’s not a toy project.My concern is that after 7 years, I don’t feel like I’ve gained much real experience because of the constant rush and hacky workarounds.

1n02kl3,Help - how do I take the next step without breaking?,SeniorIdiot,cscareerquestions,"\[Senior DevOps Engineer, 17 YOE\]Hi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.I'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.At work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.While management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the ""senior founder dev"" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.It has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( I've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to ""catch up"" and but I never quite get there...And outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?What I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.*tldr; my life isn't perfect, but I'm still here fighting - but there is no joy left and I've lost myself.**PS.

Learn GenAI / LLM-related development (prompt engineering, integrating LLMs into applications, fine-tuning, vector databases, RAG, etc.)2. Double down on my existing backend/dev skills – improve depth in Java/Spring Boot, testing, microservices, system design, cloud-native concepts, Kubernetes, DevOps pipelines, observability, and scaling distributed systems.Here’s my situation:* I’m not really interested in GenAI at the moment. It feels like a hype-driven bubble, and I don’t want to learn a stack just because it’s trendy.* My main focus has been building solid, scalable backend systems, and I enjoy working in that space.* I don’t mind picking up GenAI *if it becomes unavoidable in backend roles*, but I don’t want to spread myself too thin. To be clear:* I am not the type of person who chases the latest tech hype unless it directly benefits my day-to-day work.* Even though I am interested in GenAI personally, right now what I want to focus more on is being employable and relevant in the upcoming years as a Java backend developer.* I am also focusing on a specific side-hustle which I want to turn around into a full time business in the future, so I don't have the time to pursue/learn something new from the scratch unless it is absolutely necessary.My questions are:* Will I be missing out on backend job opportunities now (or in the next few years) if I don’t learn GenAI?* Is GenAI integration actually becoming a *must-have* skill for Java/Spring Boot developers, or is it still more of a niche?* From a long-term career perspective (5+ years), would I be better off becoming a stronger backend engineer with deep cloud/microservices/devops skills, or should I invest in GenAI sooner rather than later?* For those of you working in the industry — are companies actually *expecting* backend developers to know GenAI, or is it more of a nice-to-have skill for specific roles/domains?I’d love to hear from people in the industry (especially those hiring or working on enterprise systems).

Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more. I know this looks negative and lazy, but the problem is that in the last 5-10 interviews, I've literally had no notes on what I could prepare for next time as 99% of what I prepared for wasn't even related to the interview, and all the questions were framed like, ""Do you know Spring Boot? Do you know Angular?"" Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it. So, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. A bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.I don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.

1n04nxq,Want to pivot to a more quantitative role,goldenshowerexpert,cscareerquestions,"I’m 24 and I have 2YOE at a big tech company. I graduated with an above average GPA for my degree (3.4) but nothing to write home about. I don’t find software particularly fun, and I don’t see myself doing this long term. It was the only job I could get with my skill set at that point of time. I’ve always found ML to be really cool and I’ve done a research internship in this field. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get any ML engineer or data scientist jobs right out of undergrad (they wouldn’t even interview me). I suspect the lack of a graduate degree to be the reason, and many job postings I find interesting ask for or prefer one. How can I pivot to a more quantitative role from SWE. If I continue working as a SWE I’m afraid I will be stuck. I’ve been contemplating going back for a Masters but a few things irk me:1. I don’t want to pay 5 figures for a masters, and funded masters often ask for TA and research experience, which I lack. I did go to a competitive school so maybe my GPA can be contextualized — hard to say though. I am in state for Texas, and I could potentially pay for TAMU or UT for a semester and gamble on getting a TA position.2. Opportunity cost. Say I do get a masters, there’s no guarantee I will get a job in ML, and I would end up working as a SWE anyway. Minus 2 years of comp3. There’s millions of MS CS grads in the market and I would be competing with them for jobs in an already shaky market.Anyone who’s been through this song and dance want to chime in? In my company moving internally to a research role is very rare so that’s not possible. I really enjoyed my ML research and coursework, and I am open to working for a university lab as a researcher, as a pathway for a PhD. The lab I interned at has changed direction and focuses more on computational biology, the ML project was a one off I guess. So there’s no going back to that. My long term goal is doing applied ML at a company or in academia. This is highly coveted and competitive, so any input would be appreciated.",6,0.81,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n04nxq/want_to_pivot_to_a_more_quantitative_role/,2025-08-25 22:24:11,2025-08-30 01:23:50
1n2odq1,"Cant figure out my actual interest because of hyperfixation, what should I do?",Independent_Key_193,cscareerquestions,"My interest is somewhere in Computing or Electrical im sure of that but both are such vast fields that I can't decide which degree I should do bachelors in and I don't have much time to decide either.When I started researching about Computing fields I had interest in cybersecurity did alot of research became heavily obsessed about it my fyp was filled with cybersecurity stuff then after just a few days I moved onto electronics and same exact thing I became obsessed then I moved towards embedded systems then software engineering then computer engineering and now im hyperfixated on electrical engineeringThe problem is I get extremely absorbed in a topic, and then just as quickly I move on and almost forget about the last one. It doesn’t feel like a good thing especially now that I have to make such an important decision about what I should do bachelors in just a few days. I’m confused and worried about making the wrong choice, and I really don’t want to regret it later.I’d really appreciate any guidance or advice on how to approach this decision.

1n1ptom,Career break? Yay or Nay?,UpsetSong6616,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone, I would like to hear some opnions from people more experienced than me.I’ve been working at Microsoft (India) for about 5 years now. Got promoted to Senior.However, I’ve been feeling burnt out and craving a career break of 3-5 months.Would it be a wise decision to take a few months off? I plan to just spend time with my family, traveling but also studying about distributed systems in depth and prepping myself for the “second” phase of my career. Financials are not a problem. I have money saved to last me the next 5 years.My current job is great. I feel valued. Salary is great. Work hours? Well, sometimes its 12+ hours a day but that’s not the norm. It’s a never ending cycle of highs and lows. 6 hour days followed by 12 hour days and so on…But the feeling to say fuck it and chill for the next few months is so strong, I keep thinking about this question every couple of months.Has anyone here taken a career break? What was your experience like? How hard was it to break into a tech role again? If you could share your experience, it would help me a lot.Thank you!PS: if anyone needs guidance or referrals ( up till mid level SWE), DM me. I get more satisfaction through helping people out than my job tbh.",7,0.71,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n1ptom/career_break_yay_or_nay/,2025-08-27 18:58:08,2025-08-30 01:23:50
1n0t4l8,"I want to work R & D for Cinema/Camera tech companies, how can I?",CryThat8986,cscareerquestions,"[Student](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/?f=flair_name%3A%22Student%22)So to start off, i'm 20. Never worked a job before, not even McDonalds. GPA is bang average at 3.29. 3rd Year CS student, with a minor in Business (intended minor). Love movies, very passionate, write a lot in my free time, directed a couple shorts for fun (worked on a couple of other student productions as well), vice president of a film discussion club (started this semester, so its been about 2 weeks). Been Marketing chair for a student organization for one semester in my sophomore year, and now doing the same position again (took a break in between as I transferred).It suddenly dawned on me that companies like Canon, GoPro and other companies that produce technology need active software developers for research and development. My issue now is that1.) I don't have a job, not even a simple part time. I'm taking 16 credit hours, and very hard CS classes. I naturally have a learning curve in CS so it takes me longer than usual to get in to the groove and understand. The lack of ANY job, obviously makes me look bad and immediately puts me in a disadvantage2.) Only relevant CS experience is that I made a garbage GPT wrapper at a hackathon over a year ago. I also know Java and Python, but not certified in either of them.I'm feeling very hopeless because of this. My real passion is cinema, but in this day and age it's not wise to go into that field without backup. I think developing technology for cameras and other tools that filmmakers will end up using is something that can keep me content and fulfilled. Am I doomed? Can I mainly crack an internship by Summer 2026?

1n2xizh,Feel like I might've thrown away an internship opportunity,Not-The-Last,cscareerquestions,"Part of me knows this is an overreaction but part of me is also very worried.I'm just about to enter my 3rd year of university in this fall and I had just about thrown away all hope of landing an internship this late in the fall but on Wednesday I got a call from an IT internship position I applied to. I had applied to it back in July but got ghosted despite 2 assessments, but I the posting reappeared (maybe the person they offered the role to declined it?) so I applied again and I guess they remembered me from that first time. So they call me and ask me if I'm still interested, if I have a means to get there, what my salary expectations are, if I'd be able to work on-site every day, etc. I keep it simple, say yes to everything, keep the salary expectation humble because I do still want this job and it's entry-level. And then they say ""when would you be able to start? Would you be available to start next week?"" (week of September 1st) to which I reply ""I don't think I'd be able to start next week, but I can start next next week, the week of the 8th"". Then we wrapped it up and they said I'd be hearing from them very soon. I didn't think much of it at first but nothing is REALLY stopping me from starting next week. I have some commitments but they could be postponed. I feel like I'm overthinking but I can't help but think about them going with somebody else who *could* start next week. Like that one line sabotaged this whole operation.That being said, I looked through my recent calls and they had actually called me multiple times, on Monday and Tuesday (I tend not to pick up random calls). But I feel like if there were multiple other people they could've hired, they would've called me once, and then moved on to the next guy after I didn't pick up. But I find that equally as unlikely because this is cs and they must have tons of candidates. I know this reads as rambly but I'm just really holding out for this internship!",4,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n2xizh/feel_like_i_mightve_thrown_away_an_internship/,2025-08-29 04:05:52,2025-08-30 01:23:50
