1o0kyd0,I think we need other data infrastructure for AI (table-first infra),Fabulous_Pollution10,dataengineering,"hi! I do some data consultancy for llm startups. They do llm finetuning for different use cases, and I build their data pipelines. I keep running into the same pain: just a pile of big text files. Files and object storage look simple, but in practice they slow me down. One task turns into many blobs across different places – messy. No clear schema. Even with databases, small join changes break things. The orchestrator can’t “see” the data, so batching is poor, retries are clumsy, and my GPUs sit idle.My friend helped me rethink the whole setup. What finally worked was treating everything as tables with transactions – one namespace, clear schema for samples, runs, evals, and lineage. I snapshot first, then measure, so numbers don’t drift. Queues are data-aware: group by token length or expected latency, retry per row. After this, fewer mystery bugs, better GPU use, cleaner comparisons.He wrote his view here: [https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra](https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra)Does anyone here run AI workloads on transactional, table-first storage instead of files?

There was basically no documentation at all, and the schema was a mess, moreover, the database was huge, thousands of fields and hundred of tables. Here are some examples of bad design: * No foreign keys defined between tables that clearly had relationships.* Some tables had a column that just stored the *name* of another table to indicate a link (instead of a proper relation).* Other tables existed in total isolation, but were obviously meant to be connected.To deal with it, I literally had to spend my weeks opening each table, looking at the data, and trying to guess its purpose, then writing comments and documentation as I went along.So my questions are:* Is this kind of challenge (analyzing and documenting undocumented databases) something you often encounter in data engineering / data science work?* If you’ve faced this situation before, how did you approach it?

1nx25u5,Best GUI-based Cloud ETL/ELT,PepperAffectionate25,dataengineering,"I work in a shop where we used to build data warehouses with Informatica PowerCenter. We moved to a cloud stack years back and implemented these complex transformations into Scala in Databricks although we have been doing more and more Pyspark. Over time, we've had issues deploying new gold-tier models in our medallion architecture. Whenever there are highly complex transformations, it takes us a lot longer to develop and deploy. Data quality is lower. Even with lineage graphs, we cannot answer quickly and well for complex derivations if someone asks how we came up with a value in a field. Nothing we do on our new stack compared to the speed and quality when we used to have a good GUI-based ETL tool. Basically myself and 1 other team member could build data warehouses quickly and after moving to the cloud, we have tons of engineers and it takes longer with worse results.What we are considering now is to continue using Databricks for ingest and maybe bronze/silver layers and when building gold layer models with complex transformations, we use a GUI and cloud-based ETL/ELT solution. We want something like the old PowerCenter. Matillion was mentioned. Also, Informatica has a cloud solution.Any advice?

1o023we,I keep making mistakes that impact production jobs…losing confidence in my abilities,eatdrinksleepp,dataengineering,"I am a junior data engineer with a little over a year worth of experience. My role started off as a support data engineer but in the past few months, my manager has been giving the support team more development tasks since we all wanted to grow our technical skills. I have also been assigned some development tasks in the past few months, mostly fixing a bug or adding validation frameworks in different parts of a production job. Before I was the one asking for more challenging tasks and wanted to work on development tasks but now that I have been given the work, I feel like I have only disappointed my manager. In the past few months, I feel like pretty much every PR I merged ended up having some issue that either broke the job or didn’t capture the full intention of the assigned task. At first, I thought I should be testing better. Our testing environments are currently so rough to deal with that just setting them up to test a small piece of code can take a full day of work. Anyway, I did all that but even then I feel like I keep missing some random edge case or something that I failed to consider which ends up leading to a failure downstream. And I just constantly feel so dumb in front of my manager. He ends up having to invest so much time in fixing things I break and he doesn’t even berate me for it but I just feel so bad. I know people say that if your manager reviewed your code then its their responsibility too, but I feel like I should have tested more and that I should be more holistic in my considerations. I just feel so self-conscious and low on confidence. The annoying thing is that the recent validation thing I worked on, we introduced it to other teams too since it would affect their day-to-day tasks but turns out, my current validation framework technically works but it will also result in some false positives that I now need to work on. But other teams know that I am the one who set this up and that I failed to consider something so anytime, these false positives show up (until I fix it), it will be because of me. I just find it so embarrassing and I know it will happen again because no matter how much I test my code, there is always something that I will miss. It almost makes me want to never PR into production and just never write development code, keep doing my support work even though I find that tedious and boring but at least its relatively low stakes…I am just not feeling very good and doesn’t help that I feel like I am the only one making these kind of mistakes in my team and being a burden on my manager, and ultimately creating more work for him with my mistakes…Like I think even the new person on the team isn’t making as many mistakes as I am..",25,0.91,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1o023we/i_keep_making_mistakes_that_impact_production/,2025-10-07 01:53:54,2025-10-09 01:26:16

1nzp92t,We just launched Daft’s distributed engine v1.5: an open-source engine for running models on data at scale,sanityking,dataengineering,"Hi all! I work on Daft full-time, and since we just shipped a big feature, I wanted to share what’s new. Daft’s been mentioned here a couple of times, so AMA too.Daft is an open-source Rust-based data engine for multimodal data (docs, images, video, audio) and running models on them. We built it because getting data into GPUs efficiently at scale is painful, especially when working with data sitting in object stores, and usually requires custom I/O + preprocessing setups.So what’s new? Two big things. **1. A new distributed engine for running models at scale**We’ve been using Ray for distributed data processing but consistently hit scalability issues. So we switched from using Ray Tasks for data processing operators to running one Daft engine instance per node, then scheduling work across these Daft engine instances. Fun fact: we named our single-node engine “Swordfish” and our distributed runner “Flotilla” (i.e. a school of swordfish).We now also use [morsel-driven parallelism](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/p743-leis.pdf) and dynamic batch sizing to deal with varying data sizes and skew.And we have smarter shuffles using either the Ray Object Store or our new Flight Shuffle (Arrow Flight RPC + NVMe spill + direct node-to-node transfer). **2. Benchmarks for AI workloads**We just designed and ran some swanky new AI benchmarks. Data engine companies love to bicker about TPC-DI, TPC-DS, TPC-H performance. That’s great, who doesn’t love a throwdown between Databricks and Snowflake.So we’re throwing a new benchmark into the mix for audio transcription, document embedding, image classification, and video object detection.

AI is expected to help breakdown those barriers to increase the consumption of complicated subject matters. Guess what's required to enable this? ...data. Not just any data, good data. High integrity data, ultra high integrity data. The higher, the more valuable. Garbage data isn't going to work anymore, in any industry, as the years roll on.This isn't just true for those complicated areas, all industries will need better data. Anyone who wants to be a player in the future is going to have to upgrade and/or completely re-write their existing systems since the vast majority of data systems today produce garbage data. Partly due to businesses in-adequality budgeting for it. There is a good portion of companies that will have to completely restart their data operations, relegating their current data useless and/or obsolete.

Now what dlthub does is that it automatically normalizes the data and loads the arrays into subtables. I like this very much, but now upon some reading I found out that the general advice is to stick as much as possible to the raw format of the data, so in this case loading the nested arrays in JSON format in the db, or even loading the whole response as one value to a raw table with one column.Wha do you think about that? What I’m losing by normalizing it at this step, except the fact that I have a shitton of tables and I guess it’s impossible to recreate something if I don’t like the normalize logic?

1o14vvh,[FOSS] Flint: A 100% Config-Driven ETL Framework (Seeking Contributors),TeamFlint,dataengineering,"I'd like to share a project I've been working on called **Flint**:Flint transforms data engineering by shifting from custom code to declarative configuration for complete ETL pipeline workflows. The framework handles all execution details while you focus on what your data should do, not how to implement it. This configuration-driven approach standardizes pipeline patterns across teams, reduces complexity for ETL jobs, improves maintainability, and makes data workflows accessible to users with limited programming experience.The processing engine is abstracted away through configuration, making it easy to switch engines or run the same pipeline in different environments. The current version supports Apache Spark, with Polars support in development.It is not intended to replace all pipeline programming work but rather make straightforward ETL tasks easier so engineers can focus on more interesting and complex problems.See an example configuration at the bottom of the post.

I’m in a decent position to move up.The company is big but my team is small (1 manager, 1 senior, 2 juniors). It’s generally a good place to work, though promotions and recognition are quite slow — most people move internally to progress. As the other junior and senior are on a single project, I'm doing all others currently.I normally get bored after about a year in a job, but I’ve been here for 2 years and still enjoy most of the work despite a few frustrations.Current situation:My girlfriend lives in Germany (we’ve been together for 4 years), and I want to move there. My current job doesn’t allow working abroad, so I’ll need to find something a way to make it happen. I do fortunately have EU citizenshipI’ve had a few opportunites in Germany. Some looked promising but didn’t work out (e.g. they needed someone to start immediately, or misrepresented parts of the process). Overall, though, I seem to get decent interest.Main issue:A lot of roles in Germany require a degree (I’m working on one but don’t have it yet).Many jobs also want fluent German. Mine is still pretty basic, but I’m learning.I'm considering:EU contracting - I like the idea of doing different projects every 6–12 months while living in Germany. I haven’t looked properly into the legal/tax side yet, but it sounds like it could fit well.Building a product/startup- I’ve built a very basic MVP that provides analytics (including some predictive analysis) for small–mid sized e-commerce companies. It’s early, but I think it could be developed into more of a template/solution to offer as a service potentially.Career progression - I don’t want to stay as a junior any longer and its so low priority for the company currently. I want to keep build towards something bigger but feel like times not on my side I’m juggling a lot right now: work, uni, the product idea, and the thought of switching to contracting and moving abroad. I want to move things forward without getting stuck in the same place for too long or burning out trying to do everything at once.Any advice on * Moving to Germany as a data professional without fluent German* Whether EU contracting is a good stepping stone or just a distraction right now* If it’s smarter to build the product before or after relocating* General advice on avoiding career stagnation while juggling multiple prioritiesTL;DR:3.5 yrs as a Data Engineer, junior title, £40k, started a degree.

1o1p9ok,Deduplication and RAM cache are two of the most critical technologies in modern IT infrastructure.,SarahVerge,dataengineering,"https://i.redd.it/yzst2xdkuysf1.gifCache only matters if it’s in the right place.For years, storage vendors have sold us on bigger arrays with bigger caches. But here’s the problem: :round_pushpin: When cache lives inside the array, it sits across the network from your workloads. :high_voltage: That means every cache hit still requires a network hop.:counterclockwise_arrows_button: Worse, storage-centric deduplication forces rehydration before the block can leave the array—erasing most of the performance benefit.From the application’s perspective, that “cache” feels no faster than a trip to flash storage.VergeOS takes a different approach.:check_mark_button: Cache is placed directly in the server, right next to the workload.:check_mark_button: Deduplication metadata is shared across the entire infrastructure, so data stays deduplicated until the VM consumes it.:check_mark_button: The result: 4–5x higher effective cache hit rates, consistently lower latency, and resources that actually work for the business instead of the array vendor.As workloads like AI, analytics, and VDI grow more cache-dependent, the gap between “marketing cache” and real cache gets wider.

Like for example, start at the top of the file and go through the functions clicking on them to go towards the source code* Run the code through a debugger : * One of the underrated ways to understand a codebase is to run the code that you are reading through a debugger. Attach a breakpoint and the simulate running the code, you will understand the flow of the code extremely well.* Start from the test cases: * If the project has test cases, that’s your entry point. Run them and *watch what happens*. * What objects are being created? * Which functions are called first? * What files are imported?Learning to read code well takes time.

Now that I am older I find the entire concept fascinating. I've researched as best I can, eaten up tutorials and free resources and even yr vids. I practice in vs code and use github for projects and spare codes. But I feel overwhelmed and a little lost.Im trying not to make it abou5 getting a job ( career change, currently unemployed and desperate) But it's difficult due to how inter3sted i am.Ill get these days that I hyperfocus and jsut go down the rabbit hole and what I end up with it.... a mess tbh.My question is - do any long term programmers/endgineers/web devs have legit, concrete advice that worked for them when learning?I don't want handouts. I like the struggle (masochist >,>) But I honestly feel like I need a direction.Mi first goal is to build a personal website as a holding place for my tentative projects, amateur blog of my learning process and what has helped me, and maybe a few scattered real like things in there too. I also plan to add in a section for gaming suggestions such as custom content, add-ons, guides etcAs well as a resources of various thingsIt's all a long term goal. Im attempting to learn basic vanilla html,css, and javascript first before delving deep into any frameworks I like to have a basic understanding of beat practices and why's first. But again... ADHD messing with my brain. Overwhelmed. Jittery. Want to do ALL THE THINGS AT ONCE.So... does anyone have ANG suggestion of how to begin this hefty project and maybe break it down into easily digestible pieces???Id so appreciate it you have NO idea.EDIT - UPDATE:: Thank you everyone so much for the honesty and helpful advice. It feels great to have people with far far more experience reach out and give tips. I seriously appreciate it. Especially considering when I made this post, I did it during an adhd spiral. I get far too honest and far too chatty without even considering the ramifications later. So I very much appreciate everyone's reply. I will be taking notes and keeping them all in mind!

The source code of my project2. Create their own API key 3.

Is it more valuable for a junior to have full-stack skills and I should pick up a frontend framework like React?​2) Beyond programming languages, what are the absolute must have for a junior developer today? I keep hearing about Git, Docker, CI/CD, and basic cloud services. How important are these for a first role?​3) What kind of personal projects really stand out to hiring managers for a junior role?

I have most of the skills necessary when it comes to this like 3d modeling, drawing, animation and sound. However I lack the most essential skill, coding.

I feel terrible using chatgpt because its just not good, it ruins a game because it was made by a clanker ai robot instead of a real human being and I don't want to be like that, but every time I have ever tried to make a game or learn how to code I have given up. The furthest I have learnt in c# right now is variables, logic gates, events and basic 2d movement along with rigidbody 2d movement but nothing else, and I just want to give up all the time and have been giving up then trying again then giving up over and over and over for the past like 4 years and idk what to do at this point. So if anybody has a solution please pretty please with a cherry on top tell me. Youtube videos never worked for me, i tried learning with chatgpt, that didn't work either, i have talked to other people who know how to code and that didnt work, just about nothing works for me.

1o0cdk6,"Stuck with My Final Year Project, Need Advice & Direction",Fearless-Aviator,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone,I’m a final year computer science student, and I could really use some help or guidance on my project.The idea started when a friend suggested Sign Language Recognition using Python and OpenCV. I instantly loved it , it felt meaningful, impactful, and technically interesting. So I jumped in, did a good bit of research, and started thinking about how I could make it my own.At first, my plan was to:* Build a basic sign language recognition system using a webcam, Python, and OpenCV.* Expand the word library beyond the typical 10-20 signs.* Focus specifically on Irish Sign Language (ISL) to localize it more.But as I kept researching, I realized I might’ve been on the wrong side of the internet early on, because it turns out that projects like this have already been done a *lot*. My additions (more words, ISL focus) don’t really feel like enough to count as a real advancement or innovation, especially for a final year project.I then thought: what if I added a region detection feature? Something that could detect which sign language dialect is being used (e.g., ASL vs BSL vs ISL). But again, the more I dig, the more I see that similar ideas have been explored — and I'm starting to feel like I’m just re-inventing existing wheels without offering anything new.To be honest, I’m really stuck now, I’ve backed myself into a project that’s been done too many times already, and I’m not sure how to meaningfully innovate it.I would love some advice on this, what more can i add, and should i just give up.

1o1s7q4,Is it possible to be too dumb to learn C?,True-Competition-889,learnprogramming,"I only lurk on Reddit, but I have to ask. Is it possible to be too dumb to learn C and low level programming? For reference, I am in college getting a degree in IT. My degree is generally more networking, infrastructure, and cybersecurity than computer science. The only computer science classes I have to take have been in python, a web development class, and an Intro to Computer Systems class in C. I did well in web development, and I absolutely LOVED the classes in python. C has been a different animal. I had to work SO hard to barely pass Intro to Computer Systems. The content was kind of interesting, but it was a ton of work. I made it though. I decided that low level just wasn't for me and moved on. Last year, I got to take a Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation class. It was all in C, but we didn't do any actual development in C. We only reverse engineered C code, then wrote exploits in assembly or hex. I loved this class as well. It was super hard, but I really enjoyed learning about how the exploits worked. The class was geared towards security researchers, which is not what I want to do, but I still loved it. My university's computer science program recently started an Operating Systems Development class, based on MIT's xv6 operating system (RISC-V). I decided to give low level development (specifically C) a second chance, but it has not been going well. The content is interesting, but I genuinely feel too stupid to learn it. The lectures feel impossible to follow, and the labs generally take me about twice as long to complete as other students. I mostly decided to take this class to learn more about a topic I probably wouldn't learn on my own, and I don't need this class to graduate. Regardless, I don't want to drop the class. I feel like I ""can"" do it, but its been so hard. It's kinda making me think that I might just not be smart enough to do low level programming, and that I should stick to the higher level stuff where I do better. Is it possible to not be smart enough? Or am I just making a big deal out of a skill issue? I enjoy learning about the content, but it takes me so long to get the labs done. Even after I complete them, I usually don't fully understand why my bug fixes work.

1o120lp,Need help to understand and learn based on some of the problems I encountered in my hobby project.,MessedUpMess59,learnprogramming,"I am learning backend by developing a simple URL shortener project. The goal of this project is to learn and try to do things in simple but better ways. I have two things in mind that I need some advice/suggestions onTech stack: Python, FastAPI, Postgres, SQLAlchemy1. How to handle click events (URL clicks used for simple analytics)?2. How to handle sequentially related operations? For example, if a User is deactivated, all the URLs of that user should be deactivatedThis is the way I started to think and improvise:As a beginner, updating the DB step by step is the usual way. The user clicks a short URL, and the click is registered in the DB (url\_id, clicked\_at, any other metadata), and then the redirection happens. Now this is a typical setup, but this may work for a few users. When I think of thousands or even millions of users, this won’t work. Yes, I can think of scaling the infrastructure, but DB operations are costly, and I need to only think about the important DB updates. When I was reading about this, I came across the concept of eventual consistency. I wanted to know how these things can be done, and came across using tasks in the background. Important updates can be done in the DB, and the rest can be pushed to the task queue to perform later. This was the basic idea I thought of. (Read Celery)Now coming to 1), I have a clicks table, and I just record the clicks. Now, for a few users, direct DB insert is fine, but for many users, this will be a bottleneck. Using a task for each click is overkill. Then I thought, can I use some sort of buffer which captures clicks in bulk and then pushes a task for a bulk update? Now the question is what to use? The read should be quick, so Redis comes into the picture, but persistence is an issue. Clicks are important data, accuracy can be debated. I can use Redis persistence mechanisms to manage it, but is this the right way to do it? Redis captures the clicks metadata. I will have a periodic task to scan the Redis, if there is any data, I fetch it in chunks and bulk update the DB. This looks good, but is there a better way to do it? When I looked into this, I came across event-driven architecture and Kafka. All these things went over my head, as I am just doing a simple project in a mono repo modular way. Please suggest any other ways to achieve this in a simpler and better way.Coming to 2), I have a user table, which has the user status. When a user deactivates, all the URLs related to that user should also be deactivated. For a few users, updating user status and then updating URL status is a typical setup, but thinking on scale, this is not feasible. Suppose 1000 users deactivate at a time, each user having 100 URLs, updating all at once will take time. What I thought was to update the user status and let the frontend show it. This is the UI level update for user consistency. The URL updates can be delayed, maybe using tasks. I thought of using per-user tasks. User deactivates, user status is updated, and a deactivate task is pushed to the queue. If the queue has fewer tasks, and workers aren't busy, then every task will be quickly done. But what if the user's status changes before the task is executed? Say the user logged in and the user is active, again, I push a task to reactivate URLs. So in a very small period of time, the user status went from active to deactivated to active again. Status is unchanged, but the URL status changed twice through two tasks, which wasn’t required. These cases may be rare, but I have to consider them. So to manage this, I can have a simple table to keep track of status using versions. Start with 1, and then update when the status changes. For the URL, I just keep track of the last user status version which updated the URL status. So I have (user\_status\_version, last\_user\_status\_version\_url\_update). When I push a task, I send the user version as the task version and then check if there is any URL update needed. Task just checks the task version and user version with the last update URL version to make URL status changes if needed. This works fine, but now the question is, if there are a huge number of users, can the task queue be overloaded? Then I thought of having a scheduled task which runs periodically. Here, I focus on the current state of the user status. For this, I need to maintain a table with (user\_id, status, version, updated\_at). All the status updates will be recorded here per user. The task will check for version differences, fetch the current user status and then make necessary changes only if required. In both methods, I have to access the DB. Is there a way to avoid this? Maybe have a buffer to store the actions for some time and then process them in bulk. Same as in 1), I thought of using Redis as an intermediate data store. A task will run periodically and check for Redis entries, if present, they will be fetched and pushed as a task to the queue to process them and update the database. Processing can be made efficient further with looping chunks or multiple tasks processing different chunks of data, etc.These are the ideas which I could think of. Are there any other ways of doing it? Feel free to suggest/advise or provide any resources. Please correct me if my thinking is wrong, I'm trying to learn as much as possible.",2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1o120lp/need_help_to_understand_and_learn_based_on_some/,2025-10-08 05:26:53,2025-10-09 01:26:17
1o0syuu,Looking for a generic data structure being able to describe complex domain specific filters ( or standardized query language ),m477h145h3rm53n,learnprogramming,"I'm searching for a very flexible data structure being able to describe what data to fetch from an API ( assuming I would own that API by creating a custom wrapper plugin ). The data itself is quite easy to fetch but the filters are very complex because the client domain is fully customizable.The system========Given an external project-based system. Each project contains multiple entities of different types ( e.g. *risk*, *hazard*, ... ). Each entity got an `id` field and can have additional custom fields ( e.g. *name*, *description*, ... ). It is possible to link entities via link definitions ( e.g. *hazard* **belongs to** *risk* ), so one entity is pointing to others.https://i.sstatic.net/lWWf5z9F.pngReading data via system GUI========The system itself provides 2 approaches to display data in its own GUI- writing raw SQL- providing a [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) query stringBoth approaches work for the most cases but complex queries are not possible. If the SQL query is too complex, the system won't execute it ( because of security reasons ), some SQL statements got blacklisted. Same for the Lucene query, you can only query very basic information. If you want to read complex data you have to write a custom Java plugin and query the database on your own.My current solution========There are several domains that require different domain specific queries ( e.g. Risk management, Cyper security, ... )Since I want to read complex data and visualize it in a table I thought it could be useful to separate the transformed UI data from the raw fetching data.So a very simple UI might look like this | Risks | Risks | Hazards || ----- | ----- | ----- || render some fields of Risk 1 | render other fields of Risk 1 | render Hazard 1 |As you can see one entity can be displayed differently in multiple columns. But since we only want to read it once ( to calculate a tree representing a table matrix ) I thought data sources would do the trick.A single data source describes which data to load. It is a pool of entities with their fields. There must be a leading data source and there can be a list of following data sources depending on each other.```tsdataSources: { leading: { id: ""unique-id"", // a unique ID for the data source entityTypeIds: [ ""entityType-1"", ""entityType-2"" ], // describe which types to load fieldIds: [ ""field-1"" ], // only fetch the desired custom fields }, following: [{ // ... following DS extends the leading DS ... dependsOn: { dataSourceId: ""id-of-the-related-data-source"", // point to the other data source ( e.g. leading ) relation: { // describe the link definition typeId: ""has"", // the ID of the link definition sourceIs: ""other"" // which direction to use? ( can be ""me"" or ""other"" ) } } }]}```Each data source loads entities with their fields based on its configuration. Related following data sources load entities based on the relation and the final result will be a data graph.Now this approach comes with some limitations:- You have to be sure that each field ID exists for each entity type- You have to be sure that the defined link definition matches each entity type of the related data source- leading data will be fetched from the current project only but related data will be fetched from everywhere ( no limits ) To add a filter to a data source I had a look at [MongoDB filter expressions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/eq/) and created my own simple filters, e.g.```ts// Comparison operators ( equals ){ ""$eq"": [""fieldId"", ""value""]}// Logical operators ( and | not | or ){ ""$and"": [] // Expecting other filters, e.g. comparison operators}```When it comes to very complex filtering, e.g.> Pick risk if linked to any hazard and at least one hazard is of category biological the only way I solved it was to hardcode some filter steps in the backend code and define them inside an action```ts// Filter action { name: ""my filter action"", // the name of the backend method param1: ..., param2: ..., ...}```With all the information the backend is able to process data source by data source ( ""column wise"" ) but my approach not ideal. Traversing 3000 risks with a generic SQL query ( by transforming the basic filters ) and applying filter methods on them is very slow. The external system is slow itself so rendering a table with ~30 columns and maybe 50 rows can take up to 1 minute ( depends on domain complexity ). ~5 seconds is considered ""fast"".I'm looking for a very generic data structure to describe exactly what I want in one run ( if possible )> Lessons learned: I think it's to slow to process data source by data source ( column wise ) because the UI has to wait everything to be fetched. It might be better to create a structure that resolves a whole ""UI"" row ( all data sources together ) because the backend could stream row by row so the client could start rendering some results earlier.So I'm thinking about overhauling the whole application in terms of flexibility and performance.""improve existing structure"" idea========As little dynamic as possible with a clear mapping```ts// Leading Entity DataSource{ ""projectID-1"": { // define project ID ""entityTypeID-1"": { // define entity type ID // define entity configuration ( e.g. fields ) } }}// Following Entity To Entity DataSource ( one to one mapping ){ ""parent-projectID-1"": { // define parent project ID ""parent-entityTypeID-1"": { // define parent entity type ID ""parent-linkDefinitionID-1"": { // define link definition ID fromTypes: { // specific link direction ( opposite is toTypes ) ""projectID-1"": { // define project ID ""entityTypeID-2"": { // define entity type ID // define entity configuration ( e.g. fields ) } } } } } }}```This structure gives you a lot more flexibility and the backend exactly knows what to do. Unfortunately I wasn't able to solve the filter part yet. How should I tell the backend> Pick this one if its status is ""open"" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.Reading every risk and applying a filter which checks every hazard relative to this risk can cause a massive slowdown ( when having many data sources )""use SQL"" idea========It would be easy to create a custom SQL string and pass it to the backend plugin which passes the SQL query to the system. Unfortunately this is not possible because- The system would block complex queries- There are no permission checks anymore""use Lucene"" idea========One could create a Lucene query string. While Lucene itself allows arbitrarily complex logical structures, the system enforces a few practical restrictions:- Security & Performance:Extremely deep nesting or very long OR chains (e.g., thousands of values) may be rejected by the system- Syntax filtering:The system only supports a subset of Lucene’s query syntax (for example, no wildcards in field names, no custom analyzer queries)- Fixed field names:You can only query fields that the system has indexed (e.g., type, status, severity, assignee, project, created, etc.)Complex queries not only check for field values but also for graphs and Lucene is not a graph database system.""filters"" idea========Think of everything being a ( known ) filter```ts// caution: this filter structure needs to be logically nested inside AND / OR / NOT{ /* Glob Pattern, e.g. ""100"" => Project 100 only ""!100"" => All projects except 100 ""100|200"" => Project 100 or 200 only ""*"" => All projects */ projectID: ""100"", entityTypeID: ""risk"", // Glob pattern similiar to project ID // ... additional filters ...}```This might work but it takes some time to resolve the request. And for now I didn't find a good structure for a very complex domain filter.---My questions:-----Is there a standard query language solving this? I want to avoid inventing my own query language.Do you have any ideas how to create a generic structure being able to solve complex domain cases?",2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1o0syuu/looking_for_a_generic_data_structure_being_able/,2025-10-07 22:11:28,2025-10-09 01:26:17

Now, I've gone crazy on this code for the past few days and went all-in to changing the interfaces of the methods provided to refactor. However, it got me wondering. Would I get punished for this or criticised?The way I look at it, when refactoring code, it's normal for some interfaces to break, which would necessitate more refactoring in other places. Of course, I've only been given a snippet, so I wouldn't be able to estimate how much impact the changing of the interfaces has.",2,0.76,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1o09kb8/programming_job_assignment_regarding_refactoring/,2025-10-07 08:59:39,2025-10-09 01:26:17

Also, when I try to do c++ work, I end up copying/repurposing existing code rather than writing something mostly fresh like I would in blueprint.I understand I could just start doing more tasks in c++ but that doesn't always seem like the most optimal and efficient way to do things, especially when performance gains are negligible.Am I right to feel this way?

When I test the method it says that 40 is a prime number. It obviously istn't though. What can I do to fix this issue? And what is causing it in the first place. I believe my function is correct. 2.

How do you balance using AI as a learning tool without letting it do too much of the work for you?I did or used to try to ask AI specific questions to learn from it, but honestly, it often feels faster to just let it handle things while I guide and review the output.

I still love coding. I still love my job. My reviews are great at work. I just... don't have the drive to work extra hard to reach senior level, much less staff/principal.I compare myself to when I was a new grad. Going to many tech events, networking, improving my Leetcode skills and constantly interviewing to improve my interview skills and to see what opportunities are available to grow or reach higher. I would read books, do side projects, keep up with the latest news and trends. My goal at the time was eventually become a staff/principal level dev earning 150-200k a year 10 years down the road. My hard work eventually paid off, I went from a no-name school to a few scrappy startups to better mid level company and eventually hit a big tech remote job. Been here three years now and I'm honestly content. Old me would have pushed for a promotion by year 1 (with an expectation of failure but that's okay! I tried to get internships my first semester in school too lol). I thought I'd ""rest"" from the grind for a bit and now 3 years have passed. Will probably reach year 4 without a promotion though my compensation has grown quite a bit regardless. I don't even interview around anymore (as that's one way to get to senior too!) Part of it seems to be that, from a compensation stand point, I had reached the upper band of my goal the moment I got the big tech job and am now at a point where I overshot it by more than 50%.

This week, I notice a lot of H1B colleagues and friends started believing that changing jobs will incur the 100k fees, and it's *not a guarantee that their employer would pay the fees*. This is obviously against the countless clarification that's been published, so I asked where heard that. They said company announcement and emails from the law firm that the company pays.That's why Big Tech has is keeping its mouth shut about the 100k H1B fees. It won't affect the majority of their hiring, not transfers, not F1, etc. but they can use the panic to insinuate that it does to suppress wages. ""You should be grateful we're paying this fee, and other employers might not when you switch jobs."" You didn't pay shit, and neither would anyone else. ""Now we have to pay everyone less to cover the fees, blah blah blah bs""The 100k ""fee"" is a win for Big Tech because their hiring is untouched by it and allows them to keep wages low by manipulating their H1Bs into thinking switching cost is even higher.

1nwss1b,"From 0 Offers to Multiple Opportunities – Job Search Season 2 Recap (7.5 YOE, Market Update, and Lessons Learned)",diabloallica,cscareerquestions,"Earlier this year, I shared a post about my *brutal job search season* — 7 years of experience, 0 offers, and a Sankey diagram of all my failures. At that time, I was struggling to get traction despite a ton of effort, and the funnel felt brutal. (For anyone curious, here’s the old post: [Brutal Job Search Season Recap - 7 YOE, 0 Offers, and a Sankey Diagram of My Failures : r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1irlf8b/brutal_job_search_season_recap_7_yoe_0_offers_and/))This time around, things went much better. With \~7.5 years of experience at a major cloud company, I decided to give the market another shot, and the difference was noticeable. I ended up landing **5 job offers, all at a higher level than my current role**, and had far more interview opportunities with larger, well-known companies compared to my last search.**What Changed Since Last Time:*** **Market conditions:** Hiring still isn’t easy, but compared to earlier this year, there’s clearly more activity. The bar is high, but not *as impossibly high*.* **Interview prep:** I doubled down on my weak spots. Coding used to be my #1 rejection reason. I kept grinding on patterns, mock interviews, and actually slowing down to talk through my thinking. That helped a lot.* **Mindset:** Last time, every rejection hit me hard. This time, I treated each round as “just another rep,” which helped me stay consistent across system design and behavioral interviews.**Results:*** Multiple onsites and final-round loops.* 5 actual offers on the table (finally!).* A more balanced funnel: coding wasn’t the auto-fail it used to be, and system design performance felt steadier.**Takeaways:**1. The market does ebb and flow. Timing matters more than we admit.2. Interviewing is a skill that compounds. The “wasted” interviews from earlier weren’t really wasted; they set me up to do better this time.3. Having \~7 years of experience doesn’t exempt you from practicing fundamentals. But it *does* give you more stories and perspective for behavioral/design rounds.Curious: has anyone else noticed interviews feeling slightly more reasonable lately? Or was this just lucky timing?**New Sankey diagrams:**[https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg](https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg) \- Without any failure reason categorization [https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2](https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2) \- With weighted failure reason categorization",85,0.9,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwss1b/from_0_offers_to_multiple_opportunities_job/,2025-10-03 07:42:49,2025-10-09 01:26:18

I just joined a Fortune 500 company after working at a small startup, and my new employer offers \~$5k/year in tuition reimbursement for any degree ""relevant to my role"". I did my bachelor’s at WGU and would probably go that route again since I could likely finish a master’s in about 6 months, making it effectively free to me.Right now, I’m not sure any of these options would directly change my position or pay in the short term, but I want to optimize for the future and keep doors open for higher-paying roles, whether as an IC or a manager. Here are the contenders:1. M.S. in Software Engineering - Closest to what I do now. Could help fill in gaps in areas I haven’t worked in, but not sure how much employability upside it really has.2. M.S. in Computer Science - The title alone sounds stronger than Software Engineering. Has AI specializations that align with my new role. Might make me stand out more technically down the road.3. MBA in IT Management - I’m interested in becoming an engineering manager eventually, but I don’t know how much a specialization like this actually matters for that.4. General MBA - The broadest option. If specialization doesn’t matter much, maybe this is better? Could also hedge for a career pivot (not planning one, but never hurts).5. None - Maybe all of these are just a waste of time, energy, and opportunity cost :'(Has anyone here gone through one of these paths or similar? Did it actually help your career or comp long-term?

1nxmaoq,Industry vs Academia for CS PhD,wonder-why-I-wonder,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,I’m finishing up a PhD in CS at a top U.S. school (think Stanford, MIT, CMU, or Berkeley). I recently received an industry offer that isn’t research-oriented (no publications involved), and I’m torn between taking it and graduating soon or going on the academic job market.For context, I have 10+ first-author papers at top AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) with around 400 citations in total. My advisor says I’m one of the best students they’ve had in the past decade and that I should be able to land a tenure-track position at a top institution.In terms of compensation, I can expect around $400–500K total in industry (with a $300K base). Assistant professors in my field at top schools seem to start around $160–180K including summer support and benefits. Tenured associate professors make roughly $220K+, full professors around $280K+, and side consulting can add a meaningful amount on top of that.Here’s my dilemma: I’m completely burned out from the publish-or-perish sprint. It feels impossible to truly rest from research, it follows you even into your dreams. I also sometimes feel empty producing papers that don’t seem to have much real-world relevance. Maybe things would get better once I settle into a tenure-track position with more autonomy, but I’m not sure. I don’t hate research, but the passion I once had for it is gone. These days, it feels more like a job I need to perform well in general at rather than something I’m genuinely excited about.That said, I absolutely love the flexibility and freedom academia offers. Being able to set my own schedule, take time off when needed, and choose topics that genuinely interest me has been invaluable. You also get summers (mostly) off from teaching and service, plus sabbaticals down the line. Most importantly, I find mentoring and teaching students incredibly meaningful in a way that publishing papers never has been. That’s the kind of “impact” that actually feels real to me.So… how do you decide between academia and industry when the pros and cons barely overlap? And is it reasonable to pursue an academic career if you don’t love research anymore, but deeply enjoy teaching and mentoring?I know no one can make this decision for me, but I’m feeling pretty lost right now and would really appreciate any perspectives or advice.Thanks a lot for reading.",47,0.85,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nxmaoq/industry_vs_academia_for_cs_phd/,2025-10-04 06:09:31,2025-10-09 01:26:18

It’s a SWE role at a pretty well-known Web3 company with a more than 30% total comp increase (about 265k vs my current 200k) and it's fully remote. The only catch is it's likely going to be intense with tight sprints, and fast-paced. I heard that they have a culture where people typically stay 1–2 years before moving on. But it's definitely a good place to make money.My **c**urrent job has pretty good job security at a company that works for the G. If I were to be honest to myself, I only do about 5 hours of real work per day. I go to the office twice a week for 30 mins each way. There are downsides (occasional confusion from unstructured sprints, tedious work, little growth), but overall it’s comfortable. But if I leave this job, it's quite difficult to return if I ever regret.The thing is I’ve always had this itch and dream of building my own product or small business someday. My logic was that this comfortable job would give me the time and space to pursue that dream. But in realityI haven’t much, just a tiny bit. I’ve been spending my extra time moving places, doing hobbies, or just unwinding.It makes me question if I can even trust myself to use free time productively for a side business. I don’t even have a concrete idea yet, just vague thoughts about building a micro-SaaS, but the market’s competitive and I’m not sure what problem to tackle.So now I’m torn because if I stay, I get comfort, stability, low stress but I risk stagnation and feel stupid leaving a lot of money on the table. And if I leave, I get more money, growth, and momentum but likely lose my free time and might burn out kept thinking of not scratching my itch.I’m nearing 40 already, so I also think about whether I should be prioritising stability or taking one last big career leap while I still can while I'm starting a family at the same time.How should I even decide especially for the long term?",18,0.79,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nyhodb/should_i_take_up_a_30_pay_raise_or_stay_at_a/,2025-10-05 07:18:56,2025-10-09 01:26:18

1nz2n2c,"Mid-career dev (5+ yrs, no CS degree) - should I skip a CS Bachelor's and go straight to a CS Master's + BS in Business?",Intrepid_Drag6726,cscareerquestions,"I have been in the programming industry about five+ years on only an Associate’s degree. Where I am at in my technology career is that I am a reputable programmer, known as a high performer, who is now being considered for leadership roles in our software product team of increasing responsibility. Because my previous roles had me at the intersection of business and technology, my goal (known by my management team) is to eventually transition to the ""business side"" of our team/very well known company. I know that ideally I need to get credentials other than an associates degree, given today's market. I’ve been pricing out a CS Bachelor's degree and the time it would take to finish... I’m looking at like 3.5 years and $65k. That’s a lot. While I was doing this, I ended up coming across an opportunity to complete a Master’s Degree in CS (it is a performance based admissions which accepts applicants w/o a bachelor’s) at a reputable, accredited school  (CU Boulder Online) for 1/2 the time and a fraction of the cost.I know that given my current career trajectory, having that Master's would be really helpful to me. I also have credits in business that are transferrable, and found out that I could get an online BS in business from WGU in a relatively short amount of time (less than one year). Would having a Master's degree in CS without a CS bachelor (instead bachelor would be in business) be a detriment to me in applying/changing jobs/getting my resume through an ATS system in the future for tech and related roles that I cannot think of at the moment?I am just afraid that not having the CS Bachelor would be a deterrent. I am over 30 and being able to do these degrees online and specifically have the technology degree being ""higher level"" to match my skill set, would make it a lot easier to get through.  I figured this is an OK strategy, but I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot…maybe someone can see a risk that I can't.Thank you!P.S. - Edited to add:  My friend who is a manager said that the Master's would be good for leveling up in our system, but that it could potentially exclude me from job reqs that require a BS in CS... so that is what has me nervous about going down this path. However, I have been seeing more job posts in our system for 'Bachelor's Degree' and it doesn't say any specific disipline, whereas before many of our postings would say Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or Higher/Equivalent Experince. Our company is also very open to people with 'different' backgrounds as long as they can 'prove' they have the skills to do the work. With this in mind, do you think purely getting the Master's is a determent (and BS in CS is better) or is it a worthwhile path to pursue to get the MS as I have already planned?

1o0pk6h,Considering SkillStorm,peteminsch,cscareerquestions,"SkillStorm (a staffing company) reached out to re-interview me for a Java Full Stack role with Ernst & Young. I was in their pipeline before, but the project was cut due to funding. Now they’re offering:* **3 months training** @ $15/hr* **Full-time role afterwards** @ $27/hr* **Relocation** to San Antonio/Dallas* **Start date** in \~20 days* **$10k breach clause** if I leave before contract ends* They said some trainees might get cut before placement* Contract lasts 2 yearsWhat I'm basically concerned about is that this job was canceled before because of funding, and I'm scared it's going to happen again. They told me it's different this time because the contract was more stable since it's not a federal contract but it's still a massive risk to quit my current job for $27/hr. There's also the $10K breach clause which I think is a red flag. Last time, when I was in their pipeline before, they explained to me that the $10K breach clause was set because of how expensive the security clearance process was. That's fine with me, but now they're telling me that there's no need for a security clearance for this role and the breach clause is still set at $10K.

Eng in CS recently, and I'm considering transitioning to teaching, specifically teaching maths and CS for high school in Ontario, Canada. My exposure to industry includes a 16 month internship. The current job market is completely unrelated to this idea.Some things that drive me away from industry include:* Impact - I feel like my work as a developer just serves to make rich people richer by launching products. I think I'd be happier helping those who actually need help, in this case, students.* Work-life balance - It feels extremely prevalent nowadays, at all levels (jr, mid, senior, etc), to be expected to push above and beyond, both during and after work hours. I'm not saying that teaching is easy and doesn't require planning/marking outside of work, but I feel that this is less often and demanding in comparison. I would like to keep my peace of mind after work hours.I think generally my strengths align with teaching, and that this would be a more fulfilling career.Is there anything I would regret?Some obvious things that come to mind:* Salary difference, especially early on.* Longer establishment time (2 years for teachers college, then supply teaching, etc.)Thank you in advance!",8,0.76,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nzp9hg/jr_engineer_thinking_of_career_change/,2025-10-06 17:19:31,2025-10-09 01:26:18

Maybe a lot of the ones without much luck are international.

I find myself unable to solve some of the most basic questions.I'm asking because I'm not sure if this is me just finding these uninteresting to solve, working in languages I'm not comfortable with, being out of 'the game' for awhile so to speak, or just slowly realizing that CS isn't for me.

I also hear from recruiters that they get inundated with hundreds of applications per opening. It's easy to get discouraged hearing this but there might be nuisances to this. Perhaps the low response rates are due to lack of qualifications on the candidate's part (ie, newly grads applying for experienced roles), or maybe the market is tough for entry-level jobs but not as bad for experienced roles.

As I leveled up, I noticed that I didn't really have any more technical challenges to solve in my domain. Everything was pretty straight forward and easy to implement. Tell me what you wanna see, and I can make it happenBut I've been in senior roles for a while and it doesn't really feel like I *ever* use my technical abilities anymore. Often, I feel actively held back from doing so. Like I could easily fix a bug, but there's often tons of overhead and planning that make it not really worth doing. I spend most of my time fighting with people over things that really don't matter, trying to decode a bunch of corporate jargon, and trying to navigate navigate corporate politicsI feel like I've never doubted my ability to deliver on anything that anyone wants in my domain (frontend), it's usually just an oddly bureaucratic set of hoops to jump through to get even the most basic things done. 90% of time is just spent communicating to higher ups, and only a minuscule fraction of time is available for coding. I kind of understand now why people study for leetcode, at this level, it feels like there's nothing to actually code anymoreI was let go and decided to work a bit on a personal project cause I was bored. I was working on a component library before I was let go and had some ideas I wanted to try. So, I spun up my own and within literally 4 hours, I had most of the library done. At work, it took 2 months to get *one component* shipped. I also for once enjoyed making something and felt really proud of the result. Just seemed so different than workAnd FYI the last place I worked that was the *most* corporate was a small startup that seemed to fancy themselves a ""developer first"" company and tried to minimize on managementIs this a common experience?

1nxjplt,Moving into tech from risk,rhohodendron,cscareerquestions,"I went to a T10 university for undergrad and did applied math & economics, wanted to work in tech but graduated into a horrible market so decided to do a masters in CS (ML focused) afterwards at the same university, then graduated into an even worse market. Spent months looking for a job and eventually landed a job in model risk at the associate level at a T1 bank in NYC focused on AI/ML models. This *felt* tech-adjacent enough that, as someone who had been searching for a job for a long time, I felt like I was obligated to take it. So I did.The role is ok. Definitely boring, only a bit of coding but alot of looking at code. It's close enough to the models themselves that I feel like I'm maintaining my technical chops. But I'm realizing that being at a bank is just not for me and I want to do something closer to the action. I've only been here for a few months but I fully intend to try and leave model risk after a year or two at this job.Not gonna lie, I've been kind of spiraling a bit lately since I've been scared that I've already boxed myself into a risk/compliance archetype that'll make it impossible to pivot to anything more exciting. Part of this is just the fact that model risk is an area thats kind of unique to banks and thus less transferable, but my cope is that since I'm working with AI/ML models more than financial models, that makes me marginally more ""tech-adjacent"" if you will. Ideally I would land a role in as a PM or TPM in AI/Responsible AI, as those *feel* like more natural pivots than trying to immediately start coding full-time again, but I worry about how my background will be perceived.This is my first full time role. Maybe I'm just overestimating how rigid career trajectories and exit opportunities and those things are. I just don't wanna be stuck doing this for the rest of my life.

It seems like while there is a bar of knowledge required to *get a job*, deep knowledge, expertise, quality, etc aren't respected that much.Why? I'm looking for new jobs now, and most recruiters have no idea what they're looking for. You could be the world's greatest distributed systems expert and no recruiter would have any idea. They're basically just keyword matching on resumes.But at the job? My boss doesn't know what I do. In fact, I have to update him with details on what I've done to justify the time that I spend on projects. He probably understands around 10% of the actual work that I do. Upper management sees engineers as mostly fungible cogs to be replaced by cheaper humans and/ or tech (see the offshoring and AI push happening currently), while patting themselves on the back for their management decisions which are much less complex than the actual work being done at the ground level.Yeah, I know that Senior/Staff/Principal, etc roles exist. But even then, they're just bigger, more valuable cogs in the machine. The highest-paid, most-respected members of any company with the most freedom are going to be in upper levels of management.It seems like ""expertise"" in this field comes down more to marketing/ selling your impact than actually being good at the work. Simply being excellent at the work will lock you into a mid/ senior-level SWE role at best.So effectively, I work for people who don't know what I do, interview for companies that don't know what they want, and how good that I *actually* am doesn't seem to matter much at all.

Things are especially bad because all the entry level positions get flooded by people with experience who are obviously better than me in every way? There's also no more spring 2025 positions pretty much, like all those new grad positions don't even have an option to say I've graduated in spring 2025 outside of the ""other"" option which means my application would probably get thrown out instantly.Experience wise I am in a bad spot, I don't have very much ""real"" internship experience, the past 4 summers in college I was at a small 1 guy + random interns place where I did random hardware ish projects with PLCs. Some years I had projects where I made a mini server and made some pages with PHP and Javascript, another year I made a small app for Zoom meetings on a headset, but none of that really counts as real stuff because I don't have any real metrics for them (because I don't have any relationship with the companies my boss was making stuff for, I can't just ask them to give me months of random data for me to see exactly how much money the thing I did made?). My parents put my old resume in ChatGPT and got something that just looks so much worse to me? It ended up making those 4 summers into one thing which to me just looks like a complete lie. Background check would immediately see that I only did like 12 months instead of 4 consecutive years or even without a background check they would think I am completely lying because I can't work a full time in person internship in one city and go to college full time in person 100 miles away, that is not believable. Should I just put that lie there anyway???But that's all in the past now, I have to do something to make myself more hireable now before my qualifications drop to zero, but I just don't know what. I can't really do networking because there's basically nothing in the way of local software openings. Befriending some random in some company isn't really going to help me unless they are someone really high up, but I just don't have that kind of charisma to make myself the best friend of some hiring person to the point that I will get in instead of all the much higher qualified people out there.Project wise I am in a bad spot too. Some college classes gave me some stuff to put on there, one class had a group project where our group made a web app with React and Firebase but that doesn't really mean much as it wasn't a ""real"" project with big profit numbers and impressive metrics of any kind. I also spent a year in high school making a old game mod with assembly but that doesn't really count because assembly code is not something anyone is hiring at entry level. It has a playerbase that I estimated to be roughly 5000+ but that doesn't really count for anything because it's not a dollar value.I just can't think of a good project to do that has anything ""impressive"" or would lead to massively impressive metrics? The only real metrics they care about are dollar values? Because anything other than those aren't really ""impressive"" (it doesn't matter if you've written X lines of code or worked with a database of X size or had X users or used X different programming languages or technologies because they don't really care about that). I don't know how to turn a profit as a guy who isn't an entrepreneur, marketer or good artist. Everything out there bangs on about those stupid metrics and it just frustrates me to no end. Because I don't know how to make anything impressive at all. I can't really think of something that distinguishes ""stupid toy project"" vs ""something hiring people are impressed by"" outside of something profitable or something made specifically for that company (which is just infeasible for me to do, I can't spend months on a massive project just to apply to a single company and have those hiring people not even bother looking).I also don't really have good answers to all the STAR questions they ask? Because I never have a result that's better than ""it got done"" or something similar. Like I keep repeating in this post I don't have metrics and I don't know how to make a project that makes those metrics happen.

Not many jobs left that I can apply to at this point so I started applying to IT support as well and got an interview lined up and to my superise I am not sure I want this job anymore. I also during the application lied about being good/ fluent at a few things I barely know so prolly won't get it anyways. Not only that but I have decided to go back to school in January if not earlier because everything looks hopeless.

1nzw60p,"Stagnate on an interesting, friendly team, or leap of faith to unknown for experience?",stacks_n_queues,cscareerquestions,"**tl;dr Would you rather 1) stay on an interesting team where you're happy, but your skills are stagnating and you're not gaining a breadth of experience, or 2) jump to a less interesting team with unknowns, but gaining new experience?**Context: I've been on my team for 6+ years. Everything is pretty good (work-life balance, team culture, etc.). The work is interesting and I'm optimistic and at least semi-interested in the product. I've gone from entry level to senior on this team, and can still have career progression here.However, I feel my technical skills have been stagnating. There isn't much engineering mentorship, so I haven't been learning better engineers. If I got laid off today, I don't think future jobs would think my skills match my resume/level. Additionally, my role is very specialized, so I'm being pigeonholed in where I can work, since despite being senior, I lack a breadth of experience.Dilemma: I was offered an internal transfer role to a team doing something completely different, and has many higher level engineers to learn from. However, there are lots of unknowns. The product itself seems much less interesting, and of course there is no telling how the people are to work with or the team culture.What would you do in this situation? Stay where you're at, happy currently, but letting my growth stagnate and potentially limiting my options in the future, or take a leap of faith in order to gain experience?Thanks in advance!",4,0.76,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nzw60p/stagnate_on_an_interesting_friendly_team_or_leap/,2025-10-06 21:33:42,2025-10-09 01:26:18
