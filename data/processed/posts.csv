1knixik,Is python no longer a prerequisite to call yourself a data engineer?,ttothesecond,dataengineering,"I am a little over 4 years into my first job as a DE and would call myself solid in python. Over the last week, I've been helping conduct interviews to fill another DE role in my company - and I kid you not, not a single candidate has known how to write python - despite it very clearly being part of our job description. Other than python, most of them (except for one exceptionally bad candidate) could talk the talk regarding tech stack, ELT vs ETL, tools like dbt, Glue, SQL Server, etc. but not a single one could actually write python.What's even more insane to me is that ALL of them rated themselves somewhere between 5-8 (yes, the most recent one said he's an 8) in their python skills. Then when we get to the live coding portion of the session, they literally cannot write a single line. I understand live coding is intimidating, but my goodness, surely you can write just ONE coherent line of code at an 8/10 skill level. I just do not understand why they are doing this - do they really think we're not gonna ask them to prove it when they rate themselves that highly?What is going on here?? edit: Alright I stand corrected - I guess a lot of yall don't use python for DE work.

1kmq1ew,Is it really necessary to ingest all raw data into the bronze layer?,Maradona2021,dataengineering,"I keep seeing this idea repeated here:> **“The entire point of a bronze layer is to have raw data with no or minimal transformations.”**I get the intent — but I have multiple data sources (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.), where each object already comes with a well-defined schema. In my ETL pipeline, I use an automated schema validator: if someone changes the source data, the pipeline automatically detects the change and adjusts accordingly.For example, the Product object might have 300 fields, but only 220 are actually used in practice. So why ingest all 300 if my schema validator already confirms which fields are relevant?People often respond with:>> **“Standard practice is to bring all columns through to Bronze and only filter in Silver. That way, if you need a column later, it’s already there.”**But if schema evolution is automated across all layers, then I’m not managing multiple schema definitions — they evolve together. And I’m not even bringing storage or query cost into the argument; I just find this approach cleaner and more efficient.Also, side note: why does almost every post here involve vendor recommendations? It’s hard to believe everyone here is working at a large-scale data company with billions of events per day. I often see beginner-level questions, and the replies immediately mention tools like Airbyte or Fivetran. Sometimes, writing a few lines of Python is faster, cheaper, and gives you full control.

1klpzaf,Do you rather hate or love using Python for writing your own ETL jobs?,CootNo4578,dataengineering,"Disclaimer: I am not a data engineer, I'm a total outsider. My background is 5 years of software engineering and 2 years of DevOps/SRE. These days the only times I get in contact with DE is when I am called out to look at an excessive error rate in some random ETL jobs. So my exposure to this is limited to when it does not work and that makes it biased.At my previous job, the entire data pipeline was written in Python. 80% of the time, catastrophic failures in ETL pipelines came from a third-party vendor deciding to change an important schema overnight or an internal team not paying enough attention to backward compatibility in APIs. And that will happen no matter what tech you build your data pipeline on.But Python does not make it easy to do lots of healthy things like ensuring data is validated or handling all errors correctly. And the interpreted, runtime-centric nature of Python makes it - in my experience - more difficult to debug when shit finally hits the fan. Sure static type linters exist, but the level of features type annotations provide in Python is not on the same level as what is provided by a statically typed language. And I've always seen dependency management as an issue with Python, especially when releasing to the cloud and trying to make sure it runs the same way everywhere.And yet, it's clearly the most popular option and has the most mature ecosystem. So people must love it.What are you guys' experience reaching to Python for writing your own ETL jobs? What makes it great? Have you found more success using something else entirely? Polars+Rust maybe? Go? A functional language?",88,0.93,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1klpzaf/do_you_rather_hate_or_love_using_python_for/,2025-05-13 16:12:38,2025-05-20 01:41:56

1kn2cgq,Perhaps the best transition: DS > DE,HungryRefrigerator24,dataengineering,"Currently I have around 6 years of professional experience in which the biggest part is into Data Science. Ive started my career when I was young as a hybrid of Data Analyst and Data Engineering, doing a bit of both, and then changed for Data Scientist. I've always liked the idea of working with AI and ML and statistics, and although I do enjoy it a lot (specially because I really like social sciences, hence working with DS gives me a good feeling of learning a bit about population behavior) I believe that perhaps Ive found a better deal in DE.What happens is that I got laid off last year as a Data Scientist, and found it difficult to get a new job since I didnt have work experience with the trendy AI Agents, and decided to give it a try as a full-time DE. Right now I believe that I've never been so productive because I actually see my deliverables as something ""solid"", something that no pretencious ""business guy"" will try to debate or outsmart me (with his 5min GPT research).Usually most of my DS routine envolved trying to convince the ""business guy"" that asked for me to deliver something, that my solutions was indeed correct despite of his opinion on that matter. Now I've found myself with tasks that is moving data from A to B, and once it's done theres no debate whether it is true or not, and I can feel myself relieved. Perhaps what I see in the future that could also give me a relatable feeling of ""solidity"" is MLE/MLOps. This is just a shout out for those that are also tired, perhaps give it a chance for DE and try to see if it brings a piece of mind for you.

1kpaisy,Is it a bad idea to use DuckDB as my landing zone format in S3?,DuckDatum,dataengineering,"I’m polling data out of a system that forces a strict quota, pagination, and requires I fanout my requests per record in order to denormalize its HATEAOS links into nested data that can later be flattened into a tabular model. It’s a lot, likely because the interface wasn’t intended for this purpose. It’s what I’ve got though. It’s slow with lots of steps to potentially fail at. All that, and I can only filter at a days granularity—so polling for changes is a loaded process too.I went ahead and set up an ETL pipeline that used DuckDB as an intermediate caching layer, to avoid memory issues, and set it up to dump parquet into S3. This ran for 24 hours then failed just shy of the dump, so now I’m thinking about micro batches.I want to turn this into a microbatch process. I figure I can cache the ID, HATEAOS link, and a nullable column for the JSON data. Once I have the data, I update the row where it belongs. I could store duckdb in S3 the whole time, or just plan to dump it if a failure occurs. This also gives a way to query the duckdb for missing records in case it fails mid way.So before I dump duckdb into S3, or even try to use duckdb in s3 over a network, are there limitations I’m not considering?

For example if tomorrow the business wants to create another report, you are not locked down to the data types enforced in staging for the needs of the first use case. Personally I find this a bit of an odd decision but would like to hear your thoughts on this.

The problem is that the api only allows inputting a single device at a time and I have 20k+ rows in the db table. The plan is to automate this using airflow as a daily job (probably 20-100 new rows per day). What would be the best way of doing this? For now I was going to resort to a for-loop but this doesn’t seem the most efficient.Additionally, the api returns information about the device, and a list of sub devices that are children to the main device. The number of children is arbitrary, but they all have the same fields: the parent and children. I want to capture all the fields for each parent and child, so I was thinking of have a table in long format with an additional column called parent_id, which allows the children records to be self joined on their parent record. Note: each api call is around 500ms average, and no I cannot just join the table with the underlying api data source directlyDoes my current approach seem valid?

The weather data is normalised to only one level while the crag data being normalised into multiple levels. I think the weather data is quite simple is easy. It's just the crag data I am worried about. There are over 127,000 rows here with lots of columns that have many 1 to many relationships. I think not normalising would be a mistake and create performance issues, but again, it's my first time normalising to such an extent. I have created a star schema database but this is the first time normalising past 1 level. I just wanted to make sure everything was correctly done before I go ahead with creating the database [Schema for now](https://preview.redd.it/q4x72hcicq0f1.png?width=2501&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69f68a2b52d63aa5ce42a36a6330873ab371ed2)**The relationship is as follows:**crag --> sector (optional) --> routecrags are a singular site of climbing. They have a longitude and latitude coordinate associated with them as well as a name. Each crag has many routes on it. Typically, a single crag has one rocktype (e.g. sandstone, gravel etc.) associated with it but can have many different types of climbs (e.g. lead climbing, bouldering, trad climbing)If a crag is particularly large it will have multiple sectors, each sector will have many routes. and each sector has a name associated with them. Smaller crags will have only have one sector, called: 'Main Sector'.Routes are the most granular datapoint. Each route has a name, a difficulty grade, a safety grade and a type.I hope this explains everything well.

However, the company offered me a Lead Data Software Engineer role instead.I’m excited about the opportunity because it’s a big step forward in my career, but I also have some doubts. I consider myself more of a hands-on technical developer rather than someone focused on team management or leadership. My experience is solid in data architecture, Spark, and Azure, and I’ve worked on developing, designing architectures, and executing migrations. However, my role has been mostly technical, with limited exposure to team management or leadership.Do you think I should accept this opportunity to grow in technical leadership?

1ko2h06,Using Parquet for JSON Files,ItsHoney,dataengineering,"Hi!Some Background: I am a Jr. Dev at a real estate data aggregation company. We receive listing information from thousands of different sources (we can call them datasources!). We currently store this information in JSON (seperate json file per listingId) on S3. The S3 keys are deterministic (so based on ListingID + datasource ID we can figure out where it's placed in the S3). Problem:My manager and I were experimenting to see If we could somehow connect Athena (AWS) with this data for searching operations. We currently have a use case where we need to seek distinct values for some fields in thousands of files, which is quite slow when done directly on S3.My manager and I were experimenting with Parquet files to achieve this. but I recently found out that Parquet files are immutable, so we can't update existing parquet files with new listings unless we load the whole file into memory. Each listingId file is quite small (few Kbs), so it doesn't make sense for one parquet file to only contain info about a single listingId. I wanted to ask if someone has accomplished something like this before.

From native support for loading data into Apache Iceberg–compatible data lakes and AI Assistants that proactively monitor connection health, to expanded advanced APIs in the Connector Builder, we continue to double down on empowering data engineering teams with the best modern open data movement solution. In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jramqt/airbyte_connector_builder_now_supports_graphql/), I covered Connector Builder updates like async streams, nested compressed files, and GraphQL support. Below is a highlight of some of the newest features we’ve added.# Consolidate Data to Iceberg-Compatible Data LakesIceberg has quickly become a standard for building modern data platforms ready for providing AI-ready data to your teams. Our [Iceberg-compatible Data Lake destination](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-data-lake) is catalog and storage agnostic, and designed for highly scalable and performant AI and analytics workloads. With schema evolution support, along with expanded capabilities to move unstructured data and structured records all in one pipeline, you can use Airbyte to consolidate on Iceberg with confidence knowing your data is AI ready. And, with [Mappings](https://airbyte.com/blog/load-compliant-data-with-airbyte-mappers), you can share corporate data with confidence, knowing sensitive data will not be leaked.For a deep dive for data engineers on the benefits of adopting the Iceberg standard for storing both raw and processed data, and an outline of the capabilities of Airbyte's Data Lake destinations, or check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8krPElimfM).# Operate Hundreds of Pipelines in One PlaceAs the number of pipelines you need to manage with Airbyte grows, the need to oversee, monitor and manage your data pipelines in one place is critical for maintaining high data quality and data freshness. With this in mind, we're excited to introduce four new capabilities enabling you to better manage hundreds of pipelines all in one place:**Diagnose sync errors with AI**We’ve expanded AI support in Cloud Team to allow you to quickly diagnose and fix failed data pipeline syncs Instantly analyze Airbyte logs, connector documentation and known issues to help you identify root cause, and get actionable solutions, without any manual debugging required.

We've heard plenty of feedback from users requesting better ease of use for our Terraform Provider. We are excited to announce new capabilities making it easier than ever to manage all of your connectors using the Airbyte Terraform provider to roll out changes programmatically to your dev, staging, and production environments.When building a connector in the Airbyte UI, you will now find a **Copy JSON** button at the bottom of connector configuration. You can quickly use this to export the the configuration of a connector to Terraform. This takes into account version-specific configuration settings, and can also be repurposed for configuring connectors with PyAirbyte, the Python SDK or the Airbyte API.https://preview.redd.it/eib6twxc3t0f1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4902d63dbc6a47f22f7f1cf10ba387f0f6474d# Create custom connectors directly from YAML or Docker images[New endpoints and resources have also been added](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/v-1.6#create-custom-connectors-from-yaml-or-docker-images-using-the-api-and-terraform) to the APIs and Terraform provider to allow you create and update custom connectors using a Connection Builder YAML manifest or Docker image. These endpoints do not allow you to modify Airbyte’s public connector configurations, but if you have custom endpoints within your organization and are running OSS or self-managed versions of Airbyte, these additional capabilities can be used to programmatically spin up new connectors for different environments.If you need to manage API custom connectors in infrastructure, we now recommend you build your custom connector using the Connector Builder, test it using the in-app capability for verifying your connector, then export the configuration YAML. You can then easily pass in the YAML as part of a connector resource definition in Terraform:https://preview.redd.it/5loabk9e3t0f1.png?width=3036&format=png&auto=webp&s=d732b93ad24c43e79a3c3f70766135b23bbf7488Together, these two changes will make it significantly easier to manage your entire catalog of connectors as infrastructure in code, if this is preference for you and your team.

1kmnscz,"Been coding for 5ish years, talked to about a dozen beginners here - some real talk",SmopShark,learnprogramming,"Hi,I've been chatting with a bunch of beginners from this sub over the past couple months (like 12 of you lol), and thought I'd dump some thoughts on what actually matters when ur starting out. Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.**Stop obsessing about languages**Everyone's like ""which language should I learn???"" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff. JS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.**What companies acutally look for**I've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough. Your starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch. One of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**One legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes. If you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af? As for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.**Find ppl who get it**You need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click. Stack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better! I was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.**Just. Pick. Something**""People keep saying mixed things about X"" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru. Every ""wrong"" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time. Also don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.**The secret sauce**Consistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways.

1kpenmw,I made a cipher that uses the digits of π to encode messages!,Remarkable_Depth4933,learnprogramming,"Hi all, I recently created a fun cipher that encodes text using the digits of π. I thought it would be a cool way to explore string matching and character encoding in Python — and I'd love to get your thoughts or improvements!## How the cipher works:- Each character is converted to its ASCII value.- That number (as a string) is searched for in the digits of π (ignoring the decimal point).- The **starting index** of the first match and the **length** of the match are recorded.- Each character is encoded as `index-length`, separated by hyphens.### Example:The ASCII value of `'A'` is `65`. If `65` first appears in π at index **7** (π = 3.141592653... → digits = 141592653...), then it's encoded as:```7-2```---## Here’s an encrypted message:```11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2```---## And here’s the Python code to decode it:```pythonfrom mpmath import mpmp.dps = 100005 # digits of πpi_digits = str(mp.pi)[2:]cipher_text = ( ""11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2"")segments = cipher_text.strip().split(""-"")index_length_pairs = [ (int(segments[i]), int(segments[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(segments), 2)]decoded_chars = []for index, length in index_length_pairs: ascii_digits = pi_digits[index - 1 : index - 1 + length] decoded_chars.append(chr(int(ascii_digits)))decoded_message = """".join(decoded_chars)print(decoded_message)```---### Tutorial FlairThis post demonstrates how to decode a custom cipher based on the digits of π.

It was run out of a rented moldy residential house. The founder would hire students from university or young adults to literally drag and drop folders into specific drives and put on various USB sticks. For 8hrs a day. Yes I said drag and drop.Most people would just put on YouTube on headphones and like zombies drag and drop all day. (Wish I was making this up). These resources were used to help students in exam preparation. In the folders there where hundreds of different PDFs, PowerPoints, MCQ questions as well as thousands of csv files.She was in a perpetually panic to do this for unclear reasons. I guess they powered her website and her entire business.At the time I had no programming knowledge yet instinctively knew it could be done better. In my total ignorance I tried some some scripts in Javascript until she caught me and yelled at me to do my real job. Later I was let go for not being productive enough.I asked some nearby devs for help but they said they were too busy.Today I know an intern could have a Python script doing the main stuff inside a day with os.system, glob, a few for loops, csv libraries etc, pandas. Stick a chron job and it’s daily routine. Even better use Powershell / awk, see or grep.Better yet move everything to the cloud.The entire process could have automated inside a month when all edge cases where accounted for. There were some devs on front end but I think they hated her so much they didn’t intervene or didn’t get paid enough to care. They all left very rapidly I don’t blame them for claiming ignorance. The owner / founder was a psychotic bint.One time, a dev got validly angry about something unrelated about a development process and suddenly next week he was gone for ""operational reasons"".She paid 10-15 people minimum wage to do this drag and dropping for 2-3 years to best of my knowledge.

Runtime errors. So many times I couldn't 100% understand why something I am passing is not rendering and what the console errors mean, what is a type Object Object etc and since I got tired of starting and giving up I decided randomly to do a project with Typescript instead of JS and holy shit. All type errors get underlined right away and just copy pasting to AI and asking for an explanation gets to understand things like when you're using a reference or comparing a reference instead of a value instead of learning about it once you set everything up. So while it might be more work, what got me to truly enjoy writing web stuff is learning Typescript. If you know any typed language it is super quick to pick up, and if it's your first typed language you'll need a bit more time to get it but once you do you're not going back to vanilla JS.

I work at a small software house that maintains and develops a few internal apps and services.Lately, I’ve been feeling extremely frustrated with the direction my work has taken, and I’m not sure if I’m just being unrealistic or if this is genuinely a toxic environment. I’d love some outside perspective.When I started, I was trained in the company's main stack – NestJS (Node) and React – and I was excited to grow in that tech. But for the past few months, I’ve been doing tasks that have almost nothing to do with fullstack development:* Creating automations in low-code tools* Researching integrations with outdated platforms* Working in an 8-year-old PHP project (I had zero experience in PHP before)To make it worse, the PHP project has no proper security practices (e.g., passwords stored in plaintext in the database), and my suggestions for refactoring or rewriting it in our actual stack have been ignored.I'm currently split across 3 different projects and constantly bombarded with tasks from all sides. Meetings eat up a lot of time, and I’m falling behind. There’s barely any code review or mentorship, and I feel like I’m not learning or growing in the direction I want.On top of all that, I’m working for minimum wage in my country, which makes it even more discouraging -I’m putting in real effort but I feel like I’m getting very little in return, both in terms of compensation and career growth.I do have a backup plan (a non-IT job I could return to), but I’m hesitant to give up on development just yet. That said, the junior job market is rough, and I’m worried that if I leave now, I might end up searching for months before I find another dev position.So I'm stuck in this limbo — should I just accept that this is how things are in smaller companies and try to push through?

Anything a more perceptive programmer would be able to see just seeps right through me. The last ""big"" project I ever completed generated bingo boards from a template with random numbers for a friend's project.

My main preference is to **read books or documentation** rather than watching videos. I feel like books allow me to go at my own pace, re-read things, and properly think about what I’m learning. I’ve also heard from others that books usually explain things in more detail and depth compared to many tutorials.Here’s how I’m planning to approach it:1. First, I want to learn **general programming concepts** — like how code works, what happens behind the scenes, how computers interpret programs, memory, logic, etc.2. Then I’ll move on to **Python**, relearn it properly with all the basics and get confident with it.3. After that, I want to get into **C++**, so that I can understand things on a lower level and get better with performance, system-level thinking, etc.I'm also planning to go into **data structures and algorithms** in between, once I have a decent hold on Python.So I’m mainly looking for **book recommendations** (or any really well-explained resources) for:* Basics of coding and general programming logic* Beginner to intermediate Python* DSA (preferably in Python, but general ones are okay too)* A good path to learn C++ after Python* Clean code, writing good code, and long-term coding habitsIf there are any **video courses that explain things really well and in depth**, I’m open to them too, but my first preference will always be books.If anyone here has gone through a similar journey or prefers reading like me, I’d love to hear your experience and suggestions.

That it gets much harder. I have some doubts because I've never been interested in computers or tech per se. I'm not a 'nerd', for lack of a better term, in this sense, but I'm not sure to what extent that matters. It seems that most people want to do a certain thing and then learn to code as a consequence of that. But are there people who learn to code first then find their interests as a result of that?I get there's also the social aspect of the job; teams, hierarchy, scrums etc, but that likely wouldn't be a problem for me. In short, is enjoying the problem solving aspect of coding for its own sake a valid reason for choosing development as a career path?As a side note, I understand the market is dire everywhere right now (I'm a UK/EU citizen), but I'm not here for that.

1kom4ek,The myth of the STEM talent shortage,SingleInSeattle87,cscareerquestions,"https://issues.org/stem-workforce-shortage-data-hira/Data doesn't lie. Why is whenever I hear justification for H1B and STEM-OPT everywhere on mainstream media, and even codified in US law, court transcripts and policy discussions: they keep saying there's a shortage of STEM workers, especially tech workers and we need more immigrants to fill those roles. Why do we hear this all the time, but it's never actually supported by data?Further, the department of labor actually has a list of jobs known to be in shortage and it doesn't use biased industry reports to determine them: it uses its own data as well as BLS data. This list is called ""Schedule A"" and it allows employers to fast track immigrant visas into these occupations without needing to go through the H1B process.But the INA has this weird thing where if a prospective job pays under $60k the employer must recruit US workers first, but it does not offer that protection to jobs that pay over $60k or if the job requires a masters degree. Congress justified this, as saying jobs paying over $60k or requiring a masters is a reasonable proxy to a job that is in shortage. But it's not. Schedule A has existed for just as long as the H1B came about in 1990. This makes me question the purpose of the H1B in the first place.If the DOL has the ability to analyze the labor market and determine certain jobs are in dire need, and need skilled immigrant labor, and our those on a dynamic list every year, why do we have ""H1B"" at all? Why can't the actual jobs in shortage, be listed, and the jobs not in shortage have to prove they couldn't find a qualified US citizen before hiring an immigrant?It seems congress relied on industry lobbying and their ""facts"" rather than our own DOL and BLS.",401,0.9,200,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kom4ek/the_myth_of_the_stem_talent_shortage/,2025-05-17 06:09:20,2025-05-20 01:41:58

1klbjft,"PIP'd for not talking enough in meetings, apparently",cscqthrowaway16661,cscareerquestions,"I was hired at this company a few months ago, it's a larger startup with a few hundred employees, and I got in via the referral of a friend who works there, although he's in a different department. I was hired as a senior SWE but the impression I'm getting is that they basically wanted me to be a lead SWE instead. We have a principal on our team as well as a few juniors and midlevel, and essentially, they hired me not as an IC but I guess more of a manager of the juniors? The principal is too busy on multiple other teams and projects to really participate in our team, although he does sometimes.This all came to a head when a few weeks ago on the 1:1 the manager said I wasn't acting like I was the second in command so to speak, but I told them I felt hired as more of an IC and for the past few months before that, no one had communicated anything regarding managerial type work at all. Nevertheless, we agreed on some action items like me being more present in the Slack, doing more code reviews, mentoring the juniors (all of which I was doing already but I just started documenting them in a work log then), as well as creating tickets and assigning and delegating work, even if that means I do less overall IC work myself (but, isn't that what the managers and scrum masters are supposed to do? Why am I responsible for that part?). The 1:1 the week after that, they presented a PIP. The PIP itself is quite vague, it wants me to take more ""ownership"" and ""leadership"" of the project as I'm the only one on the team who can since the principal is so busy, part of which is talking more in meetings apparently. When I presented the action items I was already doing, they said it was a good start but I needed to do more, but they were very vague on what that actually meant, they couldn't really define it at all since it had nothing to do with concrete performance metrics like ""finished or didn't finish X tickets per sprint.""It said PIP on the document but I didn't sign anything and they didn't ask me to, they didn't even CC HR like a traditional PIP would be. It's a 30 day one so I have to improve in the next 4 weeks apparently but I honestly don't get what they even want from me and every time I ask, they can't tell me anything more concrete. Essentially I think they hired me as a senior SWE when they really wanted to hire a lead (or even an engineering manager), and now they're trying to make me do lead/principal level work for senior pay (I'd need probably another 50k for that to happen). It all seems so sudden, like only a couple weeks ago they tell me about these sudden new ""performance"" problems when the several months before since I joined, there had been no complaints in the 1:1s.So now I'm just injecting myself in the meetings and asking questions no matter how dumb they sound, and it seems like the manager is pleased but it's all just so dumb, they literally said that they don't know if I understand things when I'm not talking in the meetings; I'm not talking so I can listen to what the more experienced team members are saying (we have some outside contractors and the full time devs were hired to eventually replace them, but in domain knowledge, the contractors know more than we do, so I also think the manager is comparing us to them too).Edit: I think people here are assuming I'm not doing senior level ticket cutting and talking often to the principal on architecture and code choices, etc, I am, it's that they seem to want even more people management type work in that they want me to essentially manage the work of the juniors and check in with them every couple days which is fine and which is something I've been doing but somehow they want even more management out of me.",325,0.89,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1klbjft/pipd_for_not_talking_enough_in_meetings_apparently/,2025-05-13 02:59:04,2025-05-20 01:41:58

I make a sizeable amount of money, I work hybrid, and I get plenty of vacation. And yet I'm miserable.As the layoffs started, the company culture immediately rotted. I found myself pushing back on others' nonsensical, perf-driven demands. I was making decisions not for technical excellence but for less stressful approvals. I was constantly fighting off attempts to steal scope or credit. Then a coworker sabotaged my work and advertised to L7's how he already had a great plan to fix ""my"" mistakes. (He was promoted for this.)**I realized that a career in tech is not about good work or good skills. It's about politics, and it gets worse the more senior you get.** I spoke to some mid-level and senior friends, and they've all told me the same, with many of them questioning their careers too.I started not caring anymore about scalable architectures or sensible design decisions. I went looking for other jobs, then I realized nearly every big company is like this now, not just Amazon. I also realized quickly that all my cold applications were getting trashed without a look; only recruiter calls mattered. (Condolences to all the entry-level folks, it really is rough out there.)**More importantly, I started questioning the point of it all.** I pursued tech because I liked coding and designing. I liked the idea of working with others to build great things. And I liked the prospect of working anywhere in the world, and not being tied to a single company.But above all I wanted to make an impact. I wanted to build software that improved millions of lives. I planned to work my way up to senior in the private sector, save a lot of money, then take a pay cut to go work for the government or a public contractor. Then Elon Musk destroyed that path.Now, I was studying so hard to get an offer to do... what? Squeeze out 0.02% more ad revenue? Get more people addicted to gambling? Exploit more vulnerable children? Or build tools to let other companies better do those things? Because that's what most big tech companies are, and why they pay the big bucks.In college, I was a premed as well as a CS major. I had everything from lab research to volunteer hours, from the courses to the MCAT—all I had to do was send the med school applications. Then I chose to pursue tech instead. After years in the real world, I'm doubting my choice.**I'm not building things that matter. Most times, I'm not building at all.** Most of my time and energy is devoted to navigating office politics. I didn't sign up for this. I certainly can't imagine 30 more years in this career.I'm still searching for a new job. But if I don't get an offer in the next few months, I'll be studying again for the MCAT. (My old score expired—what a waste.)Medicine will be a long and tough road. I'll be working longer hours with less flexibility for somewhat less pay. But at least I'll be doing something that matters, something that makes me proud to go to work every morning.

1klkljz,"US Devs: Check Your ""The Work Number"" Report",Candid-Progress-1184,cscareerquestions,"When writing your resume and negotiating pay, be mindful that Equifax operates a database called The Work Number that contains info on past employers, titles, pay, etc for a huge number of employees in the US. I recently discovered my report was wrong: it claimed I was a 'payroll specialist' rather than a 'computer systems engineer' at a previous employer because the person filling out the form put their own title instead of mine... About half my previous employers have entered data into it, and I have a feeling it might be integrated into modern HR tooling and ERP systems.Definitely check your report and make sure no one jacked up your previous title, pay, etc. Receiving a copy of any consumer credit report, including these ones, is free. My current employer tells them about every single one of my paychecks, so keep in mind future employers might literally be able to see when you got your raises too. If you're as cautious as I am, you probably want to make sure the titles listed on your resume at least bear a passing resemblance to the ones in the report so it doesn't set off alarm bells for HR folks who don't understand tech title equivalence. If you're considering overemployment, note that both roles could show up on the report.There are many other organizations that claim to provide info like this: I contacted the top 100 and no one else had any data on me, so I think The Work Number is far and away the most popular.It's possible to freeze your report just like any other credit report, but keep in mind this might look suspicious.Anyway, just be mindful that this stuff is out there and people have easy access to it. I think employers are technically supposed to tell you when the contents of a credit report are used against you, but it's impossible to enforce since they can just say nothing. You can get bad data removed for free as long as the employer either agrees it was wrong or just doesn't respond when Equifax contacts them.Stay safe and aware out there, folks.EDIT: Turns out they still have to get your consent before pulling this info, which occurs as part of the background check phase. Thanks to u/mediocreDev313 for the clarification!EDIT2: I just pulled up my report to double-check what all is on it. The report can include:Union affiliation, worker's comp award dates, reason for termination, base pay, overtime, commission, bonuses, holiday pay, pension income, severance, vested stock, stick and vacation pay, tips, hours worked for each individual pay period, garnishments, cafeteria plan fees, next projected date and amount of pay increase, last date and amount of pay increase, payroll deduction for insurance coverage, reasons for insurance ineligibility, insurance coverage level, number of covered dependents on insurance, and COBRA participation.EDIT3: Here's the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's list of consumer reporting agencies, contact details, and links to freeze your various reports: [files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb\_consumer-reporting-companies-list\_2023.pdf](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-reporting-companies-list_2023.pdf)",118,0.94,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1klkljz/us_devs_check_your_the_work_number_report/,2025-05-13 12:25:40,2025-05-20 01:41:58

The other two devs before me were in India. I was the only dev in the US (during working hours) for over a year before finally getting a second US full-stack dev (then a third and fourth front-end). Today, the small startup where I knew everyone's' name ended up getting bought out and had money pumped into it that ended up making it grow exponentially. Now I only see maybe 5% of who work in my company regularly. Because of my circumstanced, I have been categorized as the ""Go-To Person"" for getting stuff fixed or done in my company during the working hours.Before we were bought out, I already had that reputation, being the longest standing dev on the US side. I would get pings from people every couple hours that needed assistance in something they were working on, or needed someone with ""expert knowledge"" on the software in a quick meeting. I was able to balance this with my own work decent enough to still be able to get my work done in a reasonable time. But since our side of the company got exponentially bigger since being bought out, now I get pings ever 15 - 30 min some days and my schedule has been loaded with meetings that require that dev with ""expert knowledge"", even though most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I'm good at figuring it out though).Because of this, my productivity is shot. Tickets that should take 2 - 3 days are taking a week or more sometimes. I've talked to my manager over the last year about this and we have made an ""Ask a Dev"" channel for questions that aren't urgent (which has filtered out the obvious and obviously dumb questions that are asked from being asked), urgent stuff now gets filtered through the scrum master which she divides up between me and the only other full-stack that works during the workday, and we've preached, multiple times to not contact any dev directly, even though this only lasts for a little while before everyones ""Super Urgent!"" problem finds its way to my teams chat directly... again...So take this as a warning. Don't become the ""Go-To Person"" of your company/division/team if you want to keep your sanity. Edit: Spelling/grammer errors.

1kmt77j,I have a degree from 2006 but no experience. Could a bootcamp help?,CronoDAS,cscareerquestions,"I'm 42 years old. In 2006 I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in computer engineering, but I hated my classes (especially the EE circuits and signal processing ones) and was totally burned out by the time I graduated. Instead of joining the formal workforce, I've spent the last 20 years being an unpaid family caregiver for sick relatives. I literally haven't written a single line of code since graduation, and the only programming languages I've used were BASIC as a kid, Perl during an internship between high school and college, and C and C++ during school - and C++ was only taught as ""C with classes"" with no mention of the Standard Template Library or any other library besides ""iostream.h"", so if I wanted to try to get a job in tech, I'd need to learn something people actually use today, such as Python, Java, or perhaps even R for data science and statistics. (I'm within commuting distance of NYC and the finance industry hires a lot of computer people.) I've also used SQL but forgotten almost all of it.Anyway, all the sick relatives I'd been taking care of died last year (including my wife :sad_but_relieved_face:), so I need to find something else to do with my life. I have enough financial leeway that I won't actually need to work for quite a while, and I thought that if I wanted to pursue programming as a career, a (hopefully reputable) bootcamp might be a good option, because it would help me get up to speed on modern development and create a portfolio to show to potential employers. I'm also not particularly self-motivated or disciplined, so trying to learn on my own, without a structured program that has deadlines, wouldn't be my first choice of approach; if going to a physical classroom is an option, I would really prefer it over an online-only program because I'd be less likely to flake.

I was hired as developer in a project for a client from finance/fintech industry. The project was postponed or never started, and I've spent my entire time in there doing absolutely nothing, however I was told that they will find replacement project for me eventually, then 1 month before the end of my employment contract I was suggested to look for another job as they won't extend my employment. Can't say that I didn't expect that after few months of doing nothing, but I was really pissed off. At the time I could already be part of some nice project, get the know-how and be really productive in some other company.**2024 was my worst year in the industry in terms of looking for a new job, I was unemployed for few months after that company.**Now my current position - the same story. Very similiar IT Indian company, I won't give you any names but there is a few of them so you can probably figure it out. I was hired as backend dev at the beginning of the year, and so far I had few internal interviews for the various projects, but I don't even get feedback from them.**As I learned from my previous experience I have found another job as the contractor in the bank and I'm doing great here.**My employment in the do-nothing-company terminates in few months and I'm not resigning until they actually try put me on a project.

I'm still a beginner in the industry and in this very crowded market on every single interview everyone asks me about my experience in all the companies I've been working for - **I don't want to lie on my resume, but I also don't want to tell my interviewer that professionally I was not engaged in any project/team since the end of 2023, and why I am jumping between companies after barely 6 months of employment.**So, do you have experience like this? I know that sometimes you just sit on the bench as a contractor, but this is other situation and often after some time you just stop getting paid. Here I was full time employed, got paid and contributed absolutely nothing, twice. I probably won't even mention my current do-nothing-company on my CV.I'm sick of companies that are looking for developer while not having any position for them. And I completely understand that this is kind of a privilige nowadays and sounds like a dream job for many people, but in IT every year of your experience counts, and If you was hired on paper but got nothing from it, then it's going to turn out terribly for you in the future. Of course in both of those companies I tried to utilize my time and try to learn/work with new things on my own, but this is not the same.

It's been tough even getting interviews but I've had 4 so far and advanced to the final round of one of them, but unfortunately didn't get it. Last week on Monday for some reason I had 4 recruiters reach out to me for a HR Interview/ call. They were all rlly cool/big companies so I got my hopes up. Each Recruiter on the call told me they would like to schedule a technical round with me for the next week and that I would soon be getting an email to schedule that technical interview. All of them told me I'd get the email for further steps in 1-2 days after the call, but after waiting an extra day for each I respectfully followed up with the recruiters and got no response from all 3. I have one more interview coming up from the last recruiter, but idk how this one's gonna go cuz my resume is the most different from this job so im just studying up as much as i can.

1kqmlek,"""Not an Engineer"" - Limited Growth Opportunities Because of CS Degree Title",SouthMouth79,cscareerquestions,"I graduated in May 2023 with a Computer Science degree from a well respected program. Like many others in my class, it was tough landing a full-time role in this market. I did some contract work for a while until I was recently hired full-time as a “Controls and Automation Specialist”. A basic summary of what my division in the company does is that we install and program factory computers.I didn’t think much of the title of the role before starting; it wasn’t heavily stressed as a distinguishing factor in the interview, job posting, or any further correspondence with the company. It wasn’t until I started that I came to understand that there is a significant distinction between “Specialists” and “Engineers” in my division. Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, not just computer related, but from my current understanding, C+A Engineers have more career mobility within the company as well as higher salaries, even in entry-level roles.When I asked about the difference, I was told that because I have a “Computer Science” degree, I’m not considered an engineer and can’t be billed to clients as one. I thought this might be a regional thing, that software engineering isn’t yet considered “real” engineering in the southeast. But today I found out that one of our interns is titled an engineer but is pursuing a degree in Software Engineering; a degree that differs from Computer Science at their university by a single required course (Software Security).I have plenty of CS grad friends that went on to become Software Engineers, so I didn’t expect the wording of my degree to limit my role like this. I really like my coworkers, the work that I do, and the company I work for. I genuinely pictured myself being part of the company for the long-term. But it’s been hard not to feel like I’m missing out on long-term growth simply because of a technicality in how my education is labeled.Has anyone else run into this kind of title/pay/growth ceiling based on your degree title? Would love to hear how others have navigated this or similar situations, or just general suggestions or opinions on how to proceed.TLDR:CS grad working in controls/automation was told I can't hold an ""Engineer"" title, or access related pay and growth, because my degree isn’t labeled “Engineering,” despite doing similar work.

1kmngzs,I think the common theme today in this field is management is a problem and frankly needs to be automated out of existence.,Legitimate-mostlet,cscareerquestions,"I am finding that most problems in this field are coming from management. They either have unrealistic goals or deadlines. They also are filled with people with zero technical knowledge on how any of this stuff works.This is why you see posts like ""we are going to double work output with this AI tool and expect it"". Or you will see in work places arbitrary deadlines set by management and no real flexibility around these deadlines nor any data backing up how they came to the conclusion how that deadline was reached.First, I think developers need to stop making up for managements lack of skill. Make them either descope work, extend deadlines, or hire more people if they have unrealistic deadlines. Do not work overtime for a company that is not going to pay you extra to do so and will lay you off even if you work extra time for them.Second, I think most companies would be better off if they automated away most of these positions. I think it would lead to more realistic deadlines, less unreasonable requests to developers, less missed deadlines or poor coding practices because realistic deadlines would be in place, and an all around better experience for everyone including investors.I think this should be the new movement.

1kpjo1q,My internship is offering me an ambitious full-time role and I’m nervous,motuwed,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Interned at a non-tech company for 1.5 years, recently got offered a part-time-to-full-time software dev role on their AI use case team. Super excited, but nervous since there’s no real junior dev pipeline or formal training, and I’m jumping straight from student to full-time dev in a small team that mostly hires experienced people.I interned at this company for about 1.5 years with 8 moths full-time and the rest part-time.During that time, I worked on a pretty wide range of stuff: manually testing new software, creating architectural diagrams, documenting codebases, and toward the end, helping a new AI team build web apps with AI-driven features.It’s been about two months since the internship ended. When I wrapped up, there was talk of a full-time offer closer to graduation (which is in August). But recently, they reached out and said they’d actually like to offer me a position now—starting part-time, then moving to full-time after I graduate. I asked about the role, and they said “AI Developer,” which basically just means I’d be a software dev on the AI use case team (so not data science or ML).I’m super excited because I loved the team environment and like most of us our dream is software dev. That said, I’m also nervous.This company isn’t a tech company, it’s actually pretty far from one. And because of that, the structure is a bit different. There’s not really a formal junior engineer pipeline or training program. Most people get hired with several years of experience already under their belt. I do know a couple folks who came in a year or two after graduating, but even then, it was through a setup where they’d already been doing independent contract work for a while.I know I’m a strong developer, and I learn quickly, but I also know I benefit a lot from structure and guidance. Obviously working with the team towards the end of my internship did give me SOME experience, but I still feel like the jump from student to full time dev is massive and I’m worried about working in an environment that might not have that change in the forefront of their mind. Especially given that the team I’d join only has a handful of developers (maybe 3).",17,0.85,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kpjo1q/my_internship_is_offering_me_an_ambitious/,2025-05-18 13:12:48,2025-05-20 01:41:58

Generally work on applying LLM and graph neural networks to social science problems. Applied for a PhD research intern position.1. Got OA, it was dumb as fuck. Had to download and play games in Roblox. They're basically iq tests where you had to do like factory optimization and design cars to cross obstacle courses or whatever. I was just like fuck it and got basically a 0 on the first game and gave up on the rest because it wasn't worth the effort lol. 2. Recruiter schedules a call with me and basically tells me I'm moving on to the interview calls. Tells me to just redo the OAs for completion and basically that the scores don't matter. I guess they do resume screening before OA results and if your experience is relevant enough they don't care lmao. 3. Get a crappy score on the second game, and third OA segment is a bunch of behavioral scenarios, like ""your boss is wrong about something, how do you approach the situation"". No coding OA, interestingly. 4. Had a thirty minute behavioral round with pretty standard questions, ""tell me about a project where you had a different approach than stakeholders wanted"", etc etc. 5. 45 minute coding round. Really easy? I feel like I've seen other internship reports where people are getting LC hards, maybe they make it easier for the research positions. Question was basically valid parentheses but you also had to handle quote strings. Seemed like it focused more on like communication and figuring out how to handle edge cases. 6. Then they scheduled a ML deep dive with the hiring manager. 1 hour, I basically presented a few of my papers and they asked pretty detailed questions about how I made specific training/dataset/evaluation questions. Lots of reflection on what I could've done differently etc. I really enjoyed this round, it felt like a very good way to measure expertise and ML depth. 7. Whole process took place over 2-3 weeks, very efficient, quick feedback and scheduling of next rounds. I got the official offer 3 business days after the last round. Overall very good process! Much easier than I expected, but it's possible they identified a research fit and wanted to hurry the process along a bit lol.

""What type of item do you need to do ABC? I have no idea but let me ask a real store employee, 1 sec.""2. I've had store employees treat me harshly upon meeting me because I'm a fake store employee just there for a day, I'm taking time away from them doing their regular stuff while they explain stuff to me, etc... and I also think some resent the salary discrepancy. Sometimes someone will tell me that their family member makes X amount of money and I don't say anything but I'm thinking ""I never asked, I'm just here to comply and keep my job"".3. None of the things that the store employees complain about are something that I even have any power whatsoever to change or fix. It's just not something that my team or department works on.

Eight months ago, I had a solid foundation in Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, along with frameworks like React and Spring Boot. Since then, I’ve added multi-cloud experience, DevOps, and AI concepts like RAG.Very rarely I’d gone through complete interview processes: submissions, interviews, take-homes, technical rounds, only to get ghosted or declined.

Problem is it’s not an engineering role. All I do is data mappings (column(s) in this table goes to columns in that table, these tables join to make that table, etc) which is basically all done in Visio. My manager won’t let me be hands on keyboard because “That is what we pay the offshore contractors for”. I really really miss coding and actually building stuff. I work on my own side projects and stuff but it’s not the same. I have been applying like crazy for months now but I only got one OA and heard nothing back. I also get hit up all the time for contract roles from recruiters but after I send my resume it never goes anywhere. I can spin my current role as a programming role but it’s sorta limited and not impressive.My question is how long do I have to find an actual engineering role before I’m past the point of no return?

1kmlvqm,"I'm the only dev in a small firm, with a CS degree and 2 YoE overall. I think I'm going to have to try to jump ship after only 3 months in my new job. Any advice / suggestions?",double-happiness,cscareerquestions,"I'm 52, not from a STEM background and only graduated in CS at age 49 (full backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11g5wjf/graduated_in_cs_at_age_49_but_ive_ended_up_doing/)). After circa 800 applications and about a dozen interviews I finally got a role with the UK Civil Service for nearly 2 years, initially as a Trainee Software Engineer on a fixed-term contract at £22K, but managed to get a slight promotion into another fixed-term contract as Junior Software Engineer and was on £27K by the time my contract was due to expire. (There was no chance of renewal as it was maternity cover). I made over 100 applications but only had one offer, this time as Software Engineer for a small firm in the renewable energy installation sector. The range was stated to be £35K - £50K; they only offered £36K but with no other offers and only 1 week left of my contract I thought I had better take what I could get. (Worth bearing in mind that AFAIK Scotland and the North doesn't tend to offer anything like the salaries one tends to get in London anyway though).On my very first day they made 5 people redundant but I was told not to worry as my salary was paid for out of grant money. Obviously that raises the question what's going to happen when the grant money runs out. I should say I am the only SWE and there are no IT staff at all, just installers, operations, and sales people basically. My supervisor and myself didn't hit it off very well and things were a bit tense trying to work out exactly what they wanted me to do. It was all quite nebulous and completely different from the Civil Service as you might expect. No tickets, no version control in place, basically just 'here's your laptop and this is what we want'. They want me to build an API aggregator that brings together API services from a number of different renewable energy manufacturers (that's what the grant money is for). I was sharing an office with an 'actual' engineer (i.e. an electrical engineer), but he left for another firm that was going to give him better training / certs. Seemingly they wouldn't give him a £3K raise and amazingly it turned out he was on even less than me, even though he had far more responsibility and went out on jobs and all sorts.I have built this whole web application for them in TS/JS/Node/React/Express. I have used a certain amount of AI (mainly Claude, also Perplexity) to help me along, but in fairness I now have no senior dev to turn to for advice. I have actually found it helps my learning quite a bit and I ask it tons of learning questions instead of just blindly copy-pasting. In fact I sometimes tell it *not* to give me any code, but just advice/guidance. I have pushed it all to a GitHub repo but so far it has not been deployed. It is about 100 or so files, thousands of lines of code, takes in 3 different APIs, does both local and browser DB stuff, and has a lot of unit tests written in Jest. If I say so myself it is pretty neat and everyone who has seen it has been impressed. It is dead fast and has a lot of error handling. The UI is only so-so as that's not really my forte, but I've seen worse.The problems are many though. The low salary, almost total lack of job security, no bank holidays (WTF?), and now my supervisor has really started to become quite unpleasant. Yesterday he totally bit my head off because I had the temerity to ask if I had now got through my probation OK, since that was due to finish on the 10th. He accused me of being 'irritable', said I must have been 'dwelling on it', and that apparently I should have been 'proactive' and mentioned it earlier. The last I think is total nonsense as I was patiently waiting for him to tell me the probation was done. To my mind it could have come across as quite premature to bring it up prior to the date. When I showed him some code I had written he said 'there must be an easier way of doing it than that', which I thought was tantamount to saying I had gone about it the long way. OFC he never stated what the easier way might be. Seemingly he did some MATLAB back in the day but doesn't like other languages because they use 0-indexing for arrays (SMH). Yesterday he came in, I asked him how he was, but he didn't reciprocate and said nothing at all to me for 3-4 hours, literally not a word. It was only when I asked him about the probation he then kicked off.The owner (who sits in the office next to mine) is fine and I get along with him no problem. The other office staff are OK but I feel totally out of it as they are focussed on sales and installations, and I just have almost no sense of being part of a team like I at least somewhat had in CS. There I had so little to do, I felt like a substitute sat on the bench on the sidelines, but at least I was around other devs who were mainly very supportive in my 'learning journey'. Being an older entrant into the IT sector (I couldn't even afford a PC until I got a hand-me-down in my late 20s) is not always easy, as you might imagine.So WTH am I gonna do? Try to brush up [my CV](https://i.imgur.com/JzEFPuP.png) and just start applying, I guess? Trying to move on after 3 months seems like a big ask. There are only limited opportunities in southern Scotland and fully remote, and I am not at all willing to sell my home (again), especially after only 7 months here. I use all [these sites](https://i.imgur.com/g8ggTlb.png) and find LinkedIn never even gets me so much as an interview. I have previously sent a lot of CVs to recruiters and built up a quite big list of their contacts. I have nearly 250 connections on LinkedIn with a lot of recruiters and devs. Having made nearly 1000 applications in the last 2.5 years I know what to do but the 3 months is a big problem, right?!?TIA for any (constructive) advice.Edit to add: one thing that did occur to me is maybe I should lean into the situation and ask for more money.

Should i go ahead and just take it ? would that make the most sense since I have a contracting role and the role is about to end in september ? i was thinking of using my offer as leverage to get a FT role but was hoping to get an idea of what the community thought thanks !",5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kpsd5w/got_a_job_at_my_previous_employer_after_having/,2025-05-18 19:35:02,2025-05-20 01:41:58
