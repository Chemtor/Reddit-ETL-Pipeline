1mw70hb,My friend just inherited a data infrastructure built by a guy who left 3 months ago… and it’s pure chaos,UnusualRuin7916,dataengineering,"So this xyz company had a guy who built the entire data infrastructure on his own but with zero documentation, no version control, and he named tables like temp_2020, final_v3, and new_final_latest.Pipelines? All manually scheduled cron jobs spread across 3 different servers. Some scripts run in Python 2, some in Bash, some in SQL procedures. Nobody knows why.He eventually left the company… and now they hired my friend to take over.On his first week:He found a random ETL job that pulls data from an API… but the API was deprecated 3 years ago and somehow the job still runs.Half the queries are 300+ lines of nested joins, with zero comments.Data quality checks? Non-existent. The check is basically “if it fails, restart it and pray.”Every time he fixes one DAG, two more fail somewhere else.Now he spends his days staring at broken pipelines, trying to reverse-engineer this black box of a system.

Otherwise, companies are just benching you or don’t care. I used to chase on 4th day for a response, if I don’t hear back, I never chased.5) Speed : Apply to jobs posted within a week and move faster in the process. Candidates who move fast have high chances to get job.

Another problem in the project was, the data is full of PII information that only the data owner can access the data. We, the data engineers that doing the migration do not have any permission to see the production data. Hence for development, we rely on sandbox env of the SaaS app that filled with dummy data and just hope it will works in production.

1mx05yq,"Is there possible to develop an OS for DB specific, for performance?",Motor_Crew7918,dataengineering,"The idea of a ""Database OS"" has been a sort of holy grail for decades, but it's making a huge comeback for a very modern reason.My colleagues and I just had a paper on this exact topic accepted to SIGMOD 2025. I can share our perspective.**TL;DR: Yes, but not in the way you might think. We're not replacing Linux. We're giving the database a safe, hardware-assisted ""kernel mode"" of its own, inside a normal Linux process.**# The Problem: The OS is the New Slow DiskFor years, the motto was ""CPU waits for I/O."" But with NVMe SSDs hitting millions of IOPS and microsecond latencies, the bottleneck has shifted. Now, very often, the **CPU is waiting for the OS**.The Linux kernel is a marvel of general-purpose engineering. But that ""general-purpose"" nature comes with costs: layers of abstraction, context switches, complex locking, and safety checks. For a high-performance database, these are pure overhead.Database devs have been fighting this for years with heroic efforts:* Building their own buffer pools to bypass the kernel's page cache.* Using io\_uring to minimize system calls.But these are workarounds. We're still fundamentally ""begging"" the OS for permission. We can't touch the real levers of power: direct page table manipulation, interrupt handling, or privileged instructions.# The Two ""Dead End"" SolutionsThis leaves us with two bad choices:1. **""Just patch the Linux kernel.""** This is a nightmare. You're performing surgery on a 30-million-line codebase that's constantly changing. It's incredibly risky (remember the recent CrowdStrike outage?), and you're now stuck maintaining a custom fork forever.2. **""Build a new OS from scratch (a Unikernel).""** The idealistic approach. But in reality, you're throwing away 30+ years of the Linux ecosystem: drivers, debuggers (gdb), profilers (perf), monitoring tools, and an entire world of operational knowledge. No serious production database can afford this.# Our ""Third Way"": Virtualization for Empowerment, Not Just IsolationHere's our breakthrough, inspired by the classic [Dune paper (OSDI '12)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Fconference%2Fosdi12%2Ftechnical-sessions%2Fpresentation%2Fbelay). We realized that hardware virtualization features (like Intel VT-x) can be used for more than just running VMs. They can be used to **grant a single process temporary, hardware-sandboxed kernel privileges.**Here's how it works:* Your database starts as a normal Linux process.* When it needs to do something performance-critical (like manage its buffer pool), it executes a special instruction and ""enters"" a guest mode.* In this mode, it becomes its own mini-kernel. It has its own page table, can handle certain interrupts, and can execute privileged instructions—all with hardware-enforced protection. If it screws up, it only crashes itself, not the host system.* When it needs to do something generic, like send a network packet, it ""exits"" and hands the request back to the host Linux kernel to handle.This gives us the best of both worlds:* **Total Control:** We can re-design core OS mechanisms specifically for the database's needs.* **Full Linux Ecosystem:** We're still running on a standard Linux kernel, so we lose nothing. All the tools, drivers, and libraries still work.* **Hardware-Guaranteed Safety:** Our ""guest kernel"" is fully isolated from the host.# Two Quick, Concrete Examples from Our PaperThis new freedom lets us do things that were previously impossible in userspace:1. **Blazing Fast Snapshots (vs. fork()):** Linux's fork() is slow for large processes because it has to copy page tables and set up copy-on-write with reference counting for every single shared memory page. In our guest kernel, we designed a simple, epoch-based mechanism that ditches per-page reference counting entirely. **Result: We can create a snapshot of a massive buffer pool in milliseconds.**2. **Smarter Buffer Pool (vs. mmap):** A big reason database devs hate mmap is that evicting a page requires unmapping it, which can trigger a ""TLB Shootdown."" This is an expensive operation that interrupts every other CPU core on the machine to tell them to flush that memory address from their translation caches. It's a performance killer. In our guest kernel, the database can directly manipulate its own page tables and use the INVLPG instruction to **flush the TLB of only the local core**. Or, even better, we can just leave the mapping and handle it lazily, eliminating the shootdown entirely.So, to answer your question: a full-blown ""Database OS"" that replaces Linux is probably not practical. But a **co-designed system where the database runs its own privileged kernel code in a hardware-enforced sandbox** is not only possible but also extremely powerful.We call this paradigm ""Privileged Kernel Bypass.""If you're interested, you can check out the work here:* **Paper:** Zhou, Xinjing, et al. ""Practical db-os co-design with privileged kernel bypass."" SIGMOD (2025). (I'll add the link once it's officially in the ACM Digital Library, but you can find a preprint if you search for the title).* **Open-Source Code:** [https://github.com/zxjcarrot/libdbos](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzxjcarrot%2Flibdbos)Happy to answer any more questions",35,0.93,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mx05yq/is_there_possible_to_develop_an_os_for_db/,2025-08-22 07:41:04,2025-08-26 01:39:33

I went with a small dataset here for the demo, but you can push limits and create your own benchmarks to test how the system performs under real conditions.And while the guide uses MySQL as the starting point, it’s flexible you can just as easily plug in Postgres or other sources.If you’ve been trying to build a lakehouse stack yourself something that’s open source and not too inclined towards one vendor this guide can give you a good start.Check out the blog and let me know if you’d like me to dive deeper into this by testing out different query engines in a detailed series, or if I should share my benchmarks in a later thread.

Run the entire dev environment in the browser via GitHub Codespaces (or Docker + VS Code for local).2. A live postgres database with real-world data sourced from an API that you can query.3. Implement your own data contract spec so you learn how they work.4. Implement changes via database migration files, detect those changes, and surface data contract violations via unit tests.5. Run CI/CD workflows via GitHub actions to test for data contract violations (using only metadata) and alert when a violation is detected via a comment on the pull request.This is the first draft and will go through additional edits as the publisher and technical reviewers provide feedback.

1mx0je0,Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg : What's the better approach for ML pipelines and batch analytics?,datazipinc,dataengineering,"We recently took a dive into comparing Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg, especially for batch analytics and ML pipelines, and I wanted to share some findings in a practical way. The blog post we wrote goes into detail, but here’s a quick rundown and the approach we took and the things we covered: First off, both formats bring serious warehouse-level power to data lakes think ACID transactions, time travel, and easy schema evolution.That’s huge for ETL, feature engineering, and reproducible model training. Some of the key points we explored: \-Firstly, the delta Lake’s copy-on-write mechanism and the new Deletion Vectors (DVs) feature, which streamlines updates and deletes (especially handy for update-heavy streaming). ﻿ \- Iceberg’s more flexible approach with your position/equality deletes and a hierarchical metadata model for a fast query planning even across a lot(millions) of files. \- We also covered the partitioning strategies where we have Delta’s Liquid Clustering and Iceberg’s true partition evolution and they let you optimize your data as it grows.  \- Most importantly for us was the ecosystem integration iceberg is super engine-neutral, with rich support across Spark, Flink, Trino, BigQuery, Snowflake, and more. Delta is strongest with Spark/Databricks, but OSS support is evolving. \-Case studies went a long way too where we have doordash saved up to 40% on costs migrating to Iceberg, mainly through better storage and resource use.Refer  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRKHEA8-3bYFinal) thoughts: \- Go Iceberg if you want max flexibility, cost savings, and governance neutrality. \- Go Delta if you’re deep in Databricks, want managed features, and real-time/streaming is critical.We covered operational realities too, like setup and table maintenance, so if you’re looking for hands-on experience, I think you’ll find some actionable details.

This means that the data engine needed really good cloud storage support as well as maintaining a stable rate of async requests.* **Reliability beats raw throughput:** retries at this scale/with GPU hardware are extremely expensive, so streaming execution and overall system health is incredibly important* **Seamless scaling from local → distributed** meant faster iteration and debugging - developer experience for building these pipelines is really important!Turns out that AI/ML is still a big data problem :)The Daft team is also going to be taking a lot of what we learned from this collaboration and baking it into open source.

I’ve been working as a Data Analyst for about a year, but I recently switched jobs and landed in a company that has zero data infrastructure or reporting. I was brought in to establish both sides: create an organized database (pulling together all the scattered Excel files) and then build out dashboards and reporting templates. To be fair, the reason I got this opportunity is less about being a seasoned data engineer and more about my analyst background + the fact that my boss liked my overall vibe/approach. That said, I’m honestly really hyped about the data engineering part — I see a ton of potential here both for personal growth and to build something properly from scratch (no legacy mess, no past bad decisions to clean up). The company isn’t huge (about 50 people), so the data volume isn’t crazy — probably tens to hundreds of GB — but it’s very dispersed across departments. Everything we use is Microsoft ecosystem. Here’s the approach I’ve been leaning toward (based on my reading so far): Excels uploaded to SharePoint → ingested into ADLS Set up bronze/silver/gold layersUse Azure Data Factory (or Synapse pipelines) to move/transform data Use Purview for governance/lineage/monitoring Publish reports via Power BIPossibly separate into dev/test/prod environments Regarding data management, I was thinking of keeping a OneNote Notebook or Sharepoint Site with most of the rules and documentation and a diagram.io where I document the relationships and all the fields.My questions for you all: Does this approach make sense for a company of this size, or am I overengineering it?

1mzzeoq,Why aren’t incremental pipelines commonly built using MySQL binlogs for batch processing?,BankEcstatic8883,dataengineering,"Hi all,I’m curious about the apparent gap in tooling around using database transaction logs (like MySQL binlogs) for **incremental batch processing**.In our organization, we currently perform incremental loads directly from tables, relying on timestamp or “last modified” columns. This approach works, but it’s error-prone — for example, manual updates or overlooked changes sometimes don’t update these columns, causing data to be missed in our loads.On the other hand, there are many streaming CDC solutions (Debezium, Kafka Connect, AWS DMS) that consume binlogs, but they feel overkill for small teams and require substantial operational overhead.This leads me to wonder: why isn’t there a **more lightweight, batch-oriented binlog reader and parser** that could be used for incremental processing? Are there any existing tools or libraries that support this use case that I might be missing? I’m not considering commercial solutions like Fivetran due to cost constraints.Would love to hear thoughts, experiences, or pointers to any open-source approaches in this space.Thanks in advance!",5,0.79,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mzzeoq/why_arent_incremental_pipelines_commonly_built/,2025-08-25 19:01:45,2025-08-26 01:39:33
1mx4yzr,Is my Airflow implementation scalable for processing 1M+ profiles per run?,hzburki,dataengineering,"> I plan to move all my business logic to a separate API service and call endpoints using the HTTPOperator. Lesson learned! Please focus on my concerns and alternate solutions. I would like to get more opinions. I have created a pipeline using Airflow which will process social media profiles. I need to update their data and insert new content (videos/images) into our database.I will test it to see if it handles the desired load but it will cost money to host and pay the external data providers so I want to get a second opinion on my implementation.I have to run to run the pipeline periodically and process a lot of profiles;1. Daily: 171K profiles2. Two Weeks: 307K profiles3. One Month: 1M profiles4. Three Months: 239K profiles5. Six Months: 506K profiles6. Twelve Months: 400K profilesThese are the initial numbers. They will be increased gradually over the next year so I will have time and a team to work on scaling the pipeline. The daily profiles have to be completed the same day. The rest can take longer to complete. I have split the pipeline into 3 DAGs. I am using hooks/operators for S3, SQS and postgres. I am also using asyncio with aiohttp for storing multiple content on s3. ## DAG 1 (Dispatch)- Runs on a fixed schedule- fetches data from database based on the provided filters. - Splits data into individual rows, one row per creator using `.expand`. - Use dynamic task mapping with TriggerDagRunOperator to create a DAG to process each profile separately. - I also set the task_concurrency to limit parallel task executions. ## DAG 2 (Process)- Triggered by DAG 1- Get params from the first DAG- Fetches the required data from external API- Formats response to match database columns + small calculations e.g. posting frequency, etc. - Store content on S3 + updates formatted response. - Stores messages (1 per profile) in SQS. ## DAG 3 (Insert)- Polls SQS every 5 mins- Get multiple messages from SQS - Bulk insert into database- Delete multiple messages from SQS ## ConcernsI feel like the implementation will work well apart from two things.1) In DAG 1 I am fetching all the data e.g. max 1 million ids plus a few extra fields and loading them into the python operator before its split into individual rows per creator. I am doubtful that this my cause memory issues because the amount of rows is large but the data size should not be more than a few MBs. 2) In DAG 1 on tasks 2 and 3, splitting the data into separate processes for each profile will trigger 1 million DAG runs. I have set the concurrency limit to control the amount of parallel runs but I am unsure if Airflow can handle this. Keep in mind there is no heavy processing. All tasks are small, with the longest one taking less than 30 seconds to upload 90 videos + images on S3. All my code on Airflow and I plan to deploy to AWS ECS with auto-scaling. I have not figured out how to do that yet. ## Alternate SolutionsAn alternative I can think of is to create a ""DAG 0"" before DAG 1, which fetches the data and uploads batches into SQS. The current DAG 1 will pull batches from SQS e.g. 1,000 profiles per batch and create dynamic tasks as already implemented. This way I should be able to control the number of dynamic DAG runs in Airflow. A second option is that I don't create dynamic DAG runs for each profile but a batch of 1,000 to 5,000 profiles. I don't think this is a good idea because;1) It will create a very long task if I have to loop through all profiles to process them.2) I will likely need to host it separately in a container.3) Right now, I can see which profiles fail, why, when and where in DAG 2.I would like to keep things as simple as possible. I also have to figure out how and where to host the pipeline and how much resources to provision to handle the daily profiles target but these are problems for another day.Thank you for reading :D",9,0.8,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mx4yzr/is_my_airflow_implementation_scalable_for/,2025-08-22 12:20:31,2025-08-26 01:39:33
1mwyp8p,Best practice for key management in logical data vault model?,Crazy-Sir5935,dataengineering,"Hi all, First of all, i'm a beginner.Currently, were using a low code tool for our transformations but planning to migrate to a SQL/python first solution. We're applying data vault although we sometimes abuse it as in that besides strict link, hub and sats, we throw bridge tables in the mix. One of the issues we currently see in our transformations is that links are dependent on keys/hashes of other objects (that's natural i would say). Most of the time, we fill the hash of the object in the same workflow as the corresponding id key column in the link table. Yet, this creates a soup of dependencies and doesn't feel that professional.The main solution we're thinking off is to make use of a keychain. We would define all the keys of the objects on basis of the source tables (which we call layer 1 tables, i believe it would be called bronze right?). and fill the keychain first before running any layer 2/silver transformations. This way, we would have a much clearer approach in handling keys without making it a jungle of dependencies.

The tricky bit is that all of them need to be upserts.In my last job I used SparkKubernetesOperator, and since there weren’t that many jobs, I just wrote to staging tables and then used MERGE in Redshift or ON CONFLICT in Postgres. Here though, the DB team doesn’t want to deal with 400 staging tables (and honestly I agree it sounds messy).Spark doesn’t really have native upsert support. Most of my data is inserts, only a small fraction is updates (I can catch them with an updated_at field). One idea is: do the inserts with Spark, then handle the updates separately with psycopg2.

1muq3yh,"With the rising trends of finetuning small language model, data engineering will be needed even more.",dheetoo,dataengineering,"We're seeing a flood of compact language models hitting the market weekly - Gemma3 270M, LFM2 1.2B, SmolLM3 3B, and many others. The pattern is always the same: organizations release these models with a disclaimer essentially saying ""this performs poorly out-of-the-box, but fine-tune it for your specific use case and watch it shine.""I believe we're witnessing the beginning of a major shift in AI adoption. Instead of relying on massive general-purpose models, companies will increasingly fine-tune these lightweight models into specialized agents for their particular needs. The economics are compelling - these small models are significantly cheaper to train, deploy, and operate compared to their larger counterparts, making AI accessible to businesses with tighter budgets.This creates a huge opportunity for data engineers, who will become crucial in curating the right training datasets for each domain. The lower operational costs mean more companies can afford to experiment with custom AI solutions.This got me thinking: what does high-quality training data actually look like for different industries when building these task-specific AI agents?

1mutsxe,Data Migration and Cleansing,kepitingterbang,dataengineering,"Hi guys, I came across a quite heated debate on when data migration and data cleansing should take place in a development cycle, and I want to hear your takes on this subject.I believe that while data analysis, profiling, and architecture should be done before testing, the actual full cleansing and migration with 100% real data would only be done after testing and before deployment/go-live. This is why you have have samples or dummy data to supplement testing when not all data have been cleansed. However, my colleague seems to be adamant that from a risk mitigation perspective, it would be risky for developers not to insist on full data cleansing and migration before testing. While I can understand this perspective, I fail to see how the same cannot be said about the client.

1mvmawa,Recommendations for Where to Start,Thiseffingguy2,dataengineering,"Hi team,Let me start by saying I'm not a data engineer by training but have picked up a good amount of knowledge over the years. I mainly have analyst experience, using the limited tools I've been allowed to use. I've been with my company for over a decade, and we're hopelessly behind the curve when it comes to our data infrastructure maturity. The short version is that we have a VERY paranoid/old-school parent company who controls most of our sources, and we rely on individuals to export Excel files, manually wrangle, report as needed. One of the primary functions of my current role is to modernize, and I'd REALLY like to make at least a dent in this before starting to look for the next move.We recently had a little, but significant, breakthrough with our parent company - they've agreed to build us a standalone database (on-prem SQL...) to pull in data from multiple sources, to act as a basic data warehouse. I cannot undersell how heavy of a lift it was to get them to agree to just this. It's progress, nonetheless. From here, the loose plan is to start building semantic models in Power BI service, and train up our Excel gurus on what that means. Curate some datasets, replace some reports.The more I dive into engineering concepts, the more overwhelmed I become, and can't really tell the best direction in which to get started along the right path. Eventually, I'd like to convince our parent company how much better their data system could be, to implement modern tools, maybe add some DS roles to really take the whole thing to a new level... but getting there just seems impossible. So, my question really is, in your experience, what should I be focusing on now? Should I just start by making this standalone database as good as it can possibly be with Excel/Power BI/SQL before suggesting upgrading to an actual cloud warehouse/data lake with semantic layers and dbt and all that fun stuff?",5,0.78,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mvmawa/recommendations_for_where_to_start/,2025-08-20 18:02:10,2025-08-26 01:39:33

Had to build proper validation and integrity checks.* Schema management nightmare - any data structure changes required vendor coordination to prevent breaking their scripts. Massively slowed our release cycles.* Processing delays - several hours between data ready and actually processed, depending on their polling frequency.TL;DR: Secure file upload is great for security/simplicity but budget significant time for monitoring, validation, and vendor communication overhead.Anyone else dealt with similar challenges?

So we built a lightrag ish knowledge graph into the agent.**How it works:**1. Ingestion → The agent ingests alerts, logs, configs, and monitoring data.2. Entity extraction → From that, it creates nodes like service, deployment, pod, node, alert, metric, code change, ticket.3. Graph building → It links them: * service → deployment → pod → node * alert → metric → code change * ticket → incident → root cause4. Querying → When a new alert comes in, the agent doesn’t just check “what fired.” It walks the graph to see how things connect and retrieves context using lighrag (graph traversal + lightweight retrieval).**Example:*** engineer get paged on checkout-service* The agent walks the graph: checkout-service → depends\_on → payments-service → runs\_on → node-42.* It finds a code change merged into payments-service 2h earlier.* Output: “This looks like a payments-service regression propagating into checkout.”**Why we like this approach:*** so cheaper (tech company can have 1tb of logs per day)* easy to visualise and explain* It gives the agent long-term memory of infra patterns: next time the same dependency chain fails, it recalls the past RCA.what we used:1. lightrag [https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG)2. mastra for agent/frontend: [https://mastra.ai/](https://mastra.ai/)3. the agent: [https://getcalmo.com/](https://getcalmo.com/)",2,0.63,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mvc0fx/how_our_agent_uses_lightrag_knowledge_graphs_to/,2025-08-20 11:21:28,2025-08-26 01:39:33

Infact, my previous jobs didn’t require coding either.I have a burning urge to be a programmer ever since I got my first job because where I’m at, programmers get the best salary packages and they also get to travel to different countries because their office sends them there.

Great GUI, lots of tutorials.Hoppscotch → A lightweight, open source alternative to Postman. Runs in the browser or self-hosted.Bruno → Stores collections as plain text, easy to version control (great for teams).Hurl → CLI-based, tests APIs using simple text files. Super clean for automation.Yaak → Made by the original Insomnia founder. Sleek UI.SoapUI → Bit older but strong if you need SOAP and more complex protocols.Apidog → Similar to Postman, but I noticed it has a neat offline mode and works well for designing + mocking APIs.Thunder Client (VS Code extension) → Really handy if you don’t want to leave your editor.For someone still learning programming, what would you recommend focusing on first?Should I start with a GUI tool like Postman/Bruno/Hoppscotch, or dive straight into CLI stuff like Curl/Hurl to build stronger fundamentals?Would love to hear what worked for you all when you were learning API testing.",98,0.94,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mzl5zu/what_are_the_best_beginnerfriendly_tools_for/,2025-08-25 08:46:02,2025-08-26 01:39:35

1mza6fd,Are some codebases really unreadable or I am dumb?,yughiro_destroyer,learnprogramming,"Hi! I have been working as a web developer for two years and when I am looking at the codebases of the projects I am a part of I am unable to understand what is exactly going on. I simply believe that a lot of the code that is written today is unreadable but I am not sure if that's really the case or I am simply not skilled enough. I used to be a perfectionist and when I was working on my own projects it would take even 30 minutes or more to simply decide on naming a variable. Overthinking kept me away from creating and that's the primary reason for which I've wasted a lot of time. I tried to aim for perfection but such thing doesn't exist. I remember once I had the ocassion to talk with a popular car designer at Renault about sketching cars and getting the perfect drawing and he answered me with ""Only God can be perfect."". Later now, I was able to quit this toxic and not productive mindset of ""aiming at perfection"". Still, that doesn't mean I don't have a sense for order and beauty (I think?). Yes, nothing can be perfect but there are worse or better ways of doing something. When it comes to code, I am a big fan or consistency. What do I mean by that? Be consistent in naming conventions, in programming paradigms and in the location of the created and used modules. I admire simplicity and I dislike complexity.For example, one of the most recallable thing is that in the place where I work, when there is an request to update the CSS on a page, we overwrite the element rules. Instead of trying to locate and modify a class on a HTML tag they would write new rules using that tag's ID, would add style directly in HTML or use the !important rule specifier.When it comes to what is JS, code is split around everywhere, hard to trace or reason about. That's something I noticed studying other online smaller projects. I am studying game development on my own at home and when I am reading the source code of some indies... code is literally a weird combination betweeing polling and event driven. I respect both paradigms but combining them, especailly with no comments or no consistency, turns into a nightmare to track. I prefer those 10000 lines of ifs in GameMaker than this weird combination of callbacks and procedural.More than anything, I admire code that is consistent and ordered. If a module is chaotic, then that chaos is the module's chaos and trapped in there. If the module has proper wiring between input, outputs and isn't tangled with the main application as a complete monolith, that specific part can be much more easily refactored or replaced in case of need (for later optimization or other stuff).Also, tutorials. Everytime and then when I want to start learning a new library or framework or whatever, tutorials simply get into unnecessary specifics. For example, I want a 2 minute tutorial to teach me about creating an endpoint. But most tutorials start to delve inside unrelated stuff like ORMs or authentification. Yes, these are important, but right now we were talking about url endpoints, right? That's like learning the piano and out of nowhere ""yo, check out these guitar strings"" when trying to become a musician.I hope I didn't write too much BS but to end this post gracefully I will leave here my question (which is also present in the title) : Are some codebases really unredable or am I simply dumb? Is reading codebases a skill in itself? Then how do you become better at it? Has it ever occured to you to find a codebase where your first impression was ""that's pure art!"" ?

My dad's a programmer and dealt with carpal tunnel in his 40s, so I'm trying to be proactive about this stuff.Here's what I've started doing that seems to help:Taking breaks: Set a timer for every 45 minutes, get up and stretch for 5 minutes. Actually doing this consistently has been harder than I expected but it makes a difference. This is necessary, the rest will pay off in the ling run guys. Wrist stretches: Found some good ones on YouTube. The prayer stretch and wrist flexor stretches seem to help the most.Better posture: Raised my monitor so I'm not hunching over. Best way to go about it is a standing desk but I don't have enough to invest in an automatic one (Magnus Pro looks so so good!) yet so I haven't gotten one yet. On the other hand, I am still working on keeping my shoulders relaxed, the anxiety I feel constantly keeps them clenched.Split keyboard: This was probably the biggest change. Switched to a NocFree Lite about 4 months ago and honestly my wrists feel way more natural now. Takes some getting used to but the angle just feels right. NocFree Lite is just so light and easy to carry around. You'd think that the carrying part was annoying because of the 2 piece product but they provided a carrying bag with the board as well.

I'm one year into this accelerated program, and it feels like I'm getting whiplash from all the talk about AI, vibe-coding, and layoffs. I'm an engineer at heart, I really enjoy problem-solving, and I was drawn to writing code the minute I was introduced to it way back in a high school computer lab, so I really, really would like to continue down this path, but if you truly think that's a mistake, feel free to share. What I really want to know is how can I set myself up to get into an industry that, from the outside, appears to be shedding entry-level employees rather than hiring. I have strong math skills and science skills, I've worked at one of the largest aerospace companies for 3 years as a project engineering intern (commercial evacuation systems) in the past, and have an otherwise very diverse (some might say undirected) employment history.Given the skills and experience I do have, what should I be focusing on in my final year so that I can actually be an asset to a company as an entry-level developer/software engineer?

Please point me to the right direction, I want to learn. I have been learning programming on and off for years in an amateur setting (way before AI). I understand the basics. I have successfully completed small projects for my previous company (websites, small apps, basic games), however whenever I try applying these basics to build something useful, I have no idea where to start.I feel like im stuck in a loop learning variable types, loops, classes, etc, but none of this translates to a real programming job. I have the pieces of the puzzle but I don't know how to put them together. When I search for help or advice online, all I get is the same basic tutorials explaining how to do a while loop. I have recently applied to a junior position for Python dev, and the small exam they had was... overwhelming.They gave me a bunch of files and 2 hours, told me to implement some new classes, refactor some old ones, and I... had no idea where to start. Which file do I even open? Where do I write?I looked at it as a donkey would look at a palace - I can't even begin to comprehend what is going on. At this defining moment, all of my hours of practicing and building small projects amount to nothing. This has been a constant in my programming journey. I keep trying to learn, I see a bunch of tutorials and classes, learn the beginner 10% of programming building blocks but It never progresses into anything. I feel like I will never be able to progress. I feel like a fraud, like I'm wasting my life.I want to learn and do something with this knowledge.So, questions:* Can anyone tell me how you passed this barrier? Was it even a barrier for you, or is it just me? Did it just click one day randomly? Is there a website/resource/material that helps with this?* On a side note, can you tell me tips on landing a programming job and preparing for it?

(Real work—I got paid to code in each of those for over a year.)\- I don’t intend to create the next billion-dollar startup (so I don’t care if it is hard to find people who know the language).\- It’s just for fun, and I’m trying to avoid the usual suspects (Go, Python, Java, C#...) that are similar to what I already work with.\- Instead of choosing a project and then the language (which is the recommended way to do things), I’m looking for the language first and then seeing what projects can be tackled with it.\- It is not a career change, so it’s not important how many jobs are available.After a little research, I found:\- **Odin**: interesting, but it is very ""Go-like"".\- **OCaml**: I liked it a lot, and it’s out of my comfort zone (which is a plus for me).\- **Ada**: an industry standard for avionics and such.\- **Zig**: another one that I liked a lot, but it is very ""C-like"".\- **Rust**: the last time I used it was when the company was trying to decide between Go and Rust. I only used it for a couple of months, about 2–3 hours a day, and I disliked it a little bit (granted, it was only a couple of months and not much R+D).So, this post is more of a ""personal survey"" than a question in itself. I’d love to hear about your experience with any language and what you use it for—the language that gives you the most fun/joy to use, even if it is not mainstream or very well-known. To be clean, I know that ""fun"" is very subjective and that's the reason I'm asking for personal experiences and examples of stuff that you've done with it.Go (which I like a lot) is my daily driver, and I also find myself using it at home, but it feels too much like a continuation of my work.

1mxf97n,How do I actually get comfortable coding before a team project? (Vent + Need Advice),Stuiecoconut,learnprogramming,"I’m about to start my 5th year of a Masters in Software Engineering… and I can’t code.Most of my coursework has been theoretical, so whatever coding I learned was quickly forgotten after exams. The few programming tasks I’ve done were either simple or brute-forced with AI. For example: “You’ve never seen Java before, but here’s a website to pentest and refactor. You’ve got a month, and it’s 50% of your grade. Good luck.” That’s basically been my experience.I’ve tried doing small projects, but I always get stuck in a cycle:- Start something (like Langton’s ant in JS + HTML).- Hit a wall (e.g., “how do I make a grid?”).- Bang head on it for an hour, then ask AI. -Repeat until I have something that “works,” but I don’t feel like I actually learned much.- Try to extend it (e.g., Game of Life), realize I don’t understand enough, and give up.A month later, I’ve forgotten everything anyway.I’ve gone through this same cycle with Godot, React, etc. — learn a little, get stuck or bored, forget it.Now, I’ve got a month before uni starts again, and this year I’ll be working on a big, team-based project. My last team project ended with me being kicked out because the others were way ahead (lifelong coders, or just had way more time). I really don’t want that to happen again.TL;DR: I have one month to get vaguely comfortable coding in some language so I don’t drag down a team project.

For context, I am a sophomore, and in my two math classes Honors Algebra 2 and Honors Geometry, the concepts in there are not exactly impossible to understand, but a bit more difficult to grasp. However, when I learn mathematics for programming, it's much easier compared to math inside school. For more context, I am an ML Engineer, and I've learned much harder topics such as matrices, partial derivatives, derivatives, vectors, and overall just a good amount of calculus and linear algebra for programming. Although it's obvious that I'm not going into incredible depth with those topics, and it's only a basic understanding for what I need, I have created an entire AI from scratch before, and I'm creating another one with a shitty Scratch ripoff called MIT App Inventor, and for any AI nerds out there, that is not an easy task. You must be proficient in your understanding of programming & math, so how the hell can I do that but I can't learn what a domain and range is??I'm not exactly sure why this happens to me, but it certainly is weird. I should also mention that I learn much better when watching YouTube videos on math compared to learning math in school, so maybe it's just the way I learn. I have an Honors Algebra 2 test on domain and range and a bunch of other things tomorrow such as like increasing intervals and stuff like that, so I'm going to try and figure out a way that I can implement those concepts into programming somehow. If anyone wants an update, I'll post it here. Edit: I tried implementing programming into my studying, but by the time I did I had already understood everything so there was no need (I'm not sure that makes sense, but when studying how to implement it into code I just eventually learned it so there was no need to..? It's hard to explain.) I was also learning on little sleep & food for the past few weeks or so, so that's probably another factor that should've been mentioned before.

1mxaci1,Looking for feedback on error handling strategies.,Usual_Office_1740,learnprogramming,"I am writing an LSP in Rust. This is the first time I have had a project that I felt needed more than just basic error handling. By that, I mean I sent a get request. Handle the possible error case at the call site. With this project, I have several kinds of errors, and some of these kinds of errors require a specific response, as defined by the Microsoft spec.I'm using the ""?"" and a Result to push errors up the call stack, and right now, most of them just crash the program. This choice was deliberate. I didn't know how I wanted to handle this yet, and for the purpose of development, having the server crash is better for me because I know when and where I have a problem. I dont have to worry about noticing it in my log file or stderr.I've found the first point where I want to start to handle errors. The client sends messages to the server. I read, deserialize, and parse this message and produce an enum that tells the server what the client wants. Right now, I am reading the bytes out of stdin. I handle io errors here. I have two other functions that handle deserialization using serde to convert the bytes to concrete types and then read the method out of the concete type and match it to a corrisponding enum that the server can do things with.This is where I'm hoping for feedback. When would you want to see the three kinds of errors I can expect in this process to be handled? The resulting enum for this process includes an error variant with the option to include the specification defined response error code for the LSP.Should I push all the errors up from the reader and deserialization process so that I can handle everything at one focal point?Would it be better to keep the kinds of errors handled at different points? So, reader errors get handled at one spot. Deserialize errors at another point. Method parsing errors at another point? Is there another approach I've not considered? What does a good error handling strategy look like to experienced programmers, and what advice can you offer to ensure verbose error handling for my project?Thanks for your time.",3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mxaci1/looking_for_feedback_on_error_handling_strategies/,2025-08-22 15:56:36,2025-08-26 01:39:35

You can pass strings, booleans, numbers, functions, etc. directly in JSX, and it just works.This makes me wonder: isn’t React’s approach obviously more advantageous? With `{ }`, you don’t need to remember different syntaxes, it feels like “property binding that always works”.So my question is: **why didn’t Angular just make** `{{}}` **work the same way?** Is there some hidden benefit in Angular’s stricter separation (interpolation vs property binding), or is it just a design philosophy thing?I would be very thankful to hear from you, especially from people who’ve used both frameworks.",3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mx63ax/question_to_those_who_have_used_both_angular_and/,2025-08-22 13:09:48,2025-08-26 01:39:35

1mw5n7i,Help me out with nand2tetris skipping the ‘first principles’ details,ReindeerFuture9618,learnprogramming,"I’m working through nand2tetris and hitting a wall. The course often tells me to “just build an assembler/VM/compiler using a high-level language and their APIs,” but that feels like cheating.I want to see how each layer is actually *implemented from first principles* and how it executes on bare hardware. For example, how does the first assembler itself run? How was a text processing program created from bare hardware, called assembler? Instead, the book says, “Here’s an assembler, just write it in Java/Python using our API”. The course leans on abstraction barriers and assumes you’re okay using a modern host computer as scaffolding.My frustration is that I don’t just want to *use* an API to get the point, I want to see the mechanics of bootstrapping everything from the ground up, without skipping levels.

I designed this project with my friend as a non-profit organisation that we could write on our common apps. I know HTML, CSS and very minimal JS, but not enough to code a website for both frontend or backend. Im going to host the server through Netlify, Vercel or Cloudflare pages, and obtain and try to get a 5-6$ domain off cloudflare registrar since I've heard they only have ICANN cost and some other minimal costs. The thing is, Idrk how to code JS and Ive never really had any JS projects in the past. My website will have a minimal backend, no login/registration, just a dashboard explaining the site, and hyperlinks to different subjects and tutorials My friend has recorded. I was wondering if it would be possible to use AI 'vibecoding' tools like v0, cursor, perplexity, claude, gpt to help me learn and use JS alongside framer and figma for the UI design. Although ive seen these tools making extremely basic websites I really dont believe they can build a semi-decent functional website that can have traffic of upto 10-15 people without encountering issues. Even with the assistance of these tools, I dont think I myself would be able to make a good frontend either so im wondering whats the best way for me to do this project. I need this project to be done in a month, Im open to using WordPress or Wix if push comes to shove.

1my45y1,"Reminder: Software engineering is still one of the happiest careers in 2024/2025, based on data.",cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"This subreddit has a huge FAANG obsession, and it completely distorts the perception of software engineering. Every other post seems to be about insane comp packages, grueling interviews, layoffs, or burnout stories. But if you look at the actual data, the reality for most developers is completely different.[Resume.io (2025)](https://resume.io/blog/which-professions-are-the-happiest-at-work) found that 87 percent of software developers reported being “very happy” in their jobs, the highest of any profession surveyed. [Career.io (2024)](https://career.io/career-advice/careers-that-make-americans-happiest) analyzed nearly 756,000 job ratings and found software developers among the most satisfied six figure earners, with a median salary around 130K. [Market.biz (2025)](https://market.biz/job-satisfaction-statistics/#job-satisfaction-statistics-in-different-industries) reported that 74 percent of tech professionals worldwide are satisfied with their jobs. So why does this subreddit feel so negative compared to those numbers? Because the voices dominating here are FAANG engineers or startup employees, and their experiences are extreme. Life inside FAANG is often miserable. Long hours, constant pressure to ship, endless internal politics, and the looming threat of layoffs make it feel like a treadmill you can never step off. Software is the company’s entire product, so everything you do is under constant scrutiny and pressure. Burnout is common, and that is exactly what this sub amplifies.Meanwhile, the average developer lives a completely different life, and that is what drives the high happiness statistics. Most are not in San Francisco or New York. They live in mid sized cities or suburbs where their salary goes much further. They are not chasing the next billion dollar app. They work at hospitals, insurance companies, banks, logistics firms, or government agencies. The work is steady, respected, and meaningful, even if it never makes headlines.They make 100K to 130K, comfortably above the national median. Their hours are closer to forty a week. They get PTO. Their managers are competent but not tyrannical. And because software is a support function rather than the company’s core product, the pressure to grind nonstop is low. That is why surveys consistently show high satisfaction.The quiet majority of developers who live this life rarely post here. Nobody makes a thread to say “My job is stable, I like my team, I worked normal hours, and I had a great weekend hiking.” The loud minority who post are often FAANG engineers or startup refugees talking about their misery. That is why this subreddit can make software engineering seem miserable, even though for most people it is not.The truth is that chasing FAANG is often what ruins people’s perception of software engineering. It is the exception, not the rule. The average developer is happy, balanced, and living a peaceful, stable, and well-compensated life. Even in 2024 and 2025, software engineering remains one of the happiest and most rewarding professions you can choose, as long as you understand that most developers do not live the FAANG nightmare that dominates this subreddit.",641,0.86,152,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1my45y1/reminder_software_engineering_is_still_one_of_the/,2025-08-23 15:18:51,2025-08-26 01:39:36

1mvmgek,AI isn't taking your job...,TomBanjo86,cscareerquestions,"IC with 20 years in the industry, dozens of domains/teams/tech stacks. FAANG, private sector, and public sector. I landed new jobs in what were historically some of the most difficult markets (2008, 2020, and 2025)- The industry is still growing in terms of jobs and revenue- Number of CS grads has more than doubled in recent years- CS program quality at most universities have not improved and weren't very good to begin with. Sorry, but your college probably ripped you off. take it up with them. seriously.- Efficiency in software development process has improved remarkably with cloud, devops- Most developers aren't really good at building resilient, hardened systems.- Many seasoned devs have a sense of entitlement and an aversion to acquiring new skills on their own- Offshoring is acceleratingAside from all of this, it is easy to get crushed by toxic management culture and most devs don't realize that they are actively competing for a piece of the pie with layers of useless middle managers who excel at stealing accomplishments. As the industry becomes more competitive you must adapt. If you aren't already raging, here's my advice:- Learn how to self-manage and take credit for your own work- Work fast, take risks, don't worry about tech debt (your managers don't)- Never stop expanding your skill set. We are never done learning. AI, infrastructure management, scalability, data pipelines- If you are American, fight offshoring and H1B head on by proving you are more valuable and less of a hassle, voting won't make a difference there.

1mxg0g9,I uncovered a scam trying to hire for a remote engineer position,ExpensivePost,cscareerquestions,"Novel warning, but it's a good one IMO, tldr at the bottomThis is probably a common scam, but it was new to me so I figured I'd post it here in the off chance it helps someone avoid unwittingly destroying their entire company.For some time we had been getting flooded with nearly identically formatted resumes that were all very low quality. They were loaded with random keywords from our postings to try to maximize automated ranking but used very poor grammar or just nonsense word soup.They were all PDFs and all of them had similar metadata that was unique to them so I just wrote a script for our recruiters to auto-reject all of them.We got tons of them for every pure-remote posting, never in-office, or even hybrid.Curiosity got the better of me so I tried to schedule a tech screen with a few of them. Most ghosted, but I was able to actually get on a call with one.* The name was very English, first and last.* Age was late 20's which was a bit young given the timeline shown in the work history and education, but not impossible. It put them finishing their BS right at 21.* Location was listed as Austin, Texas and indicated that they were legal to work in the US without visa endorsement.* They listed a BS in Game Programming from Full Sail University (private, for-profit, online). I've had limited but mixed experience with their grads. Not an auto-reject school, but it's not going to help your resume really.* They had some work history with several short-term contracts with random non-us based small game studios and one 2-year stint with a well-known, but long defunct American studio. The timeline was a a bit dense with their first 2 contract gigs overlapping with their last year of college.Unfortunately for this person, the games industry is fairly small and I have close friends who were at the studio they listed at the time they reported having worked there. One of my friends would have been the director of the team this person reported having been a junior engineer on. My friend confirmed without question that this person was never at that studio and was never on his team.Once I got on the call (zoom), it was clear the the person was not a native English speaker. Which isn't a problem, they were conversational, just incongruitous with the name. The age also seemed unlikely; this person was probably over 40, though I've been more off on age guesses before. I'm familiar with Austin so I asked about the city a bit. It was clear that the person had never been there, let alone lived there.I poked at their technical skills and they actually seemed like they had some programming knowledge, but nothing close to what their experience and education would suggest. They used jargon more in-line with a very junior web developer than a mid-level game engineer. C++ was very weak, no knowledge of basic game design principles, and they couldn't speak at all to basic game development team structure or workflows.I was ready to get to the truth so I asked where they were calling from, making up some bullshit their IP address looking unusual (lie, zoom doesn't expose that). They said they were visiting family in Delhi but would be back in the US before the start date. I asked to confirm their legality to work in the US and they confirmed what was in their application and added that they were a natural born American citizen.I asked about their experience at the US-based game studio. I asked some specifics about their internal processes that you would only know if you were actually working there as an engineer (they had an unusual source-control workflow). Candidate had no clue and made up some bullshit. I asked about their responsibilities on the team and who they reported to; more bullshit.Time to take the mask off.I told them I know they never worked at that studio. I told them I know they've never been to Austin. And I asked directly: what's your goal here? They tried to redirect, and doubled down on the bullshit, clearly not understanding that the scam was over. So I asked about the name on the application: Is that a real person? Did you steal their identity? Are they in on it like some sort of employment mule? They immediately dropped from the call.After the call, I hit up our legal department and asked them to see if the name on the application could be identified as a real person (possibly in Austin). Turns out the name was just uncommon enough and we had just enough PII that it did match a likely real person in Austin. Legal notified the Austin PD about the probable identity theft (or possibly an accomplice to fraud) and that was the last I heard about it.My theory is that the scammers get enough info about an American to secure a remote job with that identity (really they just need a name, DoB, and SSN). They rely on companies not verifying their education and employment history (which they make difficult using small and defunct companies). Then they spam every possible remote job listing hoping to overwhelm their recruiting pipeline and sneak someone through. I imagine they would do just enough to not get immediately fired and collect a paycheck while exfiltrating as much source code, data, and other assets of value as possible once they have access. I would be surprised if they didn't also try to plant ransomware or other malware to company systems or worse, customers.This was a few months ago, and I'm no longer at that company, but their current director has told me that the resume script is still working and hitting about a hundred resumes per posting, still only for remote roles.If you have this issue, look at the PDF metadata and it should be pretty obvious what pattern I'm talking about. My script was very simple using PyMuPDF to read metadata to identify and filter them.tldr: Got lots of similar, sketchy resumes for remote postings only. I investigated and actually spoke to one of them.

I want to share what I learned over 10+ years that could save you from making the same mistakes I did.The Reality Check:When I started, I thought being a good developer meant:\- Memorising every framework and language\- Writing perfect code from day one\- Working insane hours to ""prove myself""\- Never admitting I didn't know somethingAll of this was wrong and held me back for years.What Actually Matters:For Job Applications:You don't need to meet 100% of job requirements. I got interviews, meeting 60-70% of the requirements. Companies hire for potential and problem-solving ability, not just current skills.For Learning:Stop trying to learn everything. Focus on core concepts (data structures, algorithms, design patterns) and learn specific technologies as you need them. The best skill is learning how to learn quickly.For Career Growth:You'll never feel ""ready"" for the next level. I spent 2 years over-preparing for senior roles I was already qualified for. Apply anyway, volunteer for challenging projects anyway, give that tech talk anyway.For Productivity:Working 45 focused hours produces better results than 70 exhausted hours. Burnout isn't a badge of honour, it's a career killer. Take breaks, have hobbies, maintain relationships outside tech.For Code Quality:Nobody cares about your clever algorithms. They care about solutions that work and code that's maintainable.

Right now, I’m working at one of the most popular restaurants in NYC, making around **$115k working just 4 days a week**.

Before this, the most I ever made was around $50k a year at any other restaurant, so this income honestly feels unreal.But being honest, seeing all the millionaires who dine here, I really want to break into the field I studied. I don’t want to be the server forever, I want to be the one being served, like those customers.That said, I never got an internship during college.

I have little to nothing to show for it. I know the job market is ultra-competitive right now but it's still my responsibility to work with what I have, and I haven't been.I realized during the five years I've studied Computer Science that even though I love video-games and thought robotics was alright (I did robotics programming in highschool & during my senior project, mentored by AmazonRobotics), I have no confidence in programming, and frankly, problem-solving in general. Everything is so reliant on connecting/social engineering now that my anti-social ass hasn't been doing. My parents have gotten people from my church and extended family, to give advice to me and frankly I've mostly been ignoring them when they repeat the same stuff I've been hearing for a while now. I apply to X position a family/family friend tells me to apply to, I get rejected/ghosted, repeat ad-nauseam until I stopped applying months down the line out of frustration, lying to them saying ""yeah I applied to plenty of places"". Confidence is at an all-time low.Today my mom yells at me on how much I've been freeloading and threatens to kick me out, and I couldn't talk back at her because I know she's right. **For the short-term,** I have $2,700 in my bank account, pretty much nothing to live on my own for. I hate being around my family but really want a remote position to show to my parents ASAP, so I don't get the boot. At this point I don't care what field it is, it doesn't have to be CS/programming--I really want to get a remote job in SOMETHING I can tolerate, in the next couple weeks or so while I try and gather my bearings for my future, or else I am likely getting kicked out. Preferably something that doesn't get too in the way of me studying for certs.**For the long-term,** If it helps, again, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, and am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification because I figured maybe I can try the IT space if I hate programming so much (already paid for a voucher, planning to take the exam in \~2 weeks). Unfortunately had no real work experience/internships in the Comp. Sci. field as I was too busy just trying not to drop out; took me 5 years to graduate. I've worked Doordash for a couple months using the family car, until my parents forbade me from doing so (for asinine reasons but it's their car so I can't talk back). I thought I was passionate in programming, I'm not. I have pretty much no passion in anything except games and anime, both industries sound awful to actually work in. Last week I started brainstorming a Unity game since I randomly thought it would be nice to work on something, anything, and put it on GitHub. **I'm well-aware that my story is not rare.

If I can, I explain it to them in a way that hopefully makes sense to them, so that they can take the information and run with it. Most people don’t operate this way, though. What I see instead is this sense of, “I’m better than you because you don’t know X, and I do”. It’s like people are just waiting, frothing at the mouth for their chance to elevate themselves over another person, instead of just helping that person learn, or at the very least not shaming and degrading them for not knowing something. The reality is that many things are easily teachable and once you get it, you get it. Most people can learn if the information is presented to them in the right way. So why isn’t that approach adopted in today’s working world, to build happier, healthier teams? What is with all the elitism? Don’t these people realize that the second someone else knows more than they do, that person is then considered “better” by the rules of this stupid game? And what’s the solution there - to keep rabidly trying to outdo everyone around you?

1muzhe0,I just got laid off again after working for a year,Craexus,cscareerquestions,"Last year, I got caught up in one of those ""restructuring"" situations where the company eliminated a few positions from every team. Mine was one of them. That day was my first time being laid off.So when I was job hunting, I made sure to target more established companies this time as I thought it would bring me more stability. During interviews, I specifically asked about company stability related questions. For example, I asked questions about how often layoff occurs and about the length of the tenure of the employees on the team. The hiring manager gave me the usual spiel about how yes, they'd had layoffs the previous year, but my role would be ""more secure"" since those cuts mainly hit non-dev positions. When I asked about team tenure, the interviewers gave the impression that the people had been there for years.Today, my director messaged asking if I had ""a moment to chat"" and I knew I was about to be cut. It's the same dance as last year where manager suddenly requested a meeting with me. The director told me it wasn't performance orientated as 15% of the company got laid off but I still feel like maybe if I was better at my job I would be one of the ""safe"" people.I spent the rest of the day doing damage control on my finances, cancelling the subscriptions I don't need, trying to get my head straight. The timing just feels particularly brutal because my team has been grinding through overtime these past few weeks, pulling extra hours just to so we can finish our project on time and meet our side of the service level agreement.All those late nights, all that extra effort and for what? It's exhausting as none of it seems to matter in the end. After my first layoff my confidence in my programming skills already took a fall and now I sometimes feel that maybe I don't have the skills to succeed and they're just cutting the weak links.I'm not sure if anyone will read this but I wanted to post it here if anyone has any guidance.",96,0.94,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1muzhe0/i_just_got_laid_off_again_after_working_for_a_year/,2025-08-20 00:02:48,2025-08-26 01:39:36

Done well, got awards, recently got promoted to SWE IIIMy current job makes me dread life.

1muhjxw,"Meeting with my boss and skip manager about my boss being unusually ""aggressive"". How should I approach this?",Dreadsin,cscareerquestions,"So I'm *pretty sure* this all started one day where I was given a very large task, basically go through every design and break it down to components, then create a design system from that meeting some requirements. I made a notion doc, shared it, and worked through it. My manager told me to make tickets for it, I said I wasn't yet done with breaking things down, she got really mad and reassigned it to another teammate with no warning so I stopped working on itShe said (quote) ""\[redacted\] will be leading the theming & tokens initiative, but he's on PTO this week. he'll help build out the project w/ its various phases & tickets. i'm creating some tickets with explicit tasks for you to get started"". She then assigned me a small handful of tickets. I didn't totally understand what the actual implication of that new guy being the lead of the project meant, and she didn't explain it, so I figured it just meant ""stop working on this project"". I don't want to ask, because she responds to questions **very** negatively.We had a 1:1 where she mentioned a lot of very strange things. She said I should implicitly know what to work on 100% of the time and it's ""not her job"" to give me work to do. One thing that also came up was that I took a ticket which was ""meant"" to be for support, but was actually just sitting at the top of the backlog. To her, this was a really big miss on my part and she wouldn't stop talking about it. To me, I just saw a ticket with high priority on the backlog and grabbed itSince then, she was downright *aggressive*. I'm talking, every time I put in a pull request she'd rip it apart, but without looking at the code. She'll nitpick the description, the title, pretty much everything but the code. Some were such bizarrely small nitpicks. Prime example, I made a fix for a footer component so my commit message was like ""\[FE-29\] {footer} fixes the way images display in dark mode on the footer component"". She said that I really messed up because I didn't include a link to the storybook. I was a bit confused because a bot usually deploys it then comments the link. I asked what she meant, and she said ""I need an EXACT LINK to the footer component in dark mode"", followed by a lot of derisive comments about how I never do anything right. To me, I thought ""it says the component and it says dark mode... just click the link, click footer, and click dark mode...?"". It was never a stated convention that we would have to post a direct linkLater she comments how I'm on ""thin ice"" and how I need to tell her what I'm working on this week. I ask her a few things about prioritization, which I get a lot of non-answers to. So, I get really specific. ""Looking at both the boards, it appears the button component is the next highest priority. Is that right?"", she then explains what the component library *is* as if I haven't been working on it. The only hint is she said ""priority ahead of that is working on your existing PRs"", so it seems like she's saying ""yes, after you finish your existing PRs, do the button""Frankly, I'm a bit annoyed with the indirectness so I say ""so should I take the button component? Yes or no?"", which she said ""i'm looking for you to create a weekly work plan w/ prioritized tasks from the available information"". So then I say ""... ok... so I guess I'll take the button?"", and she replied ""i've asked for a weekly work plan — this includes a list of items that you plan to dedicate time to this week""So I gather 4-5 tickets and send them to her. I accidentally didn't include the button (just messed up one link) and before I could even edit, she started berating me and she said she was prepping to put me on PIP. I tried explaining to her, ""the reason I'm asking you this is because you reassigned that project to someone else and told me you'd make tickets for me. Because of that, I thought that you wouldn't want me to blindly take tickets and work on them"". Just the previous week, I got in trouble for taking one of ""her"" tickets, despite the fact that it was sitting in the backlog not assigned to herI got really frustrated with her at this point and reached out to my previous manager. I said I feel like I can't communicate clearly with this manager, and she set up a meeting with me and the skip. Really, I just can't deal with the leading questions, non answers, ""quizzing"" me, and negative responses to my questions. I feel unable to have an actual conversation with her without inadvertently pissing her off",53,0.89,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1muhjxw/meeting_with_my_boss_and_skip_manager_about_my/,2025-08-19 12:52:07,2025-08-26 01:39:36
1mx4r5q,I suspect my manager is intentionally nitpicking PRs to make me unproductive?,cs_____question1031,cscareerquestions,"I had a task to make a button component in a shared library as part of a larger initiative. However, in this initiative, there was a ticket which was for making “design tokens”. I read through it, and it detailed we’d have design tokens for broad things like “primary color” and “accent color”. However, it also stated that individual components would have their own design tokens, so if it was a button, it might have “button primary color”. I brought this up to my manager, that I’m not sure if I should be working on the button because it seems dependent on this other ticket. I think there was a whole lot of misunderstandings, but she kinda seemed to get pretty hostile about itI guess I noticed that I really wasn’t getting anywhere with this conversation and everything I said seemed to make her even more angry. She threatened to put me on PIP at least once during this conversation, which I felt was unmerited, so I disengaged entirely and went to my previous manager. My previous manager is super chill so I was hoping we could just resolve it somehow. She set up a meeting with my skip. I just simply told him the exact situation, kinda in an emotionless, anodyne way. He seemed very receptive to it, surprisingly. He brought up that my manager had negative feedback about me “not following processes”, which we had a long conversation about, and he seemed much more “on my side” than I thought he would be. From my manager’s feedback, you’d think I’m doing everything wrong — but the skip was like “yeah it’s a new thing everyone is adjusting to. You’re fine”. I think this did get my manager in trouble, thoughI never did get an answer on the design tokens thing, but I was told to start work on the button. At first I made the button following the design tokens as the document stated, but I was told to remove this. No problem, AI was quickly able to resolve that. But then she started nitpicking pretty much every, insignificant detail. Mind you, this is really just a `` with some tailwind classes applied, with 100% unit test coverage. Specifically, she goes after the storybook (which is just a preview for the components), and constantly changes her mind there. “It should be like this” then I’ll submit it and she’ll be like “no I changed my mind make it like this”. They’re not things I would know as a developer, they’re just subjective preferences like “I want this story to be called (whatever) instead”. I find it all kinda odd, cause there are controls on storybook that let you change the preview. You can configure it to show whatever button you want using thoseI also have another ongoing PR for another component. Same thing here, she nitpicks it to death, especially the storybook. It feels like she always has a new thing to add or remove, which at some point just feels entirely unproductive, so I wonder why she’s doing it as my manager if it would reflect poorly on her. Like, even I think this is a waste of everyone’s time at this point, so I get suspiciousThen going back to the other one that originally used design tokens, she insists that I remove a css file that we would use for the design tokens in the future. This is a bit more complex than you’d think because it requires changing the build around and the exports in the package.json and I’m _pretty sure_ it might break tailwind when used in an app. I told her that I don’t think this is a good idea cause we’ll just have to revert it in the future, but she absolutely insists that we must do this. I actually feel kinda uncomfortable with it. I’m essentially making extra work for future me, for no gain and a potential bugAll this time I notice that she said I would have to ship this button this week _and_ replace all instances of the button in 3 apps. I still think she’s mad about the meeting with the skip manager we had. I really don’t wanna go to him again, but I’m concerned that she’s just trying to justify letting me go by making it impossible for me to get my work done.

1mvwc1o,"12 years at the same company, how do I get out of here?",Sysson,cscareerquestions,"I’ve spent the last 12 years as a developer in a Fortune 500 manufacturing company. I started in college studying IT/cybersecurity and took a short graphic design side gig—but a VBA script I wrote to automate reporting turned me into “the tech guy”. Since then, the company has tripled in size, and I’ve built and maintained a wide variety of internal tools: PLM apps, dashboards, automation systems, integrations, and even a 3D packing tool (Three.js/r3f). I taught myself React/Node, cloud, data engineering, and DevOps. Aside from a few college courses, everything is self-taught and \~90% custom.The catch: I’ve always been completely isolated. No peers, code reviews, or mentors. I report outside the tech org and handle all development myself. My day-to-day includes supporting \~100 users, gathering pain points, designing features, and doing analytics and reporting, since we don’t have a dedicated data person. It’s demanding—at one point I even debugged production code on a cruise ship in the Atlantic.I'm underpaid and I want out. What really broke the camel's back was when I took on the 3D packing tool, the agreement was that I'd have hires to help. That was 9 months ago, and it's still just me.

Lot of tech peers and friends in PM and Data, but no one to really ask for close advice. **TL;DR:** 12 years as a lone dev in a non-tech Fortune 500 (Excel → PHP/jQuery → React/Node/Three.js).

1mz81ay,How to upskill as a mid to senior level software engineer?,gunk_of_gamers,cscareerquestions,"I am a backend software engineer with 6.5 years of experience.

I want to upgrade and sharpen my skills as a dev and improve my resume at the same time, my resume since my current work is not anything too special to highlight. But I am confused on what direction I need to take in order to improve as a mid level to senior level developer. I don’t think building some boilerplate projects like a to do list or a note taking app would be helpful for my skills or resume, since I am not at entry level(though I doubt if it even works for them these days). Nor would leetcode. I do study system design on the side, which might help me if I get some interesting work or while interviewing, but it does not help in strengthening my resume. What should I do then in order to get noticed more for opportunities while also improving my skills?

But I am completely out of ideas and inspiration to solve any issues that I might face. I can’t think of any problem that I need to desperately solve by building an app. What else should I do?

One of my collaborators is a much older man (I think 40s) from another country(japan).How it started: Initially, everything was great and super professional. We communicated on Discord. He would compliment my work, like ""Good job on that template,"" which felt nice and motivating. He was very polite about scheduling meetings across our different time zones.**When things started to feel weird:** After a few days, he learned my age during a call. After that, the dynamic slowly started to change.1. He suggested we move our conversation from the public Discord to WhatsApp and shared his personal number.2. His compliments started shifting from my work to me as a person.3. He found out I was interested in some media from his country (like anime/manga) and offered to teach me his language one-on-one.4. He started talking about me potentially working in his country in the future and asked if I was interested.**The part that is freaking me out now:** Last night, the conversation escalated quickly. I asked for his LinkedIn to learn more about his professional background. He sent it, then immediately followed up by saying if I ever came to his country, he would ""show me around.""Then he sent these messages back-to-back: ""You are such a kind person."" ""You are a genius."" ""I'm serious.""This is where my internal alarms went off like crazy. It felt like a switch flipped from ""polite colleague"" to something intense and personal. It feels like he's trying to build some kind of deep emotional bond, and the ""I'm serious"" part felt like he was pressuring me to accept the compliments.**My question for you:** Am I overreacting? Is this just a case of ""super politeness"" from a different culture, or is this classic grooming/love-bombing behavior? My gut is screaming that this is wrong, but my logical brain keeps trying to find excuses like ""maybe he's just being nice.""What do you think is happening here, and more importantly, what is the safest and most professional way to handle this and create distance?**TL;DR:** I'm 16, my much older male colleague moved our chat to WhatsApp, and his praise has escalated to ""you're a genius, I'm serious"" after inviting me to visit him in his country.

I'd take a bit of time each week to dig into the technologies I was using at work to try and find non-functional areas we could improve in as I was grinding out functional stuff. over time this built up to an okay understanding of the SDLC overall.there are plenty of areas I'm still not very strong, but at this point I have enough experience with enough different things that its relatively uncommon i encounter problems totally out of band from what I've seen before, and have a fairly decent understanding of many of the popular technologies used today across a wide span of problems. Ive worked in a lot of different domains over my career. ive generally left most of the parsing of those domains to domain experts. sure, I'd pick up things here or there, enough exposure to particular verticals will do that, but I generally focused my time and energy on developing my tech knowledge, as it is more portable between jobs than domain specific stuff.that said, I can now see the limits of this approach. I've been working in the same shop now for four years and I wish I had spent a little bit of time each week better learning the domain I am working in from first principles. I dont feel like I am lacking in technical ability. I have enough technical tools at my disposal. I feel I am lacking in domain specific insight, and so are the others surrounding me. If i had been studying my current domain a little bit more here and there over the past 4 years, I suspect I wouldn't feel this way. I suspect I would be able to crack some of the tough nut problems we've been dealing with sensibly.looking back, there were plenty of times in past roles where I wasnt able to see the forest for the trees as a result of a little too much domain blindness & outsourcing of that knowledge to others who perhaps didn't know the domain all that well either.anyways, the advice I wish I had gotten was to carve out a bit of time for myself to learn the domain I was working in outside of the context of tech and programming.

1mu5fks,Late career: Planning my final years & offramp,Repulsive_List_5639,cscareerquestions,"BLUF: I'm 45, MS & BS in CS and in technical management at a national lab. I came here because I was sick of industry, venture capital, layoffs, etc. The lab's comp and benefits package was enough for me to say fuqqit to private industry's higher comps and volatility. I also noticed the workforce skewed older, and surmised less ageism in the tech roles here. Glad to say I've been right so far. Finally, in the back of my mind I always wished I had earned a PhD so that I could be an expert in something. Doesn't mean I wanted to do pure research per-say, but just to have developed depth. The lab is supportive of that - extra time off, free grad school, connections, etc. Since I'm just over halfway through my career I've really started to map out my off ramp. The math says I can probably retire in 10 years (age 55) if I stay, thanks to a great 401K match and a small windfall I got earlier this year. There is also a tuition benefit for my kids: half off in-state if my kids qualify academically. Since I have 4, that's going to help a lot :). To make it work though, I feel a strong need to do one last push with my education and personal development, and that is where I could use some perspective from other late career folks in tech. Some paths open before me are:\- Project & Program Management. In addition to my tech management role, I manage a \~$16M contract (finances, staffing, direction, etc). I've thought I should just get a PMP so I can check the box and have some more options. (P.S. I feel like its fine to be ""older"" in these kind of management roles).\- Go for a PhD in CS with an AI focus. The lab has plenty of academic affiliations where I could seriously pursue this part-time. It would take a while, but I'd still feel good about it as a life goal. Then maybe I can teach at the community college nearby. My MS was relatively recent (5 years ago) with an AI/ML focus and straight As. I can do well academically when I put my mind to it. \- Get an MS/Dr. Eng in Systems Engineering so I can broaden the projects I work on. I've always been the guy who could extract requirements, model different approaches, build schedules, budgets, etc. I wrote plenty of code - but also raised my hand to do all the other stuff because I like variety. Probably why I'm doing some project management now.\- A wilder option is a (slow) pivot into computational physics, since we do tons of computational modeling and simulation for all sorts of scenarios that might arise in the defense of our nation. That just might mean an Applied Physics MS to start, but I could see going all the way with a PhD (probably earned at 60 though :) ). Intellectually, this grabs me the most because it would probably stretch me the most - I love learning - and get me into some really cool work.I haven't done exhaustive pros/cons to these and thats probably my next step. I'd still like some outside perspective from later career folks in CS who have maybe walked some of these paths and could provide an opinion. I'm wrestling with the feeling that this would be my last big career development goal, and I need to pick the ""right"" one.",12,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mu5fks/late_career_planning_my_final_years_offramp/,2025-08-19 01:53:32,2025-08-26 01:39:36

1n02kl3,Help - how do I take the next step without breaking?,SeniorIdiot,cscareerquestions,"\[Senior DevOps Engineer, 17 YOE\]Hi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.I'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.At work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.While management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the ""senior founder dev"" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.It has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( I've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to ""catch up"" and but I never quite get there...And outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?What I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.*tldr; my life isn't perfect, but I'm still here fighting - but there is no joy left and I've lost myself.**PS.

Therefore I will need to move to San Francisco by Jan 1 in order to keep my current job.

For those who are still reading and are interested, I am an android developer but haven't gotten much industry experience with Jetpack Compose. Lately I've been doing more low level sensors related work (Bluetooth, location, accelerometer). But even that work is kind of built on the backs of previous team members. I feel like I haven't been really able to truly build something myself and don't even really enjoy the work per-say. Is it time to move to another domain? How would I even do that? I'd like to get out of mobile and maybe pursue something more java backend like or a Go type of role but not really sure how to start that or even what tech stack to use.For those of you who think I should just take the offer and move to San Francisco my concern is more than just the fact that I don't really enjoy the work I also have a partner who has a job she enjoys in the town that we live in... So my dilemma is why would I move half way across the country for a job I don't enjoy, rip her from a job she enjoys... for money? We will be married soon and probably trying for kids... do I want my nights that should be the happiest of my life to be stressed by this job I kind of hate? If I do make a job move how do I deal with all the rejection? How do I make myself better? I have a enterprise Udemy account in which I can seem to enroll in any class but even the motivation behind that feels low. Should I be focusing on Android classes to improve my current skill set or working on a whole new one? Will I even be able to get a job in this new domain with just some personal projects?Perhaps this is more of a rant than anything, maybe I just needed to get this out of my system and out into the internet but I've just been a little depressed about all this lately and feeling very unsure of my future. FWIW anyone who thinks I should be talking to someone about this I am utilizing therapy to try and get out of this funk but it just feels like anyone I talk to doesn't understand the tech side of things and just says I'll be ok, I must be smart if they hired me and haven't PIP'd me yet... Which just feels empty coming from people who don't understand the field.",6,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mvu7mf/what_should_i_do_about_my_companies_rto_policy/,2025-08-20 22:59:17,2025-08-26 01:39:36
1muswdl,"Recent grad working in DevOps but really wanting to switch to data science, analytics or business intelligence role",bikinbaebuatcurhat,cscareerquestions,"I graduated a little over a year ago and by some miracle got offered a job in a DevOps/platform engineer role straight after graduation despite all my internship and college experience lining up more with data analytics & BI, which I graduated with flying colors and gleaming reviews for those areas of expertise (not to flex, I just mean I know i'm also good at it). That's also where my passion actually lies. However, I still took the devops offer because with the way the job market is, I just didn't want to risk anything (it was my only offer amongst many rejections, even to the more relevant roles to my resume). I've been passively applying here and there, tailoring my CV and doing side projects for data analytics and no luck. There are rarely any entry level jobs, yet somehow many internships (which are aimed at students, and I wouldn't actually be able to support myself with anyways)I'm still not finding the joy in devops almost a year in but now I'm starting to consider just sucking it up, going all in and focus all my efforts in becoming a great devops engineer (courses & certifications). My question is, do you think a career switch later down the line would be possible, and if so how can I work towards that? I feel like I'm just not getting any resume experience while the field will keep growing rapidly and self learning can only get me so far. Should I just stick to devops altogether?Edit: added additional context in first paragraph",6,0.8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1muswdl/recent_grad_working_in_devops_but_really_wanting/,2025-08-19 19:46:38,2025-08-26 01:39:36

1mwxpkl,Switching when <1y in a company + how to say no?,dontRemoveTheHurdles,cscareerquestions,"Hello! I started working at a FAANG+ company (big tech, everyone here would know the name) as an entry-level SWE about 10 months ago, right after school. I got an invitation to interview at a startup (YC backed, though now has 100+ employees) and decided to do it just as an excuse to keep my leetcode skills fresh.I somehow ended up doing well and am now in their team matching process. They are asking me to meet with hiring managers etc.**Issue 1: Should I be considering this job with <1 yoe?*** The new job is better paying (by about 20k looking at base, and 60k if I expect their stock to have any value anytime soon).* Has better benefits (free food, better RTO policy)* Has less name recognition and isn't in an interesting field, IMO* Looks like it may have better WLB than my better gig, but not by much, and the startup does have busy oncalls For reference, I'm... mostly happy with my current gig - it is very busy, but I am learning a good amount, have a good team and feel like I'm on path to get promoted by next year. The product I'm working on is somewhat interesting, but still better than what I would work on at this new startup. I am worried about layoffs in my current company (there has been some chatter about it happening next year) but nothing has happened yet, so I can't really make a decision on that. Another consideration is I'm on an open work visa, so though I can easily switch companies right now, sticking to my current big company may be safer later on if I need immigration support.**Issue 2: If I say no, how do I say no?**IDEALLY I would like to be on good terms with this company in case things turn south and I NEED to switch companies. I'm not sure what excuse to give here - I decided to stay because of promotions? Make up a raise or some other reasons? Also, if I want to say no, I should say no NOW before meeting with the hiring managers, right? I think meeting up with HMs with no intention of joining is a bit too much, and I don't want to waste their time (interviews I don't mind because they probably do a ton of them anyway).Thoughts?",5,0.86,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mwxpkl/switching_when_1y_in_a_company_how_to_say_no/,2025-08-22 05:10:21,2025-08-26 01:39:36

1murxjw,Got a raise but feel underpaid and underwhelmed by it.,yerba-matee,cscareerquestions,"I'm an android developer working in Berlin,. I have been working at the company for around 2 years now and accepted a low ball offer at the start to get myself into the field.I had no prior experience and I'm self taught so no degree.I accepted 39k to start with and have asked at the beginning of this year for a raise, I was told to reach certain goals that would push me closer to a mid Level from junior ( but I'm still within what the company has down as junior). I have taken on larger projects and I'm working a lot more and on much more complex tasks, leading small parts of the app.Today my team lead called me in for a meeting without telling me what it was about. It was a raise. I will be getting 1.5k extra a year. So about 3.7%. I never negotiated this raise, it was fine by my team lead for me with the manager of the mobile department.This doesn't cover inflation over the last two years and I can't see myself getting another raise until I hit mid level, which I think would be coming in 2027 as a minimum. The company also has new rules about raises in that, this year they need to be agreed upon before September and as of next year before June. So I'm waiting probably 1.5/2.5 years now for the next raise.I feel offended by such a small number especially as the average salary for a junior android dev in Berlin is closer to 45k.We do however, get a bonus at the end of each year ( although it's not guaranteed that we will get it every year, and people seem to be questioning if we will get it this year or not) that caps out at 4k. After two years you get the full amount, so there is a chance I get this in December bringing me closer to 45, but I don't know if the bonus should count or not.Should I try to ask for a higher raise, what sort of number or percentage is even reasonable?Update: I've written to my team lead and asked to speak to him and the boss together to see if we can sort something out. I'm thinking to ask for a 15% raise, which will obviously be lowered but still hopefully work out higher.",4,0.56,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1murxjw/got_a_raise_but_feel_underpaid_and_underwhelmed/,2025-08-19 19:11:18,2025-08-26 01:39:36
