1kk0xxg,Last 2 months I have been humbled by the data engineering landscape,skatez101,dataengineering,"Hello All,For the past 6 years I have been working in the data analyst and data engineer role (My title is Senior Data Analyst ). I have been working with Snowflake writing stored procedures, spark using databricks, ADF for orchestration, SQL server, power BI & Tableau dashboards. All the data processing has been either monthly or quarterly. I was always under the impression that I was going to be quite employable when I try to switch at some point.But the past few months have taught me that there aren't many data analyst openings and the field doesn't pay squat and is mostly for freshers and the data engineering that I have been doing isn't really actual data engineering.All the openings I see require knowledge of Kafka, docker, kubernetes, microservices, airflow, mlops, API integration, CI/CD etc. This has left me stunned at the very least. I never knew that most of the companies required such a diverse set of skills and data engineering was more of SWE rather than what I have been doing. Seriously not sure what to think of the scenario I am in.",292,0.97,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kk0xxg/last_2_months_i_have_been_humbled_by_the_data/,2025-05-11 13:23:56,2025-05-16 01:41:27
1kmq1ew,Is it really necessary to ingest all raw data into the bronze layer?,Maradona2021,dataengineering,"I keep seeing this idea repeated here:> **“The entire point of a bronze layer is to have raw data with no or minimal transformations.”**I get the intent — but I have multiple data sources (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.), where each object already comes with a well-defined schema. In my ETL pipeline, I use an automated schema validator: if someone changes the source data, the pipeline automatically detects the change and adjusts accordingly.For example, the Product object might have 300 fields, but only 220 are actually used in practice. So why ingest all 300 if my schema validator already confirms which fields are relevant?People often respond with:>> **“Standard practice is to bring all columns through to Bronze and only filter in Silver. That way, if you need a column later, it’s already there.”**But if schema evolution is automated across all layers, then I’m not managing multiple schema definitions — they evolve together. And I’m not even bringing storage or query cost into the argument; I just find this approach cleaner and more efficient.Also, side note: why does almost every post here involve vendor recommendations? It’s hard to believe everyone here is working at a large-scale data company with billions of events per day. I often see beginner-level questions, and the replies immediately mention tools like Airbyte or Fivetran. Sometimes, writing a few lines of Python is faster, cheaper, and gives you full control. Isn’t that what engineers are supposed to do?Curious to hear from others doing things manually or with lightweight infrastructure — is skipping unused fields in Bronze really a bad idea if your schema evolution is fully automated?",152,0.94,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kmq1ew/is_it_really_necessary_to_ingest_all_raw_data/,2025-05-14 20:45:40,2025-05-16 01:41:27

1knixik,Is python no longer a prerequisite to call yourself a data engineer?,ttothesecond,dataengineering,"I am a little over 4 years into my first job as a DE and would call myself solid in python. Over the last week, I've been helping conduct interviews to fill another DE role in my company - and I kid you not, not a single candidate has known how to write python - despite it very clearly being part of our job description. Other than python, most of them (except for one exceptionally bad candidate) could talk the talk regarding tech stack, ELT vs ETL, tools like dbt, Glue, SQL Server, etc. but not a single one could actually write python.What's even more insane to me is that ALL of them rated themselves somewhere between 5-8 (yes, the most recent one said he's an 8) in their python skills. Then when we get to the live coding portion of the session, they literally cannot write a single line. I understand live coding is intimidating, but my goodness, surely you can write just ONE coherent line of code at an 8/10 skill level. I just do not understand why they are doing this - do they really think we're not gonna ask them to prove it when they rate themselves that highly?What is going on here?? edit: Alright I stand corrected - I guess a lot of yall don't use python for DE work.

1klpzaf,Do you rather hate or love using Python for writing your own ETL jobs?,CootNo4578,dataengineering,"Disclaimer: I am not a data engineer, I'm a total outsider. My background is 5 years of software engineering and 2 years of DevOps/SRE. These days the only times I get in contact with DE is when I am called out to look at an excessive error rate in some random ETL jobs. So my exposure to this is limited to when it does not work and that makes it biased.At my previous job, the entire data pipeline was written in Python. 80% of the time, catastrophic failures in ETL pipelines came from a third-party vendor deciding to change an important schema overnight or an internal team not paying enough attention to backward compatibility in APIs. And that will happen no matter what tech you build your data pipeline on.But Python does not make it easy to do lots of healthy things like ensuring data is validated or handling all errors correctly. And the interpreted, runtime-centric nature of Python makes it - in my experience - more difficult to debug when shit finally hits the fan. Sure static type linters exist, but the level of features type annotations provide in Python is not on the same level as what is provided by a statically typed language. And I've always seen dependency management as an issue with Python, especially when releasing to the cloud and trying to make sure it runs the same way everywhere.And yet, it's clearly the most popular option and has the most mature ecosystem. So people must love it.What are you guys' experience reaching to Python for writing your own ETL jobs? What makes it great? Have you found more success using something else entirely? Polars+Rust maybe? Go? A functional language?",85,0.93,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1klpzaf/do_you_rather_hate_or_love_using_python_for/,2025-05-13 16:12:38,2025-05-16 01:41:27
1kimfzi,Do we hate our jobs for the same reasons?,tensor_operator,dataengineering,"I’m a newly minted Data Engineer, with what little experience I have, I’ve noticed quite a few glaring issues with my workplace, causing me to start hating my job. Here are a few:- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. - We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. I don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem.

1kn2cgq,Perhaps the best transition: DS > DE,HungryRefrigerator24,dataengineering,"Currently I have around 6 years of professional experience in which the biggest part is into Data Science. Ive started my career when I was young as a hybrid of Data Analyst and Data Engineering, doing a bit of both, and then changed for Data Scientist. I've always liked the idea of working with AI and ML and statistics, and although I do enjoy it a lot (specially because I really like social sciences, hence working with DS gives me a good feeling of learning a bit about population behavior) I believe that perhaps Ive found a better deal in DE.What happens is that I got laid off last year as a Data Scientist, and found it difficult to get a new job since I didnt have work experience with the trendy AI Agents, and decided to give it a try as a full-time DE. Right now I believe that I've never been so productive because I actually see my deliverables as something ""solid"", something that no pretencious ""business guy"" will try to debate or outsmart me (with his 5min GPT research).Usually most of my DS routine envolved trying to convince the ""business guy"" that asked for me to deliver something, that my solutions was indeed correct despite of his opinion on that matter. Now I've found myself with tasks that is moving data from A to B, and once it's done theres no debate whether it is true or not, and I can feel myself relieved. Perhaps what I see in the future that could also give me a relatable feeling of ""solidity"" is MLE/MLOps. This is just a shout out for those that are also tired, perhaps give it a chance for DE and try to see if it brings a piece of mind for you. I still work with DS, but now for my own pleasure and in university, where I believe that is the best environment for DS to properly employed in the point of view of the developer.",58,0.94,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kn2cgq/perhaps_the_best_transition_ds_de/,2025-05-15 07:32:53,2025-05-16 01:41:27

1kkip1h,For those who have worked both in data engineering and software engineering....,thro0away12,dataengineering,"I am curious what was your role under each title, similarities and differences in knowledge and which you ultimately prefer and why?I know some people say DE is a subset of SWE, but I don't necessarily feel this way about my job. I see that there is a lot of debate about the DE role itself, so I'm not sure if there is a consensus of this role either. Basically, my DE job entails creating SQL tables, but more so than that a ton of my time just goes into trying to figure out what people want without any proper guidance or documentation. I don't interact with the stakeholders but I have colleagues who are supposed to translate to me what the stakeholders want. Except that they don't...they just tell me to complete a task with my only guiding documents being PDFs, data dictionaries, other documents related to the projects. Sometimes, my only guidance is previous projects, but when I use those as templates I'm told I can't rely on that since every project is different. This ends up just being a constant back and forth stream and when there is a level of concensus reached as to what exactly the project is supposed to accomplish, it finally becomes a clean table in SQL that is frequently used as the backend data source for a front-end application for stakeholders to use (I don't build this application). I have touched Python very rarely at my job. I am supposed to get a task where I should be doing more stuff in Python but I'm not sure if that's even going to happen. I'm kind of more a technically minded person. When my job requires me to find solutions by writing code and developing, I feel like I can tolerate my job more. I'm not finding my current responsibilities technical enough for my liking. The biggest gripe I have is that the person who should be helping guide me with business/stakeholder needs is frequently too busy to communicate properly with me and never tells me what exactly the project is, what the stakeholders want and keeps telling me to 'read documents' to figure it out, documents that have zero guidance as to the project. When things get delayed because I have to spend forever trying to figure out what exactly I should be doing, there's a lot of frustration directed at me. I personally think I'd be happier as a backend SWE, but I am uncertain and would love to hear from others what they preferred between DE and SWE and why. I would consider changing to a different DE role but with SQL being the only thing I use (I do have experience otherwise in Python and JavaScript, just not at my current job), I'm afraid I'm not going to be technically competitive enough for other DE roles either. I don't know what else to consider if I want to switch jobs.

While the standard approach would be to enforce data types in the staging layer, a colleague insists on keeping all data as string and only apply the right data types in the final consumption tables. Their thinking behind this is that this gives the greatest flexibility when it comes to different asks by the business. For example if tomorrow the business wants to create another report, you are not locked down to the data types enforced in staging for the needs of the first use case. Personally I find this a bit of an odd decision but would like to hear your thoughts on this. Edit: the issue was that he once had defined a column as BIGINT only for business to come later and say decimals are allowed so they had to go back and change to Double and reload all data.In our case though we are working with BigQuery and most data types do accept nulls.",19,0.89,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1klk9tt/dbt_staging_layer_string_data_type_vs_enforcing/,2025-05-13 12:09:17,2025-05-16 01:41:27

1kmch5u,Advice needed for normalizing database for a personal rock climbing project,KookyCupcake6337,dataengineering,"Hi all,**Context:**I am currently creating an ETL pipeline. The pipeline ingests rock climbing data (which was webscraped) transforms it and cleans it. Another pipeline extracts hourly 7 day weather forecast data and cleans it. The plan is to match crags (rock climbing sites) with weather forecasts using the coordinate variables of both datasets. That way, a rock climber can look at his favourite crag and see if the weather is right for climbing in the next seven days (correct temperature, not raining etc.) and plan their trips accordingly. The weather data would update everyday.To be clear, there won't be any front end for this project. I am just creating an ETL pipeline **as if** this was going to be the use case for the database. I plan on using the project to try to persuade the Senior Data Engineer at my current company to give me some real DE work.**Problem**This is the schema I have landed on for now. The weather data is normalised to only one level while the crag data being normalised into multiple levels. I think the weather data is quite simple is easy. It's just the crag data I am worried about. There are over 127,000 rows here with lots of columns that have many 1 to many relationships. I think not normalising would be a mistake and create performance issues, but again, it's my first time normalising to such an extent.

They have a longitude and latitude coordinate associated with them as well as a name. Each crag has many routes on it. Typically, a single crag has one rocktype (e.g. sandstone, gravel etc.) associated with it but can have many different types of climbs (e.g. lead climbing, bouldering, trad climbing)If a crag is particularly large it will have multiple sectors, each sector will have many routes. and each sector has a name associated with them. Smaller crags will have only have one sector, called: 'Main Sector'.Routes are the most granular datapoint. Each route has a name, a difficulty grade, a safety grade and a type.I hope this explains everything well.

How do you approach them and how much time do they usually take?* How would you classify tasks as easy, medium, or advanced in terms of difficulty – could you give examples?* Could you describe the context of your current project?* Do you often use documentation and AI? What is the attitude toward AI in your team and among your managers?* What do you do when you face a problem you can’t immediately solve? What does team communication look like in such cases?* Do you take part in designing the architecture and integrating services?* What does the lifecycle of a task look like?* How do you usually communicate – is it constant interaction or more asynchronous work, e.g. through Git?I hope I managed to express clearly what I’m looking for. I also hope this post helps not only me but other aspiring data engineers as well. Looking forward to hearing from you!I’ll be truly grateful for any response – whether it’s a detailed description of your workday or more general advice and reflections.",9,0.74,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kl2w4o/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_data_engineer_in_cloud/,2025-05-12 20:21:18,2025-05-16 01:41:27
1kkvi7j,Replication and/or ETL tools - what's the current pick based on pricing vs features around here? When to buy vs build?,reelznfeelz,dataengineering,"I need to at least consider in a comparison matrix some of the paid tools for database replication/transformation. I.e. fivetran, matillion, stitch. My guess is this project's leadership is not going to want to spring for the cost and we're going to end up either standing up open source airbyte, or just writing a bunch of python code. It's \~2 dozen azure SQL databases, none huge at all by modern standards. But they do have a LOT of tables and the transformation needs aren't trivial. And whatever we build needs to be deployable to additional instances with similar source db's ideally using some automated approach. I.e. don't want to build manually or by hand the same thing for all \~15-20 customer instances.At this point I just need to put together a matrix of options running from ""write some python and do it manually"", to ""use parameterized data factory jobs"", to ""just buy a tool"". ADF looks a bit expensive IMO, although I don't have a ton of experience with it. Anybody been through a similar process recently? When does an expensive ETL tool become ""worth it""?

1kmpgwy,Airbyte Platform May Updates,marcos_airbyte,dataengineering,"We’re thrilled to share a selection of the latest enhancements to the Airbyte Platform. From native support for loading data into Apache Iceberg–compatible data lakes and AI Assistants that proactively monitor connection health, to expanded advanced APIs in the Connector Builder, we continue to double down on empowering data engineering teams with the best modern open data movement solution. In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jramqt/airbyte_connector_builder_now_supports_graphql/), I covered Connector Builder updates like async streams, nested compressed files, and GraphQL support. Below is a highlight of some of the newest features we’ve added.# Consolidate Data to Iceberg-Compatible Data LakesIceberg has quickly become a standard for building modern data platforms ready for providing AI-ready data to your teams. Our [Iceberg-compatible Data Lake destination](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-data-lake) is catalog and storage agnostic, and designed for highly scalable and performant AI and analytics workloads. With schema evolution support, along with expanded capabilities to move unstructured data and structured records all in one pipeline, you can use Airbyte to consolidate on Iceberg with confidence knowing your data is AI ready. And, with [Mappings](https://airbyte.com/blog/load-compliant-data-with-airbyte-mappers), you can share corporate data with confidence, knowing sensitive data will not be leaked.For a deep dive for data engineers on the benefits of adopting the Iceberg standard for storing both raw and processed data, and an outline of the capabilities of Airbyte's Data Lake destinations, or check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8krPElimfM).# Operate Hundreds of Pipelines in One PlaceAs the number of pipelines you need to manage with Airbyte grows, the need to oversee, monitor and manage your data pipelines in one place is critical for maintaining high data quality and data freshness. With this in mind, we're excited to introduce four new capabilities enabling you to better manage hundreds of pipelines all in one place:**Diagnose sync errors with AI**We’ve expanded AI support in Cloud Team to allow you to quickly diagnose and fix failed data pipeline syncs Instantly analyze Airbyte logs, connector documentation and known issues to help you identify root cause, and get actionable solutions, without any manual debugging required.

You can use tags to organize connections based on any set of criteria you like: 'department' in the case of different consuming teams, 'env' for indicating if they are running in production, and anything else you like.https://preview.redd.it/12lnnj3a3t0f1.png?width=2836&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8dfbbbebbc4a9776d5b1b650172094cf138da93**Identify schema changes in the Connection timeline**The [Connection timeline now includes events for any connection settings update](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/cloud/managing-airbyte-cloud/review-connection-timeline): whether these be a schedule update, or a change in the connection schema. For Cloud Teams users, you can use this in conjunction with AI logging to easily diagnose why sync behavior or volumes have suddenly changed.https://preview.redd.it/p4oqcbgb3t0f1.png?width=2746&format=png&auto=webp&s=248babfb9b142aad7a5a88fc6bd2bf555d750b61# Manage Connectors as Infrastructure with Airbyte's Terraform ProviderData movement is an integral part of your application and infrastructure. We've heard plenty of feedback from users requesting better ease of use for our Terraform Provider. We are excited to announce new capabilities making it easier than ever to manage all of your connectors using the Airbyte Terraform provider to roll out changes programmatically to your dev, staging, and production environments.When building a connector in the Airbyte UI, you will now find a **Copy JSON** button at the bottom of connector configuration. You can quickly use this to export the the configuration of a connector to Terraform. This takes into account version-specific configuration settings, and can also be repurposed for configuring connectors with PyAirbyte, the Python SDK or the Airbyte API.https://preview.redd.it/eib6twxc3t0f1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4902d63dbc6a47f22f7f1cf10ba387f0f6474d# Create custom connectors directly from YAML or Docker images[New endpoints and resources have also been added](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/v-1.6#create-custom-connectors-from-yaml-or-docker-images-using-the-api-and-terraform) to the APIs and Terraform provider to allow you create and update custom connectors using a Connection Builder YAML manifest or Docker image. These endpoints do not allow you to modify Airbyte’s public connector configurations, but if you have custom endpoints within your organization and are running OSS or self-managed versions of Airbyte, these additional capabilities can be used to programmatically spin up new connectors for different environments.If you need to manage API custom connectors in infrastructure, we now recommend you build your custom connector using the Connector Builder, test it using the in-app capability for verifying your connector, then export the configuration YAML. You can then easily pass in the YAML as part of a connector resource definition in Terraform:https://preview.redd.it/5loabk9e3t0f1.png?width=3036&format=png&auto=webp&s=d732b93ad24c43e79a3c3f70766135b23bbf7488Together, these two changes will make it significantly easier to manage your entire catalog of connectors as infrastructure in code, if this is preference for you and your team.

1kmk8lw,dbt and Snowflake: Keeping metadata in sync BOTH WAYS,nosebrocolli,dataengineering,"We use Snowflake. Dbt core is used to run our data transformations. Here's our challenge: Naturally, we are using Snowflake metadata tags and descriptions for our data governance. Snowflake provides nice UIs to populate this metadata DIRECTLY INTO Snowflake, but when dbt drops and re-creates a table as part of a nightly build, the metadata that was entered directly into Snowflake is lost. Therefore, we are instead entering our metadata into dbt YAML files (a macro propagates the dbt metadata to Snowflake metadata). However, there are no UI options available (other than spreadsheets) for entering metadata into dbt which means data engineers will have to be directly involved which won't scale. What can we do?

1kkg2tv,Spark optimization for hadoop writer,Manyreason,dataengineering,"Hey there, Im a bit of a spark ui novice and I'm trying to understand what is creating the bottle neck in my current glue job. For this run, we were using a g.8x with 2 workers.This job took 1 hour 14, and 30 minutes of the job were between 2 jobs. A GlueParquetHadoopWriter and rdd at DynamicFrame.I am trying to optimize these two tasks so i can reduce the job run time.My current theory is that we convert our spark dataframe to a dynamic frame so that we can write partitions out to our glue tables. I think this step is the rdd at Dynamic Frame job, i think its shuffling(?) to a rdd.The second job i think is the writes to s3, this being the GlueParquetHadoopWriter. Currently if we run this job for multiple days, we have to write out partitions at the day level, which i think makes the writes take longer. Example if we run for \~2 months, we have to partition the data to day level then write it out to s3 (60\~ partitions).Im struggling to come up with solutions on how to increase the write speed, we need the data in this partition structure for downstream so we are pretty locked. Would writing out bulk and having another job pick the file up to repartition it be faster? My mind thinks this just means we would then pay for cold start costs twice and get no real benefit.Interested to hear ideas people have on diagnosing/speeding up these tasks!

1kn6f9x,Too early to change jobs?,curiouscat2468,dataengineering,"I started as a data engineer 3 months ago (mid-senior role) after switching from a backend programmer (1.5 YOE after graduating undergrad), but have no prior experience as a DE and my manager has been pressuring me to output. I personally am struggling to fit in since most of the engineers I am surrounded by either have 7+ YOE as an engineer or working within the industry, which I do not, so the pace at which I’m learning is definitely slower compared to a few other engineers that joined around the same time as I did. I have overcome imposter syndrome (because I know that everyone on my team knows I’m not doing well), but on the other hand, I’m feeling a bit burnt out trying to output as a DE while also being told to work as a product owner for a product that the team is developing with about 6 to 7 meetings a day (with also the request of outputting reports and other data-related projects alongside managing one time-consuming product). The team is a mess with no structure and some colleagues seem to have bad blood, which gets in the way of the methods of running a project (for instance a DE might not want to disclose whatever process they’re doing to run a project to the main product owner because they have bad blood etc.). My manager is also overworked and seems to only be getting input from my colleagues or external vendors we work with.I know working as a DE is tough and there’s never going to be a moment where I’ll understand everything, but at this rate, I feel lost and I have many days where I feel incredibly stupid and incapable (my manager also questioned my capabilities). I initially wanted to jump ship and change careers, but I also know quitting isn’t the best option especially if it’s only 3 months in, and I feel like if I really use this opportunity to my advantage, I could maybe learn a lot. I am worried about my mental well-being and the possibility of being fired during my probation since I have not yet hit the 6 month mark. Is it better to quit not and pursue a different career, or should I grit it out?I would appreciate any advice, thank you",4,0.75,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kn6f9x/too_early_to_change_jobs/,2025-05-15 12:02:12,2025-05-16 01:41:27

1kkpf3o,Seeking Advice: Transitioning from Python Scripting to Building Data Pipelines,JazzlikeFly484,dataengineering,"Hello,I'm a student/employee at a governmental banking institution. My contract is due to end in November of this year at which point I'll graduate and be on the job market. My work so far has been scripting in Python to aggregate data and deliver it to my supervisor who does business specific analytics in Excel. I export data from SAP Business Objects and run a Python solution on it that does all of the cleaning, aggregations and delivers multiple csv files of which only two are actively used in Excel for dashboarding.We've had problems with documentation of the upstream data that had us waste a lot of time finding the right people to explain some of the things we needed to access to do what we do. So my supervisor wants us to have a suitable, structured way of documenting our work to contribute to the enhancement of the state of Data Cataloguing at our firm.On the other hand, I haven't felt satisfied in what I've been doing so far, 7 months into the work. My motivation has declined slowly and it's quite obvious that my relationship with my supervisor has suffered from it (lack of communication, not much work on the table, etc...). I would like to change this reality and give myself the opportunity to show that I could be more of use if I'm put to work on the technical aspects more so than following the trail of my supervisor on the business oriented work. I understand that I must ultimately be in service of the business goals but as explained above, doing Python scripting on excel and csv files then letting him do the dashboarding in Excel while I sit back and wait for another need to be done isn't very fulfilling on all levels (academically, I need to showcase how I used my technical expertise in DE. Professionally, I need to show that I worked on designing, implementing and maintaining robust data pipelines. The job market is hard enough as it is for the freshly graduated, not having any actual work under my belt on some of the widely used technologies in the field of DE)Eventually, the hope is to suggest a data pipeline to replace what we've been doing so far. Instead of exporting csv and excel from SAP Business Objects, loading in them in Python, doing transformations in Python, then exporting csv and excel files for the supervisor to load them using Power Query in Excel and do his dashboarding there I suggest the following: \- Exporting from SAP BO and immediately loading into an Object Storage System, I have experience with MinIO. \- Ingesting data from the files into PostgreSQL as a Data Warehouse. \- Using DBT+Python to do the Transformations & Quality Control (Is it possible to only use DBT to preprocess the data, i.e remove duplicate rows, clean up columns, build new columns? I do these in Python already) \- Using a different tool for BI (I worked with PowerBI & Metabase before) \- Finally, a Data Catalog to document everything we're doing. I have experience with Datahub but my company uses Informatica Axon and I don't have access to ingesting any metadata or adding any data sources.I appreciate anyone who read my lengthy post and suggested their opinion on what I should do and how I should go about this. It's a really good company to work at (from a salary and reputation pov) so having a few years here under my belt after graduating would help my career significantly but I need to be of use to them for this.",4,0.75,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kkpf3o/seeking_advice_transitioning_from_python/,2025-05-12 10:46:36,2025-05-16 01:41:27

1kndvqd,Is what I’m (thinking) of building actually useful?,tensor_operator,dataengineering,"I am a newly minted Data Engineer, with a background in theoretical computer science and machine learning theory. In my new role, I have found some unexpected pain-points. I made a few posts in the past discussing these pain-points within this subreddit. I’ve found that there are some glaring issues in this line of work that are yet to be *solved*: eliminating tribal knowledge within data teams; enhancing poor documentation associated with data sources; and easing the process of onboarding new data vendors. To solve this problem, here is what I’m thinking of building: a federated, mixed-language query engine. So in essence, think Presto/Trino (or AWS Athena) + natural language queries. If you are raising your eyebrow in disbelief right now, you are right to do so. At first glance, it is not obvious how something that looks like Presto + NLP queries would solve the problems I mentioned. While you can feasibly ask questions like “Hey, what is our churn rate among employees over the past two quarters?”, you cannot ask a question like “What is the *meaning* of the table called`foobar` in our Snowflake warehouse?”. This second style of question, one that asks about the *semantics* of a data source is useful to eliminate tribal knowledge in a data team, and I think I know how to achieve it. The solution would involve constructing a new kind of specification for a metadata catalog. It would not be a *syntactic* metadata catalog (like what many tools currently offer), but a *semantic* metadata catalog. There would have to be some level of human intervention to construct this catalog. Even if this intervention is initially (somewhat) painful, I think it’s worth it as it’s a one time task.So here is what I am thinking of building: - An open specification for a semantic metadata catalog. This catalog would need to be flexible enough to cover different types of storage techniques (i.e file-based, block-based, object-based stores) across different environments (i.e on-premises, cloud, hybrid).- A mixed-language, federated query engine. This would allow the entire data-ecosystem of an organization to be accessable from universal, standardized endpoint with data governance and compliance rules kept in mind. This is hard, but Presto/Trino has already proven that something like this is possible. Of course, I would need to think very carefully about the software architecture to ensure that latency needs are met (which is hard to overcome when using something like an LLM or an SLM), but I already have a few ideas in mind. I think it’s possible.If these two solutions are built, and a community adopts them, then schema diversity/drift from vendors may eventually become irrelevant. Cross-enterprise data access, through the standardized endpoint, would become easy. So would you let me know if this sounds useful to you? I’d love to talk more to potential users, so I’d love to DM commenters as well (if that’s ok). As it stands, I don’t know the manner in which I will be distributing this tool. It maybe open-source, it may be a product: I will need to think carefully about it. If there is enough interest, I will also put together an early-access list.

1kmttx5,Best practices for Kafka partitions?,Born_Breadfruit_4825,dataengineering,"We have a CDC topic on some tables with volumes around 40-50k transactions per day per table. Each transaction will have a customer ID and a unique ID for the transaction (1 customer can have many transactions). If a customer has more than 1 consecutive transaction this will generally result in a new transaction ID, but not always as they can update an existing transaction. Currently the partition key of the topics is the transaction ID however we are having issues with downstream consumers which expect order in the transactions to be preserved but since the partitions are based on transaction id and not customer id, sometimes some partitions are consumed faster than others resulting in out of order transactions for some customers which have more than 1 transaction in a short period of time. Our architects are worried that switching to customer ID could result in hot partitions. Is this valid in practice?Some analysis shows that most of the time customers do 1 transaction at a time, so this would result in more or less the same distribution as using the unique id. Would it make sense to switch to customer ID?

The agent needs context, so we built a system that ingests this data, processes it, and builds a structured knowledge graph (kind of a mix of RAG and GraphRAG).What we didn’t expect was just how much infra work that would require, specifically around the data.We ended up:* Using LlamaIndex's OS abstractions for chunking, embedding and retrieval.* Adopting Chroma as the vector store.* Writing custom integrations for Slack/GitHub/Notion. We used LlamaHub here for the actual querying, although some parts were unmaintained/broken so we had to fork + fix. We could’ve used Nango or Airbyte tbh but eventually didn't do that.* Building an auto-refresh pipeline to sync data every few hours and do diffs based on timestamps/checksums..* Handling security and privacy (most customers needed to keep data in their own environments).* Handling scale - some orgs had hundreds of thousands of documents across different tools. So, we had to handle rate limits, pagination, failures, etc.I’m curious: for folks building LLM apps that connect to company systems, how are you approaching this?

1kjxab3,I built a database of WSL players' performance stats using data scraped from Fbref,play_ads,dataengineering,"On one hand, I needed the data as I wanted to analyse the performance of my favourite players in the Women Super League. On the other hand, I'd finished an Introduction To Databases course offered by CS50 and the final project was to build a database.So killing both birds with one stone, I built the database using data starting from the 2021-22 season and until this current season (2024-25). I scrape and clean the data in notebooks, multiple notebooks as there are multiple tables focusing on different aspects of performance e.g. shooting, passing, defending, goalkeeping, pass types etc.I then create relationships across the tables and then load them into a database I created in Google's BigQuery. At first I collected and only used data from previous seasons to set up the database, before updating it with this current season's data. As the current season hasn't ended (actually ended last Saturday), I wanted to be able to handle more recent updates by just rerunning the notebooks without affecting other season's data. That's why the current season is handled in a different folder, and newer seasons will have their own folders too.I'm a beginner in terms of databases and the methods I use reflect my current understanding.TLDR: I built a database of Women Super League players using data scraped from Fbref. The data starts from the 2021-22 till this current season.

1kmnscz,"Been coding for 5ish years, talked to about a dozen beginners here - some real talk",SmopShark,learnprogramming,"Hi,I've been chatting with a bunch of beginners from this sub over the past couple months (like 12 of you lol), and thought I'd dump some thoughts on what actually matters when ur starting out. Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.**Stop obsessing about languages**Everyone's like ""which language should I learn???"" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff. JS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.**What companies acutally look for**I've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough. Your starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch. One of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**One legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes. If you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af? As for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.**Find ppl who get it**You need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click. Stack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better! I was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.**Just. Pick. Something**""People keep saying mixed things about X"" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru. Every ""wrong"" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time. Also don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.**The secret sauce**Consistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways. I still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like ""damn I'm good at this"". It's normal. Hit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.Edit 1: Wow, I did not know all these people would be interested!

On top of all that, I still struggle with basic decisions. Like, a week ago, I was having a crisis because I couldn’t figure out if I was using classes properly. Like, I feel like the loop I’ve been in is I learn a bunch of stuff, but then I don’t understand it, so I don’t use it or I apply it incorrectly, so I go back to the way I was coding before, but then the code is ass and it’s absolutely painful to refactor, so I restart.

A little while ago, I applied to a job and was invited to take a coding test online with them. I looked through all the rules and terms before I took it, and there was not one direct mention of whether reading documentation or looking things up was fair game or not. From their other rules, it seemed to potentially imply that they only wanted one window/tab open, so I went into this test with no resources.Suffice it to say, it didn't go so well. It was in JavaScript, which I was learning at the time, and the most important question on the test relied heavily on JavaScript string methods, which I have never memorized (even Python or Java string methods, I'll generally look up).So my question: Does knowing string methods off the top of your head indicate that you are a good programmer? Since you have had so much experience programming that it's trivial to remember and use them?

I tried it and I realized something. The AI scaffolded the app in React but Firebase and Angular are Google products. So it makes me wonder if even Google is hanging it up with Angular on a slow transition if they don't even use their own frameworks?

We used csv-files now, but I want to do it using an embedded sqlite-database. Because using csv-files is something we did in every practice so far, and it's nothing new at this point. While with csv-files, the problem was to make sure you don't have redundancies, the problem with a database is now the other way around. Here is a simplified layout without any m:n:Product(id as PK, name, price) LineItem(id as PK, volume, product as FK) Sale(id as PK, lineitem as FK)Products need to be able to be updated, because you can edit them. But LineItem and in the end, Sales should not be able to change. With this normalized setup, changing the price of a product, would also change them in all line-items and sales from the past. That obviously must not happen. So what would be the best practice to save a ""history"" of Sales? Save the price in the LineItem? But what if the name changed. So saving the entire Product in the LineItem? But what if the Product becomes bigger, then I'd end up with a lot of columns in Line item, which are also not referencing.Not really sure how this should be handled.

However I've already begun adding it on github, and i feel like, as a resume-project, it may look a little bad that i started it, and paused for a couple weeks?So I'm not sure what to do, either i force myself to cram and finish it, even just a super basic version.

I simply cannot wrap my head around the syntax of declarative programming since what I have been learning is imperative. Everywhere i look online shows basic examples of it like ""lst = \[x\*2 for x in lst\]"" and there are no examples of more complex code, e.g. nested loops or branching. On top of this, everywhere that mentions declarative programming they all say that you should not update values throughout the lifespan of the program but that is quite literally impossible. I have spoken to my teacher multiple times and joined several support sessions but i still have no clue how to program declaratively. I understand that i need to ""say what result i want, not how to get to it"" but you still write code in a specific syntax which was simply not exposed to us at a high enough lvl to be able to go and write a small program.

Here’s my approach:**First 2 months**:* Learn Python basics (variables, loops, functions, data types, file handling).* Focus on NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.* Understand basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.).**Next 2 months**:* Deepen knowledge of data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.* Learn SQL for database management.* Work with APIs to practice fetching and manipulating data.**Final 2 months**:* Study machine learning basics using Scikit-learn.* Build small projects, such as data analysis or prediction models.* Practice coding problems on LeetCode or HackerRank.I also plan to start applying for entry-level jobs and internships by month 6, aiming to transition into a full-time role in tech.**Platform Questions**:* What’s the best way to learn: Udemy, YouTube, or other platforms?* Should I pay for courses on Udemy, or can I learn everything I need from free resources like YouTube or blogs?* Do I need certifications (e.g., from Coursera or Google) to get hired?* How long does it typically take from beginner to landing a job?* Has anyone here transitioned into tech through self-study?

Yes I said drag and drop.Most people would just put on YouTube on headphones and like zombies drag and drop all day. (Wish I was making this up). These resources were used to help students in exam preparation. In the folders there where hundreds of different PDFs, PowerPoints, MCQ questions as well as thousands of csv files.She was in a perpetually panic to do this for unclear reasons. I guess they powered her website and her entire business.At the time I had no programming knowledge yet instinctively knew it could be done better. In my total ignorance I tried some some scripts in Javascript until she caught me and yelled at me to do my real job. Later I was let go for not being productive enough.I asked some nearby devs for help but they said they were too busy.Today I know an intern could have a Python script doing the main stuff inside a day with os.system, glob, a few for loops, csv libraries etc, pandas. Stick a chron job and it’s daily routine. Even better use Powershell / awk, see or grep.Better yet move everything to the cloud.The entire process could have automated inside a month when all edge cases where accounted for. There were some devs on front end but I think they hated her so much they didn’t intervene or didn’t get paid enough to care. They all left very rapidly I don’t blame them for claiming ignorance.

1kjpqui,Looking Things Up When Lost,Embarrassed_Tower_52,learnprogramming,"I’m sharing this experience as context for the title.I've been learning Python fundamentals, and one of the topics I recently explored was working with dictionaries and lists. Yesterday, I started building a simple contact book that uses these structures. The idea was for the program to ask the user how many contacts they'd like to add, and then prompt for each contact’s name, phone number, and email. The goal was to use the name as the key in a dictionary, with the corresponding phone number and email grouped as the value. It also needed to support adding, editing, and deleting contacts.I spent two days stuck on how to cleanly structure this. I figured out how to loop based on the number of contacts entered, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how to group the 2 pieces of information (phone number, email) in a nested way that made sense for a dictionary with the name as Key. After some Googling, I discovered that you could, in one line, create a dictionary with a nested dictionary inside of it. .update({x: {y: z}})Where x is the name, y is the phone number, and z is the email.I felt a bit guilty for not figuring that out on my own. I had tried using a separate dictionary for the values and updating the main contact dictionary with it, but the results were messy. Either older contacts got overwritten, or duplicated data would be printed.All of that to say, I’m wondering if this was one of those learning moments where I should’ve pushed through on my own a bit longer instead of looking it up.

From this process I have noticed that the current ""industry standard"" meet management software leaves a bit to be desired and is exorbitantly expensive. I have always had an interest in computers and coding and I want to advance my skills. **End Vision** I have heard it is good to have a goal project as you learn. In the end (end likely means a matter of years as this is a side project/hobby), I would like to create something similar (an alternative to) *Hy-Tek Meet Manager For Swimming*. It does not have to be fully featured just to learn. This program runs on a database and tracks swimmers, events, and entries. It also has more advanced features including implementation with timing consoles and the sort, but I am currently not concerned with this. **My Question**What might be some coding languages/applications I would want to learn to approach a program like this? I am assuming I would need some form of database back end with a gui on the front. Where should I start? I would prefer not to take true college classes or anything like that.

Im victim of this too. I just think that at a certain point deciding between 170k or 200k isn't much diffnerent. I dont think that 30k is going to change your life by that much. It's nice to have that extra money but why risk possibly hvaing terrible work life balance, leaving a job that you have known for years and values you to a job that you may need to spend years re-building that trust.

1klbjft,"PIP'd for not talking enough in meetings, apparently",cscqthrowaway16661,cscareerquestions,"I was hired at this company a few months ago, it's a larger startup with a few hundred employees, and I got in via the referral of a friend who works there, although he's in a different department. I was hired as a senior SWE but the impression I'm getting is that they basically wanted me to be a lead SWE instead. We have a principal on our team as well as a few juniors and midlevel, and essentially, they hired me not as an IC but I guess more of a manager of the juniors? The principal is too busy on multiple other teams and projects to really participate in our team, although he does sometimes.This all came to a head when a few weeks ago on the 1:1 the manager said I wasn't acting like I was the second in command so to speak, but I told them I felt hired as more of an IC and for the past few months before that, no one had communicated anything regarding managerial type work at all. Nevertheless, we agreed on some action items like me being more present in the Slack, doing more code reviews, mentoring the juniors (all of which I was doing already but I just started documenting them in a work log then), as well as creating tickets and assigning and delegating work, even if that means I do less overall IC work myself (but, isn't that what the managers and scrum masters are supposed to do? Why am I responsible for that part?). The 1:1 the week after that, they presented a PIP. The PIP itself is quite vague, it wants me to take more ""ownership"" and ""leadership"" of the project as I'm the only one on the team who can since the principal is so busy, part of which is talking more in meetings apparently. When I presented the action items I was already doing, they said it was a good start but I needed to do more, but they were very vague on what that actually meant, they couldn't really define it at all since it had nothing to do with concrete performance metrics like ""finished or didn't finish X tickets per sprint.""It said PIP on the document but I didn't sign anything and they didn't ask me to, they didn't even CC HR like a traditional PIP would be. It's a 30 day one so I have to improve in the next 4 weeks apparently but I honestly don't get what they even want from me and every time I ask, they can't tell me anything more concrete. Essentially I think they hired me as a senior SWE when they really wanted to hire a lead (or even an engineering manager), and now they're trying to make me do lead/principal level work for senior pay (I'd need probably another 50k for that to happen). It all seems so sudden, like only a couple weeks ago they tell me about these sudden new ""performance"" problems when the several months before since I joined, there had been no complaints in the 1:1s.So now I'm just injecting myself in the meetings and asking questions no matter how dumb they sound, and it seems like the manager is pleased but it's all just so dumb, they literally said that they don't know if I understand things when I'm not talking in the meetings; I'm not talking so I can listen to what the more experienced team members are saying (we have some outside contractors and the full time devs were hired to eventually replace them, but in domain knowledge, the contractors know more than we do, so I also think the manager is comparing us to them too).Edit: I think people here are assuming I'm not doing senior level ticket cutting and talking often to the principal on architecture and code choices, etc, I am, it's that they seem to want even more people management type work in that they want me to essentially manage the work of the juniors and check in with them every couple days which is fine and which is something I've been doing but somehow they want even more management out of me.",316,0.89,168,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1klbjft/pipd_for_not_talking_enough_in_meetings_apparently/,2025-05-13 02:59:04,2025-05-16 01:41:30

Then he asked - When can you join - I told him, give me 2 weeks to think about it, the CEO said No, give me an early response. Then the CTO told him to atleast tell me about the company. Then he talked about the company. After it, I was desperate so I joined it.First day - They didn't even gave me any offer letter, just onboarded me on their payroll system, they didn't even gave me company laptops. So I started the day at 10 am, get every system access(github, backend) access around 11am-12 pm, they have already assigned me a ticket. Around 3 pm, the CTO asked me whether I am done, which I said No because they have hired me as an AI engineer position and their work/tickets assigned were for backend development. Then CEO came around 5 pm, started asking me whether I am done, then he further asked me around 7 pm- How much percentage I am done of the first ticket. I was really exhausted after 7:30 pm so I left, the ticket was still assigned. Also, second ticket was also assigned around nighttime to me.Meanwhile, at the same night, he called the other developer and asked him- How was my performance on the first day.I thought a bit at the same night, and then I told them I can't work there. All of my friends are saying that I should have stayed there, and I am behaving like an entitled Gen-Z and startups are run like this only and I should have collected atleast few paychecks.

1klkljz,"US Devs: Check Your ""The Work Number"" Report",Candid-Progress-1184,cscareerquestions,"When writing your resume and negotiating pay, be mindful that Equifax operates a database called The Work Number that contains info on past employers, titles, pay, etc for a huge number of employees in the US. I recently discovered my report was wrong: it claimed I was a 'payroll specialist' rather than a 'computer systems engineer' at a previous employer because the person filling out the form put their own title instead of mine... About half my previous employers have entered data into it, and I have a feeling it might be integrated into modern HR tooling and ERP systems.Definitely check your report and make sure no one jacked up your previous title, pay, etc. Receiving a copy of any consumer credit report, including these ones, is free. My current employer tells them about every single one of my paychecks, so keep in mind future employers might literally be able to see when you got your raises too. If you're as cautious as I am, you probably want to make sure the titles listed on your resume at least bear a passing resemblance to the ones in the report so it doesn't set off alarm bells for HR folks who don't understand tech title equivalence. If you're considering overemployment, note that both roles could show up on the report.There are many other organizations that claim to provide info like this: I contacted the top 100 and no one else had any data on me, so I think The Work Number is far and away the most popular.It's possible to freeze your report just like any other credit report, but keep in mind this might look suspicious.Anyway, just be mindful that this stuff is out there and people have easy access to it. I think employers are technically supposed to tell you when the contents of a credit report are used against you, but it's impossible to enforce since they can just say nothing. You can get bad data removed for free as long as the employer either agrees it was wrong or just doesn't respond when Equifax contacts them.Stay safe and aware out there, folks.EDIT: Turns out they still have to get your consent before pulling this info, which occurs as part of the background check phase. Thanks to u/mediocreDev313 for the clarification!EDIT2: I just pulled up my report to double-check what all is on it.

For example specialize entirely on mobile code using something like swift and show a specialization in this language. I feel like everyone’s learning java and python, myself included so would learning a specialized language be more desirable? Or should I just stick with something like a MERN stack and pump out projects that are “more complex” with more universal technologies. If contributing to open source, idek how to put that into my resume? “I added three new functions that reduced latency by .5 ms” . Could I make this its own section where I say I have contributed to 10+ open source projects with a link to my github for them to check themselves. Would focusing on open source for experience to pad my resume be a good idea?Are there any certifications worth getting? AWS or Azure fundamentals? Agile or scrum certs?

Our team is made up of 1 FTE and 3 of us contractors working under her. Today my manager pulled me into a call to tell me her contracting budget has been cut (I had a mini heart attack) and she has decided to let one of our team members go. He joined late last year and is technically still new to the team. He’s been working on some new things and she wants me to start learning everything he’s working on (telling him it’s just as backup) as she’s going to let him go next quarter. I’m pretty shaken by this.. the way she mentioned it felt too casual. Her exact words were “between the two of you I’ve decided to let him go”. Our third teammate who is also not FTE is her “special” employee - and to his defence he really is talented. I know professionally I need to just get work done but I feel like I’m stuck in an icky situation. A part of me feels like telling this guy he’s going to be laid off but I know professionally that might hurt me and that this is just part and parcel of corporate life.

1kmt77j,I have a degree from 2006 but no experience. Could a bootcamp help?,CronoDAS,cscareerquestions,"I'm 42 years old. In 2006 I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in computer engineering, but I hated my classes (especially the EE circuits and signal processing ones) and was totally burned out by the time I graduated. Instead of joining the formal workforce, I've spent the last 20 years being an unpaid family caregiver for sick relatives. I literally haven't written a single line of code since graduation, and the only programming languages I've used were BASIC as a kid, Perl during an internship between high school and college, and C and C++ during school - and C++ was only taught as ""C with classes"" with no mention of the Standard Template Library or any other library besides ""iostream.h"", so if I wanted to try to get a job in tech, I'd need to learn something people actually use today, such as Python, Java, or perhaps even R for data science and statistics. (I'm within commuting distance of NYC and the finance industry hires a lot of computer people.) I've also used SQL but forgotten almost all of it.Anyway, all the sick relatives I'd been taking care of died last year (including my wife :sad_but_relieved_face:), so I need to find something else to do with my life. I have enough financial leeway that I won't actually need to work for quite a while, and I thought that if I wanted to pursue programming as a career, a (hopefully reputable) bootcamp might be a good option, because it would help me get up to speed on modern development and create a portfolio to show to potential employers. I'm also not particularly self-motivated or disciplined, so trying to learn on my own, without a structured program that has deadlines, wouldn't be my first choice of approach; if going to a physical classroom is an option, I would really prefer it over an online-only program because I'd be less likely to flake. Would the combination of my degree and having completed a bootcamp give me a reasonable chance of getting an entry level job *somewhere* in spite of my age and resume gap, or is the job market for programmers without work experience just that bad right now?",68,0.76,155,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kmt77j/i_have_a_degree_from_2006_but_no_experience_could/,2025-05-14 23:02:10,2025-05-16 01:41:30

However recently it has felt like since management knows about how AI is, they load us up on our sprints, where I'm getting double the amount of tickets as I was before, and even junior developers are leading entire initiatives of our project, and they too have voiced feelings of intense pressure.As a result of this, I'm starting to feel like my love of programming and problem-solving is dwindling. Each ticket I hardly have the time to truly think about solutions and research and learn, because I'm expected to use AI to grind out the solution and move onto the next. This has made me feel like I'm burning out a bit, because instead of learning things I feel more like a prompt engineer at most and just gluing solutions together and moving onto the next ticket, with little time for anything else because the work volume has drastically increased.Was wondering if anyone else has had feelings similar to this?

I am trying to grind projects/certs towards that, since the skills I use in my current job would not help me get the jobs I want. Obviously my job takes up a lot of my time, plus I have other non-work obligations that I'm not willing to give up, so most days I feel like I'm wasting my time at work learning irrelevant skills while I should be leveling up in my field of interest instead. I'm used to living very frugally and have enough savings, and not many medical bills, so would it be crazy to quit my job to better spend my time gaining skills I actually want to use in my career? I would probably get a part-time job in the meantime to help myself but not take so much of my time. Thinking about this since I don't want to get stuck deeper into a career that I loathe - I am quite miserable albeit financially secure, and leveling up in an area of my interest is more important to me than money beyond basic survival.

With benefits and bonus I'm just over 200k but I see all my peers at FAANG with the same YOE getting TC around 300k+.

The problem is that I hear the market is super competitive now so I'm not sure if its worth investing the time into getting back into interview shape. I'm also worried about burnout, since I am fully remote here and usually only go in-office twice a week for food.

I’m currently trying to figure out what kind of environment I actually want to work in long term.In particular, how normal is it to see these patterns? I’ve noticed these either as an intern or through reviews online for other startups:* Long hours: e.g. 10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week. Sometimes explicitly stated as part of the culture, other times unstated but clearly expected - people work late, on weekends, etc.* Leadership doesn’t take accountability: when things go wrong, there's no clear ownership from the top. Just a vague sense of we all failed together.* Strict in-office requirement: 5+ days a week in-office, with little or no flexibility for WFH.* Constantly shifting direction or pivoting: roadmaps or priorities changing multiple times a month, with work frequently thrown away.* Unstable policies: things like compensation, time-off policies, or promised benefits being changed or walked back* No mentorship: you're expected to figure things out mostly on your own, even as a junior or new hire.I get that startups are fast-paced, ambiguous, and scrappy, that’s kind of the appeal in some ways. But when several of these things combine, it’s hard to tell if that’s just startup life or if it’s a genuinely unhealthy environment, especially when you're early in your career.So how many of these are just part of the deal when working at an early-stage company?

Make them either descope work, extend deadlines, or hire more people if they have unrealistic deadlines. Do not work overtime for a company that is not going to pay you extra to do so and will lay you off even if you work extra time for them.Second, I think most companies would be better off if they automated away most of these positions. I think it would lead to more realistic deadlines, less unreasonable requests to developers, less missed deadlines or poor coding practices because realistic deadlines would be in place, and an all around better experience for everyone including investors.I think this should be the new movement.

1kib4yw,Tips on applying to new jobs as junior dev with 1 YOE?,Accipitrim,cscareerquestions,"Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.**((This part is just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**I know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't ""crazy"" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave, but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.All of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.I still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\-----------------------------------------------------I know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",15,0.94,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kib4yw/tips_on_applying_to_new_jobs_as_junior_dev_with_1/,2025-05-09 05:41:09,2025-05-16 01:41:30

I maintain middleware backend web services for my large finance company's mobile apps (mobile BFF architecture) in TypeScript. I've gotten good at TS, can implement whatever's given to me, the job's stable and secure. I'm fortunate in many ways.The problem is... the architecture means I've got no experience with DBs. Not even ORMs. We don't really roll our own infra, rarely we'll change an IAC config file somewhere. No gRPC. No real system design skills to speak of. Node+TS on the backend is also a weird place to be in this market where companies want you to fit to a T, it's in the intersection of front and backend.We basically get together, talk about the future states of some parts of the mobile app, get the data from downstream services and just add business logic so that our REST endpoints have XYZ fields. It's gotten too easy, I don't feel like I'm growing and I'm worried about the skills I have vs those I *should* have on paper. The current market is also making it hard to switch jobs to get more breadth/depth.

Any advice / suggestions?",double-happiness,cscareerquestions,"I'm 52, not from a STEM background and only graduated in CS at age 49 (full backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11g5wjf/graduated_in_cs_at_age_49_but_ive_ended_up_doing/)). After circa 800 applications and about a dozen interviews I finally got a role with the UK Civil Service for nearly 2 years, initially as a Trainee Software Engineer on a fixed-term contract at £22K, but managed to get a slight promotion into another fixed-term contract as Junior Software Engineer and was on £27K by the time my contract was due to expire. (There was no chance of renewal as it was maternity cover). I made over 100 applications but only had one offer, this time as Software Engineer for a small firm in the renewable energy installation sector. The range was stated to be £35K - £50K; they only offered £36K but with no other offers and only 1 week left of my contract I thought I had better take what I could get. (Worth bearing in mind that AFAIK Scotland and the North doesn't tend to offer anything like the salaries one tends to get in London anyway though).On my very first day they made 5 people redundant but I was told not to worry as my salary was paid for out of grant money. Obviously that raises the question what's going to happen when the grant money runs out. I should say I am the only SWE and there are no IT staff at all, just installers, operations, and sales people basically. My supervisor and myself didn't hit it off very well and things were a bit tense trying to work out exactly what they wanted me to do. It was all quite nebulous and completely different from the Civil Service as you might expect. No tickets, no version control in place, basically just 'here's your laptop and this is what we want'. They want me to build an API aggregator that brings together API services from a number of different renewable energy manufacturers (that's what the grant money is for). I was sharing an office with an 'actual' engineer (i.e. an electrical engineer), but he left for another firm that was going to give him better training / certs. Seemingly they wouldn't give him a £3K raise and amazingly it turned out he was on even less than me, even though he had far more responsibility and went out on jobs and all sorts.I have built this whole web application for them in TS/JS/Node/React/Express. I have used a certain amount of AI (mainly Claude, also Perplexity) to help me along, but in fairness I now have no senior dev to turn to for advice. I have actually found it helps my learning quite a bit and I ask it tons of learning questions instead of just blindly copy-pasting. In fact I sometimes tell it *not* to give me any code, but just advice/guidance. I have pushed it all to a GitHub repo but so far it has not been deployed. It is about 100 or so files, thousands of lines of code, takes in 3 different APIs, does both local and browser DB stuff, and has a lot of unit tests written in Jest. If I say so myself it is pretty neat and everyone who has seen it has been impressed. It is dead fast and has a lot of error handling. The UI is only so-so as that's not really my forte, but I've seen worse.The problems are many though. The low salary, almost total lack of job security, no bank holidays (WTF?), and now my supervisor has really started to become quite unpleasant. Yesterday he totally bit my head off because I had the temerity to ask if I had now got through my probation OK, since that was due to finish on the 10th. He accused me of being 'irritable', said I must have been 'dwelling on it', and that apparently I should have been 'proactive' and mentioned it earlier. The last I think is total nonsense as I was patiently waiting for him to tell me the probation was done. To my mind it could have come across as quite premature to bring it up prior to the date. When I showed him some code I had written he said 'there must be an easier way of doing it than that', which I thought was tantamount to saying I had gone about it the long way. OFC he never stated what the easier way might be. Seemingly he did some MATLAB back in the day but doesn't like other languages because they use 0-indexing for arrays (SMH). Yesterday he came in, I asked him how he was, but he didn't reciprocate and said nothing at all to me for 3-4 hours, literally not a word. It was only when I asked him about the probation he then kicked off.The owner (who sits in the office next to mine) is fine and I get along with him no problem. The other office staff are OK but I feel totally out of it as they are focussed on sales and installations, and I just have almost no sense of being part of a team like I at least somewhat had in CS. There I had so little to do, I felt like a substitute sat on the bench on the sidelines, but at least I was around other devs who were mainly very supportive in my 'learning journey'. Being an older entrant into the IT sector (I couldn't even afford a PC until I got a hand-me-down in my late 20s) is not always easy, as you might imagine.So WTH am I gonna do? Try to brush up [my CV](https://i.imgur.com/JzEFPuP.png) and just start applying, I guess? Trying to move on after 3 months seems like a big ask.

I'm also friendly with all the C-suite folks and I've been to our CEOs house and we literally send memes to each other.With all that said, the only reason I'm leaving is money. I make more than the median but I'm pretty underpaid and the company is fully bootstrapped (0 investors) so I know they can't offer to pay me more money. The new role is at FAANG+ and will almost 2.5x my salary and in this economy, I need all the money I can get.I just feel so bad because it was always implied that we would all stay till we sold the company. The growth has been pretty good but not nearly what they were expecting. I think they're still well on their way to sell the company but this was a golden opportunity that I got so I signed with them.With all that said, how do I go about it? I plan to either tell them tomorrow (Fri) or on Monday. On one hand, I don't want to 'ruin' their weekend and feel like I should say it on Monday but on the other hand, I want to get it off my chest. We're also a remote company so I was thinking of asking people to hop on a call starting with my manager, then CEO, then rest of the team, then formally tell the whole company (or whatever the CEO suggests). Does that sound reasonable? Also, how should I go about explaining the ""why""? Should I just straight up say it's the money? They may ask/wonder why I never asked for a raise but I know there's 0% chance they can match the offer so should I mention my new salary or mention that it's over double what I'm making? Should I also mention that I'm willing to make this a smooth transition and I'm willing to continue to work more than the needed two weeks? My new job starts in 5 weeks so I have quite a bit of time.I really want to leave on good terms because I love these people and I want to stay in touch with them if possible.Basically any help in wording all this and advice on how to leave on good terms will be appreciated.
