They do llm finetuning for different use cases, and I build their data pipelines. I keep running into the same pain: just a pile of big text files. Files and object storage look simple, but in practice they slow me down. One task turns into many blobs across different places – messy. No clear schema. Even with databases, small join changes break things. The orchestrator can’t “see” the data, so batching is poor, retries are clumsy, and my GPUs sit idle.My friend helped me rethink the whole setup. What finally worked was treating everything as tables with transactions – one namespace, clear schema for samples, runs, evals, and lineage. I snapshot first, then measure, so numbers don’t drift. Queues are data-aware: group by token length or expected latency, retry per row. After this, fewer mystery bugs, better GPU use, cleaner comparisons.He wrote his view here: [https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra](https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra)Does anyone here run AI workloads on transactional, table-first storage instead of files?

1o25ahw,Iceberg is an overkill and most people don't realise it but its metadata model will sneak up on you,DevWithIt,dataengineering,"I’ve been following (and using) the Apache Iceberg ecosystem for a while now. Early on, I had the same mindset most teams do: files + a simple SQL engine + a cron is plenty. If you’re under \~100 GB, have one writer, a few readers, and clear ownership, keep it simple and ship.But the thing that was important was ofcourse “scale.” and the metadata. Well i took a good look at a couple of blogs to come to a conclusion for this one and also there came a need of it.So iceberg treats metadata as the system of record. Once you see that, a bunch of features stop feeling advanced and just a reminder most of the points here are for when you will scale.* Well one thing it has is Pruning without reading data, column stats (min/max/null counts) per file let engines skip almost everything before touching storage.* bad load? this was one i came across.. you’re just moving a metadata pointer to a clean snapshot.* Concurrent safety on object stores wtih optimistic transactions against the metadata, so it’s all-or-nothing, even with multiple writers.* Well nonetheless a lot of other big names do this but just putting it here schema/partition evolution tracked by stable IDs, so renames/reorders don’t break history.So if you arae a startup be simple but be prepared and it's okay to start boring. But the moment you feel pain schema churn, slower queries, more writers, hand-rolled cleanups Iceberg’s metadata intelligence starts paying for itself.If you’re curious about how the layers fit together (snapshots, manifests, stats, etc.), I wrote up a deeper breakdown in the blog above Don’t invent distributed systems problems you don’t have but don’t ignore the metadata advantages that are already there when you do.",92,0.84,38,https://olake.io/blog/2025/10/03/iceberg-metadata,2025-10-09 13:00:39,2025-10-13 01:40:02

1o023we,I keep making mistakes that impact production jobs…losing confidence in my abilities,eatdrinksleepp,dataengineering,"I am a junior data engineer with a little over a year worth of experience. My role started off as a support data engineer but in the past few months, my manager has been giving the support team more development tasks since we all wanted to grow our technical skills. I have also been assigned some development tasks in the past few months, mostly fixing a bug or adding validation frameworks in different parts of a production job. Before I was the one asking for more challenging tasks and wanted to work on development tasks but now that I have been given the work, I feel like I have only disappointed my manager. In the past few months, I feel like pretty much every PR I merged ended up having some issue that either broke the job or didn’t capture the full intention of the assigned task. At first, I thought I should be testing better. Our testing environments are currently so rough to deal with that just setting them up to test a small piece of code can take a full day of work. Anyway, I did all that but even then I feel like I keep missing some random edge case or something that I failed to consider which ends up leading to a failure downstream. And I just constantly feel so dumb in front of my manager. He ends up having to invest so much time in fixing things I break and he doesn’t even berate me for it but I just feel so bad. I know people say that if your manager reviewed your code then its their responsibility too, but I feel like I should have tested more and that I should be more holistic in my considerations. I just feel so self-conscious and low on confidence. The annoying thing is that the recent validation thing I worked on, we introduced it to other teams too since it would affect their day-to-day tasks but turns out, my current validation framework technically works but it will also result in some false positives that I now need to work on. But other teams know that I am the one who set this up and that I failed to consider something so anytime, these false positives show up (until I fix it), it will be because of me. I just find it so embarrassing and I know it will happen again because no matter how much I test my code, there is always something that I will miss. It almost makes me want to never PR into production and just never write development code, keep doing my support work even though I find that tedious and boring but at least its relatively low stakes…I am just not feeling very good and doesn’t help that I feel like I am the only one making these kind of mistakes in my team and being a burden on my manager, and ultimately creating more work for him with my mistakes…Like I think even the new person on the team isn’t making as many mistakes as I am..",27,0.94,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1o023we/i_keep_making_mistakes_that_impact_production/,2025-10-07 01:53:54,2025-10-13 01:40:02

1nzp92t,We just launched Daft’s distributed engine v1.5: an open-source engine for running models on data at scale,sanityking,dataengineering,"Hi all! I work on Daft full-time, and since we just shipped a big feature, I wanted to share what’s new. Daft’s been mentioned here a couple of times, so AMA too.Daft is an open-source Rust-based data engine for multimodal data (docs, images, video, audio) and running models on them. We built it because getting data into GPUs efficiently at scale is painful, especially when working with data sitting in object stores, and usually requires custom I/O + preprocessing setups.So what’s new? Two big things. **1. A new distributed engine for running models at scale**We’ve been using Ray for distributed data processing but consistently hit scalability issues. So we switched from using Ray Tasks for data processing operators to running one Daft engine instance per node, then scheduling work across these Daft engine instances. Fun fact: we named our single-node engine “Swordfish” and our distributed runner “Flotilla” (i.e. a school of swordfish).We now also use [morsel-driven parallelism](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/p743-leis.pdf) and dynamic batch sizing to deal with varying data sizes and skew.And we have smarter shuffles using either the Ray Object Store or our new Flight Shuffle (Arrow Flight RPC + NVMe spill + direct node-to-node transfer). **2. Benchmarks for AI workloads**We just designed and ran some swanky new AI benchmarks. Data engine companies love to bicker about TPC-DI, TPC-DS, TPC-H performance. That’s great, who doesn’t love a throwdown between Databricks and Snowflake.So we’re throwing a new benchmark into the mix for audio transcription, document embedding, image classification, and video object detection. More details linked at the bottom of this post, but tldr Daft is 2-7x faster than Ray Data and 4-18x faster than Spark on AI workloads.https://preview.redd.it/ohjpa08jyitf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5109e9cb6a8e9ca435b7ec77f522b1830b4d9a72All source code is public.

This retail company sets annual targets in dollars for purchases and sales, so these targets are yearly. The fact table als has a Year attribute. A solution might be to use a Date attribute?Ultimately, I need to create a table visualization in PowerBI that combines data from these two fact tables along with some additional measures.Sometimes, I need to filter by type, so TransactionType and TargetType must be linked.I feel like using a bridge table might be “cheating,” so I’m curious: what would be the correct approach according to Kimball principles?",18,0.91,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1o2yrhe/how_to_model_two_fact_tables_with_different/,2025-10-10 11:51:33,2025-10-13 01:40:02

AI is expected to help breakdown those barriers to increase the consumption of complicated subject matters. Guess what's required to enable this? ...data. Not just any data, good data. High integrity data, ultra high integrity data. The higher, the more valuable. Garbage data isn't going to work anymore, in any industry, as the years roll on.This isn't just true for those complicated areas, all industries will need better data. Anyone who wants to be a player in the future is going to have to upgrade and/or completely re-write their existing systems since the vast majority of data systems today produce garbage data. Partly due to businesses in-adequality budgeting for it. There is a good portion of companies that will have to completely restart their data operations, relegating their current data useless and/or obsolete. Operational, transactional, analytical, etc. This is just to get high integrity data. To implement data into products needing application/operational data feeds where AI is also expected to expand?

1o27u1n,Snowflake (or any DWH) Data Compression on Parquet files,rtripat,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,My company is looking into using Snowflake as our main data warehouse, and I'm trying to accurately forecast our potential storage costs.Here's our situation: we'll be collecting sensor data every five minutes from over 5000 pieces of equipment through their web APIs. My proposed plan is to first pull that data, use a library like pandas to do some initial cleaning and organization, and then convert it into compressed Parquet files. We'd then place these files in a staging area and most likely our cloud blob storage but we're flexible and could use Snowflake's internal stage as well.My specific question is about what happens to the data size when we copy it from those Parquet files into the actual Snowflake tables. I assume that when Snowflake loads the data, it's stored according to its data type (varchar, number, etc.) and then Snowflake applies its own compression.So, would the final size of the data in the Snowflake table end up being more, less, or about the same as the size of the original Parquet file? Let’s say, if I start with a 1 GB Parquet file, will the data consume more or less than 1 GB of storage inside Snowflake tables?I'm really just looking for a sanity check to see if my understanding of this entire process is on the right track.Thanks!",11,0.93,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1o27u1n/snowflake_or_any_dwh_data_compression_on_parquet/,2025-10-09 14:44:45,2025-10-13 01:40:02

Now lets say that I have this JSON response that consists of pleeeenty of nested data (4 or 5 levels deep of arrays). Now what dlthub does is that it automatically normalizes the data and loads the arrays into subtables. I like this very much, but now upon some reading I found out that the general advice is to stick as much as possible to the raw format of the data, so in this case loading the nested arrays in JSON format in the db, or even loading the whole response as one value to a raw table with one column.Wha do you think about that? What I’m losing by normalizing it at this step, except the fact that I have a shitton of tables and I guess it’s impossible to recreate something if I don’t like the normalize logic?

1o4678u,Career path advice,SoggyGrayDuck,dataengineering,"I'm at a huge fork in the road in terms of career. I'm going to have to learn something independently but have no idea what path I should take. I've bounced around between different roles frequently, which primes me well for a leadership position but I first have some gaps to fill. I started as a BI Developer but also did the data warehouse architecture and ETL loading. I designed a data warehouse from the ground up with my manager simply coaching but zero micro managing. Then I feel like my career took an unexpected turn, I took a job at a smaller firm. It ended up being more system administration with data engineering on the side but definitely more traditional data engineering than I did as a BI dev. I didn't have a manager so the skills I really learned was working with the owners/directly with leadership but it was a small firm and not as formal as I've seen at medium to large companies. No real formal quarterly planning but I was directly responsible for anything that happened or was needed. I really learned to solve whatever problem is thrown at me and I now have the confidence to attack any problem thrown at me. On the technical side I automated their manual workflow, mistakenly using SSIS, because I didn't know better. I later migrated them to the cloud with the support of a very very good consultant. He really liked my ability to learn and solve new problems and I'm still in contact with him today. After migration my job became more of a system administrator but also added new sources to the pipeline. No architecture or modeling responsibilities though. Next I found a job as an architect based in the cloud. Once again I had no technical people above me. I think this job was a a reach for me, I didn't know what I didn't know and oversold myself. Still I made it work and got my cloud pipelines built but mostly using the interface vs coding the way I expect most companies to work. We used S3, glue, RDS and lambda. This was short lived due to funding for the project and likely because I was over my head. Her I took a step back and just wanted to be a data engineer at a medium to large company. This was all good until we got offshored. I'm now working through the remaining months of that job while I look for a new one. Unfortunately it seems the traditional data flow knowledge isn't very wanted anymore and I spent the last 7 years learning more of the administration and leadership side vs technical skills. Am I simply screwed? Do I have to scramble to learn spark and get AWS engineering certified before I'll be valuable to a company again? I keep getting calls from Linkin recruiters who want me to lead a cloud engineering team but I'm looking for a job as one of those engineers, not their leader. The salary doesn't even seem to be the issue, the issue is no one is looking for general data skills to help train into cloud engineers. I knew u was goin to have to learn throughout my career but I didn't expect this drastic of a shift.

1o3otpf,Need advice on designing a scalable vector pipeline for an AI chatbot (API-only data ~100GB JSON + PDFs),PrestigiousDemand996,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I’m working on a new AI chatbot project from scratch, and I could really use some architecture feedback from people who’ve done similar stuff.All the chatbot’s data comes from APIs, roughly 100GB of JSON and PDFs. The tricky part: there’s no change tracking, so right now any update means a full re-ingestion.Stack-wise, we’re on AWS, using Qdrant for the vector store, Temporal for workflow orchestration, and Terraform for IaC. Down the line, we’ll also build a data lake, so I’m trying to keep the chatbot infra modular and future-proof.My current idea: API → S3 (raw) → chunk + embed → upsert into Qdrant. Temporal would handle orchestration.I’m debating whether I should spin up a separate metadata DB (like DynamoDB) to track ingestion state, chunk versions, and file progress or just rely on Qdrant payload metadata for now.If you’ve built RAG systems or large-scale vector pipelines:* How did you handle re-ingestion when delta updates weren’t available?* Is maintaining a metadata DB worth it early on?* Any lessons learned or “wish I’d done this differently” moments?Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.

Set value = orig\_value, unless business updates the record. Something like:|value|orig\_value||:-|:-||A|A|Then, after updating the record:|value|orig\_value||:-|:-||B|A|Is there any reason NOT to do it this way? Business will make the updates to records by editing an upstream table via a file upload. I feel that this approach would simplify the SQL logic; a simple coalesce would do the job.

It’s more operational and repetitive, and my manager doesn’t really let me get involved in data or reporting work. My long term goal is to move into a machine learning engineer or data engineering role.I recently got an offer from another company in a different industry. The pay is in the low 80s and the role is hybrid with about two to three days in the office. It’s a bit more technical than what I do now since it focuses on Power BI and reporting, but it’s still not super advanced or coding heavy. The new job offers more PTO and I’d have more autonomy to build models and learn skills on my own. The only catch is that raises aren’t guaranteed or significant.Here’s my situation. My current company is fully in person but it’s less than 10 miles from home and school. The new job is 30 to 40 miles each way, so the commute would be a lot longer even though it’s hybrid. At the beginning of next year, I’ll be eligible to apply for internal transfers into more data driven departments. However, I’m not sure how guaranteed that process really is since this is my first job in the industry. If I do move into a different role internally, the pay becomes much more competitive, but again it’s not something I can fully rely on. I’m also due for a raise of around 4 percent, a bonus, and about 3K in tuition reimbursement that I’d lose if I left now.Financially, the new offer doesn’t change much. Maybe a few hundred more a month after taxes, but it offers hybrid flexibility, slightly more technical work, and a bit more freedom.Would you stay until the beginning of next year to collect the raise and bonus and then try to move internally into a more data focused role? Or would you take the hybrid offer in a new domain for the Power BI experience and flexibility, even though the commute is longer and the pay difference is small?TL;DR: First job out of college making mid 70K offered a low 80s hybrid role that’s a little more technical (Power BI and reporting) but in a new industry with longer commute and no guaranteed raises. Current job is closer to home and school, and I’ll get a raise, bonus, and tuition reimbursement if I stay until the beginning of next year plus a chance to transfer internally, though I’m not sure how guaranteed that is.

The current version supports Apache Spark, with Polars support in development.It is not intended to replace all pipeline programming work but rather make straightforward ETL tasks easier so engineers can focus on more interesting and complex problems.See an example configuration at the bottom of the post.

Even now, we study their work to understand how things actually function under the hood.So my questions are:What did they actually learn back then that made them capable of such deep work?Was it just ""computer science basics"" or something more?Did having fewer abstractions make them better engineers because they had to understand everything from the metal up?Is today's developer culture too reliant on tools and frameworks, while they built things from scratch?I'm genuinely curious—did the limitations of the time force them to think differently, or are we missing something in how we approach learning today?Would love to hear from people who were around back then or who study that era.

1o1s7q4,Is it possible to be too dumb to learn C?,True-Competition-889,learnprogramming,"I only lurk on Reddit, but I have to ask. Is it possible to be too dumb to learn C and low level programming? For reference, I am in college getting a degree in IT. My degree is generally more networking, infrastructure, and cybersecurity than computer science. The only computer science classes I have to take have been in python, a web development class, and an Intro to Computer Systems class in C. I did well in web development, and I absolutely LOVED the classes in python. C has been a different animal. I had to work SO hard to barely pass Intro to Computer Systems. The content was kind of interesting, but it was a ton of work. I made it though. I decided that low level just wasn't for me and moved on. Last year, I got to take a Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation class. It was all in C, but we didn't do any actual development in C. We only reverse engineered C code, then wrote exploits in assembly or hex. I loved this class as well. It was super hard, but I really enjoyed learning about how the exploits worked. The class was geared towards security researchers, which is not what I want to do, but I still loved it. My university's computer science program recently started an Operating Systems Development class, based on MIT's xv6 operating system (RISC-V). I decided to give low level development (specifically C) a second chance, but it has not been going well. The content is interesting, but I genuinely feel too stupid to learn it. The lectures feel impossible to follow, and the labs generally take me about twice as long to complete as other students. I mostly decided to take this class to learn more about a topic I probably wouldn't learn on my own, and I don't need this class to graduate. Regardless, I don't want to drop the class. I feel like I ""can"" do it, but its been so hard. It's kinda making me think that I might just not be smart enough to do low level programming, and that I should stick to the higher level stuff where I do better. Is it possible to not be smart enough? Or am I just making a big deal out of a skill issue? I enjoy learning about the content, but it takes me so long to get the labs done. Even after I complete them, I usually don't fully understand why my bug fixes work.

My first problem is that I feel a bit too old to just be starting to get my degree (I am 25yo right now) and feel behind most of my peers. The other thing, and perhaps the most technical one, is that I don't feel adequate.I try not to compare myself to other since doing so only seems to make feel worse. Thus, I try to compare with my past self. When doing so, I can see some real improvement (to put an example last year I was not comfortable AT ALL programing 2D arrays during my structured programming course, today I can code some programs using 3D arrays using pointers), nevertheless every now and then I come across a problem that really test me while not being overly complicated and really begin doubting my own abilities (the most recent was writing a program to calculate, using pointers, an Adjugate matrix of an user-input 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 matrix).I do my best not to rely on AI, I always work my code as far as I can on my own using stackOverflow (or similar) to look things up that I don't remember, and, if I do end up using AI, I make sure to be 100% sure of what each part of the code I used its help for does and how it works in conjunction with the rest of the code, so the next time I need to do something similar, I can do it myself.I **think** I like programming, it can be frustrating, it can be confusing, but ultimately seeing my work **do** something makes me feel proud, unfortunately that doesn't necessarily translate in getting a decent job to be able to support myself. I hear about projects that other people work on and cant see myself doing such complex tasks. This in conjunction of being in a whole different age bracket that most classmates, makes me doubt if I even have a future in this field (I am calculating, based on my missing courses, to be finishing by the time I am between 27 and 29 yo). Of course, I am already trying to see what I need to get a job while studying.Basically, I sometimes feel like I am learning, and others feels like I learned nothing at all, and being older as other freshmen/sophomores put me down a little bitDoes anyone that currently working in the field felt, or feel, like this?

Separating each class into a .h and a .cpp file.2. Using forward declarations in headers instead of including other headers whenever possible.3. Including the real headers only in the .cpp files where the functions are actually implemented.After doing this, all the circular include problems disappeared and everything compiled without errors.I know this might be obvious to experienced devs, but as a beginner, it was a big “aha” moment.If anyone has tips on structuring bigger C++ projects, I’d love to hear them.",13,0.93,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1o3sz8l/a_roadblock_i_didnt_see_coming_called_circular/,2025-10-11 11:14:53,2025-10-13 01:40:03

Honestly, I’m facing this right now. I have eight months of professional experience, but my GitHub and LinkedIn are practically empty.

The first question that comes to mind is: **what should I develop?** I’m thinking of starting with a simple project, like a CRUD, and then adding features like table relationships, authentication and authorization, caching, etc. On the other hand, I’m wondering if it would be better to split each topic into separate solutions:* **Project 1:** CRUD and relationships* **Project 2:** Authentication and authorization* **Project 3:** Combine everything + front-endI admit I’m not very creative yet and don’t have many ideas for solving real problems, but I’ve considered the following projects:1. **To-do List** – simple, easy, and generic, but many people already do this, which could be a downside.2. **Address API** – CRUD for addresses, integrating an external API for automatic address completion. But I wonder if it makes sense to use an API just to fill in addresses.3. **Identity API** – authentication and authorization system, including forms and two types of auth: JWT and OAuth, with email verification.At the moment, I’m focusing mainly on two projects: authentication and CRUD. I plan to build a full portfolio later, once I learn Angular and can integrate back-end and front-end.**Bonus question:** From what I wrote above, my insecurity probably shows, but is it worth creating creative projects for a junior developer position, or do companies mostly just want to see that you can use the technologies and figure things out?",12,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1o1upp0/how_to_build_relevant_portfolio_projects/,2025-10-09 02:39:42,2025-10-13 01:40:03

And it's really just a matter of what format and data type ""lens"" you want to view the data as?Having the characters 0-9 be their digit counterparts would make it easier to convert from text to numbers (granted, it isn't really that much harder now, because you just have to subtract a fixed offset from the character).Another reason I think they didn't take this route is that they wanted the NULL character to be represented by 0, which would slightly ruin the ""0-9 chars as 0-9 digits"" format, but couldn't they still make it work for 1-9?It really does just feel kind of non-intuitive to me why they chose to have digit characters not represented by their digits.

I’m working on an algorithms assignment (range maximum on a static array) and I’m stuck on the exact method/indexing.**Task (as I understand it)*** We have an array `a[1..n]`.* Build a complete binary tree over `a` where each internal node stores the max of its two children.* The tree is stored in an array (1-indexed). `h` is the index of the **first leaf**, so leaves occupy `[h .. 2h-1]`. (Pad with sentinels if `n` isn’t a power of two.)* Implement `maxInInterval(a, left, right)` that returns the **index in `a`** of the maximum element on the inclusive interval `[left, right]`.**My understanding / attempt*** Map endpoints to leaves: `i = h + left - 1`, `j = h + right - 1`.* While `i <= j`, if `i` is a right child, consider node `i` and move `i++`; if `j` is a left child, consider node `j` and move `j--`; then climb: `i //= 2`, `j //= 2`. Track the best max and its original array index.* Expected time: `O(log n)`.**What I’m unsure about**1. Is the “sweep inwards + climb” approach above the correct way to query with leaves at `[h..2h-1]`?2. When returning the **index in `a`**, what’s the standard way to preserve it while climbing? Store `(maxValue, argmaxIndex)` in every node?3. Are `[left, right]` both inclusive? (The spec says “interval” but doesn’t spell it out.)4. Edge cases: `left == right`, `left=1`, `right=n`, and non-power-of-two `n` (padding strategy).5. Proof sketch: is there a clean invariant to argue we visit at most `O(log n)` disjoint nodes that exactly cover `[left, right]`?**Tiny example**Suppose `a = [3, 1, 4, 2, 9, 5, 6, 0]`, so `n=8` and we can take `h=8`. Leaves are `t[8..15] = a[1..8]`.

The reason is simple: I can see the work I do immediately. Whether it’s on the web, desktop, or another platform, I genuinely enjoy seeing something appear on the screen. Backend, on the other hand, has always felt a bit boring to me; I write code, but I don’t see the result right away, the process feels tedious, and I lose motivation.Just doing frontend alone doesn’t feel fun enough. If nothing happens when I click a button, I can’t enjoy it and my motivation drops. Unless there’s some action involved a working system, data, and interaction frontend by itself isn’t enough for me.I’m now in my last year of high school, and I don’t know what to do for my career. I have a few project ideas in mind, but they’re either too big or don’t seem feasible. My backend knowledge isn’t sufficient either.

1o21qmk,Is there a mindset or formula to be a better programmer?,Effervescence_101,learnprogramming,"I’m a first year student in college learning c++ for the first time basically(i learned a bit a couple years ago but forgot most of it). I’m not sure if this makes sense but is there a way I should be approaching it or a certain mindset/perspective for trying to learn it. Programming feels so foreign it feels diff than with math where there are formulas and if you follow the method you’ll get the answer. I feel like i just get confused how you have to be so precise abt writing the code a certain way to get a desired output but even so there are still different ways to write it. Also, the fact that there are just so many aspects like functions, classes, references, pointers and trying to understand it is hard let alone writing the code from scratch. Looking at example code and figuring out the output is hard already, i find it even harder to write from scratch it feels so tedious and then im struggling to remember what these other things mean. Also, my class expects some type of prior knowledge but i’ve finally understood functions and we’re moving onto pointers, references, and classes so fast. Is there a better way to look at this, we’re moving so fast and I’m worried I’ll fall behind.

1o1z9m5,Confused about C literals type suffixes,Ssingleaspringle,learnprogramming,"I know that standard C types (long, unsigned long etc.) do not strictly define the size of memory allocated for a variable - the size may differ between platforms. For example x86_64 architecture on Linux uses 8 bytes for variables of type long and 32-bit ARM processors use 4 bytes for the same type (long). The solution for that problem would be to use fixed-width variable types like uint32_t. This part is quite self-explainatory: we can use fixed-width variable types for cross-platform portability.   But I don't quite understand how one should approach numeric literals in C. Let's say I assign a value like this: uint32_t x = 5; Many guides encourage and stress the use of type suffixes stating that I should write uint32_t x = 5LU to ensure the correct type of the assigned literal. LU stands for unsigned long. The part with unsigned kinda makes sense, but declaring a literal's type as long, long long etc. seems to kill the whole point of using uint32_t in the first place. A well-known case where this may cause problems is when performing binary operations on values like this.printf(""%zu, sizeof(1L));printf(""%ld, 1L << 31);The result (the same code compiled and run on x86_64 Linux and 32-bit ARM CPU) proves that this is a real problem and the usage of suffixes is not portable across platforms at all.ARM result: 4 -2147483648Linux result: 8 2147483648So my question is: how do you guys approach this problem? I've seen alternatives like using macros UINT32_C(5); or staight up casting (uint32_t) 5; but they also seem to have their own problems. The most common style I see is using suffixes. Programming teams also seem to not care that much (I get it - it's an additional 8 characters per variable declaration :face_with_tongue:) until it becomes a problem.",3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1o1z9m5/confused_about_c_literals_type_suffixes/,2025-10-09 07:04:20,2025-10-13 01:40:03

I instantly loved it , it felt meaningful, impactful, and technically interesting. So I jumped in, did a good bit of research, and started thinking about how I could make it my own.At first, my plan was to:* Build a basic sign language recognition system using a webcam, Python, and OpenCV.* Expand the word library beyond the typical 10-20 signs.* Focus specifically on Irish Sign Language (ISL) to localize it more.But as I kept researching, I realized I might’ve been on the wrong side of the internet early on, because it turns out that projects like this have already been done a *lot*. My additions (more words, ISL focus) don’t really feel like enough to count as a real advancement or innovation, especially for a final year project.I then thought: what if I added a region detection feature? Something that could detect which sign language dialect is being used (e.g., ASL vs BSL vs ISL). But again, the more I dig, the more I see that similar ideas have been explored — and I'm starting to feel like I’m just re-inventing existing wheels without offering anything new.To be honest, I’m really stuck now, I’ve backed myself into a project that’s been done too many times already, and I’m not sure how to meaningfully innovate it.I would love some advice on this, what more can i add, and should i just give up.

The issue: the **Objective-C delegate methods never get called**.After researching, I suspect it’s because **Objective-C requires a run loop** to be active for delegates to trigger. When my code was part of a full macOS app, it worked fine — but now that it’s being called through the C interface (and from Python), the delegates don’t fire.I’ve tried:* Manually running `[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] run]` in different threads.* Creating my own loop and dispatching the delegate calls manually.* Using Python threads and `ctypes` to spawn a native loop.None of these approaches worked.So I’m wondering: **How can I properly start and manage the Objective-C run loop when my C/Objective-C code is being called from Python via ctypes?** Is there a known pattern or workaround for this type of cross-language integration?Thanks a lot in advance — any help or pointers to similar cases would be super appreciated!",2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1o354az/objectivec_delegates_not_firing_when_called_from/,2025-10-10 16:07:09,2025-10-13 01:40:03

I started work last week, and everything seemed to be going great, I was onboarding smoothly and was getting great vibes all around from the people and the team. In a huge turn of events, on my 2nd day, they suddenly told me they no longer needed me and ended my employment, no negotiations. It was completely unexpected and I am still in shock. I had barely settled in and was still getting used to the new environment. It felt like they were never serious about hiring me from the start considering I could just get let go randomly on my 2nd day, but it's also extremely unfair to me having quit my job at big tech and leaving my friends and family to move across the world to work for them. Has anyone had such an experience before before? Is this a common thing among AI startups right now where hiring-and-firing is just part of the culture?Anyhow, I am now stuck in San Francisco alone with a 60-day window to find a new job before my visa runs out. If anyone has any advice on how to get through this period, or could refer me to any opportunities in backend, AI, ML, or infrastructure engineering roles in the Bay Area, it would mean everything to me. I have experience as a backend engineer working on large-scale AI/ML infrastructure at big tech, and also full-stack development across smaller companies. I'm open to any types of companies at this point and will put in my best work wherever I end up next.P.S. Some people are accusing this post of not being real, or sounds fake. It absolutely happened. I understand why doubts are being casted, and I do agree we should not trust everything on the internet, but on the flip side, I do need some room for anonymity as well, considering this post has already been seen by 73k users.

1o3mf8y,"No, AI is not taking tech jobs. At least yet.",hrrm,cscareerquestions,"[https://imgur.com/a/K96VYOd](https://imgur.com/a/K96VYOd)FRED data shows that software development job postings increased post-pandemic (due to low federal funds rate and quantitative easing by the Fed) and reached at peak in early 2022. At this time, the Fed finally decided to reverse their take on inflation being only transitory, and began their first rate hike to begin cooling the economy in an attempt to suppress rising inflation. Corporations responded to this shift in monetary policy and began immediately reducing their hiring and thus job postings. Over the course of the year, SWE job postings fell rapidly.In November of 2022, ChatGPT was widely released. Following that, other models by other companies were widely released. The rate of job post reduction did not accelerate following ChatGPTs release. The rate of job post reduction did not accelerate following other model releases. In fact, the declining rate of job postings slowed as the Fed reduce their rate of interest rate hikes. The number of SWE job postings is not materially different now than it was the day that CoPilot and Gemini released.I am asserting that the CS job market today is almost entirely a product of the normal labor market effects during a Federal Funds Interest Rate hike cycle. The layoffs we see today are still a hold over from the massive hiring effort made post-pandemic compounded by corporations now being squeezed due to comparatively speaking high interest rates.Largely, not completely, any company that conducts layoffs citing AI are doing so as a PR play as it makes it sound as though they are able to the same work with less overhead and are expertly adopting this new technology, when in reality they are just responding to the squeeze. Any job seeker unable to find a job and citing reasons due to AI are doing so because it protects their ego or they are uninformed about the greater monetary policy and labor market effects at play.",221,0.85,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o3mf8y/no_ai_is_not_taking_tech_jobs_at_least_yet/,2025-10-11 04:33:49,2025-10-13 01:40:05

1o43iop,Senior Engineer with 8+ YOE: Sankey Diagram of my Job Search,book-store-coder,cscareerquestions,"[https://imgur.com/a/wqXqjDa](https://imgur.com/a/wqXqjDa)I wanted to share what my job search journey was like as a more tenured engineer, since most posts here are from people with less experience. I've been working at a FAANG for a bit over eight years, and got promoted to Senior around three years ago.I recently went on a job search, and things went very well for me. I spent several months (April to July) preparing, did a bunch of mock interviews, solved hundreds of LeetCode questions, etc. That dedicated prep was absolutely vital. While my experience helped me get interviews, the prep work was what allowed me to pass interviews. If I had just started applying without putting the prep work in, I probably would have gotten around the same number of responses, but I would not have been nearly as successful once I got to the interviews themselves. I applied to most of these companies over the last week of July, and ultimately signed a deal with a household name tech company as a Staff Engineer in early October.I really feel for all the new grads out there - when I was applying, I quickly realized I didn't need to filter the job listings by experience, because basically every company had almost exclusively Senior and above roles - there were barely any new grad or even just early career listings that I could see. It definitely looks like it's a tough market for new engineers, but (in my experience, which isn't saying it'll be true for everyone) the market for Senior and Staff seems relatively robust.Happy to answer any questions.

1o2gue3,If you're worried about landing a developer job...,TomBanjo86,cscareerquestions,"If you're worried about landing a developer job and/or are worried that AI is eliminating web dev roles, you should really consider opening up to SRE/SysDE/Production engineering roles and ramp up your skills on that side of the CS spectrum.

I don't really understand this philosophy for the people who are acting like AI killed their career or are otherwise frantically job hunting. To me the writing is on the wall: these roles seem to be replacing ""full stack"" developer roles in a lot of companies. The scope of ""full stack"" has changed significantly over the last several years and the way that the hyperscalers and big business alike are operating if your skills don't cross over into cloud/infra management you're simply not going to be able to meet their needs for a high paying role anymore. The only exceptions to that of course seem to be ML engineers or the work that rides even closer to the hardware than the SRE role demands.

So I wasn't doing pure software development - it was more data engineering and integration focused work.Here's where I'm struggling. I do get some responses to applications - not many, but a few here and there. The problem is when I actually get to the interview stage, I'm struggling badly. I've gotten really rusty after 7 months out of the field, and interviewers dive way deeper into technical concepts than I expect. Things I used to know well - AWS integrations, ETL architecture, even some Python specifics - are getting fuzzy. I can talk about what I did at a high level, but when they start asking detailed technical questions or want me to architect something on the spot, I'm just not sharp anymore. It's like I know I used to understand this stuff, but I can't access it quickly enough in the moment.On top of that, I genuinely don't know what jobs I should even be targeting with my background. My title was ""Application Engineer"" but the work was really data engineering and integration heavy. Should I be going for Data Engineer roles? Backend Engineer? DevOps or Platform Engineer positions? Cloud Engineer roles? I honestly don't know anymore, and I think I might be applying to the wrong types of positions entirely, which is why the interviews feel so mismatched when I do get them.I'm also struggling with how to describe what I actually did. When I write ""data integration"" and ""ETL maintenance"" on my resume, it sounds way less impressive than the work actually was, but I don't know how to articulate the complexity without sounding like I'm overselling it. And the market being brutal right now isn't helping - I know 2025 has been terrible for everyone, but getting through interviews when I'm this rusty is becoming impossible.I'm at the point where I'm considering a few different paths but I'm not sure which makes sense. Maybe I should take some time to rebuild my skills systematically before continuing to interview, possibly through grad courses or something structured. Maybe I should pivot to a different type of role that's easier to break into right now. Or maybe I just need to figure out how to prep better for these deep technical interviews. Honestly, I don't know anymore.So I guess my questions for this community are: Based on the experience I described, what job titles and roles should I actually be targeting? I feel like I'm applying to positions that don't quite match my background and that's showing up in interviews. How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field? What's the most efficient way to rebuild technical skills when you've been disconnected for this long, especially the deep technical knowledge that comes up in interviews? Is my experience even marketable in the current climate, or is ""data integration and ETL work"" too niche or not in-demand right now? And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again? What actually worked for rebuilding that technical depth?The problem is I'm bombing them because I'm not technically sharp anymore. I need tactical guidance on whether I should pause and rebuild skills first, or if there's a way to prep more effectively for these deep technical conversations. Any honest feedback would be really appreciated because I'm genuinely lost here.",69,0.95,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o2dn13/7_months_postlayoff_skills_getting_rusty/,2025-10-09 18:22:37,2025-10-13 01:40:05

Tell me what you wanna see, and I can make it happenBut I've been in senior roles for a while and it doesn't really feel like I *ever* use my technical abilities anymore. Often, I feel actively held back from doing so. Like I could easily fix a bug, but there's often tons of overhead and planning that make it not really worth doing. I spend most of my time fighting with people over things that really don't matter, trying to decode a bunch of corporate jargon, and trying to navigate navigate corporate politicsI feel like I've never doubted my ability to deliver on anything that anyone wants in my domain (frontend), it's usually just an oddly bureaucratic set of hoops to jump through to get even the most basic things done. 90% of time is just spent communicating to higher ups, and only a minuscule fraction of time is available for coding.

I just joined a Fortune 500 company after working at a small startup, and my new employer offers \~$5k/year in tuition reimbursement for any degree ""relevant to my role"". I did my bachelor’s at WGU and would probably go that route again since I could likely finish a master’s in about 6 months, making it effectively free to me.Right now, I’m not sure any of these options would directly change my position or pay in the short term, but I want to optimize for the future and keep doors open for higher-paying roles, whether as an IC or a manager. Here are the contenders:1. M.S. in Software Engineering - Closest to what I do now. Could help fill in gaps in areas I haven’t worked in, but not sure how much employability upside it really has.2. M.S. in Computer Science - The title alone sounds stronger than Software Engineering. Has AI specializations that align with my new role. Might make me stand out more technically down the road.3. MBA in IT Management - I’m interested in becoming an engineering manager eventually, but I don’t know how much a specialization like this actually matters for that.4. General MBA - The broadest option. If specialization doesn’t matter much, maybe this is better? Could also hedge for a career pivot (not planning one, but never hurts).5. None - Maybe all of these are just a waste of time, energy, and opportunity cost :'(Has anyone here gone through one of these paths or similar? Did it actually help your career or comp long-term?

(B) AI Consultant in the Netherlands: Immediate relocation and visa, but at a smaller, unknown company with less technical depth. Which path is better for a long-term international career in AI?:loudly_crying_face:**\[background\]** I have been working in one of the Big 4 in Japan as a tech strategy consultant for 1.5 years as a new grad. But the job was only focusing on upstream, and didn't have practical data analysis or AI application opportunities, not even a PoC. In the worst cases, the jobs were not even about AI but some robotics fields. (This is because I failed to join the AI team due to my misfortune.)This is frustrating, as I have a Master's in CS and 6+ years of practical data science and engineering experience from internships, and I feel my technical skills are atrophying.My search criteria were simple:* (1) deepening my hands-on technical skills in an AI-related field* (2) balancing upstream (strategy) with downstream (hands-on implementation)* (3) working in a global environment, ideally relocating to English-speaking countries in the future* (4) opportunity for the next career**\[current situation\]**And I got offers from (A) Accenture as a Data Scientist in Japan and (B) a Japanese mid-sized IT company as an AI Consultant (including implementation) in the Netherlands.

At the start, everything felt perfect the team was friendly, people would talk and engage. But as the weeks went by, I started seeing the reality. My mentor never seemed interested in genuinely solving my problems. Whenever I’d share updates or ask for help, she’d just avoid it or brush things off with random things. Major issues in my project were ignored by her, even though the entire team, including the manager, knew about these blockers. Because of this, I lost 3–4 weeks struggling with blockers while no one actually helped.Honestly, my communication wasn’t the best since this was my first job. I thought putting in hard work would be enough, but I soon realised it’s more about networking and “being seen.” Even so, I completed my project completely from start to finish, pushing thousands of lines of code in the last five days before my internship ended.After all that effort, I didn’t get a return offer. The HR gave me random feedback which wasn’t even related to my actual work. It was clear my mentor and manager had already made up their minds. She never gave me any feedback during the entire internship. Even after it ended, I reached out to her, but she just ignored my message. She’s only skilled at looking good in front of upper management.This whole experience has taken a major mental toll on me. Even now, months after rejection, I feel like a failure. Every time I open LeetCode or even see job openings from that company on LinkedIn, it messes with my mind. Most interns got converted to full-time, even those who barely worked meanwhile, I did everything right and still got left behind. I’d be labelled as a failure in front of other interns, the team, and even networks within the company man.Although I did get another offer, working at that company was my dream. That dream was completely destroyed because of these people. Whenever I try to talk about it, people just give me sympathy and say, “You’ll get better opportunities.” But they don’t realise life doesn’t throw big opportunities every day.

1o4ao7y,Tips for avoiding toxic companies?,cs_____question1031,cscareerquestions,"I just can't do another toxic company honestly. I've had three in a row. I've started self-reflecting and trying to figure out how I keep ending up in them and how to avoid them in the future. Here's a few key things I thought of:1. if a company has a non disparagement clause in their *employment* contract, they are probably not a good place to bother with. It means that you won't be able to find ""real"" data online so it's just a shot in the dark2. Ask companies about their reviews, especially negative ones. At the worst company I worked at, I brought up a negative review. The CTO basically went ""oh, just a bunch of dumb disgruntled employees, I don't know what their problem was"". Suffice it to say, I now certainly know what their problem was, and I think they were quite justified in their opinion3. Companies under 100 employees are deeply unstable and promoting a single person can make everyone's life a fucking nightmare4. Use ChatGPT deep research for company sentiment. I would also recommend you ask it to break it down by year, saying how the company culture has evolved. I just did it for one company I worked at that I said I disliked, and it was literally 100% correct5. Do what you can to check for cult-like behavior.

I graduated in May and have been fortunate enough to get a software engineering job at a small start up and have been learning a lot the last three months. I didn't use AI for coding at all in college, which seems to be uncommon since it came out a couple months into my freshman year, but I cared too much about learning things for myself and the satisfaction of coding to bother with it much. When I started my job, our lead/senior dev encouraged using AI to speed up processes and handle some tedious tasks. I've been using ChatGPT for writing unit tests, doing more difficult research and bug finding, etc. which are things that I was asked to do to speed things up. I am cool with using it as a tool to augment my programming and I'm sure it does speed things up. Recently, they've had me install Cursor, which again, I admit is cool and it works, but what the hell is the point of being a software engineer with this? I'm told I still need to know what I am doing, still need to do research into what libraries and patterns to use, review the generated code, etc. but I'm starting feeling like I entered this field too late to actually be a programmer if this is the new expectation. I don't want to push back on using Cursor, but I want to be writing my own code. I don't want to fall behind in efficiency when the other two engineers are heavily using Cursor, but I don't want to lose the skill of coding and problem solving for myself.

1o1x64j,Potentially doing a 2nd masters degree due to unemployment; a good idea?,zuniloc01,cscareerquestions,"I was laid off earlier this year from my first job at a startup, and have been on the job market ever since. Counting internships, I have about 1.5 years of total experience (without internships, I only have 3 months). I graduated with a masters degree in December 2023 (only coursework, no thesis) and then spent some time unemployed before finding my first role.Since entry level is only going to get more competitive, I'm thinking of doing another masters degree if I cannot find anything by the end of this year. Is this the ideal way to proceed? Right now, I'm pursuing personal projects, maintaining my Medium blog and building projects in public. Money is not an obstacle for me (in-state tuition is cheaper).While doing this will definitely buy me more time and save me from having a huge career gap, I would be making a gamble that this period will allow me to network more and get one internship that would hopefully convert to a full time offer. Also, I would need to figure out how to get updated recommendation letters, which is not going to be easy with this time gap...Has anyone gone through this similar situation and ended up going back to school?

1o1kxjn,What should I be doing to get a job right now as a guy with bad experience?,shade_blade,cscareerquestions,"I feel like my job search is going nowhere, about 1000 applications in and nothing has really stuck (only a few calls recently, most recent one was for a place hundreds of miles away paying $45k that still said no)Every position out there gets 100s to 1000s of applicants so I have to be top 1% or top 0.1% to get any chance of getting anything. Things are especially bad because all the entry level positions get flooded by people with experience who are obviously better than me in every way? There's also no more spring 2025 positions pretty much, like all those new grad positions don't even have an option to say I've graduated in spring 2025 outside of the ""other"" option which means my application would probably get thrown out instantly.Experience wise I am in a bad spot, I don't have very much ""real"" internship experience, the past 4 summers in college I was at a small 1 guy + random interns place where I did random hardware ish projects with PLCs. Some years I had projects where I made a mini server and made some pages with PHP and Javascript, another year I made a small app for Zoom meetings on a headset, but none of that really counts as real stuff because I don't have any real metrics for them (because I don't have any relationship with the companies my boss was making stuff for, I can't just ask them to give me months of random data for me to see exactly how much money the thing I did made?). My parents put my old resume in ChatGPT and got something that just looks so much worse to me? It ended up making those 4 summers into one thing which to me just looks like a complete lie. Background check would immediately see that I only did like 12 months instead of 4 consecutive years or even without a background check they would think I am completely lying because I can't work a full time in person internship in one city and go to college full time in person 100 miles away, that is not believable. Should I just put that lie there anyway???But that's all in the past now, I have to do something to make myself more hireable now before my qualifications drop to zero, but I just don't know what. I can't really do networking because there's basically nothing in the way of local software openings. Befriending some random in some company isn't really going to help me unless they are someone really high up, but I just don't have that kind of charisma to make myself the best friend of some hiring person to the point that I will get in instead of all the much higher qualified people out there.Project wise I am in a bad spot too. Some college classes gave me some stuff to put on there, one class had a group project where our group made a web app with React and Firebase but that doesn't really mean much as it wasn't a ""real"" project with big profit numbers and impressive metrics of any kind. I also spent a year in high school making a old game mod with assembly but that doesn't really count because assembly code is not something anyone is hiring at entry level. It has a playerbase that I estimated to be roughly 5000+ but that doesn't really count for anything because it's not a dollar value.I just can't think of a good project to do that has anything ""impressive"" or would lead to massively impressive metrics? The only real metrics they care about are dollar values? Because anything other than those aren't really ""impressive"" (it doesn't matter if you've written X lines of code or worked with a database of X size or had X users or used X different programming languages or technologies because they don't really care about that). I don't know how to turn a profit as a guy who isn't an entrepreneur, marketer or good artist. Everything out there bangs on about those stupid metrics and it just frustrates me to no end. Because I don't know how to make anything impressive at all. I can't really think of something that distinguishes ""stupid toy project"" vs ""something hiring people are impressed by"" outside of something profitable or something made specifically for that company (which is just infeasible for me to do, I can't spend months on a massive project just to apply to a single company and have those hiring people not even bother looking).I also don't really have good answers to all the STAR questions they ask? Because I never have a result that's better than ""it got done"" or something similar. Like I keep repeating in this post I don't have metrics and I don't know how to make a project that makes those metrics happen. I also don't have good answers for their other kind of questions like ""explain a time where you had a conflict with a coworker"" because I don't have experience like that (the worst that happened to the groups I was in was more like ""minor disagreement that gets resolved in 1 minute"", I just don't have a compelling story about how all the group members were arguing for hours and then I stopped it in 1 second.). I also never have a good answer for ""why do you want to work for this company"" because I don't really care about random company #1000 I've applied to, I just can't give them the answer ""I have always strived to work for this specific company and I have never applied to anything else and I will die for this company that I've only heard of when I saw the job posting""",10,0.79,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o1kxjn/what_should_i_be_doing_to_get_a_job_right_now_as/,2025-10-08 19:42:51,2025-10-13 01:40:05

I know some individuals will point out that it's not ideal to do this in this economy, but I also know that I'm in a point of my career where if I don't take some time off now, I will never have the opportunity to do so as I currently don't have any kids.

I think I'd be happier helping those who actually need help, in this case, students.* Work-life balance - It feels extremely prevalent nowadays, at all levels (jr, mid, senior, etc), to be expected to push above and beyond, both during and after work hours. I'm not saying that teaching is easy and doesn't require planning/marking outside of work, but I feel that this is less often and demanding in comparison. I would like to keep my peace of mind after work hours.I think generally my strengths align with teaching, and that this would be a more fulfilling career.Is there anything I would regret?Some obvious things that come to mind:* Salary difference, especially early on.* Longer establishment time (2 years for teachers college, then supply teaching, etc.)Thank you in advance!",10,0.82,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nzp9hg/jr_engineer_thinking_of_career_change/,2025-10-06 17:19:31,2025-10-13 01:40:05
1nz8p1z,Does anyone know roughly what percent of applicants get OAs / phone screens at the internship/new grad level at tech companies?,risingsun1964,cscareerquestions,"I've never really seen an estimate given on here, but looking at Sankey diagrams and anecdotes, I'm seeing some people say 5%, others 1%, some 0%. It seems like for big tech, mathematically, about 5% would make sense because you have the long interview loops afterwards to sort it down to 0.1-0.2% for offer rate. For midtier/startups, maybe 2%, with 5-10% of those getting offers? Of course this will vary based on school and prior experience, but does this sound about right on average? It confuses me seeing some people with experience/target schools apply to thousands and get 1 response while others with neither get 20 interviews out of 500 applications. Maybe a lot of the ones without much luck are international. Does anyone have anything to add?Bonus question: If you're really really good at leetcode, like top 2% and can solve pretty much any unseen medium/hard in 25 minutes, is this typically enough to get into big tech or at least upper-middle tech within a couple years with an average resume?",10,0.73,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nz8p1z/does_anyone_know_roughly_what_percent_of/,2025-10-06 03:39:24,2025-10-13 01:40:05

Thousands of applications and only a small handful of interviews / calls have gone nowhere so they have amounted to a total waste of time. I'm applying all over the place, for pretty much anything remotely CS related I have most of the experience for so it's not like I only look for remote stuff or $100k+ stuff (in fact I don't even apply to positions that pay that much anymore because I know their standards are too high for me to meet). I have more personal projects that aren't on my resume but they are not really something that I can put on my resume as they don't generate money, aren't complete projects and have no users and aren't particularly impressive in any way, so in effect I am not doing anything at all every day.[worse resume link](https://imgur.com/a/eUrbC84)Here's a version of my resume where I removed the non programming stuff, the imperfect GPA, the irrelevant degree, the skills not related to positions on the resume as well as the video game projects as they probably don't count as real projects. To me it just looks even worse in every way and there is zero chance I can get hired with it? Does this mean I am unhireable? It looks like I didn't get anything for the past few years and thus I am a terrible employee that nobody should ever hire. There's also way too much white space because there is nothing more to say about each position that isn't just restating the same things over and over or saying extremely basic stuff (like they don't need to know the exact random libraries I used and it probably would look bad on me for talking about those? I also heard that me talking about something as basic as ajax requests is also bad?)[more complete resume link](https://imgur.com/a/iaYDKYg)Even with the more complete resume it still feels very terrible in terms of me competing with other people (I feel like maybe the bar for entry level is having several years of highly relevant non internship experience which I'm never going to get if I don't get a job). Adding in the skills for each position also breaks it when I put it into Workday so I have to get rid of them? It doesn't matter if it looks better to a human recruiter if the system parses it so badly I get trashed immediately so I should remove them?I just don't know at all what I should be doing to get a job? I haven't been working on ""real"" projects because I don't know how to make those (a project isn't real unless it's generating money and/or has a ton of users?). I know there is a definitive thing I should be doing but I don't know what it is? No amount of ""just do it"" is going to help me find that correct answer, I can't ""just make a game"" like my parents want because that is something that requires years of (non programming) work to make something profitable, and even then companies don't even see video game projects as real projects so all that effort would not help me even slightly?",7,0.73,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o4yzi1/how_to_not_be_unhireable/,2025-10-12 19:56:49,2025-10-13 01:40:05
1o4241l,Money or remote work?,moondaybitch,cscareerquestions,"I'm in the fortunate position to have 2 job offers right now. One of which is full remote (permanently), and the other is in person 4 days a week, with a 1 day WFH policy. The remote gig would be a pretty good salary bump from my current role and has comparable benefits to my current position, which is also remote (but less time off). The in office gig would be significantly better benefits when it comes to PTO, retirement contributions, and while the base salary is the same as the other role, there is an annual discretionary bonus that I have been told averages 35-65% of your base salary (but of course... discretionary) which would make it SIGNIFICANTLY more financially desirable. I had a really great impression of the culture at both companies in my interviews, however a friend of my mentor warned her that the in office place has toxic tendencies, not from personal experience but via the grapevine from others in the same industry. This really surprised me as I felt like everyone I met was SO friendly and nice and that I would really enjoy working with them, but I don't want to fully discount his take as my mentor trusts him. That said, based on glassdoor reviews I am getting a picture that a certain side of the company is pretty toxic, however the team I'm joining has no overlap with that group. But it's hard to know where the spillover is of course. I have heard good things about the remote company's culture, but my friend who works there has told me he has some issues with upper leadership's direction (but has said he thinks those issues would exist at most companies). The remote one is more of a career advancing step into a leadership position, whereas the in office one is somewhere I would get to grow my skills and work closely with mentors to improve technically. I would definitely be locking in in either role to perform well, but with slightly different dynamics. I have about 5 years of experience, so while I think I could tackle the remote leadership opportunity, I don't feel as secure in my skillset as I might want to be in order to perform really well in such a high impact role -- so I think that role would involve a high degree of personal time spent learning off the job to make sure I could keep up. The remote role has much more flexible hours so I could continue to step out for an occasional 2pm pilates class if I felt like it, but there is an on call component where I would need to do unpaid overtime occasionally outside of core hours. On the contrary, obviously I'm not doing a workout class in the middle of the day if I take the in office role, but there is no on-call component and the interviewers I spoke with all told me they have never done any overtime and that when they close their laptops at the end of the day, that's really it, which also appeals to me as the remote boundary blurring has been a big issue in my current role as well.Both have tech stacks I see as very transferrable skills, although my mentor pointed out the remote one would have much better name recognition when it came time to job hunt next. (Another positive about the in office role is that everyone I spoke with has been there 5+ years, which seemed like a really positive sign about retention). I am honestly very tempted by the in office role, but multiple friends have told me I'm nuts for not taking the remote role and the phrase ""blinded by money"" has been used.

1o4ib37,How to upskill soft skills?,LiveMathematician892,cscareerquestions,"So, I keep getting an excellent feedback about my technical ability, yet, I get shit about my soft skills. The thing is, they won't tell what's the actual problem. All I hear are ""oh, you don't like small talk much"" or ""You're rude and not diplomatic enough"".How I would describe myself:1) I indeed don't like small talk, I know more or less how it works, I just find it annoying and sort of pointless. I know that's how you can create a relationship and such... But I see those guys, at best, 2 times within a year when the team gets of remote, why would anyone care about that? I'm, like all of them, there for the money and thats that... It will read ""machiavelistic"", assholish or something like that but for the last decade give or take the only relationships I built, or tried to build, was with people where I saw something that I could gain from. It was either people who were smarter than me, people with connections or information that I wanted (although sometimes I think there was misjudgement and I was thinking about getting laid, or at best it was connection of both). This kind of worked and let me get my foot in the door, despite many shortcoming on my end at the time. The issue is, these people are out of the picture, atm way too often I do feel like I'm the smartest person in the room, or, at the very least, knowing the smarter person won't get me anywhere, feel like it's just a matter of a workplace. It ain't Google, Microsoft or anything of the kind, its just some run of the mill company pushing out overengineered, slow, unmaintainable code. Wasnt it for the bad market and my decent pay (Ill have hard time finding a job where Ill get a payrise significant enough to risk a job change in this market. These people won't get me anywhere other than up the ladder in the company, but even so, I rarely get to interact with people other than a lead of my project whos a bit of a pushover. I mean, I don't see any other solution to the issue than reprogamming myself (how???) to attempt building relationships with anyone, not just someone I want to bang or where I feel like there is a clear benefit to gain from them. Only person that I feel like I really somewhat connected at the firm is a tester designated to my project who hates and trashtalks it about as much as I do, that made us have something in common...2) I'm the kind of guy that leaves a lot of comments under PRs. I get a cred for it, at the very least from upper management. It's not about the extra spaces or formatting, although at extreme cases I'll point that out, I just hate mess or the ""iterative development"" where lack of code review lets very obvious bugs get to the repo, hinder development and generate more work (more PRs). Most people at my company don't do the review, but were getting back to 1) here - most people at my firm are just bad/very average devs (or at the very least lack ambition or are burned out).3) I tend to be ""judgemental"" or ""rude"". This is coming from me sometimes pointing out someone did a poor job (overengineer a feature, create a poorly worded ticket etc.) without beating around the bush. The thing is, I'm not completely f-ed in the head, I don't do that from day one, the frustation really needs to reach the boiling point where the same thing happens a number of times. But you know what sucks about it, that I give a shit about being ""rude"" or ""judgemental""? When I tried being nice, giving ""constructive criticism"" at retros, vaguely pointing out things that could be improved... Nothing f happened. You know the routine, theres action point, theres fake action to handle it, then maybe there is a call on what to do, and then somewhat checks the issue as resolved and we move on. Only by expressing my frustation over a longer period, so it was finally escalated to a person that gives a damn, my points that I gave several figureheads finally started to be taken seriously, I made an impact. At the end of the day, the person that matters, sees it as a double edged sword (or something like that) - this dude cares about this project and this company, but hes a douchebag/cant get his point across via diplomatic means.TLDR: I dont know how to force myself to small talk / building relationships that I find ""pointless"" i.e. without easy to spot value and don't know how to communicate issues/suggest improvements (it feels like at my current firm I need to break the chain of command and go the highest person immediately)",5,0.73,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o4ib37/how_to_upskill_soft_skills/,2025-10-12 06:56:06,2025-10-13 01:40:05

Some of it is boring, but some is interesting and I'm starting to move up in the company and be responsible for my own projects after 18 months.They paid a recruiter probably a lot of money to get me just 18 months ago, and I work with the head of the department on a weekly basis who is a really nice guy. Everyone at the top of the company in my engineering department has been there for 5, 10, or 20 years (200 people total). I don't usually have to work more than 40 hours and when I do I'm paid for it.They treat their employees well, but I have a better offer (25% raise) doing more elite work for more money. It's like the engineering equivalent of a FAANG I guess. I can't shake the horrible feeling of guilt when I imagine having to tell my boss that I'm leaving after less than 2 years and that the time they spent answering my questions was a waste. I know the new company puts a lot of investment in their employees like my current one does though.Also my wife really wants to be a stay at home mom soon and this gets us closer to that goal.",6,0.64,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o1rrpr/feeling_guilty_about_possibly_leaving_job/,2025-10-09 00:18:04,2025-10-13 01:40:05
1o0pq17,Considering switch to cloud engineering/devops from software development. Any advice from people with experience in that area?,schmubbyboi,cscareerquestions,I have 3.5 years of software dev experience. Some full stack and some backend Java api work. My current position pays pretty well but I do a bunch of tedious busy work and am not challenged. Also feel overwhelmed working on a massive project that has a ton of old legacy code. I hardly know anything about the code base and feel pretty useless.Considering cloud engineering to shake things up and gain some job security given the ability of AI to replicate a lot of the work I do on a daily basis. Does anybody have insight on the proposition for someone in my position making the switch? Is it worth it to invest that time to learn the necessary skills and how much of a job market is there?,6,0.88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o0pq17/considering_switch_to_cloud_engineeringdevops/,2025-10-07 20:08:33,2025-10-13 01:40:05
1nzw60p,"Stagnate on an interesting, friendly team, or leap of faith to unknown for experience?",stacks_n_queues,cscareerquestions,"**tl;dr Would you rather 1) stay on an interesting team where you're happy, but your skills are stagnating and you're not gaining a breadth of experience, or 2) jump to a less interesting team with unknowns, but gaining new experience?**Context: I've been on my team for 6+ years. Everything is pretty good (work-life balance, team culture, etc.). The work is interesting and I'm optimistic and at least semi-interested in the product. I've gone from entry level to senior on this team, and can still have career progression here.However, I feel my technical skills have been stagnating. There isn't much engineering mentorship, so I haven't been learning better engineers. If I got laid off today, I don't think future jobs would think my skills match my resume/level. Additionally, my role is very specialized, so I'm being pigeonholed in where I can work, since despite being senior, I lack a breadth of experience.Dilemma: I was offered an internal transfer role to a team doing something completely different, and has many higher level engineers to learn from. However, there are lots of unknowns. The product itself seems much less interesting, and of course there is no telling how the people are to work with or the team culture.What would you do in this situation? Stay where you're at, happy currently, but letting my growth stagnate and potentially limiting my options in the future, or take a leap of faith in order to gain experience?Thanks in advance!",5,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nzw60p/stagnate_on_an_interesting_friendly_team_or_leap/,2025-10-06 21:33:42,2025-10-13 01:40:05
1o4u3pe,Can I side-project my way into DevOps & Infra?,Mysterious-Flow-9860,cscareerquestions,"I pivoted from my useless business degree into tech, now working as a Junior SRE for a year. It was quite a journey to end up here but this obviously means I don't come from a CS background and have no prior experience in tech. Currently, I'm loving the job, although there's obviously learning curves to overcome each day. I've had positive reviews so far and my responsibilities do continue to grow so I think I'm keeping up with the pace well.That being said, the company I work at is a big global company, so the teams are quite specialized. My team in particular is all-things reliability, but I feel like I need to expand my skillsets. I rarely have the chance to work with k8s, docker, terraform, AWS/GCP, istio, and all those stuff in the DevOps & Infra side of things and part of me feels like I should in order to keep more career options open. My question is, can I do that outside of my actual work? In other words is it possible to get (hire-able) working knowledge & skills of these technologies through independent side projects, self-study & certifications supplemented with only SRE work experience (mainly dealing with observability, load testing, launch readiness testing, DR, etc).On one hand I know I had these exact concerns when I first pivoted, but I feel like having junior level expectations was very different.",3,0.72,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o4u3pe/can_i_sideproject_my_way_into_devops_infra/,2025-10-12 16:49:50,2025-10-13 01:40:05
