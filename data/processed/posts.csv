1lhgnlz,Interviewer keeps praising me because I wrote tests,psgpyc,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I recently finished up a take home task for a data engineer role that was heavily focused on AWS, and I’m feeling a bit puzzled by one thing. The assignment itself was pretty straightforward an ETL job. I do not have previous experience working as a data engineer.I built out some basic tests in Python using pytest. I set up fixtures to mock the boto3 S3 client, wrote a few unit tests to verify that my transformation logic produced the expected results, and checked that my code called the right S3 methods with the right parameters. The interviewer were showering me with praise for the tests I have written. They kept saying, we do not see candidate writing tests. They keep pointing out how good I was just because of these tests.But here’s the thing: my tests were super simple. I didn’t write any integration tests against Glue or do any end-to-end pipeline validation. I just mocked the S3 client and verified my Python code did what it was supposed to do. I come from a background in software engineering, so i have a habit of writing extensive test suites. Looks like just because of the tests, I might have a higher probability of getting this role.How rigorously do we test in data engineering?",357,0.96,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lhgnlz/interviewer_keeps_praising_me_because_i_wrote/,2025-06-22 05:50:36,2025-06-28 01:41:19
1lkfghr,I don't enjoy working with AI...do you?,clueless3867,dataengineering,"I've been a Data Engineer for 5 years, with years as an analyst prior.

I don't enjoy writing prompts for AI to then do the stuff that I really like.

1ljq8r4,Unit tests != data quality checks. CMV.,EarthGoddessDude,dataengineering,"Unit tests data quality checks, for you SQL nerds :PIn post after post, I see people conflating unit/integration/e2e testing with data quality checks. I acknowledge that the concepts have some overlap, the idea of correctness, but to me they are distinct in practice. Unit testing is about making sure that some dependency change or code refactor doesn’t result in bad code that gives wrong results. Integration and e2e testing are about the whole integrated pipeline performing as expected. All of those could, in theory, be written as pytest tests (maybe). It’s a “build time” construct, ie *before* your code is released. Data quality checks are about checking the integrity of production data as it’s already flowing, each time it flows. It’s a “runtime” construct, ie *after* your code is released. I’m open to changing my mind on this, but I need to be persuaded.",186,0.94,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ljq8r4/unit_tests_data_quality_checks_cmv/,2025-06-24 23:20:59,2025-06-28 01:41:19

1lioeql,Why data engineers don’t test: according to Reddit,PotokDes,dataengineering,"Recently, I made a post asking: Why don’t data engineers test like software engineers do? The post sparked a lively discussion and became quite popular, trending for two days on r/dataengineering.Many insightful points were raised in the comments. Here, I’d like to summarize the main arguments and share my perspective.The most upvoted comment highlighted the distinction between data testing and logic testing. While this is an valid observation, it was somewhat tangential to the main question, so I’ll address it separately.Most of the other comments centered around three main reasons:1. Testing is costly and time-consuming.2. Many analytical engineers lack a formal computer science background.3. Testing is often not implemented because projects are volatile and engineers have little control over source systems.And here is my take on these:1. Testing requires time and is costly**Reddit:** The decision to invest in testing often depends on the company and the role data plays within its structure. If data pipelines are not central to the company’s main product, many engineers do not see the value in spending additional resources to ensure these pipelines work as expected.**My perspective**: Tests are a tool. If you consider your project simple enough and do not plan to scale it, then perhaps you do not need them.**Reddit:**: It can be more advantageous for engineers to deliver incomplete solutions, as they are often the only ones who can fix the resulting technical debt and are paid more for doing so.**My perspective**: Tight deadlines and fixed requirements mean that testing is usually the first thing to be cut. This allows engineers to deliver a solution and close a ticket, and if a bug is found later, extra time and effort are allocated from a different budget. While this approach is accepted by many managers, it is not ideal, as the overall time wasted on fixing issues often exceeds the time it would have taken to test the solution upfront.**Reddit:**: Stakeholders are rarely willing to pay for testing.**My perspective**: Testing is a tool for engineers, not stakeholders. Stakeholders pay for a working product, and it should be the producer's responsibility to ensure that the product meets the requirements. If I personally were about to buy a product from a store and someone told me to pay extra for testing, I would also refuse. If you are certain about your product do not test it, but do not ask non-technical people how to do your job.2. Many analytical engineers lack a formal computer science background. **Reddit:**: Especially in analytical and scientific engineering, many people are not formally trained as software engineers. They are often self-taught programmers who write scripts to solve their immediate problems but may be unaware of software engineering practices that could make their projects more maintainable.**My perspective**: This is a common and ongoing challenge. Computers are tools used by almost everyone, but not everyone who uses a computer is a programmer. Many successful projects begin with someone trying to solve a problem in their own field, and in analytics, domain knowledge is often more important than programming expertise when building initial pipelines. In companies just starting their data initiatives, pipelines are typically built by analysts. As long as these pipelines meet expectations, this approach is acceptable. However, as complexity grows, changes become more costly, and tracking down the source of problems can become a nightmare.3. No control of source data **Reddit:**: Data engineers often have no control over the source data, which can lead to issues when the schema changes or when unexpected data is encountered. This makes it difficult to implement testing.**My perspective**: This one of the assumptions of data engineering systems. Depending on the type of the data engineering system, data engineers very rarely will have a say in there. Only where we are creating the analytical system for the operational data, we might have a conversation with the operational system maintainers.In other cases when we are scraping the data from the web or calling external APIs, it is not possible. So what are the ways that we could do to help in such situations?When the problem is related to the evolution of schema (case when data fields are added or removed, data type changes): First we might use schema-on-read strategy, where we store the raw data as they are ingested, for example in JSON format in the staging models, we extract only the fields that are relevant to us. In this case, we do not care if new fields are added. When columns that were using are removed or changed the the pipeline will break, but if we have tests they will tell us what is the exact reason why. We have a place to start investigation and decide how to fix itIf the problem is unexpected data the issues are similar. It’s impossible to anticipate every possible variation in source data, and equally impossible to write pipelines that handle every scenario. The logic in our pipelines is typically designed for the data identified during initial analysis. If the data changes, we cannot guarantee that the analytics code will handle it correctly. Even simple data tests can alert us to these situations, indicating, for example: “We were not expecting data like this—please check if we can handle it.” This once again saves time on root cause analysis by pinpointing exactly where the problem is and where to start investigating a solution.",126,0.9,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lioeql/why_data_engineers_dont_test_according_to_reddit/,2025-06-23 18:30:25,2025-06-28 01:41:19

1lkkjdf,"What's the thing with ""lakehouses"" and open table formats?",mr_tellok,dataengineering,"I'm trying to wrap my head around these concepts, but it has been a bit difficult since I don't understand *how* they solve the problems they're supposed to solve. What I could grasp is that they add an additional layer that allows engineers to work with unstructured or semi-structured data in the (more or less) same way they work with common structured data by making use of metadata.My questions are:1. One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?2. How *straightforward* it is to use technologies like Iceberg for managing non-tabular binary files like pictures, videos, PDFs etc? Is it even possible? If yes, is this a common use case?3.

1lhepme,I built a DuckDB extension that caches Snowflake queries for Instant SQL,dsiegs1,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering.So about 2 months ago when DuckDB announced their instant SQL feature. It looked super slick, and I immediately thought there's no reason on earth to use this with snowflake because of egress (and abunch of other reasons) but it's cool.So I decided to build it anyways: Introducing Snowduckshttps://preview.redd.it/s50m6as7ge8f1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd6492295dae218aa8ff2d27b517f2992c389903Also - if my goal was to just use instant SQL - it would've been much more simple. But I wanted to use Ducklake. For Reasons. What I built was a caching mechanism using the ADBC driver which checks the query hash to see if the data is local (and fresh), if so return it. If not pull fresh from Snowflake, with automatic limit of records so you're not blowing up your local machine. It then can be used in conjunction with the instant SQL features.I started with Python because I didn't do any research, and of course my dumb ass then had to rebuild it in C++ because DuckDB extensions are more complicated to use than a UDF (but hey at least I have a separate cli that does this now right???). Learned a lot about ADBC drivers, DuckDB extensions, and why you should probably read documentation first before just going off and building something.Anyways, I'll be the first to admit I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I also don't even know if I plan to do more....or if it works on anyone else's machine besides mine, but it works on mine and that's cool.Anyways feel free to check it out - [Github](https://github.com/danjsiegel/snowducks)",60,0.95,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lhepme/i_built_a_duckdb_extension_that_caches_snowflake/,2025-06-22 03:51:41,2025-06-28 01:41:19

1lk39fh,Im exhausted and questioning everything,neosisrube,dataengineering,"I moved from a startup into a corporate job ( digital banking ) a few months ago. I’m from Malaysia , for context. I’m still under probation. And honestly, I don’t know anymore if I’m underperforming, or if I’m just stuck in a dysfunctional culture that burns people out.In my previous role, I worked as a backend engineer. I had autonomy. Things moved fast. Feedback was immediate. Now, I’m in an environment where expectations are vague, processes are messy, and communication is passive-aggressive.One example: we have a support schedule to help vendors load data into internal systems. They can’t do it directly, so someone from our side has to run everything manually. It’s basic, repetitive work , I once suggested scripting it to make the process cleaner. That suggestion was ignored. So we keep doing it the hard way.Recently I got pinged after working hours to join a “5-minute call to load something” , something that would run for 10 hours. There was no advance notice, just the assumption I’d be available. I was already off shift, but even then, the next day came with a passive-aggressive remark: “Didn’t expect this from you.” This wasn’t the first time either.Then there’s the feedback I’ve been given. My boss told me twice , that I lack “initiative.” The most recent example was over documentation. I was asked to update some system design docs. I did. I even left a comment inside tagging him, asking for input , which should’ve triggered an email notification. But I didn’t follow up in Teams because I got pulled into other work. I was literally about to update him the next morning when he messaged me and immediately launched into a rant about me needing to be more proactive and take ownership. Even though the work had been done. However, sometime he would dished out praise but rarely. Meanwhile, I’m putting in 10–15 hour days. I’m exhausted. I forget things. I don’t have any more bandwidth. I’m not even doing meaningful engineering work , just reacting to whatever lands in my inbox or chat window. No ownership, no growth. Just people assuming I’ll pick up anything and everything.This is starting to affect my personal life. I carry the resentment home. I’m always tired. I’m checked out even when I’m not working. I literally can’t take a shit without being pulled into a meeting.So now I’m asking: is this a sign I’m not fit for this kind of culture? Am I truly missing something basic? Or is this what happens when you take someone from a fast, transparent, builder-type environment and drop them into a place where nobody wants to own problems , they just want someone to quietly clean up the mess?If you’ve been through this, I’d appreciate perspective.",27,0.92,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lk39fh/im_exhausted_and_questioning_everything/,2025-06-25 11:34:10,2025-06-28 01:41:19

1lko7yz,"A practical guide to UDFs: When to stick with SQL vs. using Python, JS, or even WASM for your pipelines.",Asleep-Rise-473,dataengineering,"**Full disclosure:** I'm part of the team at Databend, and we just published a deep-dive article on User-Defined Functions (UDFs). I’m sharing this here because it tackles a question we see all the time: when and how to move beyond standard SQL for complex logic in a data pipeline. I've made sure to summarize the key takeaways in this post to respect the community's rules on self-promotion.We've all been there: your SQL query is becoming a monster of nested `CASE` statements and gnarly regex, and you start wondering if there's a better way. Our goal was to create a practical guide for choosing the right tool for the job.Here’s a quick breakdown of the approaches we cover:* **Lambda (SQL) UDFs:** The simplest approach. The guide's advice is clear: **if you can do it in SQL, do it in SQL**. It's the easiest to maintain and debug. We cover using them for simple data cleaning and standardizing business rules.* **Python & JavaScript UDFs:** These are the workhorses for most custom logic. The post shows examples for things like: * Using a Python UDF to validate and standardize shipping addresses. * Using a JavaScript UDF to process messy JSON event logs by redacting PII and enriching the data.* **WASM (WebAssembly) UDFs:** This is for when you are truly performance-obsessed. If you're doing heavy computation (think feature engineering, complex financial modeling), you can get near-native speed. We show a full example of writing a function in Rust, compiling it to WASM, and running it inside the database.* **External UDF Servers:** For when you need to integrate your data warehouse with an existing microservice you already trust (like a fraud detection or matchmaking engine). This lets you keep your business logic decoupled but still query it from SQL.The article ends with a ""no-BS"" best practices section and some basic performance benchmarks comparing the different UDF types. The core message is to start simple and only escalate in complexity when the use case demands it.**You can read the full deep-dive here:** [https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend\_UDF/](https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend_UDF/)I'd love to hear how you all handle this.

Local testing with PySpark shows fast performance even when joining tables, so I'm considering using S3 as my main data store instead of a DB.Is this a bad approach that could come back to bite me?

Our client has multiple contracts with us, and I support one of them. I’ve been interested in moving into data engineering for a while and am about halfway through a master’s in computer and information technology.Recently, I asked if I could shadow the DE team on an adjacent contract, and they brought me in for their latest sprint. Shortly after, the program manager on that team asked if I’d be interested in applying for an open DE role. I was thrilled—it felt like the perfect opportunity.I already know the data really well (I worked on their recent migration efforts and use their tables regularly), and I’m familiar with some of the team. It’s a solid internal move with a lot of alignment.The catch? I’d have to take a $27K pay cut—from $137K to $110K.I expected a cut since I don’t have formal DE experience and would be stepping into a mid-level role, but that number feels steep—especially since I live in a high cost of living area and recently bought a house.⸻My question for you all:1. Would you take the job anyway, just to get your foot in the door?2. Has anyone else here made a similar internal switch from analyst to DE? How did it work out long-term?3. Are there ways to negotiate this kind of internal transition to ease the pay gap? (e.g. retention bonus, hybrid role, defined promotion path)4.

Further, I’m also paid well given my experience and get along well with my manager (who started 2 years ago).I have explicitly asked my manager to be moved to work with the new platform (or improve the issues with the current platform) part time, but I’m stuck maintaining legacy while consultants build the new platform. Despite this, I truly believe the company will be great to work at in 2-3 years. Have anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you stick it out, or would you find a new job?

1ljfxww,How can I enforce read-only SQL queries in Spark Connect?,Certain_Leader9946,dataengineering,"I've built a system where Spark Connect runs behind an API gateway to push/pull data from Delta Lake tables on S3. It's been a massive improvement over our previous Databricks setup — we can transact millions of rows in seconds with much more control.What I want now is user authentication and access control:* Specifically, I want certain users to have read-only access.* They should still be able to submit Spark SQL queries, but no write operations (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).When using Databricks, this was trivial to manage via Unity Catalog and OAuth — I could restrict service principals to only have SELECT access. But I'm now outside the Databricks ecosystem using vanilla Spark 4.0 and Spark Connect, which I want to add, has been orders of magnitude more performant and easier to operate, and I’m struggling to find an equivalent.Is there any way to restrict Spark SQL commands to only allow reads per session/user? Or disallow any write operations at the SQL level for specific users or apps (e.g., via Spark configs or custom extensions)?Even if there's a way to disable all write operations globally for a given Spark Connect session or app, I could probably work around that for my use case by leveraging those applications at the API layer!Would appreciate any ideas, even partial ones. Thanks!!!EDIT: No replies yet but for context I'm able to dump 20M rows in 3s from my Fargate Spark Cluster. I then make queries using [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html) via Spark Connect (except in Scala). This lets me receive the results via Arrow and push them lazily into my Websocket response to my users, with a lot less infra code, whereas the Databricks ODBC connection (or JDBC connection, or their own libs) would take 3 minutes to do this, at best. It's just faster, and I think Spark 4 is a huge jump forward.EDIT2: While Spark Connect is a huge jump forward, using Databricks Connect is the way we are thinking about going with this (as it turns out Databricks connect is just a wrapper with Spark connect so we can still use the local instance as local development and have Databricks hoist our Spark cluster on the cloud; still maintaining the benefits; and as it turns out you can connect to Databricks compute nodes with Spark Connect vanilla and be fine).",12,0.94,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ljfxww/how_can_i_enforce_readonly_sql_queries_in_spark/,2025-06-24 16:36:40,2025-06-28 01:41:19

1lh2yt4,I'm making an AWS project about tracking top Spotify songs in a certain playlist and I need advice on designing the pipeline,Lastrevio,dataengineering,"Hi, I just learned the basics of AWS and I'm thinking of getting my hands dirty and building my first project in it.I want to call the Spotify API to fetch, on a daily basis, the results of a certain Spotify playlist (haven't decided which yet, but it will most likely be top 50 songs in Romania). From what I know, these playlists update once per day, so my pipeline can run once per day.The end goal would be to visualize analytics about this kind of data in some BI tool after I connect to the Athena database, but the reason I am doing this is to practice AWS and to put it as a project on my CV.Here is how I thought of my data schema so far:I will have the following tables: f_song, f_song_snapshot, d_artist, d_calendar.f_song will have an ID as a primary key, the name of the song and all the metadata about the song I can get through Spotify's API (artists, genre, mood, album, etc.). The data loading process for this table will be UPSERT (delta insert).d_artist will contain metadata about each artist. I am still not sure how to connect this to f_song through some PK-FK pair since a song can have multiple artists and an artist can have multiple songs so I may need to create a new table to break down this many-to-many mapping (any ideas?). I also intend to include a boolean column in this table called ""has_metadata"" for reasons I will explain below. The data loading process will also be upsert.f_song_snapshot will contain four columns: snapshot_id (primary key), song_id (foreign key to f_song's primary key), timestamp (which represents the date in which that particular song was part of that playlist) and rank (representing the position in the playlist that day from 1 to 50). The data loading process for this table will be ONLY INSERT (pure append).d_calendar will be a date look-up table that has multiple DATE values and the corresponding day, month, year, month in text, etc. for each date (and it will be connected to f_song_snapshot). I will only load this table once, probably.Now, how to create this pipeline in AWS? Here are my ideas so far:1). Lambda function (scheduled to run daily) that calls Spotify's API to get the top 50 songs in that day and all the metadata about them and then dumping this as a JSON file in an S3 bucket.2). AWS Glue job that is triggered by the appearance of a JSON file in that bucket (i.e.: by the finishing of the previous step) that takes the data from that JSON file and pushes it into f_song and f_song_snapshot. f_song will only be appended if a respective song is not already in it, while f_song_snapshot will *always* be appended. This Glue job will also update d_artist but not all the columns, only the artist_id and artist_name, and only in the cases in which that artist does not already exist, and in the case in which a new artist is inserted, has_metadata will be equal to 0 (false) and all other columns (with the exception of id, name and has_metadata) will be NULL.3). Lambda function, triggered, by the finishing of the previous step, that makes API calls to Spotify to get the metadata of all the artists in d_artist for whom has_metadata = 0. This information will get dumped as a JSON in another S3 bucket.4). AWS Glue job that gets triggered by the addition of another file in that artist S3 bucket (by the finishing of the previous step) that updates the rows in d_artist for which has_metadata = 0 with the new information found in the new JSON file (and then sets has_metadata = 1 after it is finished).How does this sound? Is there a simpler way to do it or am I on the right track? It's my first time designing a pipeline so complex. Also, how can I connect the M:M relationship between the f_song and d_artist tables?",10,0.92,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lh2yt4/im_making_an_aws_project_about_tracking_top/,2025-06-21 18:12:06,2025-06-28 01:41:19

1ljlzxt,Chuck Data - Agentic Data Engineering CLI for Databricks (Feedback requested),caleb-amperity,dataengineering,"Hi all,My name is Caleb, I am the GM for a team at a company called Amperity that just launched an open source CLI tool called [Chuck Data](https://chuckdata.ai). The tool runs exclusively on Databricks for the moment. We launched it last week as a **free** new offering in research preview to get a sense of whether this kind of interface is compelling to data engineering teams. This post is mainly conversational and looking for reactions/feedback. We don't even have a monetization strategy for this offering. Chuck is free and open source, but just for full disclosure what we're getting out of this is signal to drive our engineering prioritization for our other products.# General PitchThe general idea is similar to Claude Code except where Claude Code is designed for general software development, Chuck Data is designed for data engineering work in Databricks. You can use natural language to describe your use case and Chuck can help plan and then configure jobs, notebooks, data models, etc. in Databricks. So imagine you want to set up identity resolution on a bunch of tables with customer data. Normally you would analyze the data schemas, spec out an algorithm, implement it by either configuring an ETL tool or writing some scripts, etc. With Chuck you would just prompt it with ""I want to stitch these 5 tables together"" and Chuck can analyze the data, propose a plan and provide a ML ID res algorithm and then when you're happy with its plan it will set it up and run it in your Databricks account.Strategy-wise, Amperity has been selling a SAAS CDP platform for a decade and configuring it with services. So we have a ton of expertise setting up ""Customer 360"" models for enterprise companies at scale with any different kind of data. We're seeing an opportunity with the proliferation of LLMs and the agentic concepts where we think it's viable to give data engineers an alternative to ETLs and save tons of time with better tools. Chuck is our attempt to make a tool trying to realize that vision and get it into the hands of the users ASAP to get a sense for what works, what doesn't, and ultimately whether this kind of natural language tooling is appealing to data engineers.My goal with this post is to drive some awareness and get anyone who uses Databricks regularly to try it out so we can learn together. # How to Try Chuck OutChuck is a Python based CLI so it should work on any system. You can install it on MacOS via Homebrew with: brew tap amperity/chuck-data brew install chuck-dataVia Python you can install it with pip with: pip install chuck-dataHere are links for more information:* Git repo: [https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data](https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data)* Website: [https://chuckdata.ai](https://chuckdata.ai)* Launch video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA) * Discord: [https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe](https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe)If you would prefer to try it out on fake data first, we have a wide variety of fake data sets in the Databricks marketplace. You'll want to copy it into your own Catalog since you can't write into Delta Shares. [https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity](https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity)I would recommend [the datasets in the ""bronze"" schema for this one specifically](https://marketplace.databricks.com/details/6bc4843f-3809-4995-8461-9756f6164ddf/Amperity_Amperitys-Identity-Resolution-Agent-30-Day-Trial).

1ljgjmd,Confused about the direction and future of my career as a data engineer,thro0away12,dataengineering,"I'm somebody who worked as a data analyst, data scientist and now data engineer. I guess my role is more of an analytics engineering role, but the more I've worked in my role, it seems the future direction is to make my role completely non-technical, which is the opposite of what I was hoping for when I got hired. In my past jobs, I thrived when I was developing technical solutions in my work. I wanted to be a SWE but leap from analytics to SWE was difficult without more engineering experience, which is how I landed my role. When I was hired for my role, my understanding was that my job would be that I have at least 70% of the requirements fleshed out and will be building the solution either via Python, SQL or whatever tool. Instead, here's what's happening:* I get looped into a project with zero context and zero documentation as to what the project is* I quite frankly have no idea or any direction with what I'm supposed to do and what the end result is supposed to be used for or what it should look like* My way of building things is to use past 'similar projects', navigate endless PDF documents, emails, tickets to figure out what I should be doing* I code out a half-baked solution using these resources* I get feedback that the old similar project solution doesn't work, that I had to go into a very specific subfolder and refer to a documentation there to figure out something * My half-baked idea either has to revert back to completely starting from scratch or progressively starts to bake but is never fully baked * Now multiply this by 4, plus meetings and other tasks, so no time for even me to write documentation. * Lots of time, energy gets wasted in this. My 8 hour days have started becoming 12. I'm sleeping as late as 2-3 AM sometimes. I'm noticing my brain slowing down and a lack of interest in my work. but I'm still working as best as I can. I have zero time to upskill. I want to take a certification exam this year, but I'm frequently too burnt out to study. I also don't know if my team will really support me in wanting to get certs or work towards new technical skills. * On top of all of this, I have one colleague who constantly has a gripe about my work - that it's not being done faster. When I ask for clarification, he doesn't properly provide it. He constantly makes me feel uncomfortable to speak b/c he will say 'I'm frustrated', 'I wanted this to be done faster', 'this is concerning'. Instead of constructive feedback, he vents about me to my boss and their boss. I feel like the team I work on is very much a firm believer that AI will eventually phase out traditional SWE and DE jobs as we know today and the focus should be on the aspects AI can't replace, such as us coming up with ways to translate stakeholder needs into something useful. In theory, I understand the rationale, in practice....I just feel translation aspect will always be midly frustrating with all the uncertainties and constant changes around what people want. I don't know about the future though, whether or not trying to upskill, learn a new language or get a cert is worth my time or energy if there won't be money or jobs here. I can say thugh those aspects of DE are what I enjoy the most and why I wanted to become a data engineer. In an ideal world, my job would be a compromise between what I like and what will help me have a job/make money. I'm not sure what to do. Should I just stay in my role and evolve as an eventual business analyst or product manager or work towards something else? I'm even open to considering something outside of DE like MLE, SWE or maybe product management if it has some technical aspects to it.",9,0.81,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ljgjmd/confused_about_the_direction_and_future_of_my/,2025-06-24 16:59:59,2025-06-28 01:41:19

I began my career in 2017 as a junior data engineer and worked in India for 5 years. During that time, I gained solid experience with technologies such as Spark, Airflow, AWS, CI/CD, Kafka, Elasticsearch, SQL, Python, Scala, and a bit of GCP. These form the core of my technical background.After working with two companies in India, I moved to the UK in mid-2022 to pursue a Master’s degree in Data Science. It was a one-year program, and I graduated in 2023 with distinction. Right after graduation, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Assistant in the UK until February 2025. Around that time, I moved to Ireland on a joint visa, and I'm currently settled here.Since March 2025, I've been actively looking for opportunities in data engineering or software development. I’ve been fortunate to receive interviews from some great companies. I’ll admit, I wasn’t fully prepared for the first two or three, but since then, I’ve put in a lot of focused effort. I'm now quite confident in SQL, Python, and problem-solving.However, it’s now June, and I still haven’t landed a role. I’ve reached the final rounds in 3 or 4 interviews, but unfortunately, the outcomes have been negative. This has been difficult emotionally, and I'm growing concerned about the employment gap it’s creating in my career.I can feel the competition is intense, especially in the data engineering field. Some people are even surprised that I haven’t secured a role yet, given my 5+ years of experience and a master’s degree. I understand their perspective, but I’m truly doing everything I can.If anyone has any advice, guidance, or even just words of encouragement, I would deeply appreciate it.

So if element1 is approve than that’s something, and I have somewhere else to store all approved subelement for this.Might be complicate to understand in simple words, but tldr how do you store static things that are required for your pipeline ? I want something else than juste a table in Postgres because I want non tech people to be able to add elementsWe currently use Salesforce for some stuff, but are going away from it so I try to find a simple solution which can work for DE and not necessary the company as a hole.

In my job, I think I have reached the boundary between data engineering and data science, and I'm out of my depth right now.I work for a government contractor. I am the only data scientist on the team and was recently hired. It's government work, so it's inherently a little slow and we don't necessarily have the newest tools. Since they have not hired a data scientist before, I currently have more infrastructure-related tasks. I also don't have a ton of people that I can get help from - I might need to reach out to somebody on a totally different contract if I wanted some insight/mentorship on this, which wouldn't be impossible, but I figured that posting here might get me more breadth.Vaguely, there is an abundance of data that is (mostly) stored on Oracle databases. One smaller subset of it is stored on an ElasticSearch cluster. It's an enormous amount that goes back 15 years. It has been slow for me to get access to the Oracle database and ElasticSearch cluster, just because they've never had to give someone access before that wasn't already a database admin.I am very fortunate that the data (1) exists and (2) exists in a way that would actually be useful for building a model, which is what I have primarily been hired to do. Now that I have access to these databases, I've been trying to find the best way to work with the data. I've been trying to move toward storing it in parquet files, but today, I was thinking, ""this feels really weird that all these parquet files would just exist locally for me."" Some Googling later, I encountered this concept of a ""data lake.""I'm posting here largely because I'm hopeful to understand how this process works in industry - I definitely didn't learn this in school! I've been having this nagging feeling that ""something is missing"" - like there should be something in between the database and any analysis/EDA that I'm doing in Python. This is because queries are slow, it doesn't feel scalable for me to locally store a bunch of parquet files, and there is just no single, versioned source of ""truth.""Is a data lake (or lakehouse?) what is typically used in this situation?",6,0.72,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lkkcey/data_scientist_looking_for_help_at_work_do_i_need/,2025-06-25 23:01:51,2025-06-28 01:41:19

1lka20n,Data Engineering for Gen AI?,on_the_mark_data,dataengineering,"I'm not talking about Gen AI doing data engineering work... specifically what does data engineering look like for supporting Gen AI services/products?Below are a few thoughts from what i've seen in the market and my own building; but I would love to hear what others are seeing!1. A key differentiator for quality LLM output is providing it great context, thus the role of information organization, data mining, and information retrieval is becoming more important. With that said, I don't see traditional data modeling fully fitting this paradigm given that the relationship are much more flexible with LLMs. Something I'm thinking about is what are identifiers around ""text themes"" an modeling around that (I could 100% be over complicating this though).2. I think security and governance controls are going to become more important in data engineering. Before LLMs, it was pretty hard to expose sensitive data without gross negligence. Today with consumer focused AI, people are sending PII to these AI tools that are then sending it to their external APIs (especially among non-technical users). I think people will come to their senses soon, but the barriers of protection via processes and training have been eroded substantially with the easy adoption of AI.3. Data integrations with third parties is going to become trivial. For example, say you don't have budget for Fivetran and have to build your own connection from Salesforce to your data warehouse. The process of going through API docs, building a pipeline, parsing nested JSON, dealing with edge cases, etc takes a long time. I see a move towards offloading this work to AI ""agents"" (loaded term now I know), but essentially I'm seeing traction with MCP server. So data eng work is less around building data models for other humans, but instead for external AI agents to work with.Is this matching what you are seeing?edit: typos",3,0.72,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lka20n/data_engineering_for_gen_ai/,2025-06-25 16:19:29,2025-06-28 01:41:19

I've been making almost exclusively C and C++ programs and libraries for a few years now, and never really touched anything else. However, I've recently started trying to make stuff for Android and for the web, and **dear lord it's soo much more complicated**.The main problem i have, specially when making Android apps, is that a minimal ""hello world"" example is very complex. I got used to starting with literally 1 file (main.c / cpp), 1 command (the compiler doing its thing), and 1 resulting file (the binary).With Android, a minimal working example has dozens of files, a dozen processes running in the background, a dozen dependencies being downloaded while building, and even if you do everything right, sometimes a bug in one of those hundreds of failure points just breaks everything.A similar situation happens with webdev, though an **actual** minimal project only requires HTML, with most of the complexity existing on the server setup.I know this sounds like a rant, so here's the actual question: Is there a good reason for this, or is it just a case of an environment evolving badly over time?",275,0.92,131,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lgkpxz/why_are_most_forms_of_programming_so_complex/,2025-06-21 01:31:20,2025-06-28 01:41:20

Dafuq?,Visible-Bonus-5892,learnprogramming,"First off, thanks to anybody who has some advice or insight for me.After being in my early thirties and a career in the military cut short due to injuries/health reasons, I had the chance to start a new career, with school, an official certificate (which is a big deal where I am from) and all that.6 Months into learning coding my program requires me to do a two year internship alongside the school. Cool, get some actual experience and don't just learn theory and how to write a console app. After some months of applying (keep in mind, during the two years the employer has no costs, since I don't get a salary from them and they don't have to pay taxes for me) I found a small, but established company that decided to take me. The CEO was very upfront about everything, there is nobody here that knows anything about coding, I would be the only one that maintains the main product of the company and he understands that I have to learn a lot before I become an expert. After a few days of thinking about it and talking to teachers and an acquaintance of mine I thought that this is a great opportunity to learn and become competent in a wide variety.It's my third month now and I still don't know what I am doing. We just started coding TicTacToe in School and at work I am currently (stuck at) rewriting a standalone part of the project with roughly 5k Lines, integration into multiple third-party services and a device developed by us. To my shame I have to admit I have vibecoded a large chunk of it. Now I am stuck on two projects, where the solutions seems like it would be solved by someone with actual experience within two hours.Did I fuck up, or is there some place I can get somebody that is somewhat knowledgeable in our tech stack to sit down with me for a day and explain some basic concepts?Thanks if anybody has some advice, and also thanks if you tell me that I'm an idiot that plunged himself too deep into the waters.Edit: Techstack is React, C#, hosted on Azure.

1lkz80b,5 Rules to follow for using AI,neverbeendead,learnprogramming,"I see a lot of posts, particularly from people trying to learn about the dangers of AI. I think it's very easy to misuse it but there are a few simple things we can all do to keep ourselves growing. The issue with AI is that it's answers are too easy so they don't ""stick"" in your mind.1) Never copy and paste code. This applies to tutorials as well. The act of typing will help you remember. Pair this with consciously thinking about everything you type and scrolling through IDE intellisense suggestions.2) Always ask for an explanation. Even for simple things, just reading the explanation can help your brain.3) Get familiar with documentation. AI can spit out an answer, but it isn't necessarily giving you the best answer. Looking at docs (if they are good) will show you different ways of using certain features or components. Alternatively, ask AI for different options and explanations of what works best in what situations.4) Ask about design patterns and Strategies rather than specific code snippets. This has helped me a ton. It's easy to find an article about why x is better than y, but the reality is most of the time each strategy fits a different requirement better and sometimes it's about how you want to build your system. 5) if you don't need AI, don't use it. Even if it takes you a little longer to do something, forcing your brain to recall something will signal to your brain that that information is important and we should keep it. If you overly rely on AI, your brain will stop retaining the information. The same thing happens in a relationship. If your partner is responsible for feeding the pets, it's hard for you to remember. That is shared memory and it happens with AI.",25,0.79,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lkz80b/5_rules_to_follow_for_using_ai/,2025-06-26 12:45:31,2025-06-28 01:41:20

My lecturers were software engineers at top companies and gave so much valuable advice and insight into what it’s actually like working as a software engineer. But whilst learning, they said it’s not important for us to know and fully understand everything, it’s just about us knowing that these things exist and so when we would get the job, we aren’t unfamiliar with certain tech vocab and we can just search it up in the job. So right now I’m about to start React with TOP. But in the back of my mind I know that when it came to the async topics for eg, I didn’t fully understand it and it’s just in the back of my mind. I’d typically just make sure I’m somewhat familiar with it and then just move on. I’ve read the docs but don’t fully get it. I don’t know if me wanting to fully 100% get it is my perfectionist side and therefore perhaps slightly pointless when considering the advice my lecturers gave, or if me having a decent grasp on it is a enough and now I can just move on.

The original plan was: Master's degree in the energy sector, then a trainee position at a large energy company (entry is up to €70,000 in Germany/Europe, which is not little money here), long-term corporate career.But now I'm busy with a thought that won't let me go and came up more often in recent years.I saw a video in which someone without previous experience taught themselves programming in 4 months of intensive work and then got a job as a developer. He went through 6 days a week, looked for a mentor, even offered employers unpaid work - but then, thanks to his skills, he was hired at a normal starting point.I am now seriously considering pausing my original plan and instead investing 10–11 months full-time and structured programming – with a clear focus on the career entry in the tech sector.I am extremely motivated, not afraid of hard work, learn quickly (IQ tested at 131) and would take the time really seriously.The development of AI and the situation on the job market has also reached me, but often it is also said that only low-level coding is automated, but good developers who have an idea of system design, software architecture, error analysis etc. will always be in demand.Now my questions• Is this a realistic plan from your point of view for someone with a lot of drive but no prior coding knowledge?• Which entry-level areas in the tech sector would you prioritize in my situation?• And what about age (27 at the start of a career) in practice - disadvantage or no matter?• Would you personally go the safe way (Master + Corporate Job) or the ""risk path"" (1 year all-in towards tech)?I am looking forward to honest opinions - especially from people who have changed themselves or are looking after newcomers.

Instead of Master + Group career (60k+ entry) I am considering learning programming full-time for 10–11 months to start as a developer.Don't have a tech background, but high motivation, learning ability (IQ 131) and time.Questions: Is that realistic?

They said they were noticing when a user updated a rating on one page and then navigated to another page, the rating wasn't updated. They thought it was some caching issue (not really understanding how our current caching works since rating data wasn't even be cached on the client) and decided to input the entire section into Claude and ask to fix it and then copy and paste. Claude spitted out a new section that fetched the data in an extremely inefficient way causing the slow load times.I look into the code for about 10-15 minutes. I realized the error didn't have to do with the database or caching at all, but simply because co-founder (or Claude I guess) added different rendering logic on the UI for showing the ratings in one section compared to an other section (so the ratings were being properly updated under the hood but appeared to not be consistent because of UI inconsistencies). After I push the fix, I'm just thinking, yes this was relatively small, but I just lost over 10 minutes fixing something that wouldn't have been an issue with basic software engineering principles (re-using existing code / simple refactoring). Imagine if we were still just pushing to prod.There's another story I could tell here, but this post is already getting long (tldr is co-founder tried to vibe code a small change and then f'd up one of our features just before launch which I luckily noticed on the deployment preview).So, when people say ""AI is going to replace software engineers"", I have to laugh. Even on something that people (wrongly) think is simple like frontend, the models are often crapping out across the board when you look at [benchmarks](https://www.designarena.ai/). I also remembering watching videos and reading articles on products like Devin AI failing over 50% of real-world SWE tasks. Don't be fooled by the AI hype. Yes, it will increase productively and change the role and responsibilities of a SWE, but a non-technical PM or manager isn't just going to be able to create something on a corporate scale.",440,0.96,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1linwzs/my_startup_cofounders_vibe_coding_almost_broke/,2025-06-23 18:11:33,2025-06-28 01:41:21
1lhayzr,Ghosted After Being Requested to do a 36 hour Take Home Assessment [ThirdLayer],Ecstatic-Concern1443,cscareerquestions,"I wanted to share a frustrating experience I had with a company’s hiring process.A few weeks ago, I received an email from **ThirdLayer** saying they found my application interesting and invited me to complete a take-home challenge. Without much context or follow-up, the email stated:**“Please complete no later than 3 days from the time of this email.”**It didn’t matter when I saw the message or what I had going on--they expected urgency and precision on my end. It was already late in the recruiting season, but since they were a YC startup, I decided to give it a shot. I put in \~30 hours of focused work. They asked for a full-stack AI copilot that integrates with Google Drive, retrieves relevant snippets, and could be tested by their team, which is an insane task to do in 3 days imo. I still attempted to build it, recorded a video walkthrough, sent them a GitHub invite as requested, and submitted it all on time.No response. Not after 3 days. Not after 7. They didn’t even accept the GitHub invite.  It’s disappointing--especially when they pushed for urgency and responsiveness, but couldn’t extend even basic courtesy in return. I feel like I wasted so much time. I wouldn’t be nearly as frustrated if they had just ignored my application from the start. What stings is that they did respond, assigned an extremely demanding task, and then completely disappeared. Even a simple rejection email would've been good.Behind every resume is a real person with real commitments. I was proud of what I built, and getting ghosted like this felt incredibly disrespectful. Venting to the people around me helped but they also couldn't believe that the company would simply choose not to respond.

1lgyd32,"The more and more I vibe code, the more confused I get over claims that vibe coding will completely close the gap between non-technical and technical people and replace software engineers",Accomplished-Copy332,cscareerquestions,"Now to start, I will say AI is a fantastic tool. It makes development cycles much much faster. Things that I thought would originally take weeks now take days. That said, the more and more I am using AI for coding, my initial awe at the technology continues to wear off, and now claims that coding will be dead or SWE will go extinct seem far-fetched or overly optimistic at best.After working on some stuff for the past few months, for the initial MVP or demo or prototype, I was always able to spin up something decent with AI. However, when I would create stuff even on the scale of just a few hundred or few thousands of users, I would notice that things would start to break down, and AI actually missed a lot of things during development such as: 1. Performance Optimization: AI won't immediately implement stuff like caching systems, pagination, and database design optimization or indexing without explicitly being told. Let's take caching for example. I wanted to cache results on a page to speed up load times and reduce unnecessary queries to the database. I gave the AI a file for a page to implement caching for and it did it, but then I realized that there was a design flaw that didn't lead to the best UX (when user is performing mutation actions, it seems like the page wasn't being updated until the cache expired so I should clear or update the cache on those actions). Now this may seem like something trivial to a developer, but I doubt a non-technical person using AI would be able to catch these details, know what files to edit, and spin up something fully optimized. Tldr here is that if I just pretty much let AI create my whole app for me, I would end up with something incredibly non-optimized, slow, and would have poor user experience for a larger audience. 2. UI/UX: A lot of people think that frontend will be the first to go. Yes, AI can currently basically zero/one-shot landing pages and basic crud apps. But when these apps need to scale to at least hundreds of thousands of people, and stuff like device responsiveness and accessibility or other UI/UX features becomes important, AI is not giving you solutions out-of-the-box unless it's guided. I came across this [UI/UX benchmark](https://www.designarena.ai) to compare different models, and models today do struggle at really creating production/professional sites, though vibe coding might suffice for a marketing site or hobby app. Those are a few things I noticed, but there are even more things that I mentioned such as infrastructure and systems design, security, etc. that AI isn't getting right yet on its own, and I would be surprised if a person with little-to-no programming experience could ensure are implemented correctly. Now of course, what exactly software engineers do will change (and it already has), but I still think SWEs will still need to serve as an ""architect"" for the AI while the AI takes the role of the ""construction worker"" or ""builder"". We have seen what happens when we allow bad architects to design buildings and infrastructure (people lose their lives). The same should probably apply to who we have use AI to design crucial systems.",256,0.93,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lgyd32/the_more_and_more_i_vibe_code_the_more_confused_i/,2025-06-21 14:51:50,2025-06-28 01:41:21

The visas became so popular that demand quickly outstripped supply, forcing the government to hold annual lotteries to determine who could apply for the limited number of H-1Bs allotted each year.Visa middlemen soon found ways to manipulate the lottery, giving them an advantage over sponsors seeking a specific worker for a specialized role. H-1B rules require applicants to have a “bona fide” job offer for each visa they seek. Yet staffing firms used webs of connected companies to submit multiple lottery registrations for the same applicants. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services called this practice, known as “multiple registration,” fraudulent in a 2023 report and took steps to end it last year. A second strategy – flooding the lottery with thousands of interchangeable applicants – provides a major advantage for large outsourcing firms that tend to have vast overseas workforces.""""The middlemen who win the lottery then farm out the visa-holders on contract to their business clients and take a portion of each worker’s pay.

1lluus4,Anyone else seeing a mass exodus in their company?,Taitrnator,cscareerquestions,"I work at a fairly established but small company that had about 200 people when I started. Now it’s down to about 120. No layoffs but there’s been some people singled out and fired, and a ton of churn. I suspect a lot of problems here are happening in the industry as a whole. For product and eng it’s 100% driven by low engagement and burnout. I only started here in August but it’s been a straight trend of just doing everything wrong. New product leader came in around when I did. Slowly ripped away any authority that ICs/managers have to define their scope or what to prioritize. It’s extremely top-down, do whatever the cofounders want now, and that was fairly insulated when I started. They’ve pushed out any and all leadership that were a source of any friction at the top, and I think they saw this new leader they hired was gonna validate anything they say. Now it’s only yes-people in the room. Teams and reorgs constantly happen at whims of leadership without really consulting anyone. This then impacts roadmap items but the expectations don’t change. Roadmap itself is never even really committed too, cause they change priorities there all the time, you never know when or why the thing you were working on for three weeks will get deprioritized. You also don’t know when something you thought you’d do a month later you’re now expected to present a prototype of at the end of the week. A lot of expected overtime work, not a lot of pay or advancement opportunity. Definitely a lack of clarity or support on directions given. I’ve seen people ask valid questions get put on PIPs basically. As a designer I can definitely say this is not a place I expect to do great work or anything I can really showcase. The top down mandate is quite simply, AI-wash the product. I worked on a project with that mandate, just impossible constraints and no scope clarity. So I had to challenge that team to really turn this into something that customers would value and pay for and set a small target. With the full support and backing of my manager we really pushed to make sure it’s at least providing real value to the user, compromised as quickly as possible when necessary to unblock Eng (we were all building the plane while flying it). We really inserted ourselves so that we don’t make terrible UX decisions even and especially when that made things a little harder. Worked really hard on it, set a bar for quality. Executives swooped in last two weeks before launch and started asking for tons of changes, same timeline. So, lost time QAing there that really would have made a difference. Delayed the launch. They freaked out and blamed everyone they were pushing to work 80 hour weeks for a month to get this done. An eng quit on the spot which I applaud. Sure enough it launched and immediately sold enough to make the company profitable for its first quarter in like two years. Did we get any additional respect or acknowledgement, maybe some trust and respect for our process? lol. Well, that product leader got all the credit somehow despite having very little involvement. They got a promotion, and my manager, the one really backing me up challenging them and the team, got demoted, so no design voice in the leadership room now. This is the same product leader who’s entire staff either quit or been let go since they joined, and a replacement hired for most of them. Despised by everyone in product, design, and eng now. Yet, great at rubbing shoulders with management and pleasing them. Way too small of a company for politics like that to really work, but sure enough they convinced founders that they’re the goat. They have multiple engagement surveys where we’ve basically flatlined to zero on product side since that leader started. Feedback has been given calling out leadership as the source. None of the driving behavior changed or was addressed by them, it only got worse. Then Eng started to feel the impact of this over the last 6 months. A lot of them started quitting, the best ones that had been there longest and had most domain knowledge. most recent engagement shows a big dip for them now too. Def cannot replace them faster than they quit right now and it’s an existential risk. It’s looking like the ship is gonna sink itself here. I’m also just wondering if there’s greener grass or is this just how the industry is gonna be for a while? Business idiots running everything into the ground with zero accountability, and ICs treated like disposable resources who can be replaced by AI if they go. It’s frustrating cause if they actually empowered us a bit more, we have the talent and means of making a great product that actually sells, but it’s like their own egos take priority and they can’t conceive of anyone knowing the business opportunities worth investing in other than themselves. Down to the micromanaged details, like they don’t trust or value the expertise they hired.",105,0.93,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lluus4/anyone_else_seeing_a_mass_exodus_in_their_company/,2025-06-27 14:09:40,2025-06-28 01:41:21

1lkrs4i,"Should I, a ForeverJunior:trade_mark:, lie about my previous titles?",Flat-Butterfly8907,cscareerquestions,"I am a ~~Senior~~ Backend Engineer who has never made it past Junior. I got fucked over by two jobs in a row over the past 4 years which held me back. Its a long story so I'll try to keep it somewhat short (because oh boy there is so much more I could talk about).The first one was one I held for 3 years. The company was tumultuous and there was high turn over, and a year into the job, half of the engineers were gone and replaced, and by year 3, I was the longest tenure engineer at the company. When I first started there, we had no titles besides Software Engineer and Senior Software Engineer. 2 years in, they decided they wanted to be more like other companies and decided to implement bands. At this point, I was doing system design, db design, security, re-architecture work, introducing process changes, leading meetings, mentoring, etc. I was pushing to get a promotion, because I was doing way more senior work than other seniors in the company, but I was told that they were making a rubric and had frozen promotions for 6 months.So, 6 months go by and we have this new salary/title band system, and we get a new HR system as well. I don't think too much of it until one day I go to submit some time off, and under my profile name, it says ""Software Engineer I"", the lowest title level. I'm stunned and go look at the org chart and out of 40 engineers, I am the ONLY ONE who is a Software Engineer I. I bring it up to the engineering manager and he tells me to just go through the review process and it should be fixed with the new rubric. So review time comes around and I finally get the rubric that I had been asking for for a month, and the new rubric ends up blocking my promotion.Why? Because whoever made the rubric decided one of the requirements to go from Engineer I to Engineer II is that you have ""Taken responsibility when your changes were responsible for a critical error"". Problem is, after 2.5 years, I never introduced a show-stopping bug. I was the only engineer in the company who never introduced a show-stopping bug. So apparently, I failed that requirement, so they weren't going to give me a promotion. I ended up getting laid off with a bunch of other people 6 months after.Then last year, I started working a job that was supposed to be a Senior Engineer position, but even though I did great on the interviews, because my previous position wasn't as a ""Senior"", they wouldn't give me the senior title. At this point, things were starting to get pretty bad with the job market and I was desperate, so I took it. Ended up getting laid off again with people late last year.Now, with how bad the market has gotten, I am struggling to get any traction. I am one of those devs who truly loves writing software, and I've loved it since I first tried it out in high school just for fun. I'm not the most genius engineer or anything like that, but I truly love it, and its not about the money for me. But these past 4 years have really killed my drive and motivation. Now here I am, barely getting any traction while job-searching for months, and since every job posting out there is for Senior+, I'm getting filtered out of jobs left and right. At this point, should I just ""lie"" (or rather, correct what titles I should have had)?",72,0.81,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lkrs4i/should_i_a_foreverjunior_lie_about_my_previous/,2025-06-26 05:14:15,2025-06-28 01:41:21
1lhs4g7,Should you lie in job application dropdowns?,Enmeeed,cscareerquestions,"I’m not talking about falsifying experience or a degree, which is obviously a no go. What I mean is so many applications have “X experience with Y technology”. Traditionally, it is advised you apply to jobs even if you do not meet requirements as they are often soft requirements even if stated otherwise. However, application pages are well past just a resume and cover letter. Now they want me to fill out fields like “How many years of experience in React do you have” or the same with NoSQL or database. Typically I am inclined to answer honestly. However I feel that these fields are often just auto filters that will punish you hard for lying and you’ll never have a person even glance at your resume.

1lgklmb,I posted 10 months ago and I found a job since then,-NearEDGE,cscareerquestions,"So, 10 months ago I made this post:[How do I get my first job as a self-taught software developer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1evuuo5/how_do_i_get_my_first_job_as_a_selftaught/)At the time, I was beyond frustrated. I had nearly two decades of experience building all kinds of things. From game engines to low-level graphics to machine learning, but no degree, no big-name companies on my resume, and most of my freelance work was under NDA, so I couldn’t even show it off publicly. Since then, I learned to approach things differently: I started using platforms like LinkedIn more actively, did a bit of networking, and made a point of showing off my skillset.The post got downvoted pretty heavily. A lot of people didn’t like how I phrased things or maybe didn’t believe someone in my situation could be skilled. Whatever the reason, I got the message: *“You’re not supposed to complain. Just stay in your lane.”****But here’s the update:*** I landed a job as an Embedded Software Engineer.Over the summer, I was approached by three companies. What changed was how I presented myself. I started using LinkedIn actively, and Premium honestly helped me get visibility. On top of that, I shared more of my personal projects and made my skills visible.One company I haven’t heard back from yet. For another, the recruiter told me the position was put on hold but asked if they could reach out again when hiring resumed. For the third, I made it deeper into the interview stages.I was told there were other applicants, most of whom had degrees, but I still ended up getting the offer at the top of the pay range they advertised. The role is Embedded Software Engineer, and honestly it’s a higher-level position than I expected to land right out the gate, but one I’m confident stepping into.What helped most was having solid personal projects to point to. During the technical interview, I didn’t have any trouble with the questions, and the team lead seemed to get a good impression of me fairly quickly.If you’re self-taught and don’t have a degree, the most useful advice I can give is to make your work visible. Start publishing your projects on GitHub, put together a simple portfolio website, and make sure you’re using LinkedIn. If you’re able to afford Premium, it was surprisingly helpful during my job search and the only reason I used it was because they gave me a free trial.What really got the process moving was a recruiter reaching out based on the broad strokes of my resume. Once someone technical took a closer look at what I’d done, things moved quickly from there.I do want to ask though: Why did it seem like people hated my original post so much? I can guess and make inferrences, but I would like to know. It was sort of discouraging and I did shift my focus for a little while as a result, but things went really differently on this last hunt just from some strategic changes.",72,0.81,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lgklmb/i_posted_10_months_ago_and_i_found_a_job_since/,2025-06-21 01:25:07,2025-06-28 01:41:21

1li0sht,"High-level ICs (above senior), how is your WLB like?",Jyonnyp,cscareerquestions,"I'm currently a mid-level at my company. I've worked here since my internship, so I have about 2.5 YOE total. Currently I'm interested to continue progressing as an IC but I have zero interest in management, because I hate having to have that responsibility and sitting in meetings all day long sounds horrid.My concern though is that above senior, it seems your responsibilities end up becoming cross-team. With that sounds like a lot of stress. The people I work closely with that are above senior seem like they're always busy throughout the day and even get pinged oftentimes post 5 or 6PM. Feels like they always have a ton on their plate to do both in terms of coding, designs, attending meetings, etc. And the ones I know even still feel like their output outside of meetings is high. Like their brain is just completely on for the entirety of the work day, something I cannot do.I hope to progress above Senior but I don't want to have to sacrifice a ton of WLB for that. Currently I enjoy my WLB. I work remotely, start at like 9-9:30 and end at 5-6, depending on if I have impromptu meetings (my personal policy is end independent work at 5 but if someone needs to meet with me I can stretch until 6, especially since my team is in CT or PST). I completely ignore any pings before/after and that's not a problem. I feel like with my current workload in my team and company, I can progress in my career while still having sufficient brain breaks throughout the day, and at least in my team, there's good support and little pressure.At risk of sounding greedy, my current TC is around like $200k~ but I hope to reach like $300k+ in <7 years, without having to kill myself with work and stress for it. I also have problems with anxiety which is pretty bad in high-pressure, hectic environments that I assume a lot of higher level engineers have to deal with given their responsibilities. I know other companies can pay that amount of mid-level and seniors...but they also work you to the bone. I want to know if my prospects are too idealistic, hence why I'm asking if engineers above senior here can pitch in and let me know how their WLB experiences have been like. Obviously it's company and team dependent but I assume there's a level of similarity between companies given a similar breadth and depth of responsibilities.And I guess a second question to my main one is if you guys think (if you can even predict the future) that the answers to my first question are even relevant like 7+ years down the line.",37,0.87,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1li0sht/highlevel_ics_above_senior_how_is_your_wlb_like/,2025-06-22 22:40:43,2025-06-28 01:41:21

1lm61o2,This field is taking a toll on my mental well-being,zipped_chip,cscareerquestions,"I graduated in 2022 with a bachelor's in IT, but found I liked dev work a lot more. Brushed up on React, SpringBoot, MYSQL etc., made a few apps and stuffed my resume. Had that canon event we all seem to be going through of not being able to find anything.Fast forward 8 months post-grad, I cave and take a QA Engineer position. My thinking was that I'd take the route of automating everything I can to impress the devs and join them at the company, but no such luck. My company is mostly foreign, with about 70% of the staff being Chinese... including the entirety of the devs. I don't speak Chinese, and there's a blatant opportunity/ compensation bias towards my Chinese coworkers. Nonetheless, I get a few Automation certs, make a couple projects specifically for the company's benefit with the previous stack, and it gets me nowhere. A ""Thank you! Now get back to work"", and a 2% annual bump in my salary. So, while still trying to create applications/software to benefit my company, my main work has been devolved into manual testing. I'm desperately doing anything I can to code. But I feel like I've got the QA brand on me now after this long.Then I get home, see 3-5 more rejections from the prior days applications, apply to 15-20 more, leetcode, work on projects/ certs, go to the gym and lift out my frustration, and go to bed. It's been like this for **2 and a half years** now, and I'm losing my mind. I spend most of my days feeling like an absolute failure, and hating myself over this, and it's effecting my relationships because people are picking up on it now. I see friends/ acquaintances of the same age buying homes, having kids etc., that went right into the trades after high school. And I'm still living at my parent's place. I just feel so incredibly cheated and disheartened that those 4 years in college and countless post-midnight study grind sessions, along with all of the extra effort post-grad haven't gotten me anywhere.I just don't know what to do. I don't want to be a CEO. I'm not applying to FANG or anything like that. Just all normal, average companies. I don't care to be wildly rich. I just want to be able to comfortably support a future family, and buy a house for them, and live out the American Dream. That's literally it, and I spend so much time being bitter about that being so far away right now. I'm just so tired of hating myself and feeling like a failure.

1lh6uc4,Is it still realistic to get hired again after a long career gap?,bmp_xor,cscareerquestions,"I’m looking for honest input from people who’ve either been through something similar or have seen it from the hiring side.I used to work as a software engineer at a well-known infrastructure company (intentionally omitting the name here for some level of anonymity). I contributed to core distributed systems work and overall would say I had a strong start to my career.Unfortunately I left without another job lined up, mostly due to burnout and a family tragedy (my brother passed away). When this initially happened I tried to push through and keep the job anyway but once I had some level of financial cushion to support it I thought that thought a year or two out of the workforce would help me process some of the grief I was feeling day to day. The time off ended up lasting longer than I anticipated because it hasn’t been exactly easy to get hired again. I’m actively rebuilding momentum — applying to jobs, prepping for interviews, working on side projects, reconnecting with mentors, and I also got accepted into an MS CS program this fall (with a focus on AI/ML).The gap will be around 2–3 years total by the time I’m back in full swing. I’m not sure whether to focus fully on grad school or keep pushing hard for jobs now. Part of me worries I burned too much credibility by leaving when I did and being out this long.So here’s my question:Has anyone here come back successfully from a gap like this? Do hiring managers actually give people like me a second shot, or should I expect to start from a lower level (if I get hired at all)?Any blunt or realistic advice is appreciated.

1lir9dc,"First year Computer Science done, considering switching to Humanities / Political Science",CannedCam,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR, I finished my first year of my Computer Science degree poorly and I’m considering switching to Humanities/Political Science or something similar (which I am definitely more interested in), but I have concerns related to opportunities, income, work, etc.I’m 19 (turning 20), from New Brunswick, Canada. I always liked technology and thought I’d do well pursuing a computer science but after doing my first year in two parts, I’m honestly not sure.Ended my year with only a 2.5 GPA. Surprisingly I did meh in my other classes but still passed (C’s, B-‘s) profs were probably generous, but I did horrible in my Java class and got a D, so I’d have to retake it. Overtime I feel like I’ve grown disinterested in Java and as much as I tried in the classes (along with my other ones), but there’s just no way I can catch up on pace especially given the fact that during classes I also had to work part time 20 hours/week to help my family with rent/utilities/etc. I ended up relying a lot on “online tools” more than I’d like to admit, as disappointing as it is to the integrity of my university. Hate to make excuses but I really would dedicate more time to my studies if I didn’t have to work so much, I live with a single parent who is lower income and I have to help out.That being said, I’m wondering if I should change my major to Political Science or a related field, like maybe History or something in the Humanities field. My best class was an A- in Sociology, which I took as an Elective. I also went to a political science professor’s lectures often out of interest, and he’s pretty damn good. I sometimes engaged more than the people actually taking the course did.Politics or History (particularly Canadian) something I’ve grown extremely interested in over the past few years now and I’m pretty knowledgeable on Legislative matters. I’ve used newspaper archives often and contributed to hundreds (and personally written 100+) of encyclopedic texts about New Brunswick related topics on Wikipedia, so it’s probably clear I have much more of an interest in Humanities/Politics/History than I do CS. If you’ve read anything New Brunswick-related on WP chances are I’ve contributed to it in some shape or form. I’d be interested in maybe some sort of Government position but I’m just concerned about job opportunities for that field. Whichever route I take, I’ll have to take out a student loan due to being low income. I do feel pretty disappointed in myself for making these sort of considerations after a year though; I had used up all of the RESP money saved up for me towards something I performed so poorly in and I’d feel even more behind on life than I already do if I were to switch.Any potential advice?

I mainly wrote it for myself because I absolutely despise repetitive work, but word got around when I showed it to ONE person and I was persuaded to turn it into a standalone GUI tool. Eventually that task I entirely automated wasn't my responsibility anymore as I got a promotion and went to work on other projects. The individuals that wound up handling that task/responsibility heavily used my tool until it didn't work anymore because the structure of the source data changed, and the way the tool was written wasn't dynamic. So of course, they reach out to me to update it. I didn't really have time to update that thing, but they'd become so spoiled, I said okay. So I rewrote it. I implemented some pretty rudimentary data structures so it was dynamic and would work with any modifications to the source data. I also implemented some fuzzy matching so it would populate accurately regardless, whether there were differences in case or trailing spaces or whatever. One of the guys in the role decided to ask me for a walk through, because apparently, he has a CS degree. He looked through the code of the older version (static/hard coded) and the new version (dynamic/fuzzy) and said he didn't understand the updates --so he was going to work with the first one. Fast forward to yesterday and he's giving a ""demo"" on his ""updates"". On that call were members of management, eagerly anticipating something inventive and/or innovative from some supposed collaborative effort. I join the call late because I was super busy, but when I get on, he's walking through the logic, workflow, and data structures that I wrote in the first and second version. I'm sitting there like.. hmm.. this sounds like all of the functionality I built, and I'm wondering if I should air him out and let the entire group know. Of course I didn't because I'm better than that, but I did ask what improvements or updates he made (that constituted the meeting). The only thing he changed was swapping out one Excel read/write library for another, because the one I used (xlswriter) overwrites formulas in cells. Anyway, so while the tool isn't all that much of a big deal, because, I pretty much hacked it together in a couple of hours altogether to save myself some time, I can't help feeling a little petty about this dude passing along my work as his own. It's one thing to show the tool's usage, it's another to walk through the logic to upper-management, like he wrote the damn thing.

I have worked here for about a month now, and they have been astonished by my accomplishments in automating some of the workflow, and even said that I have been the best intern they have had, and even have talked about me possibly continuing as an employee afterwards. The problem though is that I can count the lines of code I have written on 1 hand, everything else, 99%, is straight up AI work. The company itself is not an IT one, and besides me, there is 1 IT lead, and another coder. They know that I use AI, they even gave an AI model subscription, (they use AI themselves). They like how I have accelerated the development in IT sector, and they do not really care how I get the results, just that it is moving forward. And this is kinda pushing me further to continue to use AI. The code-base was already huge when I came, and it felt overwhelming trying to do something without AI.But I feel like, I gain no valuable knowledge, I should be happy that I even got this internship, because in the first year it was totally dry, this year I submitted even more applications and this was the only one that I got.I mainly have to code in PHP, js, and use REST API(which I don't know), should I just try to learn those languages in my free time, or just continue free-balling.

1llxi30,From big tech to verge of collapse. What should I do next?,fuzzycat__,cscareerquestions,"I have done B.Tech in CS and graduated in 2022 and I landed a FAANG internship. I thought a full-time offer was practically a sure thing.But then, no full-time offer materialized because of team structuring. Still, I secured an SDE-1 role at a major tech company, earning a solid 14-18 LPA.Within a year, I left the work as the work wasn't challenging me as there was literally zero work related to actual product development / core software engineering, the culture felt stagnant and I was hungry for more.After leaving that SDE-1 role without any full-time offer, I pivoted to a freelancing role while prepping for the interviews for full time role alongwith DSA, System Design etc.I interviewed with 50+ companies including Google, Amazon, Zomato etc last year for the initial 7-8 months period.The Google interview was four months of pure emotional journey. I aced the first two tech rounds with ""Strong Hire"" and “Hire” ratings, the third round got completely derailed with a ""No Hire"" for the technical part and rated ""Hire"" for Googlyness by the same interviewer. After this they ghosted me for two months without any 'team matching' calls. In my Amazon interview I sailed through their technical rounds but got rejected in the leadership evaluation. Out of five companies where I actually cleared all the interview rounds, four of them just straight-up ghosted me. The single offer I did receive was a massive 40% below my previous salary and demanded relocation. I declined it.After this period while freelancing I earned what I used to make from my previous salary within two months. Here, I took a break from job searching as it was draining me mentally. But after three months, reality hit when the freelancing projects dried up. I decided to upskill (enrolled in Harkirat's 100xdevs cohort) for full-stack development. Six months later, I'm only about 70% through the course. The freelancing money, my savings is now exhausted with only 3 months runaway.I've spent the last year grinding, working on my weaknesses. I've gone from zero to four to five production-ready MERN stack applications. I've genuinely evolved from an AI trainer(freelance work) to a full-stack developer.After these interviews, I figured out that three main issues consistently held me back:1. Role Mismatch: Companies just couldn't reconcile my AI training background with traditional SDE roles.2. Short Tenure: Leaving my first job within a year constantly came up.3. Weak Dev Skills (Back Then): Honestly, I just couldn't demonstrate core software engineering capabilities during technical rounds. API building, database schemas, system design.Now, I'm at a crossroads. I'm facing some big challenges:1. The CTC issue: My freelance income was hourly and in USD. When I mention my 25-30 LPA expectations, recruiters often ghost me. Should I anchor to my last full-time salary?2. Market Reality Check: With roughly 3 years of experience and this diverse background, is 25-30 LPA even realistic in today's market?3. Strategic Focus: Do I cast a wide net (remote, YC startups, EU, Dubai based) or grab the first decent Indian offer for stability?4. Ethical Job Title: During my freelance period, I applied my new full-stack skills to personal projects. Can I legitimately frame this as ""Contract Software Engineer (Full-Stack)"" on my resume, or is that crossing a line?5. Unable to get calls: Despite applying actively, I’m struggling to get interview calls and even when recruiters reach out those calls are not converted to interviews.To anyone who's been here, or helped someone through similar crossroads: what would you do?TL;DR2022 grad with 3 YOE (6 months of internship +1 yr FTE + 1.5 yrs freelance).

My first job out of uni is a full stack web platform developer in my country’s public sector. While work hours and pay is decent, it is only a contract role, career progression is very slow if converted, and I have very little interest in my current industry. So I am looking to job hop in the next couple of years.I am competent at front end, but I struggle with backend tasks as I lack exp. I often require guidance on how to do stuff like Kafka streams, microservice programming in C#, SQL Schema configuration etc. In fact, it has come to the point where my team lead has stopped giving me backend tasks altogether, saying that I should just focus on front end for now, which was demoralising for me.I am definitely concerned for my future plans to job hop as I feel the competition. You have:1. Highflyer CS fresh grads who have tons of hackathon, internship and project exp who memorise all of Leetcode, and can easily land jobs at MNCs/Big Tech2. Offshore foreign devs who can do a junior’s work at a fraction of the cost and with more work hours3. AI LLMs which can streamline all the work of multiple junior devsMeanwhile there is me who cant even land a permanent role after uni grad and cant do backend coding to save his life.I am considering what to do at this point. My original idea was to read up on the side and do another web dev project tied to cloud services to showcase my fullstack skills, for a cause/industry that I’m passionate in. But the competition and job economy for devs will just not get easier from now on.Realistically however, would it be better for me as an average dev to eventually pivot to project management instead? From what I read, PM roles rely more on industry domain knowledge and soft skills, of which fresh grads, offshore devs, or AI LLMs would tend to not be as strong in. I do have some project leadership exp from various CCA and volunteering opportunities in the past. And of course, this still allows me to work on tech related projects. Can anyone advise me on this?

I take help often I make silly mistakes and don't really know what I'm doing most of the time. I don't come up with solutions I sometimes fill in the blanks if my senior gives me a hint. I really don't know why I'm not getting any negative feedback from anyone I truly don't know even if I take forever to finish simple stuff they say it's nothing out of ordinary to take a few days extra.My question: I'm not good at this I can't solve real problems I don't know what I am doing and somehow got lucky with a team and company.how do I deal with my own mediocrity? What can be done if a task needs me to actually solve something? Can one like me improve enough to be productively employable in this day and age of competition and AI.",7,0.89,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1llpo6h/how_you_deal_with_not_being_good_enough/,2025-06-27 09:37:02,2025-06-28 01:41:21
1ljiu5t,Second job in CS to fill missing hours,griffs_charisma,cscareerquestions,"I got my CS degree in May '24. I have been working completely remote as a Full-Stack Junior Developer for a small company (20-30 employees) based in southern Indiana since October '24 (8 months). I get paid $36/hour but since it's 1099 taxes take nearly 20% of that. On top of taxes I am not getting the proper hours I need, 15-20 hours most weeks, but want at least 35-40hrs. When I started working with this company my project manager said after a few months they would bring me on as a full-time dev. That has yet to happen even after bringing it up 6 months into this position.At this point I'm open to completely switching jobs but would rather get a second job that's completely asynchronous (or highly flexible) since my job now requires me to have a set schedule. I believe a second job would be better since sticking around for at least a year would show commitment but I'm unsure if that matters given my professional experience is so limited.While I have been looking and applying I feel pretty stuck/limited so any guidance on switching jobs or where to look for a completely asynchronous second job would be extremely appreciated.",9,0.8,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ljiu5t/second_job_in_cs_to_fill_missing_hours/,2025-06-24 18:25:04,2025-06-28 01:41:21

1lm665p,"Is QA Automation a pigeonhole or a dead end, difficult to pivot out of? Or a stepping stone?",Crapahedron,cscareerquestions,"I'm curious about this; I don't know a single developer who at one point worked professionally in QA automation (Selenium + language of choice etc). And everyone I know that does work in it, started there and has never moved out of that niche. As someone who himself does not work as a developer professionally, only in roles that are satellite roles surrounding the development lifecycle (QA, BA, Scrum Master etc) is Automation / SDET really that difficult to move away from and into a more traditional development role? In my current company of employment, a QA Automation dev is on the same payscale as a front-end web developer. We have had front end devs move into QA and QA Automation, but we never had anyone move out of Automation into, well, anywhere else. Is my experience in this observation mostly a vacuum or is this actually a thing? I'm curious so I thought I would ask you guys!Thanks!",6,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lm665p/is_qa_automation_a_pigeonhole_or_a_dead_end/,2025-06-27 21:51:09,2025-06-28 01:41:21
1lknud7,I work for a good company and a bad manager. Need corporate politics advice from you experienced folks,t3klead,cscareerquestions,"Hello good people.Like the title says I work for a typical megalomaniac, micromanaging, exploitive manager. I don’t mind it too much as I’m in good terms with her and she mostly leaves me the fuck alone because 90% of the time I close out all my tickets.I’ve been working on this project that uses a LLM model to generate some output, but I don’t think it’s the right project to solve with LLMs because of the inconsistencies/inaccuracies generated in the output. But my manager seems to be convinced that we can make it work, we just need to try harder (improve the prompt, adjust the code, etc.) My company has zero experience building AI products wants to jump in the AI bandwagon and my manager wants to impress c-suite folks by solving business problems with AI. I have voiced my concerns several times how we are trying to solve a problem with the wrong tool or how we should change our approach as the project requires a more deterministic output. I have been ignored everytime and was either asked to just “improve the process a little more” or “don’t think too much, it’ll be fine”. I put duck tapes here and there and the end product is shit. My manager convinced me its fine as long as we make efforts in a positive direction, and at the end if we can’t build this there’s no real repercussions. Long story cut short we are few months into the project and I had to demo the app to the client we are building this for and they weren’t impressed with the inconsistencies in the output. Because at the end of the day it’s nothing like what my manager promised them and they are on our asses to build a working solution ASAP.At this point I think you can guess who’s on the hook for all of this? Fortunately the concerns I have expressed to her during the initial phase of the project is documented in emails. But at my company upper management doesn’t want to hear/doesn’t care if your direct manager is being a dick/is incapable and they tell you “you need to figure this out with your manager. Ain’t there nothing I can do about this”. So between me and my manager they’ll just take her word against mine (even with email proof) as I’m more “dispensable” in their eyes? If this project fails more than likely I’ll be blamed and let go as I’ve no doubt she’ll use me as a scapegoat.What’s my move here? I can’t just work harder during the weekends and crank this out. Really need your advice so I can form a strategy.

I'm done working with embedded and prefer go backend. I get fairly consistent messages from recruiters on linkedin, but they're all for embedded roles instead of SWE roles.
