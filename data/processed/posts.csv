I am also studying Software Engineering at the moment.I've been working in isolated environments for the past 3 years which prevents me from using modern cloud platforms. Most of my time in DE has been on the platform side, not the data side. Since I joined the field, DevOps, MLOPs, LLMs, RAG and Data Lakehouse have been added to our responsibility on top of the old Modern Data Stack and Data Warehouses. This stack covers all of the use cases I have faced so far. These are my current recommendations for each of those problems in a self hosted, open source environment (with the exception of vibe coding, I haven't found any model good enough to do so yet). You don't need all of these tools, but you could use them all if you needed to. Solve the problems you have with the minimum tools you can. I have been working on guides on how to deploy the stack in docker/kubernetes on my site, [www.datacraftsman.com.au](http://www.datacraftsman.com.au), but not all of them are finished yet... I've been vibe coding data engineering tools instead as it's a fun distraction. I hope these resources help you make a better decision with your architecture.Comment below if you have any advice on improving the stack with reasons why, need any help setting up the tools or want to understand my choices and I'll try my best to help.",533,0.85,87,https://i.redd.it/0bwy1conkuaf1.png,2025-07-04 12:15:10,2025-07-09 01:46:51

In all I processed 178.33 GB ZIP files, which uncompressed was 3314.57 GB. I created Parquet files for each table, with the data types optimized.Here are some next steps that I want to do, and I would love anyone's comments on it:* Create a Dagster (have to learn it) pipeline that downloads and processes the data tables when they are updated (I am almost finished creating a Python Package).* Create a process that will upload the files to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (CERNs data portal) and other sites such as The Internet Archive, and Hugging Face. The data will be versioned so we will always be able to go back in time and see what code was used to create the data and how the data has changed. I also want to create a torrent file for each dataset and have it HTTP seeded from the aforementioned sites; I know this is overkill as the largest dataset is only 6.94 GB, but I want to experiment with it as I think it would be awesome for a data portal to have this feature.* Create a Python package that magically links the data tables to their geographic boundaries. This way people will be able to view it software such as QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, DeckGL, lonboard, or anything that can read Parquet.All of the code to create the data is currently in \[2\].

Or am I being gaslighted:My team, which is data starved, has imo unrealistic expectations about how tested a pipeline should be by the data engineer. I must basically do data analysis. Jupyter notebooks and the whole DS package, to completely and finally document the data pipeline _and the data quality_, before the data analysts can lay their eyes on the data. And at that point it's considered a failure if I need to make some change. I feel like this is very waterfall like, and slows us down, because they could have gotten the data much faster if I don't have to spend time doing basically what they should be doing either way, and probably will do again. If there was a genuine intentional feedback loop between us, we could move much faster than what were doing. But now it's considered failure if an adjustment is needed or an additional column must be added etc after the pipeline is documented, which must be completed before they will touch the data.I actually don't mind doing data analysis on a personal level, but it's weird that a data starved data science team doesn't want more data and sooner, and do this analysis themselves?",56,0.94,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lrsrdn/what_tests_do_you_do_on_your_data_pipeline/,2025-07-04 20:36:51,2025-07-09 01:46:51

1lsg7gu,Building a Data Warehouse: alone and without practical experience,bukketraven,dataengineering,"Background: I work in an SME which has a few MS SQL databases for different use cases and a Standard ERP system. Reporting is mainly done via downloading files from the ERP and importing it into PowerBI or excel. For some projects we call the api of the ERP to get the data. Other specialized Applications sit on Top of the SQL databases.Problems: Most of the Reports get fed manually and we really want to get them to run automatically (including data cleaning), which would save a lot of time. Also, the many sources of Data cause a lot of confusion, as internal clients are not always sure where the Data comes from and how up to date it is. Combining data sources is also very painful right now and work feels very redundant. This is why i would like to Build a „single source of truth“.My idea is to Build a analytics database, most likely a data Warehouse according to kimball. I understand how it works theoretically, but i have never done it. I have a masters in business Informatics (Major in Business Intelligence and System Design) and have read the kimball Book. SQL knowledge is very Basic, but i am very motivated to learn.My questions to you are:1.⁠⁠is this a project that i could handle myself without any practical experience? Our IT Department is very small and i only have one colleague that could support a little with database/sql stuff. I know python and have a little experience with prefect. I have no deadline and i can do courses/certs if necessary.2.⁠⁠My current idea is to start with Open source/free tools. BigQuery, airbyte, dbt and prefect as orchestrator. Is this a feasible stack or would this be too much overhead for the beginning? Bigquery, Airbyte and dbt are new to me, but i am motivated to learn (especially the Latter)I know that i will have to do a internal Research on wether this is a feasible project or not, also Talking to stakeholders and defining processes. I will do that before developing anything. But i am still wondering if any of you were in a similar situation or if some More experienced DEs have a few hints for me.

1ltg0pt,Why Realtime Analytics Feels Like a Myth (and What You Can Actually Expect),ivanimus,dataengineering,"Hi there :waving_hand:I’ve been diving into the concept of realtime analytics, and I’m starting to think it’s more hype than reality. Here’s why achieving true realtime analytics (sub-second latency) is so tough, especially when building data marts in a Data Warehouse or Lakehouse:1. Processing Delays: Even with CDC (Change Data Capture) for instant raw data ingestion, subsequent steps like data cleaning, quality checks, transformations, and building data marts take time. Aggregations, validations, and metric calculations can add seconds to minutes, which is far from the ""realtime"" promise (<1s).2. Complex Transformations: Data marts often require heavy operations—joins, aggregations, and metric computations. These depend on data volume, architecture, and compute power. Even with optimized engines like Spark or Trino, latency creeps in, especially with large datasets.3. Data Quality Overhead: Raw data is rarely clean. Validation, deduplication, and enrichment add more delays, making ""near-realtime"" (seconds to minutes) the best-case scenario.4. Infra Bottlenecks: Fast ingestion via CDC is great, but network bandwidth, storage performance, or processing engine limitations can slow things down.5. Hype vs. Reality: Marketing loves to sell ""realtime analytics"" as instant insights, but real-world setups often mean seconds-to-minutes latency. True realtime is only feasible for simple use cases, like basic metric monitoring with streaming systems (e.g., Kafka + Flink).TL;DR: Realtime analytics isn’t exactly a scam, but it’s overhyped. You’re more likely to get ""near-realtime"" due to unavoidable processing and transformation delays. To get close to realtime, simplify transformations, optimize infra, and use streaming tech—but sub-second latency is still a stretch for complex data marts.What’s your experience with realtime analytics?

What started as a straightforward streaming pipeline turned into: procedures dynamically generating SQL merge statements, tasks chained together with dependencies, custom parallel processing logic because the sequential stuff was too slow...So we decided to give Dynamic Tables a try.**What changed:** Instead of maintaining all those procedures and task dependencies, we now have simple table definitions that handle deduplication, incremental processing, and scheduling automatically. One definition replaced what used to be multiple procedures and merge statements.**The reality check:** It's not perfect. We lost detailed logging capabilities (which were actually pretty useful for debugging), there are SQL transformation limitations, and sometimes you miss having that granular control over exactly what's happening when.For our use case, I think it’s a better option than the pipeline, which grew and grew with additional cases that appeared along the way.**Anyone else made similar trade-offs?** Did you simplify and lose some functionality, or did you double down and try to make the complex stuff work better?Also curious - anyone else using Dynamic Tables vs traditional Snowflake pipelines?

Source -> BI ToolLonger version:Coming from being ""the excel guy"" I've recently been promoted to analytics engineer (whether or not that's justified is a discussion for another time and place).My company's reporting was entirely build upon me accessing source systems like our ERP and CRM through SQL directly and feeding that into Excel via power query.Due to growth in complexity and demand this isn't a sustainable way of doing things anymore, hence me being tasked with BI-ifying that stuff.Now, it's been a while (read ""a decade"") since the last time I've come into contact with dimensional modeling, kimball and data warehousing.But that's more or less what I know or rather I can get my head around, so naturally that's what I proposed to build.Our development team is seeing things differently saying that storing data multiple times would be unacceptable and with the amount of data we have performance wouldn't be either.They propose to build custom APIs for the various source systems and feeding those directly into whatever BI tool we choose (we are 100% on-prem so powerBI is out of the race, tableau is looking good rn).And here is where I just don't know how to argue. How valid is their point? Do we even need a data warehouse (or lakehouse and all those fancy things I don't know anything about)?One argument they had was that BI tools come with their own specialized ""database"" that is optimized and much faster in a way we could never build it manually.But do they really? I know Excel/power query has some sort of storage, same with powerBI but that's not a database, right?I'm just a bit at a loss here and was hoping you actual engineers could steer me in the right direction.Thank you!",11,0.74,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lrcx96/please_help_do_modern_bi_systems_need_an/,2025-07-04 07:43:03,2025-07-09 01:46:51
1lpxdy8,Polars/SQLAlchemy-> Upsert data to database,N1loon,dataengineering,"I'm currently learning Python, specifically the Polars API and the interaction with SQLAlchemy. There are functions to read in and write data to a database (pl.read_databaae and pl.write_database). Now, I'm wondering if it's possible to further specify the import logic and if so, how would I do it?Specifically, I wan to perform an Upsert (insert or update) and as a table operation I want to define 'Create table if not exists'. There is another function 'pl.write_delta', in which it's possible via multiple parameters to define the exact import logic to Delta Lake:```.when_matched_update_all() \.when_not_matched_insert_all() \.execute()```I assume it wasn't possible to generically include these parameters in write_database because all RDBMS handle Upsets differently? ...So, what would be the recommended/best-practice way of upserting data to SQL Server? Can I do it with SQLAlchemy taking a Polars dataframe as an input?The complete data pipeline looks like this:- read in flat file (xlsx/CSV/JSON) with Polars- perform some data wrangling operations with Polars- upsert data to SQL Server (with table operation 'Create table if not exists')What I also found in a Stackoverflow post regarding Upserts with Polars:```df1 = ( df_new .join(df_old, on = [""group"",""id""], how=""inner"") .select(df_new.columns) ) df2 = ( df_new .join(df_old, on = [""group"",""id""], how=""anti"") ) df3 = ( df_old .join(df_new, on = [""group"",""id""], how=""anti"") ) df_all = pl.concat([df1, df2, df3])```Or with `pl.update()` I could perform an Upsert inside Polars:```df.update(new_df, left_on=[""A""], right_on=[""C""], how=""full"")```With both options though, I would have to read in the respective table from the database first, perform the Upsert with Polars and then write the output to the database again. This feels like 'overkill' to me?...Anyways, thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!",12,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lpxdy8/polarssqlalchemy_upsert_data_to_database/,2025-07-02 14:31:56,2025-07-09 01:46:51

I'm creating a hands-on coding course for upstream data quality for transactional databases and would love feedback on my plan! (this course is with a third party [not a vendor] that I won't name).All of my courses have sandbox environments that can be run in GitHub CodeSpaces, infra is open source, and uses a public gov dataset. For this I'm planning on having the following:- Postgres Database- pgAdmin for SQL IDE- A very simple typescript frontend app to surface data- A very simple user login workflow for CRUD data- A data catalog via DataHubWe will have a working data product as well as create data by going through the login workflow a couple times. We will then intentionally break it (update the data to be bad, change the login data collected without changing schema, and changing the DDL files to introduce errors). These errors will be hidden from the user, but they will see a bunch of errors in the logs and frontend.From there we conduct a root cause analysis to identify the issues. Examples of ways we will resolve issues is the following:- Revert back changes to the frontend- Add regex validation for login workflow- Review and fix introduced bugs in the DDL files- Implement DQ checks to run in CI/CD that compares proposed schema changes to expected schema in data catalogAnything you would add or change to this plan? Note that I already have a DQ for analytical databases course that this builds on.My goal is less teaching theory, and more so creating a real-world experience that matches what the job is actually like.",11,0.78,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lsgfqq/data_quality_for_transactional_databases/,2025-07-05 18:22:14,2025-07-09 01:46:51

1lupipn,Medallion-like architecture in MS SQL Server?,ursamajorm82,dataengineering,"So the company I'm working with doesn't have anything like a Databricks or Snowflake. Everything is on-prem and the tools we're provided are Python, MS SQL Server, Power BI and the ability to ask IT to set up a shared drive.The data flow I'm dealing with is a small-ish amount of data that's made up of reports from various outside organizations that have to be cleaned/transformed and then reformed into an overall report.I'm looking at something like a Medallion-like architecture where I have bronze (raw data), silver (cleaning/transforming) and gold (data warehouse connected to powerbi) layers that are set up as different schemas in SQL Server. Also, should the bronze layer just be a shared drive in this case or do we see a benefit in adding it to the RDBMS? So I'm basically just asking for a gut check here to see if this makes sense or if something like Delta Lake would be necessary here. In addition, I've traditionally used schemas to separate dev from uat and prod in the RDBMS.

1ltsbjn,Star schema - flatten dimensional hierarchy?,paulrpg,dataengineering,"I'm doing some design work where are are generally trying to follow Kimball modelling for a star schema. I'm familiar with the theory of the data warehouse toolkit but I haven't had that much experience implementing it. For reference, we are doing this in snowflake/dbt and were talking about tables with a few million rows.I am trying to model a process which has a fixed hierarchy. We have 3 layers to this - a top level organisational plan, a plan for doing a functional test and then the individual steps taken to complete this plan. To make it a bit more complicated - whilst the process I am looking at has a fixed hierarchy but the process is a subset of a larger process which allows for arbitrary depth, I feel that the simpler business case is easier to solve first.I want to end up with 1 or several dimensional models to capture this, store descriptive text etc. The literature states that fixed hierarchies should be flattened. If we took this approach:* Our dimension table grain is 1 row for each task* Each row would contain full textual information for the functional test and the organisational plan* We have a small 'One Big Table' approach, making it easy for BI users to access the dataThe challenge I see here is around what keys to use. Our business processes map to different levels of this hierarchy, some to the top level plan, some to the functional test and some to the step.I keep going back and forth as a more normalised approach - where 1 table for each of these steps and then build a bridge table to map them all together is something that we have done for arbitrary depth and it worked really well.If we are to go with a flattened model then:* Should I include the surrogate keys for each level in the hierarchy (preferred) or model the relationship in a secondary table?* Business analysts are going to use this - is this their preferred approach - they will have fewer joins to do but will need to do more aggregation/deduplication if they are only interested in top level informationIf we go for a more normalised model:* Should we be offering a pre-joined view of the data - effectively making a 'one big table' available at the cost of performance?",10,0.82,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ltsbjn/star_schema_flatten_dimensional_hierarchy/,2025-07-07 12:01:22,2025-07-09 01:46:51

1lpp9nk,SQL vs. Pandas for Batch Data Visualization,schrodingersmilk,dataengineering,"I'm working on a project where I'm building a pipeline to organize, analyze, and visualize experimental data from different batches. The goal is to help my team more easily view and compare historical results through an interactive web app.Right now, all the experiment data is stored as CSVs in a shared data lake, which allows for access control, only authorized users can view the files. Initially, I thought it’d be better to load everything into a database like PostgreSQL, since structured querying feels cleaner and would make future analytics easier. So I tried adding a batch_id column to each dataset and uploading everything into Postgres to allow for querying and plotting via the web app. But since we don’t have a cloud SQL setup, and loading all the data into a local SQL instance for new user every time felt inefficient, I didn’t go with that approach.Then I discovered DuckDB, which seemed promising since it’s SQL-based and doesn’t require a server, and I could just keep a database file in the shared folder. But now I’m running into two issues: 1) Streamlit takes a while to connect to DuckDB every time, and 2) the upload/insert process is for some reason troublesome and need to take more time to maintain schema and structure etc.So now I’m stuck… in a case like this, is it even worth loading all the CSVs into a database at all? Should I stick with DuckDB/SQL? Or would it be simpler to just use pandas to scan the directory, match file names to the selected batch, and read in only what’s needed? If so, would there be any issues with doing analytics later on?

So I have been working as SQL Server Dba for last 2 years for a service based company and I am currently part of the dba team which caters to atleast 8-10 clients simultaneously. Most of my work is monitoring work with ocassional high level stuff, otherwise most of the time I get like L1 level tasks. Since we cater to multiple clients therefore I had the opportunity to get in touch with other databases like MySQL and Oracle. I also work in AWS cloud, mainly we work with RDS, S3 for backups and EC2 instances where DB instances are installed. We work in rotational shifts which is the least favorite part of the job me. I got DBA role as a chance to enter to corporate and specially the data field, but I really don't like the DBA role, because I have seen the kind of time this role demands from you. I have seen my manager even working weekends sometimes due to some client activity or doing some POC for potential client. Plus the rotational shift I just hate it, I have endured for 2 years but I don't think so I will be able to endure for another year or two. I have been working remotely for last 2 years Therefore I had plenty of time to upskill myself and learn technologies like SQL Server, AWS Cloud (Mainly Database related tasks), L1 administration of MySQL and Oracle. Apart from that I have also invested time in learning Python which I like a lot, I had also invested a lot time in learning SQL too. Earlier I was learning web dev along job thinking that I could transition from DBA to dev, but I realised that both are very different roles and whatever I have learnt here as a DBA won't do me that good in dev role. Therefor I have decided to further transition into DE role. I have made a plan of the things that I will have to learn for DE role and also a plan to double down on things I already know. Mostly I want to focus on Azure ecosystem for DE and for That I have decided to learn SQL, Azure Data Factory - ADF - ETL, Databricks, Python, Spark - PySpark, Azure Synapse Analytics. I am already familiar with SQL and Python as mentioned before, and just need to take care of the other things. I just want to know from you guys is this even possible? Or am I just stuck with DBA role forever? Is my plan even relevant and doable or not?

1lpld31,Why do we need the heartbeat mechanism in MySQL CDC connector?,the-fake-me,dataengineering,"I have worked with MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL Debezium CDC connectors as of now. As per my understanding, the reason MongoDB and PostgreSQL connectors need the heartbeat mechanism is that both MongoDB and PostgreSQL notify the connector of the changes in the subscribed collections/tables (using MongoDB change streams and PostgreSQL publications) and if no changes happen in the collections/tables for a long time, the connector might not receive any activity corresponding to the subscribed collections/tables. In case of MongoDB, that might lead to losing the token and in case of PostgreSQL, it might lead to the replication slot getting bigger (if there are changes happening to other non-subscribed tables/databases in the cluster). Now, as far as I understand, MySQL Debezium connector (or any CDC connector) reads the binlog files, filters for the records pertaining to the subscribed table and writes those records to, say, Kafka. MySQL doesn't notify the client (in this case the connector) of changes to the subscribed tables. So the connector shouldn't need a heartbeat. Even if there's no activity in the table, the connector should still read the binlog files, find that there's no activity, write nothing to Kafka and commit till when it has read. Why is the heartbeat mechanism required for MySQL CDC connectors? I am sure there is a gap in my understanding of how MySQL CDC connectors work. It would be great if someone could point out what I am missing.

1luioth,Applying from daughter company to parent company - bad move or not,areeba_k84,dataengineering,"So I work as the only data engineer at a small game studio. Our parent company is a much bigger group with a central data team. I regularly work with their engineers, and they seem to like what I do — they even treat me like I’m a senior dev.The problem is, since I’m the only data person at my company, I don’t get to collaborate with anyone or learn from more experienced engineers. It’s pretty stagnant.Now, the parent company is hiring for their data team, and I’d love to apply — finally work with a proper team, grow, etc. But a friend told me it might be a bad move. His reasoning:•They might hire me but still keep me working on the same stuff at the studio•They could reject me because taking me would leave the studio without a data engineer•Worst case, they might tell my current company that I’m trying to leave. Ideally I shouldn’t expose that I would like to leave.However, I wanted to apply because their data team is a big team of senior and mid level developers . They use tools that I’ve been wanting to work with.

1lrmko8,Kafka stream through snowflake sink connector and batch load process parallelly on same snowflake table,nimble_thumb_,dataengineering,"Hi Folks,Need some advice on below process. Wanted to know if anybody has encountered this weird behaviour snowflake.Scenario 1 :- The Kafka Streamwe have a kafka stream running on a snowflake permanent table, which runs a put command to upload the csv files to table stage and then runs a copy command which unloads the data into the table. And then a RM command to remove the files from table stage.order of execution :- PUT to table\_1 stage >> copy to table\_1 >> RM to remove table\_1 stage file.All the above mentioned steps are handled by kafka of course :)And as expected this runs fine, no rows missed during the process. Scenario 2:- The batch loadSometimes we need to do i batch load onto the same table, just in case of the kafka stream failure.we have a custom application to select and send out the batch file for loading. But below is the over all process via our custom application.Put file to snowflake named stage >> copy command to unload the file to table\_1.Note :- in our scenario we want to load batch data into the same table where the kafka stream is running. This batch load process only works fine when the kafka stream is turned off on the table. All the rows from the files gets loaded fine.But here is the catch, once the kafka stream is turned on the table, if we try to load the batch file it doesnt just load at all.I have checked the query history and copy history.And found out another weird behaviour. It says the copy command has been run successfully and loaded around 1800 records into the table. But the file that we had uploaded had 57k. Even though it says it had loaded 1800 rows, those rows are nowhere to be found in the table. Has anyone encountered this issue? I know the stream and batch load process are not ideal. But i dont understand this behaviour of snowflake.

1lt6qlc,How do you actually code??,Godevil4716,learnprogramming,"I'm currently in my third year of engineering, and to be honest, I haven’t done much in the past two years besides watching countless roadmap videos and trying to understand what's trending in the tech market. Now that I’ve entered my third year, I’ve decided to aim for a Java Full Stack Developer role. I know it’s a heavy-duty role, but I want to keep it as my goal even if I don't fully achieve it, at least I’ll be moving in a clear direction.Here’s the issue I’ve been facing: whenever I watch a YouTube video of someone building an end-to-end project, I expect to learn something valuable. But then I see that the actual learning requires following a long playlist. Theoretically, the concepts make sense I understand the data flow and architecture. But when I get to the implementation, especially the backend, everything becomes overwhelming.There are all these annotations, unfamiliar syntax, and configurations that feel like they just magically work and I have no clue why or how. I end up copying the code just to make it work, but in the end, I realize I’ve understood very little. It feels more like rote copying than actual learning.Truthfully, I feel lost during this process. The complexity of the syntax and the lack of clarity around what’s happening behind the scenes demotivates me.So, here’s what I really want to understand: how do people actually “learn” a tech stack or anything new in tech?Do they just copy someone else's project (like I’m doing) and somehow that’s enough to add it to their resume? I’ve watched so many roadmaps that I know the general advice—pick a language, choose a framework, build projects—but when it comes to actual implementation, I feel like without that tutorial in front of me, I wouldn’t be able to write a single line of meaningful logic on my own.Is this really how someone LEARNS in a IT Tech Industry?Just by watching playlist and rote copying?",174,0.91,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lt6qlc/how_do_you_actually_code/,2025-07-06 17:23:55,2025-07-09 01:46:52

So many properties, methods, constructors, inheritance, mixins, parameters, and I’m like:""Wait… what do I actually need to look at right now?""I often just search for what I need in the moment, but then I get this weird FOMO (fear of missing out), like maybe I’m ignoring something really useful that I’ll need later.At the same time, reading everything seems impossible and draining.So I wanted to ask:How do you personally approach big documentation pages?Do you just read what’s relevant now?Do you take time to explore what else a class can do, even if you don’t need it yet?And if yes, how do you remember or organize what you saw for later?I guess I just feel like I should ""know everything"" and that pressure gets overwhelming.

1ls1kp8,Friendly advice to beginners: Stop obsessing over languages and start viewing them as tools.,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"I was also guilty of this when I started 3 years ago. I wanted to learn everything, because everything seemed so cool. My main goal was Backend development but I ended up starting courses on Kotlin, Go, Rust, Java, Python and Lua. I didn't see these languages as tools but as personalities, and that's a big mistake I made aswell as a lot of other beginners. Very often I'd find myself asking questions like ""How many languages should I learn?"", ""Is Java, JavaScript and Python a good stack for backend development?"", but I'd still be learning JS arrays in codecademy with only 3 projects in my directory.The answer to all those questions, in my opinion is, it does not matter. Programming != coding, so it doesn't matter how many languages you learn, the thing you should be mainly focused is learning how to solve problems using the syntax. Learn to solve problems with what you have, THAT is the important piece in my opinion.Why I think it's important that many beginners grow out of this phase ASAP: 1. When you start to view languages as what they are, you start to appreciate more what you use. In my case, I don't find JavaScript to be the most charming language, but I love it's rich ecosystem and the fact that I can use it for pretty much anything I want to do. 2. You risk burning yourself out. This was me three years ago. I had 5 courses on different languages and it polluted my mind with information that I KNEW deep down was completely useless to me in the long run. You could argue that I was getting to see new paradigms and techniques to solving problems, but that wasn't even true. I never made it far enough into ANY course to learn anything that I hadn't seen in JavaScript. It was a waste of time and it lead to me burning out and losing interest, until recently that I finally got back into programming. 3. You stop thinking and you start doing. When I finally got back into coding recently with better learning habits I started learning and creating projects faster than ever before. Because I wasn't focused on ""Hmmm, maybe I should try out Scala!"", no I was focused on ""What other Data Structures should I learn to implement?"", ""How do I solve this bug?"", ""What should be my next project?"". When you start seeing languages as tools, you'll want to use those tools.In conclusion, this is not to say that you shouldn't be curious and you shouldn't ask questions and you shouldn't experiment and you should just stick to one thing and never explore. What I'm trying to say is that, a lot of the time, beginners are so excited to learn that they forget WHY they're learning. Which is to get a job, to be successful, to create something meaningful, to be good at a hobby, etc.. And I feel like if you don't focus on creating and learning and solving, and you're always thinking about what's the future and not the present, then you'll just risk burning yourself out. There are tons of roadmaps out there for whatever you want to build, stick with it or tweak it a little along the way. But don't start a course on Python today and then tomorrow it's SQL and then the next day is HTML and CSS, no. Stick to what you want to do, once you understand the core concepts and programming as a whole, everything else will follow and everything after that will be easier to learn.",131,0.96,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ls1kp8/friendly_advice_to_beginners_stop_obsessing_over/,2025-07-05 04:35:27,2025-07-09 01:46:52

1lum9ro,I feel completely lost. Any advice appreciated.,mustard_mind,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, I’m writing this because I feel like I’m hitting a wall, and I don’t know what to do anymore.I am a career shifter and currently unemployed. I’ve studied 169 hours in the last 6 weeks. That’s nearly 30 hours a week of solo learning. I was motivated, consistent, and determined. I finished Angela Yu’s Python course and felt proud of myself. I even pushed into more advanced topics like data science, Python scripting, Leetcode, OOP, and I bought a cybersecurity course too.But now? I feel completely lost. I don’t know what to focus on anymore. The worst part is: I actually know what I want, I love data science. I enjoy exploring it, building things, and seeing the insights come to life. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel like I don’t have a real future in it because I’ve always struggled with math, and that makes me doubt myself. (Right now, I’m not even struggling with the math yet. It’s mostly basic stuff so far. But I keep worrying about the more advanced math that’s coming, and that fear holds me back before I even get there.)I also love Python. I genuinely enjoy writing code and want to keep going with it. But we all know that just knowing Python isn’t enough anymore especially with how fast AI is changing the game. That’s what led me to consider cybersecurity, thinking it might be a more stable and future-proof path.But deep down, I feel like I’ve already found what I want to do. And the idea of abandoning data science just because it’s hard or because I’m scared I won’t be good enough, feels really painful. Like I’m betraying something I actually care about, just to play it safe.I’ve also been: Tracking all my hours in Notion (which now just feels like pressure), Sleeping poorly (constant programming dreams, multiple wake-ups), Eating badly (2 months of junk and no routine).I thought I was making progress, but lately I just feel stuck.

1lrih6t,Getting back into programming after 15 years,thinkfast37,learnprogramming,"I was a Java programmer with a solid knowledge of SQL from 2000 till about 2010 before I moved into management roles. I also wrote two books on SQL back around Y2K. When I joined my current company I was actually hoping to get to be more hands on again, but the reality was my role didn't call for it... until now. Our new CTO wants dev managers to be more ""player coaches"". So I am actually pretty keen about learning my stack which is primarily node.js, react and postgres based and API standards are important.So my question is how best to efficiently learn the stack in 2025. I will need to learn syntax, and I will need to learn mechanisms that I have not worked with before, eg: promises - as asynchronous programming was not prevalent when I was a programmer. Back in the day, I learned very well reading good books - I remember a book about Java by Ivor Horton from WROX that I read back to front in a matter of days. But I wouldn't say all books were of that level. I even read all the IBM books on DB2 to learn the product and become strong on databases.Over the years I have dabbled with Udemy courses, but I find them far too inefficient to consume in video format in comparison to reading. I did learn some concepts in React and Typescript syntax, but I never completed the courses because frankly they wouldn't have benefited my role at the time and I haven't really coded for fun in some time.I also tried an ACM membership where I got access to some Safari books as well as well as Pluralsight courses which were better I found than Udemy - but lacked much one the node.js front (perhaps limited by the ACM offering). The Safari books were ok, but not necessarily that well written.I'm looking for what is likely to be the best path forward for me.

I understand its probably not great long term, but I'm just simply using it to guide, but I'm also relying on other documentation and other sources online beyond a baseline ""Try and do this, maybe try and implement this and go in this general direction""But anyway, the suggestion it gave me was a program that checks whether a number is odd or even. My first iteration was made because I didn't read what it was supposed to be and ended up making a program that had a list of preset numbers, picked a random number from that list and checked if it was even or odd.Since I realized that wasn't what I was 'supposed' to do, I actually realized what I should have done and made this.What it's intended to do is request a valid positive integer, and check if its even or odd. It ignores any negative integers, any numbers 'too larger' (which I added simply to continue learning new stuff), and anything that isn't a number.It also gives you 3 tries to input a valid integer before closing after too many tries. I also made it so the ""attempts remaining"" will either say ""attempts"" or ""attempt"" based on whether you have multiple attempts left, or only 1 attempt remaining.And this works exactly as intended on the user side. I may be overthinking this, but I was wondering if there was a way to optimize it or make it more 'efficient' when checking if the number is less than 0 or if the number is too large. Even though it works exactly as intended, I was wondering if this code was 'bad' even though it works. I don't want to develop any bad coding habits or make things longer/harder than they need to be. from time import sleep max_attempts = 3 #Total attempts allowed. attempts = 0 #Attempt starting value. number = None print('This program checks if a number is even or odd.') #Welcomes the user. while attempts < max_attempts:     try:         number = int(input('Enter a valid non-negative integer: '))         if number < 0:             attempts += 1             remaining = max_attempts-attempts ##Defines remaining as maximum attempts minus wrong attempts             if attempts < max_attempts:                 print(f""Invalid input!

1ltf54g,Recommendation for newbies (from a newbie),flrslva,learnprogramming,"Write your own labs (or whatever you want from scratch) It's helped me a ton. A lot of my coding assignments are pre written with #include's, main(), return0; and are extremely guided. It feels more like I'm drawing on a tracing table or bowling with bumpers than actually learning to code.The labs will tell you you need x ,y, and z. Then you type x, y, and z. Then you run it. Wow it works. But I don't always really know why it works. Why? That's more important.What I started doing was writing the assignment down and figuring out for myself what I need to write the program. If things don't run I'll check my notes, search geeksforgeeks, stack overflow etc, DONT READ THE AI OVERVIEW! That code was even more confusing. Get in the habit of reading things. Im in a C++ class so cppreference is a good source too.You'll make mistakes. You need that. Thats how you become a better programmer. I finally understood the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value parameters in functions because I had to fix my bad code. Then I could really understand what the books where saying.Side note. Grow your simple programs into something complex. I wrote a small inventory program when we were learning about loops and then I forgot about it. I picked it up again and I moved the code into a function. Then the next version I separated the function into two. A reading function and printing function. The next version will use a class and objects. Your program gets an upgrade. And leave yourself notes on what you want to add or change to your program. Another thing that helps too. It's on my GitHub if anyone wants to see. Nothing amazing but I'm proud.You do all the thinking. Thats a real test.

I think I am decent at figuring how to reach a goal someone else gave me. But I realised I have no clue how to use what I write outside of the pressing ""run"" in the IDE. Best example: I wanna make a mp3 out of Pi zero. I already done python youtube downloader a while ago. But when I want to run it, I go into PyCharm, press run, paste the link into the terminal and it works. But now I want to make a bash sctipt that I will call with alias + the link and I want the bash script to use the python code and then send the sound file into the Pi. But... How do I use the python code passivly? Aka how do I input the link from outside? how do I run it?

1lunw3f,What exactly is the difference between running a client with LiveServer vs something like Express?,Wooden_Artichoke_383,learnprogramming,"I'm getting into frontend development and managed to get a working client using only HTML, JS and CSS. I have a working backend and try to make a client for it to interact with it.Based on my understanding, you can use JS to manipulate the ""DOM"" (a tree) and create new HTML elements on the fly. My client creates new content based on user interaction and server responses. A real ""page"" does not exist, the content is just a ""div"" and gives the illusion of having pages by just making the previous div vanish and rendering the new one, so: document.body.replaceChild(container, body.firstChild)Where `container`, is just a div containing everything I want to show. The client initially loads with a login page (container), if the user clicks on the register button, it loads the register page (container) and so on.Note: Before I used `innerHTML` Instead but still unsure if you're supposed to use that or not, so I refactored my whole code to create the HTML from JS, without having HTML typed out as strings anywhere. Some argue that it is faster because no string parsing but I haven't measured it yet, so unsure about that one.I use the VSCode's LiveServer extension to run all of this. You can also uploud these files onto Netlify and deploy it.My question: Many tutorials use Express to do some initial setup and run the client with it. So what I did with LiveServer, they do with npm and Express. Is that the 'correct' approach for frontend development? I.e., you should always use npm and Express when trying to make a frontend using vanilla JavaScript?Currently I got into routing and realized that it is trickier without the Express setup.

1ltzfv5,Requesting Advice for Personal Project - Scaling to DevOps,C3LM3R,learnprogramming,"(X-Post from /r/DevOps, IDK if this is an ok place to ask this advice) TL;DR - I've built something on my own server, and could use a vector-check if what I believe my dev roadmap looks like makes sense. Is this a 'pretty good order' to do things, and is there anything I'm forgetting/don't know about.---------------------------------Hey all,I've never done anything in a commercial environment, but I do know there is difference between what's hacked together at home and what good industry code/practices should look like. In that vein, I'm going along the best I can, teaching myself and trying to design a personal project of mine according to industry best practices as I interpret what I find via the web and other github projects. Currently, in my own time I've setup an Ubuntu server on an old laptop I have (with SSH config'd for remote work from anywhere), and have designed a web-app using python, flask, nginx, gunicorn, and postgreSQL (with basic HTML/CSS), using Gitlab for version control (updating via branches, and when it's good, merging to master with a local CI/CD runner already configured and working), and weekly DB backups to an S3 bucket, and it's secured/exposed to the internet through my personal router with duckDNS. I've containerized everything, and it all comes up and down seamlessly with docker-compose.The advice I could really use is if everything that follows seems like a cohesive roadmap of things to implement/develop:Currently my database is empty, but the real thing I want to build next will involve populating it with data from API calls to various other websites/servers based on user inputs and automated scraping.Currently, it only operates off HTTP and not HTTPS yet because my understanding is I can't associate an HTTPS certificate with my personal server since I go through my router IP. I do already have a website URL registered with Cloudflare, and I'll put it there (with a valid cert) after I finish a little more of my dev roadmap.Next I want to transition to a Dev/Test/Prod pipeline using GitLab. Obviously the environment I've been working off has been exclusively Dev, but the goal is doing a DevEnv push which then triggers moving the code to a TestEnv to do the following testing:Unit, Integration, Regression, Acceptance, Performance, Security, End-to-End, and Smoke.**Is there anything I'm forgetting?**My understanding is a good choice for this is using pytest, and results displayed via allure.**Should I also setup a Staging Env for DAST before prod?**If everything passes TestEnv, it then either goes to StagingEnv for the next set of tests, or is primed for manual release to ProdEnv.**In terms of best practices, should I .gitlab-ci.yml to automatically spin up a new development container whenever a new branch is created?**My understanding is this is how dev is done with teams.Also, Im guessing theres ""always"" (at least) one DevEnv running obviously for development, and only one ProdEnv running, but should a TestEnv always be running too, or does this only get spun up when there's a push?**And since everything is (currently) running off my personal server, should I just separate each env via individual .env.dev, .env.test, and .env.prod files that swap up the ports/secrets/vars/etc... used for each?**Eventually when I move to cloud, I'm guessing the ports can stay the same, and instead I'll go off IP addresses advertised during creation. When I do move to the cloud (AWS), the plan is terraform (which I'm already kinda familiar with) to spin up the resources (via gitlab-ci) to load the containers onto. Then I'm guessing environment separation is done via IP addresses (advertised during creation), and not ports anymore. I am aware there's a whole other batch of skills to learn regarding roles/permissions/AWS Services (alerts/cloudwatch/cloudtrails/cost monitoring/etc...) in this, maybe some AWS certs (Solutions Architect > DevOps Pro)I also plan on migrating everything to kubernetes, and manage the spin up and deployment via helm charts into the cloud, and get into load balancing, with a canary instance and blue/green rolling deployments. I've done some preliminary messing around with minikube, but will probably also use this time to dive into CKA also.I know this is a lot of time and work ahead of me, but I wanted to ask those of you with real skin-in-the-game if this looks like a solid gameplan moving forward, or you have any advice/recommendations.",4,0.75,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ltzfv5/requesting_advice_for_personal_project_scaling_to/,2025-07-07 16:55:24,2025-07-09 01:46:52

1lv2p3y,F*ck the open office concept. All of you with cubicle offices are so lucky.,ContainerDesk,cscareerquestions,"The open office is trash. It's loud, too bright, no privacy at all, you can smell someone farting/not showered 30 feet away, someone is always looking at you etc.We were scammed out of cubicles starting in the 2010s. This is all started because the stupid hipster crowd 15 years ago didn't want to work in cubicles and thought it was cool to have open offices with exposed ceilings because it was ""Think Different"". They thought cubicles meant corporate dystopia. Then tech companies capitalized on these mocha drinking edgy new generation kids and realized how much they could save if they removed cubicles from the office entirely.The thought of cubicles wasn't cool and appeared dreadful back in the day when really the cubicle is the superior office choice, especially those old 90s cubicles that built like tanks. Cubicle offices are more peaceful, you have privacy, personalization, if someone farts it's not that bad and you have somewhat personal space. The office would x100 more pleasant if we brought back 90s cubicles with drop ceiling tiles.These are the same people that popularized those trendy garbage $30 burger joints that have metal worn out bar stools, nasty overpriced small town beers you've never heard of and a purposely poorly lit rustic brick wall atmosphere that is run by a bald guy with a handlebar mustache and when you order, he turns an iPad around that auto-selects 25% tip.",736,0.94,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lv2p3y/fck_the_open_office_concept_all_of_you_with/,2025-07-08 22:43:44,2025-07-09 01:46:53

A lot of them are socially awkward or really into anime and etc., and it makes it hard to connect. I feel like an outsider even though I’m in the same field. There’s no real teamwork or sense of belonging, just people working in silos and making small talk about stuff I can’t relate to.Lately, I’ve even been thinking about going back to school, but I have no idea what I’d study or what path would actually feel worth it.

It takes proactive decisions in the present, to avoid extreme amounts of technical debt in the future. Decisions made today have vast repercussions on outcomes several months and years from now.This shortsightedness of CEOs is a joke.

1lpza2y,Quit after two weeks at new job. How much did I overreact and how stupid was it?,cherryplusplus,cscareerquestions,"~4 YOE. Took up a new job for a new change of pace. I did screw myself because this new role wasn't paying that much more than my previous role and the commute was significantly worse, but I was already sort of burned out by my old place so I thought anything would be a nice change of pace.Fast forward one and half weeks in. A few things struck to me as red flags -* Lack of process (No testing, extremely badly defined scopes and tickets, a non-existent onboarding experience, rubber-stamping PR's and sending it almost straight to production.)* Every employee aside from the founders/management had been working here for around a year or less despite the company having been around for the past 7 years or so.* Talks about overtime as if it was something to be expected.* Their estimations were in my opinion, kind of whack. A lot of the work that would've obviously taken far more effort were given 2 points (in their own parlance, should take up a quarter of a day). For example, I was given a task that was a 2 point (So expected to be completed within a quarter of a day.) that involved rewriting a few components from scratch and new endpoints and it wasn't until halfway that I started working on this ticket that I was informed by my manager that it was actually linked to another set of UI changes (Involving overhauling a page and several other elements) that were completely outside the scope of the ticket. This was considered an additional 4 points (One day in their parlance) and I was expected to complete all of those within a quarter of a day.There might've been some disorganization but I was ready to understand, but what broke the straw on the camel's back was this following interaction that I had.After spending three hours glued to my screen working, I took a minute or two break just to check on my phone. It was lunch time and there were already co-workers actively having lunch and discussing about their lunch. I typically don't take a lunch break, so I tend to prefer to use this time just to check up on things on my phone.I was given a warning for using my phone for ""non-productive reasons"" and that I needed to give all of my attention and focus onto productivity during work hours. This was followed by another warning from another member of management. Essentially two people. (With heavy irony that the person giving me the warning was also on his phone in between waiting for things to load.)Followed by a e-mail where the entire team was CC'ed, singling me out that I did not fall into their expectations for focus and productivity with possible escalation to the CEO.Consider this a vent or a plead for affirmation, but was it just me or did this behaviour come across as total overreach? Either way, I've decided that my way of working is clearly not aligned with the company's expectations and I immediately resigned on the spot. Yes, I know that the market is bad and this may have been an overreaction on my part, but would anyone of you have done the same?",261,0.95,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lpza2y/quit_after_two_weeks_at_new_job_how_much_did_i/,2025-07-02 15:46:09,2025-07-09 01:46:53

1lqinft,"After 7 months of searching, I got a job! (lots of details below)",Any-Platypus-3570,cscareerquestions,"**Intro.**I wanted to share my experience job searching and then finally getting a job. I worked at my first full-time software engineering job for 3 years and then got laid off in late 2024. I thought it would be fairly easy to find my next job since I had 3 years of experience and even a master's degree. But it was much more difficult than I expected.**Story time.**At first I only applied to big tech. I even got to a final round big tech interview but the system design round went poorly and I did not receive an offer. After that I gradually ramped up the number of applications and widened my search. I'm mid-level but I was applying to junior as well as senior roles that fit my background.Over the first three months (Q1 2025) I got very few positive responses. In March I started applying more consistently, about 8 applications per day, and in mid April I ramped it up to about 25 per day. In May and June I started to get many more recruiter calls and interviews. At this point, every week I would have about four of them.After five months in I got close to the end with two different companies. But both ended up turning me down. Then finally, on a Tuesday I got an offer but it was with an early stage startup that couldn't offer much compensation. Like it wasn't just low for a software engineer, it was low for anybody. I happened to be interviewing with another company that same week, so I told them about my pending offer. They quickly scheduled my remaining interviews, which happened to all go well, and by Friday I received a much better offer from them. I took it.I feel incredibly fortunate because after seven months of searching I would have reluctantly taken a far worse offer, but the offer I got was very good.**Where I applied.**About 50% of my applications were on LinkedIn. The rest were company websites, Indeed, Built In, ZipRecruiter, and Handshake. Handshake is where I found my next job.**The numbers.**Now for the numbers... oh boy. In total I applied to 1892 jobs. I had 15 recruiter calls and 24 technical interviews, and approximately 12 online or take-home assessments. I made some charts: [applications](https://ibb.co/Q43YDS5), [interviews](https://ibb.co/pj79D3rY), [sankey\_diagram](https://ibb.co/Z61yDj5m).**Advice.**Over the months, I improved my resume but I wish I had done that sooner. I didn't used to have a ""Skills"" section but I added one and I think this helped. Recruiters are often just looking for key words.Don't give up. It was agonizing to search for seven months. And I know many of you have been searching for much longer. Something will come around. It's not you, it's the job market. You can get a thousand rejections but one offer, and that one offer is all that matters.I spent my free time working on a couple side projects and improving some skills, which I'm glad I did. I also spent more time with my friends and got more involved with my community through volunteering, which I'm also glad I did.

1lqcjbe,"Got a software engineering job, but don't want to program anymore",baboy4444,cscareerquestions,"**Overview**About 7 months ago, I got a job as a software engineer at a great company straight out of college. For the most part, I like my job. I really can't complain, but I just wanted to get other people's perspective. **Context**I went to school for programming because I loved it. My passion was mainly in embedded systems. During college, I was lucky enough to get a position as a research engineer on a research program, and got to write the firmware for a very small satellite. I truly loved it. During this period, I submitted hundreds of job applications that went nowhere. I ended up getting my current job from a connection I made during college.Don't get me wrong, I like my current job. I am not complaining in the slightest, I fully understand how lucky and privileged I am to be in my current position, and I don't take that for granted. I went through the job struggle like many others have. I even followed this sub, and almost lost hope because of it :( **Question**In my current position, I write Python microservices for a very large company. It can be interesting. Most importantly though, I couldn't be happier with my coworkers. They have taught me so much, and I genuinely like working with them. However, I've found that my passion for programming has started to fade away. My day job is very far away from embedded systems, which as I mentioned before, is what I am passionate about. But when I get home, and even on the weekends, I just don't have it in me anymore to bust out the Arduino or STM32 board and do a side project. I used to love doing that stuff. It was my hobby, and I was good at it. That being said, I realize that it is in part what got me my current job. But, I can't help but be a little sad that I no longer have the energy, or passion, to start side projects like I used to. It is especially frustrating because I finally have the skills to do truly *cool* projects, but I just don't feel like it anymore. **Conclusion**Again, this is just to get other software engineers' perspective. Have any of you experienced anything similar? How do you get around this? I really *want* to keep doing side projects, but just don't have the motivation anymore now that I write code 40+ hours a week. **TLDR**Got a full time programming job. Don't have motivation to do side projects anymore. Makes me sad.

The second was about my PhD, they verified the degree but had different dates that were longer than the actual time I was there.The final thing was about a part time teaching assistant job I had in undergrad, which I did for 3 years, they said I only did it for 8 months.They didn’t ask me for additional evidence, I do have paystubs, transcripts, and W2 forms ,and just sent it to the company directly!

Should I stay?",HEXXIIN,cscareerquestions,"I’m a frontend intern (student, studying software engineering) who started a 6 month internship about 3 weeks ago. When I accepted the role, I was told I’d be supporting a frontend team. Turns out there is no frontend team. I’m the only one doing frontend work. There’s no guidance, mentorship, or feedback structure in place.They’re using Flask on the backend, and I was tasked with choosing the entire frontend stack myself. I picked React (which I think makes sense given the decoupled backend). But my manager (a backend engineer with no real frontend experience) asked why I didn’t pick something like Next.js or Remix, which really confused me. those are fullstack frameworks meant to handle routing/backend stuff too, so they don’t integrate cleanly with Flask. It felt like a question meant to sound smart but showed a lack of understanding of frontend fundamentals. HE asks a lot of questions like this and they are not framed in a ""learning check"" way. And as an intern, i don't know what i don't know, so i don't know his questions are dumb until i get sent on a goose chase trying to figure out what he asked me.On top of that:* I was expected to write the entire implementation plan for the frontend build* I was then told to break that down into Git issues. Again, with zero feedback or validation* I don’t get code reviews unless I chase them for days. I asked for one, put it in every standup, pinged my manager directly, and was ignored for 4 days. When I followed up, he flipped it on me and said I should’ve pinged sooner. Why is he not checking in on me anyways???* I feel like I’m just being left to figure it out, and every question he asks sends me down weird rabbit holes because he doesn’t actually understand the frontendI’m questioning whether this internship is helping or hurting me. I’m not learning much, second guessing my decisions, and wondering if I’m even doing things right. There’s no one to ask. And the questions he does ask me show he clearly lacks an understanding of what front end even is.Should I stick it out or leave? I feel like this is stunting my growth more than helping it, but I’m only 3 weeks in. I don’t want to look bad on my resume, but I also don’t want to waste 6 months. I was thinking of staying until around week 5 or 6 to make it look less abrupt, then stepping away professionally. I feel like I can learn more spending the time I am on this internship doing something more educational. Its paid (not well. min wage in my area) but I am not in need of money as my husband comfortably supports me full time. My husbands default answer is to bounce. He says he'd rather me do nothing than keep going in this, which I am thankful for his undying support but he doesn't know tech at all.Anyone else been in a situation like this?

1lriuft,Developer wants to break into PM - How much should I fake?,sakramentoo,cscareerquestions,"Hi folks. I need your advice. I'm a front-end developer, ux-designer and startup founder who wants to become a product manager. I'm struggling to decide how I want to sell myself during interviews and on my CV. These are the points I'm struggling with:* I'm introverted, love to listen and ask a lot of questions. I have the feeling PMs are expected to be extroverted and spew out energy - especially during an interview. Should I fake it? * If I don't know something I say it. I feel like these days everybody is looking for the perfect candidate. “You don't know x or y? Next!” At least this is how it goes for dev roles. Should I pretend to know everything and wing it? (this question applies to resumes, too) * I am humble and quite frankly I should be because neither have I founded a million dollar company nor worked in big tech yet. To me it seems like during the interview phase you have to present yourself like you are the big shit and exaggerate everything you have done. Because this is exactly what everybody else does. At least for dev roles there are programming tests that show real skills. Should I exaggerate my past successes?* I don't like to throw around buzzwords. To me they hide too much meaning and If you truly understand something you can say it in a way everybody understands. But I have had experiences working with PMs who used buzzwords constantly and half the time what they said made no sense to us developers. But I get the feeling that they passed the interview and got the job at my company because they used them. How do recruiters tell if a PM “knows his stuff”? Should I use buzzwords to sound competent in an interview? * I have taken a bit of a detour in my life and focused on art/writing for 2 years. This is a gap between my first developer jobs and my last developer jobsTo me this seems like a no go to recruiters. (please tell me if I'm wrong). Companies would rather hire somebody with the perfect CV than a person who seems “real”. Should I cut that part out of my CV or own it? I hope this kind of question is acceptable in this sub.

If you’re struggling, you’re not alone",DepresionSonriente,cscareerquestions,"3 internships, 3 projects (currently working on one), student dev orgs, BS in CS, valuable tech stacks. Revamped resume a million times. I've tried every method to get my experience noticed. Sending in many applications, building my network, tweaking resumes to fit job descriptions, mock interviews, applying to jobs within hours of being posted, attempting to contact recruiters + hiring managers, IDK it's been over a year, so I've definitely tried whatever the ""meta"" advice from LinkedIn and Reddit was. Yet it all feels useless in this current time. Makes me wonder if my school's ranking has been my limiter.I know other people are going through very similar things, yet when someone vents about their struggles on this Subreddit, it's experienced devs currently in the industry regurgitating LinkedIn advice that many of us have tried with no results. In fact, they start to just assume things about the poster and call them a doomer, when all they want to do is be heard. I do agree that some posts are outlandish, and the poster has a poorly written resume or something, but there are many of us who just want to be encouraged to keep going, or receive advice + reality checks of the current market that will actually help us calculate next steps. I try to scroll this Subreddit every day to see if there's encouragement or good advice, but a lot of it is really just putting hard and smart workers looking to just get an opportunity down for not being hardworking or smart enough. Idk, the more that I keep going with no results, the more I feel helpless. At least I want to build / look for a community that can support each other's struggles during these tough times. However, I do understand that many devs who are already in the industry are annoyed by the helpless and doomer posts.

Recently I've been put in more of a leadership role where I have to manage delivery for a team of 5, now 8 as of this week, engineers and 3 QE.While I think I'm getting better at it, it also feels like there's never enough time to do all the things I need to do. I'm in meetings 6 hours a day, have to achieve increasingly difficult timelines, need to plan ahead for upcoming sprints and further on the roadmap, make sure capacity is being fully utilized, parallelize as much of the work as possible, help the developers grow, unblock them, provide technical leadership, accelerate them to meet deadlines, provide feedback to their managers, etc.Run on sentence is intended, but the main idea is that I'm overwhelmed with all that I'm responsible for. I have a project manager type person to support me, and recently we've had a more productive relationship in a way that they manage the backlog in Jira independently after we've scoped out the work and what can be done in parallel. They've started using ChatGPT to initially populate the details and we later review each of the stories when it's closer to the time someone needs to pickup the work. I have trouble gauging when my engineers are underperforming, or if I haven't provided enough support. I'm use to holding myself to my own standards, but I also feel like it's not fair to hold others to my own standards, because while they work for me and my personality, I feel like it's too high of a bar to force on others unless they opt in.I continually think about just leaving and being an IC somewhere else, but I also feel like 30 years from now I wont want to be an IC due to the changing landscape of the CS world.I think what I'm looking for is advice on how others manage it. It feels like as soon as I got good at the engineering part, I don't spend nearly as much time engineering.

1ltuo8e,Computer Science Education for Devs without college?,LibertyEqualsLife,cscareerquestions,"I'm nearly 40, and have shifted careers several times. In my last role, I found that I enjoyed building tools for my marketing team using no-code options and some basic SQL, so I took a bootcamp to learn to code and explore that interest further. I've been working as a dev for about 5 years now(primarily RubyOnRails and simple Python micro-services), and have found myself in a more ""senior"" role for a small company, mostly due to a combination of my broader industry experience and familiarity with our core systems. The problem is that I recognize that I don't really have the depth of knowledge that would typically qualify me for a Senior Developer/Engineer role in other companies. I know our tech stack, but when I find myself in conversations about new system design, or just more technical concepts in general, I'm quickly in over my head compared to colleagues that have CS degrees, where software conversations seem to evolve into higher-order maths concepts that I've simply got no familiarity with, or understanding of. I've made it this far in life without obtaining even an associates degree, and I really have no interest in starting from the beginning on the path to a comp sci degree, but I feel like I would really benefit from a ""computer science crash course"" geared towards devs that could build a foundational knowledge base for system design.

However, my offer letter and onboarding portal were all for a Vancouver, BC role, even though I’m in the U.S. and have never held a Canadian status.Naturally, I got super confused because the onboarding materials all referenced Canadian work authorization, SIN numbers, and pathways for Canadian citizens, international students, etc. I emailed Amazon’s onboarding team asking for clarification, explaining that I’m a U.S. citizen with no Canadian status and no idea how to start the work permit process.I received a reply today and was told that I should have received a U.S. offer, not a Canadian one. Furthermore, the Vancouver offer is to be canceled, and a new U.S. offer was promised by “end of day.”However, it is now evening, and I still haven’t received the new offer.My original onboarding timeline mentioned a deadline of July 7th to accept the offer and complete a survey (which I completed, though with answers which apply to the Canada offer).The Vancouver offer has definitely been revoked, attempting to access the employment documents states that I do not have an account. Tomorrow is July 4th, then the weekend, and then July 7th is Monday. I’m scared some automated system might cancel my candidacy entirely if there’s no active offer in the system by the deadline.I’m not sure if there is anything I should do in the meantime. I have already replied to the email regarding the promised U.S. offer and am hesitant to contact further, given that I have already emailed 2x today. I just don’t want to let this slip through the cracks.Should I follow up again tomorrow or wait until Monday? Will Amazon’s systems actually auto-cancel an onboarding if there’s no active offer in place?Any advice is hugely appreciated.

1lt44j0,How to get out of being put into support role as a SWE?,fishteam,cscareerquestions,"I joined a fairly large company (non-tech, although they are trying to make it otherwise) as a SWE along with a few hundred other new grads as part of a cohort. We didn't interview for a specific team and were basically placed semi-randomly onto teams that asked for SWEs.I ended up on a team that is primarily a support team. The team is mostly non-SWEs and at no point has there been any SWE on the team that didn't have the position as their first job out of college. About 60-70% of the team's day to day work consists of data remediation and other manual fixes (e.g. directly modifying data in databases) for errors caused by bugs in the systems we support. These bugs have existed the entire 2 years I've been here, and apparently longer, from what I've heard. The remainder of the work might be other random tasks geared towards facilitating the first function (e.g. writing up documentation on how to do a certain kind of fix, setting up alerting based off of logs).The only ""dev"" work that I end up doing is writing basic CRUD applications used only by our team that are hosted on on-premise servers (our team has no cloud budget so I have no experience building applications in the cloud). There's no opportunity to work on any large-scale, high traffic systems. I essentially haven't worked on anything more complex than my college work.Other people that were part of my cohort were placed on teams where they are on actual engineering teams and the work is a lot more interesting, so this is primarily a team placement issue, not necessarily a company issue. However, I've become painfully aware that my skills have been stagnating hard and I need to get out of this role ASAP. The only thing is I've been a ""software engineer"" for 2 years, but having to talk about what I've been doing in my current role makes it glaringly obvious that I was a SWE in name only.

I applied to openings in other cities, but the the number of openings were so little compared to the number of applicants so the competition was crazy, I couldn't get a job for about a year.Afterwards, I found a role as a teacher, so, I started teaching programming fundamentals and web development, I kept this job for 2 years, during which I tried applying to as much software development jobs as possible on LinkedIn and everywhere else, mainly looking for fully remote roles in the US or elsewhere.Then, I found a role at a startup as a paid intern, gotten through the interview and started work as a contractor.My initial contract was for 6 months, after that was over I signed a different contract for another 6 months, this time as a Jr. Software Developer. After this contract ended, they renewed it again as a Jr. Software Developer, but this time for 4 months, because the startup was failing. So, in total I worked as fully remote contractor for 1 year and 4 months.Then, I was jobless, I started looking for jobs again for about 6 months, then out of nowhere, the same employer from before got in touch with me and recommended me to a different startup looking for contractors. I happily accepted the offer and started work, the problem is, I wasn't even assigned a title in this new startup, I was a software developer, but I didn't know whether Jr, Mid? However, based on my own evaluation I still considered myself Jr.I was the only developer on the frontend team for this new startup, I was responsible of taking a full Figma design from scratch and implement it with React, I have to be honest I had to use a component library to get the job done, because the deadline was very close and everything was fast paced, there was no room for code refactoring, code quality, TBF I didn't even write tests! But, I ended up delivering in time, and after a couple of rounds of bug fixing, the client was happy.However, after about 8 months, I lost this job because the startup failed to secure funding again.Now, I feel a bit lost on where to move on from here. Getting a job for a US-based employer is very difficult, especially once they learn that I am based in Iraq.I have a couple of questions:1. Am I a dead cause? Is there still hope?

On one hand, it's a lot more than junior work like building specific features and testing them - it involves interviewing stakeholders, learning their needs, and figuring out how to translate that into features and how to design the software to be able to grow sustainably without having a team of other developers to lean on. On the other hand, for all I know it could be riddled with bad habits and blind spots.Most job postings with PhD qualifications are mid- to advanced-stage roles, but having not ""grown up"" in a ""professional"" team environment, I'm not sure I have the relevant experience to be able to head a team in a conventional, expected way. At the same time, while I personally don't have hang-ups about starting lower on the totem pole, I'm not sure if my experience and degree path would make me appear over-qualified for a more entry position? As in, over-qualified but under-skilled, so, pass and on to the next candidate.

1lttg8h,What are effective ways to transfer PhD and post industry research to industry?,emaxwell14141414,cscareerquestions,"When it comes to transferring from PhD and post PhD research in academic based institutions to industry based science, there's major discussion in terms of how everything from the pace of work to the lack of ability to ensure the best methods are being used and so on. So when it comes to adapting the skills obtained during a PhD and in me cases research assistantships past the PhD, and convincing others that you can transfer your skills, what works best?With some companies, particularly in this economic climate, they'll be looking for industry experience and that's it. It won't matter about published papers and successful projects. It won't matter if much of your research is in an applicable field such as data science. Side projects you've done independently may not even matter. It has to be experience in industry or it doesn't count. And often, it needs to be with the exact software tools, models and packages they use in addition.That said, I was wondering about what works when adapting your skills and also making the case to others about how you can do so. A primary option, I imagine, is being able to relate to them, for example how a paper and project you finished has implications that could assist them with their data handling, product development and so on. Or perhaps reaching out and explaining concisely how the skills you developed, even though they weren't directly in industry, could be applied to solve a problem they have.Are there methods and techniques similar to this that work?",6,0.99,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lttg8h/what_are_effective_ways_to_transfer_phd_and_post/,2025-07-07 12:55:47,2025-07-09 01:46:53
1ls65ow,Junior Developer Paradox: Finding Niche and Doing so in Wrong Time,TemporaryBaseball915,cscareerquestions,"Hello guys, I'm writing this because I recently (with full awareness) threw myself into what seems to be still waters, the junior developer job hunt. Now, this is not just another generic web dev (not my words, the vim/arch lovers' words) crying for help. No, no, and no! This is someone who found their ""niche"" but at the wrong time. Let me tell you what I mean.So, I recently graduated from a university in the U.S. During the time I was there, I fell in love with Machine Learning (and no, it's not because it's the trend). I found myself devoting my time to research, machine learning projects, doing competitions within the lab with other PhD or Masters students, etc. I was involved in the research for 2+ years for three different labs, I had the official title of ""Research Assistant"" as an undergrad for one of the labs where I was the sole engineer to develop end-to-end solution for running experiments on our university's super computer. I have published a paper in CVPR, and got the best paper award within the workshop that we've published.Now, my life had a solid plan, but due to everything changed in the states (I'm not gonna say why because I don't wanna take a one-way trip to Central America) I was forced to derail from that path. And now I am looking for a job. And man, doesn't it fucking suck. And this is where the paradox begins:**Paradox 1: ""X+ years of experience"" for recent graduate position**Let's start with the most common paradox. Now, the definition of ""experience"" differs from company to company, but what seems to be the common thing though, is that research doesn't count toward ""experience"". I know some of the undergrads who have somewhere around 1 year of experience due to things like internships or co-op (it's like internship in Canada but better), but for a lot of other students, this is going to be their first experience. Especially for someone like me who has experience but within the University, this sucks. What sucks even more, is that for a lot of international students, getting internship is very hard due to company having to justify as to why they're hiring an international student over a citizen with the same skill set. I was one of the victims of ""logistical rejection"" and that's kind of why I devoted more time within the University system because in it, it's an equal fight. Whoever has skills wins.**Paradox 2: Master's degree or PhD is required**This is especially true for machine learning engineer jobs, but the same thing can be applied to other jobs as well. Now, in my opinion, the difference between a bachelor's and master's is that if you're getting a bachelor's, what it says is you are someone who is capable of starting something small, and finish it. Maybe you have little bit of side project here and there, but nothing crazy. If you have a master's, what it says is that you can start and finish medium-sized projects, and you can also sometimes be a leader within the project as well. PhD is just matter of scaling up from master's. Now, this is what a degree ""generally"" says about you, because if you're an undergrad, companies don't expect you to develop a niche. But here's the thing, I did. I have a lot of experience in machine learning just like I said at the beginning, but company doesn't care about that because I am not a master's student. You have publications? Doesn't matter, you're an undergrad. You developed a deep learning model by yourself? Doesn't matter, you don't have a master's.Now, for those who just thought to yourself ""just get a master's bro"", here's paradox 3. **Paradox 3: I ain't got no money like that** This might be surprising for some of you but there are people who genuinely don't have money. And surprise, surprise, I don't have money. I want to work in industry to save money to go back to a master's program, but if I want to look for a job paradox 1 and paradox 2 appear, but if I want to get a master's, I need money first to even go there in the first place. And yes scholarship is a thing and definitely helps, but I need full-ride scholarship if I want to go, but those opportunities don't easily come around.**Paradox 4: Connection matters**Now, I'm not saying this statement is the paradox, but what I hear from people who are already in the system is a paradox. When I talk about these things to people who have already established themselves, they oftentimes say ""It's not about degree"" or ""If you can show that you have the skill, that's all we care about"". Now, as an engineer, they are right. It is not about degree, as long as you have the skills. But, at the same time they are not the one who is looking at my resume, it's the HR or sometime LLMs. Now I don't have the ""experience"" so I don't know how companies work, but should engineers hire another engineer? Or I guess they don't have the time so HR exists? I don't know.**Paradox 5: It's a tough time right now**For like 4 years it has been a tough time, bro. Damn.**Paradox 6: Just find a generic soft dev job**This is usually what I get from people when I talk about these paradoxes. ""You know, the hardest part is to get your foot in the system. I think you should apply for a software engineering job first and go from there."" So I said ""bet"" and applied to a bunch (I mean a bunch) of software engineering jobs. But they all say no because I am too specialized in machine learning. Welp, wtf.These are the paradoxes that I can think of right now. And I know that I used the term ""paradox"" very loosely here, but I hope you can see my point of view. And with all the seriousness, this is why I say I found the niche at the wrong time. Because I slowly began to realize that I was going nowhere with my ML skills, because the world is not obligated to take time to see what each person is capable of. I get it, people just generally don't have time.And here comes the million dollar question: What do I do now then? I am stuck between these paradoxes and the walls around me are getting tighter and tighter. I really need help.Thanks guys for reading this far, and I really appreciate it.",4,0.59,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ls65ow/junior_developer_paradox_finding_niche_and_doing/,2025-07-05 09:42:59,2025-07-09 01:46:53

1lu3flt,Editing Work in a Professional Portfolio,ColesWork,cscareerquestions,"I'm a recent college grad (about a year out of college), and I've had a job working on social media edits for a local college. The work has been good for improving my skills in Adobe software (Premiere, After Effects, etc), but now that I'm looking to include some of it in my portfolio, I realize that most of my work is editing what other people have already created.What is the line for including editing work in a portfolio? Is it disingenuous to display work as mine that I only worked briefly on, or merely adapted for social media? I know that clarifying is the obvious solution, but when you're trying to sell yourself to employers, constantly noting that you didn't do the important work seems like a bad idea.",3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lu3flt/editing_work_in_a_professional_portfolio/,2025-07-07 19:25:36,2025-07-09 01:46:53
1ltzgxc,How to navigate on-call support rotation ?,Appropriate-Head4188,cscareerquestions,"I’m a fresh grad with 6 months of experience as an SWE. This is my first job after the university. My team started to put me as secondary support around 4 months after joining this company and as primary last month. I have to do this rotation every 4-5 weeks, but the junior developers end up doing more frequent rotations like every 3 weeks or so since the senior developers often get pulled into more critical feature development tickets. On-call in our team is hectic, we get multiple support tickets during the day which needs to addressed by the EOD and at the same time, we get alerts through Pager Duty which needs to be looked into right away. All these needs to be done by the primary support alone, and the secondary support is essentially just for the namesake. We have to cover at night as well, so it is essentially a 24/7 rotation of non-stop production issues. We get an average of 10-15 pages every day, with 2-3 at least every night. At just 6 months of experience, I’m expected to resolve all these tickets by myself with minimal guidance from the team. Needless to say, every rotation puts me in a miserable state, ending up physically and emotionally exhausted, so much so that I dread the next one. Are such on-call rotations common in this industry? How to avoid these in the future?",3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ltzgxc/how_to_navigate_oncall_support_rotation/,2025-07-07 16:56:31,2025-07-09 01:46:53
1ltbefz,What Exactly Is My Position As a US Citizen Who Has Spent My Entire Life in India and Now Pursuing CS As a Bachelor?,Infinite_Primary_918,cscareerquestions,"Hi guys, I'm (18M) a US citizen who has spent my entire life with family in India. We own no property or assets in America whatsoever, the only connection we have to the US is my citizenship. I've already been admitted to an American university and plan to attend there in pursuit of the CS major and perhaps a Business/Finance minor. My university does allow double majoring at no additional costs though. I realize that I'm a bit of an exceptional case here and more privileged in the sense that I don't have to deal with F1, H1B visa rat race at all. That said, on hearing the situation of the world, in particular the US, the job market seems extremely bad. My family lives on an Indian income and while the aid we got from my university was quite generous, we've still taken a federal loans from both the US and education loans from SBI, leasing one of the property homes that we have. This honestly puts a lot of pressure on me, like any other international student because India is all I've known and frankly I've never exceeded very well academically at all.I realize that my questions are a bit immature maybe, but I think I'd still like the opinions and discussions of people who are more knowledgeable about this than I am:* How hard do you think it'll be for people like me to find jobs/placements 4 years later when I graduate? * I've been hearing that the best way to succeed is to have connections, network and stuff. I've had very bad social skills my whole life, are there any tips or perhaps personal experiences that you think I might find helpful for someone starting from scratch?* If the job situation in the US is worse than it is in India, or well let's say I can't find a job in the US how likely it is that if I come back to family and start job hunting in India as an OCI Card Holder would give me difficulties? What should I expect? Is it recommended that I come back to India at all?* What are some contingency plans I should have? I'm not particularly passionate about anything, I chose CS because my entire family works there and so having their help would be nice, plus hearing them talk about their job and interest for it made me interested as well. If CS/IT is cooked, I'm thinking maybe Business or Finance is a better option? I've decided to pursue it as a minor. If I were to make a switch, how do you think I should make it happen so that even those career paths are open to me?Lots of questions here, but I'd really appreciate any and all help!

However 5 years is a long time and the landscape has changed a lot over the last few years.Looking for fresh perspectives in this regard :-* Is it worth pursuing a Masters in AI / ML ?* If yes, is it better to do it part-time (something like an online course which can be juggled with a 9 - 5 job) or go all-in and pursue it full time ?* Which college / university / course(s) should I enroll in, if I decide to pursue a Masters in AI / ML ? What criteria do I need to keep in mind when picking college / university / course(s) ?* After completing my Masters, I would like to return back to the industry as a Software Engineer or its equivalent role, don't see myself going into academic research or going for a PhD. Is it worth pursuing a Masters given that this is what I plan to do after my Masters ?* Do I need to have a Masters thesis topic in mind before going for my Masters ?* Given that several big tech companies have done mass layoffs to invest more into advancements of AI, **what skill sets should a Software Engineer possess today to future-proof their career ?**Any guidance is really appreciated:raising_hands:Some random thoughts I have nowadays (please correct me if I am wrong anywhere) :-* Sometimes I feel that the best way to keep up with the latest advancements in AI is by pursuing a full time Masters degree in a related domain * this will help me stay relevant in the industry and be ready for potential AI Engineer roles in the near future if that happens.* Given the advancements in LLMs, it seems likely that in the near future, LLMs may easily be able to handle mere coding tasks (something that a fresh graduate might be tasked with initially), and later on complete even more challenging tasks, so what role will software engineers play in the future ?
