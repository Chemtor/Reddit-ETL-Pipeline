Bootcamps, online resources, and community content have opened doors for so many people. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel that the role is being diluted.What once required a solid foundation in Computer Science—data structures, algorithms, systems design, software engineering principles—has increasingly become something you can “learn” in a few weeks. The job often gets reduced to moving data from point A to point B, orchestrating some tools, and calling it a day. And that’s fine on the surface—until you realize that many of these pipelines lack test coverage, versioning discipline, clear modularity, or even basic error handling.Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is exactly what democratization looks like, and it’s a good thing. But I do wonder: are we trading depth for speed?

1k66f2e,"Are Delta tables a good option for high volume, real-time data?",StriderAR7,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I was doing a POC with Delta tables for a real-time data pipeline and started doubting if Delta even is a good fit for high-volume, real-time data ingestion. Here’s the scenario: - We're consuming data from multiple Kafka topics (about 5), each representing a different stage in an event lifecycle. - Data is ingested every 60 seconds with small micro-batches. (we cannot tweak the micro batch frequency much as near real-time data is a requirement)- We’re using Delta tables to store and upsert the data based on unique keys, and we’ve partitioned the table by date. While Delta provides great features like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel, I’m running into issues with table bloat. Despite only having a few days’ worth of data, the table size is growing rapidly, and optimization commands aren’t having the expected effect. From what I’ve read, Delta can handle real-time data well, but there are some challenges that I'm facing in particular:- File fragmentation: Delta writes new files every time there’s a change, which is result in many files and inefficient storage (around 100-110 files per partition - table partitioned by date). - Frequent Upserts: In this real-time system where data is constantly updated, Delta is ending up rewriting large portions of the table at high frequency, leading to excessive disk usage. - Performance: For very high-frequency writes, the merge process is becoming slow, and the table size is growing quickly without proper maintenance. To give some facts on the POC: The realtime data ingestion to delta ran for 24 hours full, the physical accumulated was 390 GB, the count of rows was 110 million.The main outcome of this POC for me was that there's a ton of storage overhead as the data size stacks up extremely fast!For reference, the overall objective for this setup is to be able to perform near real time analytics on this data and use the data for ML.Has anyone here worked with Delta tables for high-volume, real-time data pipelines?

1k6xfby,Query runs longer than your AWS bill. How do I improve it,YameteGPT,dataengineering,"Hey folks,So I have this query that joins two table, selects a few columns, runs a dense rank and then filters to keep only the rank 1s. Pretty simple right ?Here’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. So, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.Yes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. And it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. But the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details.

Why don't they control data access too?,mjf-89,dataengineering,"Hi there, I've been thinking about the current generation of data catalogs like DataHub and OpenMetadata, and something doesn't add up for me. They do a great job tracking metadata, but stop short of doing what seems like the next obvious step, actually helping enforce data access policies.Imagine a unified catalog that isn't just a metadata registry, but also the gatekeeper to data itself:- Roles defined at the catalog level map directly to roles and grants on underlying sources through credential-vending.- Every access, by a user or a pipeline, goes through the catalog first, creating a clean audit trail.Iceberg’s REST catalog hints at this model: it stores table metadata and acts as a policy-enforcing access layer, managing credentials for the object storage underneath.Why not generalize this idea to all structured and unstructured data? Instead of just listing a MySQL table or an S3 bucket of PDFs, the catalog would also vend credentials to access them. Instead of relying on external systems for access control, the catalog becomes the control plane.This would massively improve governance, observability, and even simplify pipeline security models.Is there any OSS project trying to do this today?Are there reasons (technical or architectural) why projects like DataHub and OpenMetadata avoid owning the access control space?Would you find it valuable to have a catalog that actually controls access, not just documents it?",17,0.91,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k8jmbo/are_we_missing_the_point_of_data_catalogs_why/,2025-04-26 18:24:38,2025-04-27 01:42:23
1k3wpp9,I've been testing LLMs for data transformations and results have been great,arctic_radar,dataengineering,"There are two main reasons why I've been testing this. First, in scenarios where you have hundreds of different data sources each with similar data but varying schemas, doing transformations with an LLM would mean you don't have to write hundreds of different transformation processes. manage all of them etc. Additionally, when the those sources inevitably alter their schemas slightly, you don't have to worry about your rigid transformation processes breaking.The next use case I had in mind was enriching the data by using the LLM to make inferences that would be time-consuming or even impossible to do with traditional code. For simple example, I had a field that contained mix of individual and business names. Some of my sources included a field that indicated the entity type, others did not. I found that the LLM was very accurate not only for determining whether the entity was an individual or not, but also ignoring the records that did have this indicator already. I've also tested more complex inference logic with similarly accurate results. I was able to build a single prompt that does several transformations and inferences all at the same time, receiving validated structured output from the LLM. From there, the data goes through a more traditional SQL transformation process.I really thought there would be more issues with hallucination, but so far that just hasn't been the case. The only inaccuracies I've found were in edge cases that would have caused issues with traditional transformations as well. To be fair, I'm using context amounts that are much, much smaller than the models are supposedly capable of dealing with and I suspect if I increased the context I would start to see issues. I first did some limited testing on this over a year ago, and while I remember being surprised then by how well it worked, the cost made it viable for only small datasets. I just thought it was a neat trick and didn't give it much more thought. But now the models are 20x cheaper in some cases. They are cheap enough now that I can run the same prompt through multiple models and flag anytime they disagree, which is almost always tends to be edge cases when both models were confused because the data itself had issues.I'm wondering if anyone else has tested similar processes and, if so, how did your results look? I know my use case may be niche, but I have to think this approach is going to gain popularity as these models get cheaper and more capable over the years.",16,0.84,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k3wpp9/ive_been_testing_llms_for_data_transformations/,2025-04-20 21:14:46,2025-04-27 01:42:23

We use a fairly modern stack: Snowflake, Databricks, Airflow, AWS, etc.A technical recruiter from Meta recently reached out to say they’re hiring DEs (L4/L5) and invited me to begin technical interviews.I’m torn on what decision would be best for my career: Should I pursue the opportunity at Meta, or stay in my current role and keep building?Here are some things I’m weighing:* Prestige: Having work experience at a company like Meta could open doors for me in the future.* Tech stack: I’ve heard Meta uses mostly in-house tools (some open sourced), and I worry that might hurt future job transitions where industry-standard tools are more relevant.* Role scope: I’ve read that DEs at Meta may do work closer to analytics engineering. I enjoy analytics, but I’d miss the more technical DE aspects.* Compensation: I’m currently making \~$160K base + pre-IPO equity + bonus potential. Meta’s base range is similar, but equity would likely be more valuable and far lower risk.* Location: My current role is entirely remote. I would have to relocate to accommodate Meta's hybrid in person requirement.So if you were in my shoes, what would you do?

Data is initially generated and stored on an air-gapped network. 3. Data will be moved into a lab by detaching hard-drives. There, we will need to retain some raw data for regulatory purposes, and we will also want to perform ETL into an analytical database/warehouse. I have a lot of time to refine these before implementation time, and specific technologies are flexible. but next week I wan to present a *reasonable* view of the types of solutions we might use.

I've observed a concerning trend: people working on managed services projects are often engaged throughout the entire day, handling both ETL support and ad-hoc tasks.For those unfamiliar with the Data Engineering role, let me explain what ad-hoc and ETL support tasks typically involve. **Ad-hoc tasks** refer to daily activities such as data validations, new development, modifying data sources, preparing data for frontend and ML teams, and more. **ETL support**, on the other hand, is usually provided outside of standard working hours—often at night—and involves resolving issues and fixing bugs in data pipelines.The main problem is that the same resource who works a full 9–5 shift is also expected to wake up at night for ETL support whenever it's needed. ETL errors typically occur 2–3 times a week, and these support tasks can take anywhere from 1 to 5 hours, depending on their complexity and urgency.My concern is whether this practice is common across the industry? Wouldn't it be more effective to have separate resources for ETL support and ad-hoc tasks?**What are your thoughts?**",12,0.83,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k4uwcj/raising_a_concern_for_resources_working_on/,2025-04-22 01:54:32,2025-04-27 01:42:23

1k5ghoy,Iceberg in practice,wcneill,dataengineering,"Noob questions incoming!**Context:** I'm designing my project's storage and data pipelines, but am new to data engineering. I'm trying to understand the ins and outs of various solutions for the task of reading/writing diverse types of very large data. From a theoretical standpoint, I understand that Iceberg is a standard for organizing metadata about files. Metadata organized to the Iceberg standard allows for the creation of ""Iceberg tables"" that can be queried with a familiar SQL-like syntax.I'm trying to understand how this would fit into a real world scenario... For example, lets say I use object storage, and there are a bunch of pre-existing parquet files and maybe some images in there. Could be anything...**Question 1:** How is the metadata/tables initially generated for all this existing data? I know AWS has the Glue Crawler. Is something like that used? Or do you have to manually create the tables, and then somehow point the tables to the correct parquet files that contain the data associated with that table?**Question 2:** Okay, now assume I have object storage and metadata/tables all generated for files in storage. Someone comes along and drops a new parquet file into some bucket. I'm assuming that I would need some orchestration utility that is monitoring my storage and kicking off some script to add the new data to the appropriate tables? Or is it done some other way?**Question 3:** I assume that there are query engines out there that are implemented to the Iceberg standard for creating and reading Iceberg metadata/tables, and fetching data based on those tables. For example, I've read that SparkQL and Trino have Iceberg ""connectors"". So essentially the power of Iceberg can't be leveraged if your tech stack doesn't implement compliant readers/writers?

This is especially problematic since some of our data (like blocks and transactions) needs to be available in real-time, with query latency under 100ms.To manage this better, we’re considering separating our ingestion strategy: keeping batch ingestion into ClickHouse for historical and analytical needs, while finding a way to access fresh data in real-time when needed — particularly for the GraphQL layer.Would love to get thoughts on how we can approach this — especially around managing real-time queryability while keeping ingestion efficient and stable.",9,0.85,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k6p7x9/how_do_you_handle_realtime_data_access_100ms/,2025-04-24 10:52:14,2025-04-27 01:42:23

All I want to do is read a table from Microsoft SQL Server and write it out as parquet files. The table has about 200 million rows. If I try to run this without using a JDBC partitionColumn, the node that is pulling the data just runs out of memory and disk space. If I add a partitionColumn and several partitions, Spark can spread the data pull out over several nodes, but it opens a whole bunch of concurrent connections to the DB. For obvious reasons I don't want to do something like open 20 concurrent connections to a production database. I already bumped up the number of concurrent connections to 12 and some nodes are still running out of memory, probably because the data is not evenly distributed by the partition column.I also ran into cases where the Spark job would pull all the partitions from the same executor, which makes no sense. This JDBC datasource thing seems severely limited unless I'm overlooking something. Are there any Spark users who do this regularly and have tips?

Today, it's been almost 8 months since I started applying (even before I graduated), but without success. During my internship as a data scientist in the retail sector, I found myself doing some ""data engineering"" tasks like working a lot on the cloud (GCP) and doing a lot of SQL in Bigquery, I know it's not much compared to what a real data engineer does on his daily tasks, but it was a new thing for me and I enjoyed doing it. At the end of my internship, I learned that unlike internships in the US, where it's considered a trial period to get hired, here in France it's considered more like a way to get some work done for cheap... well, especially in big companies. I understand that it's not always like that, but that's what I've noticed from many students.Anyway, during those few months after the internship, I started learning tools like Spark, AWS, and some of Airflow. I'm thinking that maybe I have a better chance to get a job in data engineering, because a lot of people say that it's getting harder and harder to find a job as a data scientist, especially for juniors. So is this a good idea for me? Because it's been like 3-4 months applying for Data Engineering jobs, still nothing. If so, is there more I need to learn?

Back then, I kind of just thought of this as some wrapper of code that I can call whenever I wanted to. But getting to learn more about them in Calculus and how much I can manipulate them, it has also translated to my programming skills. Instead of just a wrapper for my code, I treat them now like actual items that take in parameters and spits out an output. Of course like, duh, but it really has changed my perspective and style on how I code now. Back then, it's more programming first then do the math to check.

For context, I have 2 years of work experience, meaning I'm a junior dev:## Don't learn many languages""Jack of all trades"" only applies at the mid-senior level. In junior->mid level, you should pick one language and framework and stick with it! Even if you want to do full-stack (React + Backend) you should pick a focus between the two. It's rare for a company to want a split 50/50 between them, and the ones biased towards front-end will also favor UI/UX work (figma designs, etc.)## Build many projectsBuild, build, build. Don't be like me stuck in a perpetual cycle of tutorial hell, where you value finishing guided tutorials more than actually working on your own projects. Yes, those projects can (with a lot of luck) still get you an interview, but the interviewers will figure out if you really built your own stuff and researched beyond the surface or not.## Don't use AI (too early)LLM editors are great to generate boilerplate, but until you get the hang of it and really, REALLY intentionally understand what the boilerplate is doing (and why it's needed) type everything by memory, and fallback to a reference (docs, Google) when you really struggle to recall something.People will hate this one, because they'll tell you ""memorization is not the point"" and it's not. The goal is to understand the intention behind everything. Learn the language and framework of your choice more than what every junior Joe and Gary know. It's ultra-competitive right now. Do you really want to blow your chances and lose it all because you went ""meh, I'll let cursor tell me which services and repositories to make, with the basic expected CRUD interfaces"". A good rule of thumb is to do that after you know 80%+ of what Cursor is about to generate.## Keyword Match everythingOnce upon a time, people treated the keywords in the job opening as wish lists, and told you to ""apply anyways"". In this job market, companies can get whatever they want to get.

I have literally sent hundreds of personalised applications (resume + cover letter) for most of them and got only like 8% of answers, most of them being automatic rejections. I initially applied for machine learning/computer vision (my major at school) openings, but since there is no way I ever get one of those, I've widely reduced the importance of what I'd like to do in order to send more applications.Even when I get to go to the technical tests, and perform (I have had platforms telling me things like you performed better than 95% of candidates), I still get rejected without getting to the interview phase, ""we've had a lot of competitive applicants bla bla bla"". The only interviews I got are from Belgian societies, refusing me even though they don't pay their interns. I mean, even for free (for them bc it would be a lot of money for me to get there), they wouldn't have me work for them ??? This is just crazy.I have already worked half-time for more than 4 years alongside my studies, meaning that I have at the very least 2 years of full-time professional software engineering and that seems to not count at all, I've even had interviewers telling it didn't count as experience and that I was a junior with less knowledge than a student who wouldn't have worked during his studies (I admit that I left the interview after hearing this bs)I tried many different things on my resume & letters to not get rejected by the automated TAS. Many people reviewed what I sent, so I don't think that the problem comes from there.I mean, how are we supposed to find internships in CS ? Is this really the result of those 5 years of studies ? Absolutely no consideration from companies that I'd love to work for ? I'm losing my mind over this..That feeling of rejection/not being enough, even though I have proven multiple times that I can provide valuable workforce to campanies is just unbearable. Having people telling me that I should persist is now my new most listened song of 2025, but you guessed it : not my favorite.Sometimes it makes me want to scream after thinking of all those efforts to apply that won't ever bring me anything but sadness and despair.Finally, I don't understand why I should intern to graduate. How in the world can I not already look for a fucking job and call it a day since I already validated all the exams ?

I’ve been struggling a lot with understanding Java, especially as someone who’s neurodivergent and studying IT at university. The syntax, the logic, and even just staying focused - it’s all been overwhelming at times, especially after switching from C to Java.For years, I doubted myself. Pre-exams felt like climbing a mountain barefoot, and I honestly thought I wouldn’t make it through.I told myself that this would be the last semester I work on getting my degree - it was kind of a now-or-never moment. And today, I managed to reach a small milestone that once felt so distant: I passed. Not just barely - I actually did well. Despite all the confusion at the start, the stress, and the mental blocks, I pulled through and proved to myself that I can do this.I’m proud of myself - and honestly, I just wanted to hear it from someone else too. I usually keep things to myself and don’t socialize much. But if anyone else out there is in the middle of the struggle: please don’t give up.

1k7u3nv,using AI to learn programming,CapnCoin,learnprogramming,"Edit: What I mean by the post is not that everyone is saying not to use AI at all. That is simply how I understood it so I made a post in case there might be others.I often see comments on posts, asking how to learn programming, saying not to use AI.Although I am definitely no professional programmer myself, I have done quit a lot of learning (python, c#, and lately c++). I have always heeded this advice and have steered far away from using AI to learn how to code. Until the last couple of weeks.... and I have completely changed my mind about the subject.I still think it is a bad idea to have AI write up some copy-paste code as this definitely is not the best way to go about learning. Struggling a little and trying to get the code working yourself is what will cement the knowledge. But what I have been doing is submitting my code snippets to the AI after getting it to work and prompting it to analyze my code and suggest possible improvements. I then try implementing the suggestions and repeat the process.I feel this has vastly upgraded my programming skills, learning to implement fail safes, better error handling, better edge case handling, and being overall more robust. Still by no means am I any form of 'great' programmer yet but using Ai in this way has helped me progress a lot faster.So, in my opinion there is no problem with using AI to help you learn, the problem is in how we decide to use it.

But since I'm a total beginner when it comes to learning how to program, I'm not quite sure where or how to begin.I've checked out websites like CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp. They're great in terms of explaining concepts, almost like dictionaries, but I find it hard tot transition from theory to actually building and applying what I've learned. That's where I feel stuck. What I'm not saying is that CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp and such websites are bad. It's just that because of my lack of knowledge and experience that I don't know where to begin. It could even be that after all recommendations I would apply for CodeAcademy or FCC even, its just that I don't know yet.Ideally I'm looking for a learning platform that balances **teaching core concepts** (like how API's work, how to build them) **with hands-on projects** so I can apply what I'm learning as I go. I'm willing to pay- my budget is up to 40 dollars a month, but I also want to make sure that I'm choosing a platform that helps me build confidence and skills gradually, not just throw everything at me at once.Luckily my job gives me time during working hours to invest in this learning journey, so I'd love to make the most of it.

1k7lakx,[Need Advice] Struggling with Focus and Productivity After Years of Passionate Coding,hello_aaron,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I hope you’re all doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a severe lack of focus and productivity, and it’s been weighing on me for nearly a year. Let me share my story and explain where I’m at – I’d really appreciate any guidance or experiences you can share.Background: In 2021, I got my first desktop from my brother, and I was instantly hooked on computers. I spent hours exploring, learning, and diving into coding. I started with C, moved to C++, and fell in love with programming. It was exciting, and I was learning something new every day. In 2022, I joined a Computer Science Engineering program as a direct second-year student. This was the peak of my productivity. I was coding 10+ hours a day, building web development projects with Python and JavaScript, and even mastering the MERN stack. I was so focused that I’d code through the night, feeling like coding was my entire world. My hard work paid off – I became one of the top coders in my college, and my peers recognized my skills. I built a strong portfolio and improved my resume, aiming for a developer jobProblem: Things changed in my final year (2024). I started feeling depressed, demotivated, and lazy. I couldn’t focus on learning new skills or even maintaining my existing ones. While my peers were landing interviews and jobs, I struggled with aptitude tests (which I hadn’t prepared for, as I was so focused on coding). Sitting down to work on my laptop became a challenge – I just felt unmotivated. Despite this, I pushed through, and my past hard work paid off: I landed the highest-paying job at a major MNC in my college. I’m proud of this, but the problem persists. Now, with my degree wrapping up in the next 2-3 months, I want to use this time to improve myself, but I can’t focus on anything. I’ve lost the drive to learn new languages or build projects. Worse, I’m experiencing back pain from too much screen time, which makes me avoid my laptop altogether. I suspect I’m addicted to high-dopamine activities like gaming and YouTube Shorts, which make it impossible to start anything productive. My mind feels like it’s rejecting coding and my laptop for no clear reason.I’ve attempted every productivity strategy. I desperately want to be that person again who could code all day without distractions, but I feel stuck. This has been going on for almost a year, and I’m worried about starting my job in this unmotivated state. Has anyone else experienced this shift from being passionate and productive to feeling unmotivated and unable to focus? How did you overcome it?I’d love to hear your experiences, suggestions, or even just know I’m not alone in this.

I honestly don’t know how this doesn't qualify, since I’m trying to understand a conceptual difference.Anyway, here's my question.I got the structure of the `Memory` chip from GitHub. Everyone seems to be using the same implementation, and it works fine in simulation without any errors: CHIP Memory { IN in[16], load, address[15]; OUT out[16]; PARTS: DMux4Way(in=load, sel=address[13..14], a=loadram1, b=loadram2, c=loadscreen, d=loadkbd); Or(a=loadram1, b=loadram2, out=loadram); RAM16K(in=in, load=loadram, address=address[0..13], out=ramout); Screen(in=in, load=loadscreen, address=address[0..12], out=scrout); Keyboard(out=kbout); Mux4Way16(a=ramout, b=ramout, c=scrout, d=kbout, sel=address[13..14], out=out); }Now, based on this design, I expected the following code to read a value from the keyboard and store it into `RAM[1]`: (loop) @24577 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPHere's my reasoning:* `@24577` sets the A register to 24577.* That value is passed to the Memory chip as the address.* The most significant bits (bits 13 and 14) are both 1, so according to the HDL, the `Keyboard` chip should be selected.* So `out` should reflect the keyboard's output.* Then `D=M` loads the keyboard value into the D register.* `@1` sets A to 1, and `M=D` writes the value to RAM\[1\].Now, here’s my confusion: How is this different from the following? (loop) @24576 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPBoth 24576 and 24577 have the same top two bits (13 and 14 = 11), so shouldn't they both route to the keyboard? Why would one work differently from the other if the given chip structure is true?edit: in the code section some parts were typed as “u/…” instead of “@…” . I fixed them.

Explaining them is.Solving a question correctly is important, of course. But what really stands out is how clearly and naturally someone can walk others through their thought process. It’s not about over-narrating or reciting a rehearsed script. What makes a difference is:Framing your approach in simple, accessible terms Surfacing trade-offs before you're even asked Staying steady and unfazed when edge cases come up, as if you already thought about them Because of this, I gradually adjusted how I prepare for interviews, even casual ones. I still solve problems as usual, but now I also practice summarizing the solution in one or two clean sentences, basically a ""30-second version"", then being ready to dive deeper if needed.Sometimes, I’ll use a tool that offers multiple solution paths and points out which parts are worth verbalizing, not just coding. It’s helped me avoid slipping into the ""just code it"" mindset.Curious if others have similar experiences.

1k5y2ma,Big O notation and general misunderstanding,divad1196,learnprogramming,"Disclaimer: this post is also to vent.I got into a debate on something that I didn't think was so badly understood. The debate was with people claiming that ""big O notation is just counting the number of instructions"" and ""you must abstract away things like CPU"".These claims are formally incorrect and only apply for specific contexts. The big O (and little o) notation is a mathematical concept to explain how something grow. It is never mentionned ""instruction"" as this isn't a mathematical concept. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)The reason why we ""abstract"" the CPU, and other stuff, is because if 2 algorithms run on the same computer, we can expect them be impacted in the same way. ""All instruction take the same time"" (not all instruction take the same time, but the execution duration of an instruction is considered majored by a constant. A constant doesn't impact the growth, we can define this number to be `1`). In **simple** cases, the time is a function of the the number of instruction `n`, something like `duration(n) -> INSTRUCTION_DT * n` When you compare 2 univariate (""mono-variadic"") algorithms in the same context, you get things like `dt * n_1 > dt * n_2`. For `dt > 0`, you can simplify the comparison with `n_1 > n_2`.Similarly, when the number of instruction is fix on one side and vary on the other side, then it's easier to approximate a constant by `1`. The big O notation cares about the growth, there is none and that's all we care about, so replace a constant by 1 makes sense.Back to the initial point: we don't ""count the instruction"" or ""abstract"" something. We are trying to define how somethings grows.Now, the part where I vent.The debate started because I agreed with someone's example on an algorithm with a time complexity of `O(1/n)`. The example of code was `n => sleep(5000/n)`.The response I got was ""it's 1 instruction, so O(1)` and this is incorrect. `O(1)` in time complexity would mean: ""even if I change the value of N, the program will take the same time to finish"" whereas it is clear here that the bigger N is, the faster the program finishes.If I take the opposite example: `n => sleep(3600 * n)` and something like `Array(n).keys().reduce((a, x) => a + x))`Based on their response, the first one has a time complexity of `O(1)` and the second one `O(n)`. Based on that, the first one should be faster, which is never the case.Same thing with space complexity: does `malloc(sizeof(int) * 10)` has the same space complexity has `malloc(sizeof(int) * n)` ? No. The first one is `O(1)` because it doesn't grow, while the second one is `O(n)`The reason for misunderstanding the big O notation is IMO:- school simplify the context (which is okay)- people using it never got the context.Of course, that's quite a niche scenario to demonstrate the big O misconception. But it exposes an issue that I often see in IT: people often have a narrow/contextual understanding on things. This causes, for example, security issues. Yet, most people will prefer to stick to their believes than learning.Additional links (still wikipedia, but good enough)- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory (see ""Important Complexity Classes"")- DTIME complexity: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTIME",4,0.57,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k5y2ma/big_o_notation_and_general_misunderstanding/,2025-04-23 12:36:19,2025-04-27 01:42:25

Since I’m the only ""somehow-web-oriented"" person in the office (meaning I’ve completed Linux From Scratch before and have some JavaScript codebases), they asked me to build it.I spent almost three weeks on this task—learning Litestar and Vue from scratch (mostly copy-pasting from the documentation), discovering new requirements along the way (e.g., setting up a database for storage, implementing a worker queue for long-running tasks), and eventually getting the demo functional.While I learned a lot during the process, I’m uneasy about the gaps in my implementation. For example:* Some of my APIs return a Response object, while others return plain dict objects. This inconsistency feels extremely wrong.* I still don’t know how to implement a secure authentication system—a task that will likely fall to me soon.* To simulate real-time updates, I’m currently polling an API twice per second.

1k41sgk,"What is a high level programming language in a computer? More guidance on CLI and local developer environments, please!",BenjaminFinestone,learnprogramming,"I'm trying to think from a first principles perspective about what a non-binary program is in a computer, before it is compiled into machine code. I may type, say, Javascript, or Dart, and I see text like ""let varName = ""example"" "". But, if a computer is made out of 1's and 0's in electrical logic gate representations, is not this text being displayed to me already 1's and 0's? The question being, what is a non-binary language in a computer \*before\* a compiler? When I type an English-esq programming language, and I have the visual illusion of this tool writing in an easy plain language, like Python or JS, etc, what is that text that I am reading before it gets compiled? What is that in a computer? How is that different from the end binary of a compiler? What does a compiler do? Question put from idea into time: when I finish writing a program in an easy to read programming language (I.E., not binary), and then I enter a command into a terminal line to run a compiler to compile it, and then it compiles it, and run it, what is the object inside the computer across this timeline, and how is it changing across this process? What is the easy to read programming language before and after compilation inside the computer?This question has grown out of a confusion about setting up a developer environment, with command lines and language-specific SDK's, and I am just trying to understand the developer environment, and what it is I am doing when I set up things like a Dart SDK for Flutter. Windows as a developer environment confuses me, because I don't have a framework of understanding of how all these downloadable packages have an organization schema with Windows in Windows Powershell. I am starting to look into Linux, with an integrated terminal; it seems much more organized to me. When I run a command on windows, and I am not sure about all this package stuff (I am a n00b learning), and Windows doesn't recognize it, I'm not sure what various different things are or aren't, because I don't have paradigms or conceptual frameworks to organize this. Clueless and lost. Tl;dr I tried to get Dart to run a basic ""Hello World!"" program, because I want to make an app with Flutter, but VS Code terminal wouldn't understand it, because I did not set up the developer environment correctly with the SDK. Now I've realized I don't understand a local developer environment, and I am taking a step back to understand CLI, terminals, and understanding the general organization of these things in a computer and what it even means to execute a CLI command, and for an operating system like Windows (in this case, Windows Powershell) to recognize new commands from new SDK packages and how it even locates/registers stuff like that in the computer (and thus also understand why it wouldn't be registering commands during failed attempts to use all this stuff). \*I don't understand local developer environments.\*",3,0.81,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k41sgk/what_is_a_high_level_programming_language_in_a/,2025-04-21 01:27:07,2025-04-27 01:42:25

Until a few months ago, he had a job as a software engineer at an insurance company. The benefits were fantastic.. he would work 10-20 hours a week at most, work was very chill and relaxing. His coworkers and management were nice and welcoming, and the company was very stable and recession proof. He also only had to go into the office once a week. He had time to go to the gym, spend time with family, and even work on side projects if he felt like itBut then he got tempted by the FAANG name and the idea of a shiny new title and what looked like better pay and more exciting projects, so he made the jump, thinking he was leveling up, thinking he was finally joining the big leaguesFrom day one it was a completely different world, the job was fully on-site so he was back to commuting every day, the hours were brutal, and even though nobody said it out loud there was a very clear expectation to be constantly online, constantly responsive, and always pushing for moreHe went from having quiet mornings and freedom to structure his day to 8 a.m. standups, nonstop back-to-back meetings, toxic coworkers who acted like they were in some competition for who could look the busiest, and managers who micromanaged every last detail while pretending to be laid-backHe was putting in 50 to 60 hours a week just trying to stay afloat and it was draining the life out of him, but he kept telling himself it was worth it for the resume boost and the name recognition and then just three months in, he got the layoff emailNo warning, no internal transfer, no fallback plan, just a cold goodbye and a severance package, and now he’s sitting at home unemployed in a terrible market, completely burned out, regretting ever leaving that insurance job where people actually treated each other like human beingsAnd the worst part is I watched him change during those months, it was like the light in him dimmed a little every week, he started looking tired all the time, less present, shorter on the phone, always distracted, talking about how he felt like he was constantly behind, constantly proving himself to people who didn’t even know his nameHe used to be one of the most relaxed, easygoing guys I knew, always down for a beer or a pickup game or just to chill and talk about life, but during those months it felt like he aged five years, and when he finally called me after the layoff it wasn’t just that he lost the job, it was like he’d lost a piece of himself in the processTo make it worse, his old role was already filled, and it’s not like you can just snap your fingers and go back, that bridge is gone, and now he’s in this weird limbo where he’s applying like crazy but everything is frozen or competitive or worse, fake listings meant to fish for resumesI’ve seen this happen to more than one person lately and I’m telling you, if you’re in a solid job right now with decent pay, decent hours, and a company that isn’t on fire, you don’t need to chase the dream of some big tech title especially not in a market like thisRight now, surviving and keeping your sanity is the real win, and that “boring” job might be the safest bet you’ve gotBe careful out there",5202,0.95,503,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k41ad2/reminder_if_youre_in_a_stable_software/,2025-04-21 01:00:37,2025-04-27 01:42:26

I lost count of the amount of applications and interviews total. I was always just a bit short on aligning perfectly with their stack, a year too short on a certain technology, wrong cloud platform, etc. I got a part-time job, lived frugally, stretched my emergency savings / severance and told myself that the next one would surely be the one. I was so close, third time must be the charm or fourth or fifth, etc. I hid my unemployment from my family out of shame for 2 years.

The opinions about the market from people that I have talked to: - it's pretty bad, there's a lot of competition for jobs because of remote work (recruiter who mostly hires contracts) - it's terrible, because AI can do half of the work (colleague)- it's pretty bad, there's more candidates than jobs and most jobs are requiring you to be on site (recruiter who mostly hires contracts) I'm currently on a contract (remote) and looking to go full-time. I'd rather not take a pay cut, but boy it looks like I would have to -- even after allowing for benefits etc in the calculation. So what's going on here? Are we just still kind of reshuffling from shift to remote work?

1k6c2it,Actual career advice: Don’t argue with your manager (especially with feedback),mpaes98,cscareerquestions,"Wanted to share an anecdotal wisdom I’ve developed that I continue to see early career professionals do that hurts them; voicing disagreement with your manager will 99% of the time hurt you. Let’s say your manager corrects you over something that wasn’t your fault. In that case, trying to make an argument that you aren’t responsible for something is more likely to make you seem like you can’t take accountability.Or, in a feedback session, you get negative reviews from them on your performance for what seems like arbitrary reasons and you want to give an explanation/justification. In this case, there’s no explaining away what they’ve decided. You’re more likely to come off as insecure and argumentative for talking back.I’m not going to give a speech about how maybe you need to do self-reflection and practice humility; sometimes you’ll be in the right and you know you’re in the right. But career-wise, being right < manager being pleased.90% of the time, your manager has already made up his mind on how he feels about a situation.Part of your manager’s role is assessing your performance and giving feedback. So when you push back, not only are you expressing that you disagree with their opinion, you’re also coming across that you think you are better at their job than them (maybe you are?).I write this because I’m usually a self-advocate outside of work, but I’ve gotten to a point where I have to tell myself “it’s not worth it” quite a bit because of how important it is to not be a problem employee in this economy. The best recoveries I’ve had when I’m given feedback or told negative things (that I personally feel like are not my fault) is to not disagree or try to explain, it’s just thank them for the feedback and keep working.",278,0.89,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6c2it/actual_career_advice_dont_argue_with_your_manager/,2025-04-23 22:15:50,2025-04-27 01:42:26

1k8mffu,Ok I'll admit it.. I was wrong about non-tech companies. I can DEFINITELY see the appeal now.,cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"I just want to put a disclaimer: I am not saying FAANG or Big Tech sucks. It has its pros, but it also has its cons. Same with non-tech companies. But looking back on my years in the industry.. I just want to reflect on my experience and post about it.When I was just starting out, I thought I had it all figured out. Like so many others in this sub, I had one goal drilled into my brain: FAANG or bust. I thought if I was not at a top tech company or at least something adjacent, I was failing. That prestige, that resume clout, that salary, it was all that mattered.Fast forward to today. I am at a FAANG-adjacent company, something people would brag about on LinkedIn, and honestly I am exhausted. I am not even talking about having a busy week tired. I am talking about chronic, soul-sucking, life-flattening exhaustion. Every day feels like running a marathon at a sprinter's pace. There is an endless barrage of Slack messages, Jira tickets, unexpected urgent meetings, and late-night pings that just need a quick review. Every quarter feels like another round of brutal performance reviews where you are judged against metrics that seem to move the second you get close to hitting them.Even my friends who made it into the actual FAANG companies are not living the dream. They are constantly worried about the next round of layoffs. They are stuck in environments where one minor mistake can tank their rating and put their career at risk. Some are taking anxiety medication now. Some do not even enjoy coding anymore, something that used to be their passion. It has been hard to watch.And then there are my other friends.The ones I used to quietly judge. The ones who went into banking tech, insurance companies, healthcare systems, government contractors. The so-called safe non-tech companies.When we catch up, the contrast is hard to ignore. They work 20 to 30 hours a week. They log off by 4 PM, laptops closed until the next morning. No emergency production issues in the middle of the night. No hyper-aggressive performance reviews. No constant fear about the next reorg or layoff. Their companies are profitable and stable and not reacting to every market fluctuation with mass job cuts.They are happy. Genuinely happy.They have hobbies. They go hiking. They build side projects for fun. They go to the gym without feeling guilty. They spend time with family, with friends, with themselves. They are not worried about falling behind because their companies are not built on a culture of constant comparison.When I look at them now, I see peace. A peace I forgot was even possible in this industry.I was so obsessed with winning early on that I did not realize how much I was sacrificing along the way. My health. My happiness. My actual life outside of work. I thought prestige would make it all worth it, but you cannot deposit mental stability into a bank account. You cannot get back the years of stress you burned through trying to chase a logo on a resume.I am proud of what I have achieved. But if I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: ***Prestige is not everything. Stability and happiness matter more than any brand name ever will.***To anyone out there grinding away and feeling miserable but telling themselves it will all be worth it once they get to the next step. Please remember that you are allowed to choose a different path. You are allowed to choose yourself over the brand. It is not giving up.

Just two days ago, I found out from some of my co-workers that my startup might go under within a year or two. According to them, this was something the CTO himself said.For a bit of background, I was hired a year ago, but I don’t work on the company’s main SaaS product. Instead, they acquired another software company, and I’m solely responsible for maintaining and fixing bugs in that software. I have three years of experience as a full-stack developer, and in this company, I’m the only one working on this project. I’ve learned a lot over the past year, but after hearing this news, I just feel awful and completely clueless about what to do.I wouldn’t mind as much if this were a remote job, but I actually moved across states to this city because it’s an in-office position. It’s hard to get interviews these days, and when I do get them, most interviewers expect me to be available during work hours, which is difficult since my company isn’t very flexible with time off. I used to work 10-hour days, but my health took a toll, and I was diagnosed with hypertension at just 25. I'm now on medication and had just started setting personal boundaries. I joined a gym, began eating healthy, and made it a point to arrive and leave work on time. Things were starting to look up — but hearing this news killed what little motivation I had left.I also deal with anxiety, and interviews are a nightmare for me. I tend to completely blank out to the point where I can’t even answer simple questions.

1k7yw44,Reluctance to hire ex-FANG in a mid-sized area?,thefox13guy,cscareerquestions,"I've been a programmer professionally since the late 00s. I'm in Portland, which is just a mid-sized market, but still has plenty of tech jobs. I've worked at small startups as the first or second full time dev, some mid-sized companies, and FANG. I've been through a few acquisitions and survived many layoffs.Well, I was recently laid off for the first time from a mid-sized, B-tier tech company that I was having a great time at, so I am out there applying again. It was due to the typical offshoring trend and I was grateful to have survived a few rounds of layoffs and wasn't too worried. I've never had a hard time getting responses from local companies, and probably most of the time I would get interviews, and most interviews I would get an offer. But this time is different.I've applied for about two dozen companies (hybrid or onsite, haven't expanded to remote yet) and gotten almost no response. I think I am more than qualified for them and am perfectly fine with the compensation and all of that (ie, I wasn't just randomly blasting applications out there, I was picking things I genuinely wanted to do). 2-3 companies sent me a rejection based on my application, I've talked to 2-3 recruiters, and had one ""onsite"" interview. So let's just say I've gotten any response at all from about 25-30% of the companies I sent applications to. This is much lower than I'm used to.Here is the thing: I'm starting to wonder if having been at FANG and Big Tech (even though it was B-tier) most recently has hurt my chances. Just a few years ago I would've thought that having FANG would be a huge benefit for job hunting. And the 2-3 recruiters I've talked to seemed to like it, like it would make me a more marketable candidate.But after the one onsite interview, I started to question that for the first time. I was prepared for a technical interview with maybe some behavioral, but the interviewer asked me quite a bit about FANG. I was surprised and got the feeling they thought negatively of it, like asking me about certain projects and responding with, ""So, you're saying you just wrote some Java?"" with a tone that they were downplaying what I did there.Don't get me wrong. Everything at FANG wasn't very impressive. The whole thing is mostly a joke (esp. the LeetCode interviews and corporate Kool Aid) and FANG tends to be a grindhouse for new grads who otherwise have no other experience, not a bunch of math geniuses writing crazy algorithms. But prior to that interview I didn't stop to think if I should mention it in my work history; it seemed obvious that I should. Now I'm starting to wonder all sorts of things like maybe companies are gonna think I'll ask for hundreds of thousands, that I only know how to do ""Big Tech non-sense"", or that I'll be a hard to work with.Do any hiring managers or ex-FANG have any thoughts on this?

I am a very calm person who is easy to get along with, so I'm almost positive that it isn't my attitude causing this.He will also call me out publically in front of the team/ grill me on technical details in meetings (he does this to others, not just me). This is odd to me, because prior to the tech industry, I followed the standard of praise in public, punish in private. Not sure if this is normal or not.Generally speaking, I get the feeling that my manager just simply doesn't like me or want/ care about my success.

I could have left and tried to go for a more useful tech stack after 2 years but the pandemic happened so looking for a new job was impossible. When the pandemic ended, I eventually got to move to a different company and do Java development instead.My problem is, I only have 2+ years of professional experience with Java. I've been working for way longer than that but I'm treated more like a mid level developer because my only experience in Java is that long and nobody seems to care about my 4 years of experience in COBOL because to be quite honest, it's a really outdated language. I'm unable to break into the senior developer level in my company because I need more years of experience with Java.To make things worse, I have zero work experience in frameworks, APIs, microservices, cloud development, etc. The Java project I worked on didn't have those, or at least didn't have me do work in those. I never got to work on CI/CD or databases because that's not the task I got assigned to. I got to do side tasks like automation with Excel VBA macros but that doesn't seem to be as helpful for my resume as it sounds.Meanwhile, I see others younger than me get to be 5 years of experience, have experience with things like AWS, microservices, frameworks, RedHat, containers, etc.Did they just get lucky in their projects and I got unlucky? How do I even ask my manager to put me in a project that allows me to gain experience with cloud development, microservices, frameworks, and all that trendy stuff?

Legacy code base with huge theoretical complexity (Java, Spring, Maven, JavaFX) and a web application that is built in Angular (15-17) built by an external service provider with 5-6 developers from that company that have made software for us for the past 15 years. Me and another colleague were hired so they have internal 'back-up' but the communication is difficult, we don't have any project management basically, very waterfall based, barely any structured work, deadlines or planning. We feel lost about the fact that we were hired to help develop software but the circumstances don't help us grow or be better developers. In fact I feel like I am unlearning everything I learnt at uni because I cannot utilize it in the current architecture that is very customized from the general state of the art approaches I've usually been familiar with. We hardly get any support or feedback and it just sucks. Everytime we ask for structural changes and support we have to solve the issues ourselves. We are severly undermanaged and it's really taking a toll on my mental health, work ethic and confidence. I feel kind of depressed to be honest. Everytime I get a spark of hope and optimism and suggest new ideas or ask for more projects or new projects where I can play around and not struggle with the spaghetti codebase, it gets crushed.I love my coworkers and feel comfortable on a personal level. The pay is good and the job is very safe/stable so I feel so guilty and bad about feeling so lost work wise. I really don't know what to do, I am scared to give up the stability this job gives me but I feel like I am capable of more.

1k8gaf9,Protobuf vs custom binary protocol for hiring in the long term,Pyciko_,cscareerquestions,"Hello. I'm a programmer in a tech startup that develops IoT devices for on-water activities as well as a companion app for them. Due to the nature of our usage case, we sometimes have to operate in bad network conditions: the internet bandwidth may be small, the link between smart trackers and user's phones may be unstable.. etc.. A binary protocol is such a good fit for this situation: saves the bandwidth, allows to have a unification between TCP and Bluetooth comms, works great on low-ram IoT devices. My first look went into Protobuf of course, as it slowly shapes like a new ""JSON of binary world"". But when I started digging deeper, I discovered that it has multiple big downsides and I can easily fix them if I make my own proto (spoiler: I made it).1. The generated code is HUGE (especially in Dart which is used for frontend).2. It doesn't support classes inheritance. Inheritance can be bad in some cases, but if inheriting a class with some common fields halves the codebase size, I do want to have that option.3. Some features like Enums are replaced by strange stuff like int consts (again, Dart code looks even worse)4. That whole stuff with optionals and fallback defaults isn't reliable: if it's a backwards compatible protocol, the fields have to be explicitly nullable without any fallback values.5. You can just make a bitfield for null values at the start of the message, and by doing so, you can get rid of the field headers (id + type) entirely: the id doesn't exist because fields are sequential, the type is known in schema. If receiver schema is old and transmitter has sent some unknown fields, these fields are always at the end of the message, so you can just skip these bytes.And so what I did is I actually wrote a protocol myself, and tested it for a while. Now, even though I still love it, my mind keeps thinking about the following problem: if and when the time comes to hire more people, how do I explain this tech stack to them? Protobuf is a well-known thing, we can just put it as a requirement and be okay. But what about in-house solution? Also, if we need to add another programming language the our system, the protocol has to be implemented by someone.Now I'm doubting if I should continue working with our in-house protocol, or switch to Protobuf. My questions are:1. Is an average developer ready to learn custom binary protocols?2. In other companies using binary protocols, how popular is it to write a custom one and how do employees feel about using it?3. Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?",5,0.78,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k8gaf9/protobuf_vs_custom_binary_protocol_for_hiring_in/,2025-04-26 16:01:09,2025-04-27 01:42:26

I genuinely don't know what I'm doing wrong. I get that the industry is in crisis at the moment, largely due to the huge tax burden being a developer in the US causes now.Are y'all devs with more than 10 years experience also facing such huge challenges in finding a job?

1k6nwhk,"Torn between SE, ES and ML",louleads,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR : I have built some projects in ES and SE and liked ES a bit more but find SE to have more opportunities even though it might become so boring and hellish. Didn't try building any ML projects but I think ML jobs will be highly demanded in the future due to the fast progress of AI and what people are saying online (maybe thats just hype).I can't decide between software engineering, embedded systems and machine learning. I like them all and have had experience with some of them but I know that I can't be a jack of all trades.For embedded systems, I have built 2 arduino projects back in high school (currently I'm in my second year of CS uni). First one was a basic project with some LEDs and some code to make the LEDs light in different ways. Second one was a car that follows a black line and avoids obstacles. I really enjoyed and loved it. Though I have no idea what the market is for ES.For software engineering, I have not made any full projects, just some basic terminal projects, like fizzbuzz and some python scripts that automated some tasks for me. I'm currently in the process of making my first uni project (a games library with search and user authentification functionalities). I'm also going to have an internship this summer as a web dev. I enjoyed the small projects a lot, but I don't know how I'll feel about this project by the time I finish it or about the web dev internship. However, I think I have the best chance at this since I'm from a third world country and I think finding jobs in SE would be easier (not easy, just easier).For machine learning, I haven't tried anything yet. I have planned a final project for my bachelors, which is going to be an AI customer support agent (a family member has a business and suggested I try making that tool for their business). I don't know anything about ML, but I know it requires a lot of math, and I've been a math nerd since high school (solved about 1000+ math problems in my last year of high school). I also think that ML will be a ""goldmine"" for those who choose it now because I keep seeing online that ML jobs will be in high demand in the future.I know I'm deciding what I want to do based on my feelings, but I want to choose something that I'm not gonna regret by the time I turn 30. For example, I like some aspects of software engineering, but I do know that many software engineers hate their jobs because of how shit the work environment is in many companies (too many meetings, coding the same shit everyday...etc).What should I base my decision on? Preference? Market state? Opportunities?And how should I know if I actually enjoy any of these (if I should choose based on passion)?I appreciate anybody who took the time to read this.",3,0.81,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6nwhk/torn_between_se_es_and_ml/,2025-04-24 09:22:39,2025-04-27 01:42:26

1k68wj7,Dilemma: 6 Month Study Plan - What Language/Stack?,Danakazii,cscareerquestions,"Long story short, I have a safety net of around 6 months before I would 'need' to find a job (staying with parents etc, so no financial burden like rent/mortgage).I'm dedicating around **1000 hours** (+/- at around 45 hours per week incl. weekends) to learn a stack/system/framework that will see me ready for employment at the end of it.\----------------------------Here's some facts to know:\- I have 18 months professional experience as a Frontend developer working on JS/React/Next/MUI at a SME with <50 people. I was made redundant and was still very much a junior due to poor structure, management and tasks.\- I am completing my part-time MSc in Software Development that focusses on Java.\- I will not be working during this study time. My time will be 100% spent on this study plan.\----------------------------Here's the dilemma: I know it sounds like a given to just stick to frontend or atleast JavaScript, but here's the thing - **I don't want to end up in front end again**. I found the whole process tedious and perhaps I had a bad experience but I was doing nothing but working on the buttons the whole 18 months (seriously). I thoroughly enjoy UI/UX and believe in amazing interfaces to build products, but the actual pixel pushing part became very tiresome. This is the crossroad I am in at the moment:1. I've been thoroughly enjoying Java through my studies. Yes, it's not enterprise level at the moment (as I am in Year 1 of 3), but the whole jump from JS to Java has been great. I struggled on the foundations of JS but picked up and mastered them in Java. I know Java is still such a strong language for graduate roles, entry roles and for future proof, roles in FinTech, Government and FAANG types. I would love to be able to go down this path to secure a strong role somewhere and build my career this way. I know there is a harder barrier to entry here. I am willing to put in time to Leetcode, DSA and Algorithms too, in fact I want to.2. Given my previous experience in JS, I can knuckle down and use the 6 months to go over JS again, convert it all to learning TypeScript and go hard into mid-level React and Next.js knowledge and then start getting into Node.js, Databases and using TS as a backend language, showcasing fullstack capability. The advantage here is I know the stack (bar the backend) so the learning curve is less than Java. Other advantage here is there are more SME roles going in this stack and given my experience, it may be 'easier' to land a role in this space than trying to secure the first-time Java job not as a traditional Comp Sci BSC graduate. Disadvantage is that I'll fall into just frontend again.So, would love to hear everyone's opinions. I've done the ChatGPT debate for hours on end and at first it was hinting on staying with Java as it's a signal that I'll enjoy backend but then it switched over to saying stick to TS route as it will land me a job quicker and I can always do Java/Go/Rust etc in the background for my next step in my career. However, probably would be better to hear from you guys industry experts here.
