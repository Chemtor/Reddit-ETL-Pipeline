1k2e68y,Some of you aren't writing tests. Start writing tests.,ratczar,dataengineering,"[This came to my attention in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1pl3y/a_databricks_project_a_tight_deadline_and_a_pip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) One of \*the big things\* that separates a data analyst from a data engineer, imo, is whether or not you're capable of testing your code. There's a lot of learners around here right now so I'm going to write this for your benefit. I hope it helps!# CaveatI am not a data engineer. I am a PM for data systems, was a data analyst in my previous life, and have worked with some very good senior contributors and architects. I've learned a lot from them and owe a lot of my career success to their lessons.I am going to try to pass on the little that I know. If you know better than I do, pop into the comments below and feel free to yell at me.Also, testing is a wide, varied field, this is a brief synopsis, definitely do more reading on your own.# When do I need to test my code?Data transformations happen in a lot of different ways. When you work with small data, you might write an excel macro, or a quick little script for manipulation. Not writing tests for these is largely fine, especially when it's something **you** do just for **your** work. Coding in isolation can benefit from tests, but it's not the primary concern.You really need to start thinking about writing tests when two things happen:1. People that are not you start touching your code2. The code you write becomes part of a complex systemThe exception to these two rules is when you're creating portfolio projects. You should write tests for these, because they make you look smart to your interviewers.# Why do I need to test my code?Tests take **implicit** knowledge & context about the purpose of your code / what it does and makes that knowledge **explicit**.This is required to help other people start using the code that you write - if they're new to it, the tests help them understand the purpose of each function and give them guard rails as they make changes.When your code becomes incorporated into a larger system, this is particularly true - it's more likely you'll have multiple folks working with you, and other things that are happening elsewhere in the system might necessitate making changes to your code.# What types of tests are there?I can name at least 4 different types of tests off the dome. There are more but I'm typing extemporaneously and not for clout, so you get what's in my memory:* Unit tests - these test small, discrete parts of your code. * Example: in your pipeline, you write a small function that lowercases names and strips certain characters. You need this to work in a predictable manner, so you write a unit test for it.* Integration tests - these test the boundaries between different functions to make sure the output of one feeds the input of the other correctly. * Example: in your pipeline, one function extracts the data from an API, and another takes that extracted data and does a transform. An integration test would examine whether the output of the first function results is correct for the second.* End-to-end tests - these test whether, given a correct input, the whole of your code produces the correct output. These are hard, but the more of these you can do, the better off you'll be. * Example: you have a pipeline that reads data from an API and inserts it into your database. You mock out a fake input and run your whole pipeline against it, then verify that the expected output is in the database.* Data validation tests - these test whether the data you're being passed, or the data that's landing in a given system, are of the expected shape and type. * Example: your pipeline expects a json blob that has strings in it. Data validation tests would ensure that, once extracted or placed in a holding area, the data is both a json blob with the correct keys and the data types for those keys are all strings# How do I write tests?This is already getting longer than I have patience for, it's Friday at 4pm, so again, you're going to get some crib notes.Whatever language you're using should have some kind of built-in testing capability. SQL does not, unfortunately - it's why you tend to wrap SQL in a different programming language like Python. If you only have SQL, some of what I write below won't apply - you're most likely only doing end-to-end or data validation testing.Start by writing functional tests. For each function in your code, write at least one positive case (where it gets the correct input) and one negative case (where it's given a bad input that might break it).Try to anticipate ways in which your functions might fail. Encode those into your test cases. If you encounter new and exciting ways in which your code breaks as you work, write more tests for those cases.Your development process should become an endless litany of writing code, then writing tests, then testing, then breaking, then writing more tests, then writing more code, and so on in an endless loop.Once you've got a whole pipeline running, write integration tests for the handoffs between your functions. Same thing applies as above. You might need to do some mocking - look that up. End-to-end tests - you might need more complex testing techniques for this, or frameworks. If you have a webapp over your data, you can try something like Selenium. Otherwise, not my forte, consult your seniors. You might also need to set up a test environment with some test data. It's expensive time-wise, but this is why we write infrastructure as code (learn that also, if you can).Data validation tests - if you're writing in SQL, use DBT. If you're writing in Python, use Great Expectations. If you're writing in something else, I can't help you, not my forte, consult your seniors.Happy Friday folks, hope this helped!Tagging u/Recent-Luck-6238, u/FloLeicester, and u/givnv since you all asked!",345,0.89,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k2e68y/some_of_you_arent_writing_tests_start_writing/,2025-04-18 20:01:52,2025-04-25 01:38:11

Bootcamps, online resources, and community content have opened doors for so many people. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel that the role is being diluted.What once required a solid foundation in Computer Science—data structures, algorithms, systems design, software engineering principles—has increasingly become something you can “learn” in a few weeks. The job often gets reduced to moving data from point A to point B, orchestrating some tools, and calling it a day. And that’s fine on the surface—until you realize that many of these pipelines lack test coverage, versioning discipline, clear modularity, or even basic error handling.Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is exactly what democratization looks like, and it’s a good thing. But I do wonder: are we trading depth for speed?

1k20v9p,Thinking of building a SaaS that scrapes data from other sources? Think twice. Read this.,Awkward-Bug-5686,dataengineering,"* **Ever considered scraping data from various top-tier sources to power your own solution*** **Does this seem straightforward and like a great business idea to dive into?*** **Think again. I’m here to share the real challenges and sophisticated solutions involved in making it work at scale, based on real project experiences.**# Context and MotivationIn recent years, I’ve come across many ideas and projects, ranging from small to large-scale, that involve **scraping data from various sources** to create chatbots, websites, and platforms in industries such as **automotive, real estate, marketing, and e-commerce**. While many technical blogs provide general recommendations across different sources with varying complexity, they often lack specific solutions or long-term approaches and techniques that show how to deal with these challenges on a daily basis in production. In this series, I aim to fill that gap by presenting **real-world examples with concrete techniques and practices**.Drawing from my experience with well-known titans in the automotive industry, I’ll discuss **large-scale production challenges** in projects reliant on these sources. This includes:* **Handling page structure changes*** **Avoiding IP bans*** **Overcoming anti-spam measures*** **Addressing fingerprinting*** **Staying undetected / Hiding scraping behavior*** **Maximizing data coverage*** **Mapping reference data across sources*** **Implementing monitoring and alerting systems**Additionally, I will cover the **legal challenges and considerations related to data scraping**.# About the projectThe project is a **web-based distributed microservice system aggregator** designed to gather car offers from the most popular sources across CIS and European countries. This system is built for advanced analytics to address critical questions in the automotive market, including:* **Determining the most profitable way and path to buy a car** at the current moment, considering currency exchange rates, global market conditions, and other relevant factors.* **Assessing whether it is more advantageous to purchase a car from another country** or within the internal market.* **Estimating the average time it takes to sell a specific car model** in a particular country.* **Identifying trends in car prices across different regions.*** **Understanding how economic and political changes impact car sales and prices.**The system maintains and updates a database of around **1 million actual car listings** and stores historical data since **2022**. **In total, it holds over 10 million car listings**, enabling comprehensive data collection and detailed analysis. This extensive dataset helps users make informed decisions in the automotive market by providing valuable insights and trends.# High-level architecture overview[Link to drawio ](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=large-scale-arhictecture.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1H01J4TnB47yhofRdUE3gmuJptIuSmHga%26export%3Ddownload#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22FqT4bm1NmBD6wpKYtjI3%22%7D)**Microservices**: The system is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for specific tasks such as data listing, storage, and analytics. This modular approach ensures that each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. The key microservices include:* **Cars Microservice**: Handles the collection, storage, and updating of car listings from various sources.* **Subscribers Microservice**: Manages user subscriptions and notifications, ensuring users are informed of updates and relevant analytics.* **Analytics Microservice**: Processes the collected data to generate insights and answer key questions about the automotive market.* **Gateway Microservice**: Acts as the entry point for all incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices while managing authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.**Data Scrapers**: Distributed scrapers are deployed to gather car listings from various sources. These scrapers are designed to handle page structure changes, avoid IP bans, and overcome anti-spam measures like finger.**Data Processing Pipeline**: The collected data is processed through a pipeline that includes data cleaning, normalization, and enrichment. This ensures that the data is consistent and ready for analysis.**Storage**: The system uses a combination of relational and non-relational databases to store current and historical data. This allows for efficient querying and retrieval of large datasets.**Analytics Engine**: An advanced analytics engine processes the data to generate insights and answer key questions about the automotive market. This engine uses machine learning algorithms and statistical models.**API Gateway**: The API gateway handles all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices. It also manages authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.**Monitoring and Alerting**: A comprehensive monitoring and alerting system tracks the performance of each microservice and the overall system health. This system is configured with numerous notifications to monitor and track scraping behavior, ensuring that any issues or anomalies are detected and addressed promptly. This includes alerts for changes in page structure and potential anti-scraping measures.# Challenges and Practical RecommendationsBelow are the challenges we faced in our web scraping platform and the practical recommendations we implemented to overcome them. These insights are based on real-world experiences and are aimed at providing you with actionable strategies to handle similar issues.# Challenge: Handling page structure changes# OverviewOne of the most significant challenges in web scraping is handling changes in the structure of web pages. Websites often update their layouts, either for aesthetic reasons or to improve user experience. These changes can break scrapers that rely on specific HTML structures to extract data.# ImpactWhen a website changes its structure, scrapers can fail to find the data they need, leading to incomplete or incorrect data collection. This can severely impact the quality of the data and the insights derived from it, rendering the analysis ineffective.# Recommendation 1: Leverage API EndpointsTo handle the challenge of frequent page structure changes, we shifted from scraping **HTML** to leveraging the underlying **API** endpoints used by web applications (*yes, it’s not always possible*). By inspecting network traffic, identifying, and testing API endpoints, we achieved more stable and consistent data extraction. For example, finding the right API endpoint and parameters can take anywhere from an **hour** to a **week**. In some cases, we logically deduced endpoint paths, while in the best scenarios, we discovered GraphQL documentation by appending `/docs` to the base URL. If you're interested in an in-depth guide on how to find and use these APIs, let me know, and I'll provide a detailed description in following parts.# Recommendation 2: Utilize Embedded Data StructuresSome modern web applications embed structured data within their **HTML** using data structures like **\_NEXTDATA**. This approach can also be leveraged to handle page structure changes effectively.# Recommendation 3: Define Required PropertiesTo control **data quality**, define the **required properties** that **must** **be** **fetched** to **save** and use the **data** for further **analytics**. Attributes from different sources can vary, so it’s critical to define **what is required** based on your **domain model** and future usage. Utilize the **Template Method Pattern** to dictate how and what attributes should be collected during parsing, ensuring **consistency** across all **sources** and all types (HTML, Json) of **parsers.** namespace Example { public abstract class CarParserBase { protected ParseContext ParseContext; protected virtual int PinnedAdsCount => 0; protected abstract string GetDescription(TElement element); protected abstract IEnumerable GetCarsAds(TSource document); protected abstract string GetFullName(TElement element); protected abstract string GetAdId(TElement element); protected abstract string GetMakeName(TElement element); protected abstract string GetModelName(TElement element); protected abstract decimal GetPrice(TElement element); protected abstract string GetRegion(TElement element); protected abstract string GetCity(TElement element); protected abstract string GetSourceUrl(TElement element); // more attributes here private protected List ParseInternal(TSource document, ExecutionContext executionContext) { try { var cars = GetCarsAds(document) .Skip(PinnedAdsCount) .Select(element => { ParseContext = new ParseContext(); ParseContext.City = GetCity(element); ParseContext.Description = GetDescription(element); ParseContext.FullName = GetFullName(element); ParseContext.Make = GetMakeName(element); ParseContext.Model = GetModelName(element); ParseContext.YearOfIssue = GetYearOfIssue(element); ParseContext.FirstRegistration = GetFirstRegistration(element); ParseContext.Price = GetPrice(element); ParseContext.Region = GetRegion(element); ParseContext.SourceUrl = GetSourceUrl(element); return new ParsedCar( fullName: ParseContext.FullName, makeName: ParseContext.Make, modelName: ParseContext.Model, yearOfIssue: ParseContext.YearOfIssue, firstRegistration: ParseContext.FirstRegistration, price: ParseContext.Price, region: ParseContext.Region, city: ParseContext.City, sourceUrl: ParseContext.SourceUrl ); }) .ToList(); return cars; } catch (Exception e) { Log.Error(e, ""Unexpected parsering error...""); throw; } } } }# Recommendation 4: Dual Parsers ApproachIf possible, cover the **parsed** **source** with two types of parsers — **HTML** and **JSON** (via direct access to API). Place them **in priority order** and implement something like **chain-of-responsibility pattern** to have a fallback mechanism if the HTML or JSON structure changes due to updates. This provides a window to update the parsers but requires double effort to maintain both. Additionally, implement rotating priority and the ability to **dynamically** remove or change the priority of parsers in the chain via metadata in storage. This allows for dynamic adjustments without redeploying the entire system.# Recommendation 5: Integration TestsIntegration tests are crucial, even just for local debugging and quick issue identification and resolution. Especially if something breaks in the live environment and logs are not enough to understand the issue, these tests will be invaluable for debugging. Ideally, these tests can be placed inside the CI/CD pipeline, but if the source requires a proxy or advanced techniques to fetch data, maintaining and supporting these tests inside CI/CD can become overly complicated.# Challenge: Avoiding IP bans# OverviewAvoiding IP bans is a critical challenge in web scraping, especially when scraping large volumes of data from multiple sources. Websites implement various anti-scraping measures to detect and block IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior, such as making too many requests in a short period.# ImpactWhen an IP address is banned, the scraper cannot access the target website, resulting in incomplete data collection. Frequent IP bans can significantly disrupt the scraping process, leading to data gaps and potentially causing the entire scraping operation to halt. This can affect the quality and reliability of the data being collected, which is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making.# Common Causes of IP Bans1. **High Request Frequency:** Sending too many requests in a short period.2. **Identical Request Patterns:** Making repetitive or identical requests that deviate from normal user behavior.3. **Suspicious User-Agent Strings:** Using outdated or uncommon user-agent strings that raise suspicion.4. **Lack of Session Management:** Failing to manage cookies and sessions appropriately.5. **Geographic Restrictions:** Accessing the website from regions that are restricted or flagged by the target website.# Recommendation 1: Utilize Cloud Services for DistributionUtilizing cloud services like **AWS Lambda**, **Azure Functions**, or **Google Cloud Functions** can help avoid IP bans. These services have **native** **time** **triggers**, can **scale out well**, run on a **range of IP addresses**, and can be **located** in **different** **regions** close to the real users of the source. This approach distributes the load and mimics genuine user behavior, reducing the likelihood of IP bans.# Recommendation 2: Leverage Different Types of ProxiesEmploying a variety of proxies can help distribute requests and reduce the risk of IP bans. There are three main types of proxies to consider**Datacenter Proxies*** **Pros:** Fast, affordable, and widely available.* **Cons:** Easily detected and blocked by websites due to their non-residential nature.**Residential Proxies*** **Pros:** Use IP addresses from real residential users, making them harder to detect and block.* **Cons:** More expensive and slower than datacenter proxies.**Mobile Proxies*** **Pros:** Use IP addresses from mobile carriers, offering high anonymity and low detection rates.* **Cons:** The most expensive type of proxy and potentially slower due to mobile network speeds.By leveraging a mix of these proxy types, you can better distribute your requests and reduce the likelihood of detection and banning.# Recommendation 3: Use Scraping ServicesServices like [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/), [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/), [Brightdata](https://brightdata.com/) and similar platforms handle much of the heavy lifting regarding scraping and avoiding IP bans. They provide built-in solutions for rotating IP addresses, managing user agents, and avoiding detection. However, these services can be quite expensive. In our experience, we often exhausted a whole month’s plan in a single day due to high data demands. Therefore, these services are best used if budget allows and the data requirements are manageable within the service limits. Additionally, we found that the most complex sources with advanced anti-scraping mechanisms often did not work well with such services.# Recommendation 4: Combine approachesIt makes sense to utilize all the mechanisms mentioned above in a sequential manner, starting from **the lowest** to the **highest** **cost** solutions, using something like **chain-of-responsibility** pattern like was mentioned for different type of parsers above. This approach, similar to the one used for JSON and HTML parsers, allows for a flexible and dynamic combination of strategies. All these strategies can be **stored** and **updated** **dynamically** as metadata in storage, enabling efficient and adaptive scraping operations[Something like this ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hUD-2QxzISBZkjFNSkDcWA.jpeg)# Recommendation 5: Mimic User Traffic PatternsScrapers should be hidden within typical user traffic patterns based on time zones. This means making more requests during the day and almost zero traffic during the night, mimicking genuine user behavior. The idea is to split the parsing schedule frequency into 4–5 parts:* **Peak Load*** **High Load*** **Medium Load*** **Low Load*** **No Load**This approach reduces the chances of detection and banning. Here’s an example parsing frequency pattern for a typical day:https://preview.redd.it/5jc2iwglbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4083d72458642f13688d9ccdb9c6c43e2caf181# Challenge: Overcoming anti-spam measures# OverviewAnti-spam measures are employed by websites to prevent automated systems, like scrapers, from overwhelming their servers or collecting data without permission. These measures can be quite sophisticated, including techniques like user-agent analysis, cookie management, and fingerprinting.# ImpactAnti-spam measures can block or slow down scraping activities, resulting in incomplete data collection and increased time to acquire data. This affects the efficiency and effectiveness of the scraping process.# Common Anti-Spam Measures* **User-Agent Strings**: Websites inspect user-agent strings to determine if a request is coming from a legitimate browser or a known scraping tool. Repeated requests with the same user-agent string can be flagged as suspicious.* **Cookies and Session Management**: Websites use cookies to track user sessions and behavior. If a session appears to be automated, it can be terminated or flagged for further scrutiny.* **TLS Fingerprinting**: This involves capturing details from the **SSL**/**TLS** handshake to create a unique **fingerprint**. Differences in these fingerprints can indicate automated tools.* **TLS Version Detection**: Automated tools might use outdated or less common TLS versions, which can be used to identify and block them.# Complex Real-World Reactions* **Misleading IP Ban Messages**: One challenge we faced was receiving messages indicating that our **IP was banned** (too many requests from your IP). However, the **actual** **issue** was related to **missing** **cookies** for **fingerprinting**. We spent considerable time troubleshooting proxies, only to realize the problem wasn’t with the IP addresses.* **Fake Data Return**: Some websites counter scrapers by returning **slightly** ***altered*** ***data***. For instance, the mileage of a car might be listed **as 40,000 km** when the **actual value is 80,000 km**. This type of defense makes it difficult to determine if the scraper is functioning correctly.* **Incorrect Error Message Reasons**: Servers sometimes return **incorrect** **error** messages, which can **mislead** the scraper about the **actual** **issue**, making troubleshooting more challenging.# Recommendation 1: Rotate User-Agent StringsTo overcome detection based on user-agent strings, **rotate** **user-agent** **strings** regularly. Use a variety of legitimate user-agent strings to **simulate** requests from **different** **browsers** and **devices**. This makes it harder for the target website to detect and block scraping activities based on user-agent patterns.# Recommendation 2: Manage Cookies and SessionsProperly manage cookies and sessions to maintain continuous browsing sessions. Implement techniques to handle cookies as a real browser would, ensuring that your scraper maintains session continuity. This includes storing and reusing cookies across requests and managing session expiration appropriately.**Real-world solution**In one of the **sources** we encountered, **fingerprint** information was embedded within the **cookies**. Without this specific cookie, it was **impossible** to **make** **more** than **5** requests in a **short** **period** without being banned. We discovered that these cookies **could** **only** be **generated** by **visiting** the **main** **page** of the website with a **real/headless** **browser** and waiting **8–10** seconds for the page to fully load. Due to the **complexity**, **performance** concerns, and **high** **volume** of **requests**, using **Selenium** and **headless** browsers for every request was impractical. Therefore, we implemented the following solution:We ran multiple Docker **instances** with **Selenium** installed. These instances **continuously** **visited** the **main** **page**, **mimicking** **user** **authentication**, and **collected** fingerprint cookies. These **cookies** were then **used** in subsequent **high-volume** **scraping** **activities via http request to web server API**, **rotating** them with other **headers** and **proxies** to avoid detection. Thus, we were able to make up to **500,000 requests per day** bypassing the protection.# Recommendation 3: Implement TLS Fingerprinting EvasionTo avoid detection via **TLS** **fingerprinting**, mimic the **SSL**/**TLS** **handshake** of a legitimate **browser**. This involves configuring your scraping tool to use common **cipher suites**, **TLS extensions** and **versions** that match those of **real** **browsers**. Tools and libraries that offer configurable SSL/TLS settings can help in achieving this. [This is](https://scrapfly.io/blog/how-to-avoid-web-scraping-blocking-tls/) **great article** on this topic.**Real-world solution:**One of the sources we scraped started returning **fake** **data** due to issues related to **TLS** **fingerprinting**. To resolve this, we had to create a custom proxy in **Go** to modify parameters such as **cipher suites** and **TLS** **versions**, making our scraper appear as a legitimate browser. This approach required deep customization to handle the SSL/TLS handshake properly and avoid detection. [This is](https://github.com/Skyuzii/SpoofingTlsFingerprint) good example in **Go**.# Recommendation 4: Rotate TLS VersionsEnsure that your scraper supports multiple TLS versions and rotates between them to avoid detection. Using the latest TLS versions commonly used by modern browsers can help in blending in with legitimate traffic.# Challenge: Maximizing Data Coverage# OverviewMaximizing data coverage is essential for ensuring that the scraped data represents the most current and comprehensive information available. One common approach is to fetch listing pages **ordered by** the **creation** **date** from the source system. However, during peak times, new data offers can be created so quickly that **not** **all** offers/ads **can** **be** **parsed** from these pages, leading to gaps in the dataset.# ImpactFailing to capture all new offers can result in incomplete datasets, which affect the accuracy and reliability of subsequent data analysis. This can lead to missed opportunities for insights and reduced effectiveness of the application relying on this data.# Problem Details* **High Volume of New Offers:** During peak times, the number of new offers created can exceed the capacity of the scraper to parse all of them in real-time.* **Pagination Limitations:** Listing pages often have pagination limits, making it difficult to retrieve all new offers if the volume is high.* **Time Sensitivity:** New offers need to be captured as soon as they are created to ensure data freshness and relevance.# Recommendation: Utilize Additional FiltersUse additional filters to split data by **categories**, **locations**, or **parameters** such as **engine types**, **transmission types**, etc. By segmenting the data, you can increase the frequency of parsing for each filter category. This targeted approach allows for more efficient scraping and ensures comprehensive data coverage.# Challenge: Mapping reference data across sources# OverviewMapping reference data is crucial for ensuring consistency and accuracy when integrating data from multiple sources. This challenge is common in various domains, such as **automotive** and **e-commerce**, where different sources may use varying nomenclature for similar entities.# ImpactWithout proper mapping, the data collected from different sources can be fragmented and inconsistent. This affects the quality and reliability of the analytics derived from this data, leading to potential misinterpretations and inaccuracies in insights.# Automotive Domain**Inconsistent Naming Conventions:** Different sources might use different names for the same make, model, or generation. For example, one source might refer to a car model as “**Mercedes-benz v-class**,” while another might call it “**Mercedes v classe**”**Variations in Attribute Definitions:** Attributes such as **engine types**, **transmission types**, and **trim levels** may also have varying names and descriptions across sources.# E-commerce Domain**Inconsistent Category Names:** Different e-commerce platforms might categorize products differently. For instance, one platform might use “**Electronics** \> **Mobile Phones**,” while another might use “**Electronics** \> **Smartphones**.”**Variations in Product Attributes:** Attributes such as brand names, product specifications, and tags can differ across sources, leading to challenges in data integration and analysis.# Recommendation 1: Create a Reference Data DictionaryDevelop a comprehensive **reference data dictionary** that includes all possible **names** and **variations**. This dictionary will serve as the central repository for mapping different names to a **standardized** set of terms. Use **fuzzy** **matching** **techniques** during the data collection stage to ensure that similar terms from **different** **sources** are accurately matched to the standardized terms.# Recommendation 2: Use Image Detection and Classification TechniquesIn cases where **certain** **critical** **attributes**, such as the **generation** of a car model, are not always available from the sources, **image** **detection** and **classification** **techniques** can be employed to identify these characteristics. For instance, using **machine learning** models trained to **recognize** different car **makes**, **models**, and **generations** from **images** can help fill in the gaps when textual data is incomplete or inconsistent. This approach can dramatically **reduce** the amount of **manual** **work** and the need for constant updates to mappings, but it introduces complexity in the **architecture**, **increases** infrastructure **costs**, and can **decrease** **throughput**, **impacting** the **real-time** nature of the data.# Challenge: Implementing Monitoring and Alerting Systems# OverviewImplementing effective **monitoring** and **alerting** systems is **crucial** for maintaining the health and performance of a **web** **scraping** **system**. These systems help detect **issues** **early**, **reduce** **downtime**, and ensure that the data collection process runs smoothly. In the context of web scraping, monitoring and alerting systems need to address specific challenges such as **detecting** **changes** in **source** **websites**, **handling** **anti**\-**scraping** **measures**, and **maintaining** **data** **quality**.# ImpactWithout proper monitoring and alerting, issues can go unnoticed, leading to incomplete data collection, increased downtime, and potentially significant impacts on data-dependent applications. Effective monitoring ensures timely detection and resolution of problems, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the scraping system.# Recommendation: Real-Time Monitoring of Scraping ActivitiesImplement real-time monitoring to track the performance and status of your scraping system. Use tools and dashboards to visualize key metrics such as the number of successful requests, error rates, and data volume. This helps in quickly identifying issues as they occur.https://preview.redd.it/5nwszripbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afb2b969b74185d2fea25cbf3a3035a1e09910b6https://preview.redd.it/pfxjyvtsbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e07abd91acfc6aee485a9926207a032b135b97c# Funny Stories at the EndOur system scraped data continuously from different sources, making it highly sensitive to any downtime or changes in website accessibility. There were numerous instances where our scraping system detected that a website was down or not accessible from certain regions. Several times, our team contacted the support teams of these websites, informing them that “User X from Country Y” couldn’t access their site.In one memorable case, our automated alerts picked up an issue at 6 AM. The website of a popular car listing service was inaccessible from several European countries. We reached out to their support team, providing details of the downtime. The next morning, they thanked us for the heads-up and informed us that they had resolved the issue. It turned out we had notified them before any of their users did!# Final ThoughtsBuilding and maintaining a **web** **scraping** **system** is **not an easy task**.

1k21gd3,"Diskless Kafka: 80% Cheaper, 100% Open",Affectionate_Pool116,dataengineering,"# The Problem **Let’s cut to the chase:** running Kafka in the cloud is expensive. The **inter-AZ replication** is the biggest culprit. There are excellent write-ups on the topic and we don’t want to bore you with yet-another-cost-analysis of Apache Kafka - let’s just agree it costs **A LOT**![1 GiB\/s, with Tiered Storage, 3x fanout Kafka deployment on AWS costs \>3.4 million\/year!](https://preview.redd.it/930a20t0ckve1.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=8971b9c98d984bc34dc2b7e20dc5ef580716d01c)Through elegant cloud-native architectures, proprietary Kafka vendors have found ways to vastly reduce these costs, albeit at higher latency.**We want to democratise this feature and merge it into the open source.**# Enter KIP-1150 [KIP-1150](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1150%3A+Diskless+Topics) proposes a new class of topics in Apache Kafka that delegates replication to object storage. This completely eliminates cross-zone network fees and pricey disks. You may have seen similar features in proprietary products like Confluent Freight and WarpStream - **but now the community is working to getting it into the open source**. With disks out of the hot path, the usual pains—cluster rebalancing, hot partitions and IOPS limits—are also gone. Because data now lives in elastic object storage, users could reduce costs by up to 80%, spin brokers serving diskless traffic in or out in seconds, and inherit low‑cost geo‑replication. Because it’s simply a new type of topic - you still get to keep your familiar sub‑100ms topics for latency‑critical pipelines, and opt-in ultra‑cheap diskless streams for logs, telemetry, or batch data—all in the same cluster.Getting started with diskless is one line: kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --config topic.type=disklessThis can be achieved *without* changing any client APIs and, interestingly enough, modifying just a tiny amount of the Kafka codebase (1.7%).# Kafka’s Evolution**Why did Kafka win?** For a long time, it stood at the very top of the streaming taxonomy pyramid—the most general-purpose streaming engine, versatile enough to support nearly any data pipeline. Kafka didn’t just win because it is versatile—it won precisely because it **used disks**. Unlike memory-based systems, Kafka uniquely delivered high throughput and low latency without sacrificing reliability. It handled backpressure elegantly by decoupling producers from consumers, storing data safely on disk until consumers caught up. Most competing systems held messages in memory and would crash as soon as consumers lagged, running out of memory and bringing entire pipelines down.**But why is Kafka so expensive in the cloud?** Ironically, the same disk-based design that initially made Kafka unstoppable have now become its Achilles’ heel in the cloud. Unfortunately replicating data through local disks just so also happens to be heavily taxed by the cloud providers. The real culprit is the **cloud pricing model itself** \- not the original design of Kafka - but we must address this reality. With Diskless Topics, Kafka’s story comes full circle. Rather than eliminating disks altogether, Diskless abstracts them away—leveraging object storage (like S3) to keep costs low and flexibility high. Kafka can now offer the best of both worlds, combining its original strengths with the economics and agility of the cloud.# Open SourceWhen I say **“we”,** I’m speaking for Aiven — I’m the Head of Streaming there, and we’ve poured months into this change. We decided to open source it because even though our business’ leads come from open source Kafka users, our incentives are strongly aligned with the community. If Kafka does well, Aiven does well. Thus, if our Kafka managed service is reliable and the cost is attractive, many businesses would prefer us to run Kafka for them. We charge a management fee on top - but it is always worthwhile as it saves customers more by eliminating the need for dedicated Kafka expertise. **Whatever we save in infrastructure costs, the customer does too!** Put simply, **KIP-1150** is a win for Aiven and a win for the community.# Other GainsDiskless topics can do a lot more than reduce costs by >80%. Removing state from the Kafka brokers results in significantly less operational overhead, as well as the possibility of new features, including:* **Autoscale in seconds:** without persistent data pinned to brokers, you can spin up and tear down resources on the fly, matching surges or drops in traffic without hours (or days) of data shuffling. * **Unlock multi-region DR out of the box**: by offloading replication logic to object storage—already designed for multi-region resiliency—you get cross-regional failover at a fraction of the overhead. * **No More IOPS Bottlenecks**: Since object storage handles the heavy lifting, you don’t have to constantly monitor disk utilisation or upgrade SSDs to avoid I/O contention. In Diskless mode, your capacity effectively scales with the cloud—not with the broker. * **Use multiple Storage Classes** (e.g., [S3 Express](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/up-to-85-price-reductions-for-amazon-s3-express-one-zone/))**:** Alternative storage classes keep the same agility while letting you fine‑tune cost versus performance—choose near‑real‑time tiers like S3 Express when speed matters, or drop to cheaper archival layers when latency can relax.Our hope is that by lowering the cost for streaming we expand the horizon of what is streamable and make Kafka economically viable for a whole new range of applications.

1k66f2e,"Are Delta tables a good option for high volume, real-time data?",StriderAR7,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I was doing a POC with Delta tables for a real-time data pipeline and started doubting if Delta even is a good fit for high-volume, real-time data ingestion. Here’s the scenario: - We're consuming data from multiple Kafka topics (about 5), each representing a different stage in an event lifecycle. - Data is ingested every 60 seconds with small micro-batches. (we cannot tweak the micro batch frequency much as near real-time data is a requirement)- We’re using Delta tables to store and upsert the data based on unique keys, and we’ve partitioned the table by date. While Delta provides great features like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel, I’m running into issues with table bloat. Despite only having a few days’ worth of data, the table size is growing rapidly, and optimization commands aren’t having the expected effect. From what I’ve read, Delta can handle real-time data well, but there are some challenges that I'm facing in particular:- File fragmentation: Delta writes new files every time there’s a change, which is result in many files and inefficient storage (around 100-110 files per partition - table partitioned by date). - Frequent Upserts: In this real-time system where data is constantly updated, Delta is ending up rewriting large portions of the table at high frequency, leading to excessive disk usage. - Performance: For very high-frequency writes, the merge process is becoming slow, and the table size is growing quickly without proper maintenance. To give some facts on the POC: The realtime data ingestion to delta ran for 24 hours full, the physical accumulated was 390 GB, the count of rows was 110 million.The main outcome of this POC for me was that there's a ton of storage overhead as the data size stacks up extremely fast!For reference, the overall objective for this setup is to be able to perform near real time analytics on this data and use the data for ML.Has anyone here worked with Delta tables for high-volume, real-time data pipelines? Would love to hear your thoughts on whether they’re a good fit for such a scenario or not.",35,0.95,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k66f2e/are_delta_tables_a_good_option_for_high_volume/,2025-04-23 18:24:15,2025-04-25 01:38:11

1k3wpp9,I've been testing LLMs for data transformations and results have been great,arctic_radar,dataengineering,"There are two main reasons why I've been testing this. First, in scenarios where you have hundreds of different data sources each with similar data but varying schemas, doing transformations with an LLM would mean you don't have to write hundreds of different transformation processes. manage all of them etc. Additionally, when the those sources inevitably alter their schemas slightly, you don't have to worry about your rigid transformation processes breaking.The next use case I had in mind was enriching the data by using the LLM to make inferences that would be time-consuming or even impossible to do with traditional code. For simple example, I had a field that contained mix of individual and business names. Some of my sources included a field that indicated the entity type, others did not. I found that the LLM was very accurate not only for determining whether the entity was an individual or not, but also ignoring the records that did have this indicator already. I've also tested more complex inference logic with similarly accurate results. I was able to build a single prompt that does several transformations and inferences all at the same time, receiving validated structured output from the LLM. From there, the data goes through a more traditional SQL transformation process.I really thought there would be more issues with hallucination, but so far that just hasn't been the case. The only inaccuracies I've found were in edge cases that would have caused issues with traditional transformations as well. To be fair, I'm using context amounts that are much, much smaller than the models are supposedly capable of dealing with and I suspect if I increased the context I would start to see issues. I first did some limited testing on this over a year ago, and while I remember being surprised then by how well it worked, the cost made it viable for only small datasets. I just thought it was a neat trick and didn't give it much more thought. But now the models are 20x cheaper in some cases. They are cheap enough now that I can run the same prompt through multiple models and flag anytime they disagree, which is almost always tends to be edge cases when both models were confused because the data itself had issues.I'm wondering if anyone else has tested similar processes and, if so, how did your results look? I know my use case may be niche, but I have to think this approach is going to gain popularity as these models get cheaper and more capable over the years.",16,0.84,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k3wpp9/ive_been_testing_llms_for_data_transformations/,2025-04-20 21:14:46,2025-04-25 01:38:11

We use a fairly modern stack: Snowflake, Databricks, Airflow, AWS, etc.A technical recruiter from Meta recently reached out to say they’re hiring DEs (L4/L5) and invited me to begin technical interviews.I’m torn on what decision would be best for my career: Should I pursue the opportunity at Meta, or stay in my current role and keep building?Here are some things I’m weighing:* Prestige: Having work experience at a company like Meta could open doors for me in the future.* Tech stack: I’ve heard Meta uses mostly in-house tools (some open sourced), and I worry that might hurt future job transitions where industry-standard tools are more relevant.* Role scope: I’ve read that DEs at Meta may do work closer to analytics engineering. I enjoy analytics, but I’d miss the more technical DE aspects.* Compensation: I’m currently making \~$160K base + pre-IPO equity + bonus potential. Meta’s base range is similar, but equity would likely be more valuable and far lower risk.* Location: My current role is entirely remote.

I've observed a concerning trend: people working on managed services projects are often engaged throughout the entire day, handling both ETL support and ad-hoc tasks.For those unfamiliar with the Data Engineering role, let me explain what ad-hoc and ETL support tasks typically involve. **Ad-hoc tasks** refer to daily activities such as data validations, new development, modifying data sources, preparing data for frontend and ML teams, and more. **ETL support**, on the other hand, is usually provided outside of standard working hours—often at night—and involves resolving issues and fixing bugs in data pipelines.The main problem is that the same resource who works a full 9–5 shift is also expected to wake up at night for ETL support whenever it's needed. ETL errors typically occur 2–3 times a week, and these support tasks can take anywhere from 1 to 5 hours, depending on their complexity and urgency.My concern is whether this practice is common across the industry?

I'm trying to understand the ins and outs of various solutions for the task of reading/writing diverse types of very large data. From a theoretical standpoint, I understand that Iceberg is a standard for organizing metadata about files. Metadata organized to the Iceberg standard allows for the creation of ""Iceberg tables"" that can be queried with a familiar SQL-like syntax.I'm trying to understand how this would fit into a real world scenario... For example, lets say I use object storage, and there are a bunch of pre-existing parquet files and maybe some images in there. Could be anything...**Question 1:** How is the metadata/tables initially generated for all this existing data? I know AWS has the Glue Crawler. Is something like that used? Or do you have to manually create the tables, and then somehow point the tables to the correct parquet files that contain the data associated with that table?**Question 2:** Okay, now assume I have object storage and metadata/tables all generated for files in storage. Someone comes along and drops a new parquet file into some bucket. I'm assuming that I would need some orchestration utility that is monitoring my storage and kicking off some script to add the new data to the appropriate tables? Or is it done some other way?**Question 3:** I assume that there are query engines out there that are implemented to the Iceberg standard for creating and reading Iceberg metadata/tables, and fetching data based on those tables. For example, I've read that SparkQL and Trino have Iceberg ""connectors"". So essentially the power of Iceberg can't be leveraged if your tech stack doesn't implement compliant readers/writers?

1k6xfby,Query runs longer than your AWS bill. How do I improve it,YameteGPT,dataengineering,"Hey folks,So I have this query that joins two table, selects a few columns, runs a dense rank and then filters to keep only the rank 1s. Pretty simple right ?Here’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. So, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.Yes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. And it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. But the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details.

Data is initially generated and stored on an air-gapped network. 3. Data will be moved into a lab by detaching hard-drives. There, we will need to retain some raw data for regulatory purposes, and we will also want to perform ETL into an analytical database/warehouse. I have a lot of time to refine these before implementation time, and specific technologies are flexible. but next week I wan to present a *reasonable* view of the types of solutions we might use.

Today, it's been almost 8 months since I started applying (even before I graduated), but without success.

At the end of my internship, I learned that unlike internships in the US, where it's considered a trial period to get hired, here in France it's considered more like a way to get some work done for cheap... well, especially in big companies. I understand that it's not always like that, but that's what I've noticed from many students.Anyway, during those few months after the internship, I started learning tools like Spark, AWS, and some of Airflow.

For obvious reasons I don't want to do something like open 20 concurrent connections to a production database. I already bumped up the number of concurrent connections to 12 and some nodes are still running out of memory, probably because the data is not evenly distributed by the partition column.I also ran into cases where the Spark job would pull all the partitions from the same executor, which makes no sense.

For example, going through and doing the Leetcode questions now ""14. Longest Common Prefix"" - I have no idea where I would even begin.

So I've been programming for the past 8-7 years now, I think? I'm 20 rn and I started at like 12 or something just dabbling around with Python + some html css (they're not programming languages but you know, intro stuff). I've always been kind of off with my math back then and was horrible at it. I've always just approached the problems in my code with just intuitive problem solving. You know, things that might just work.These past months though, I've been getting really interested in math. So much so, that it has replaced my hobby of progamming (lol). What I noticed though was just how different I think about certain concepts. For example, functions. Back then, I kind of just thought of this as some wrapper of code that I can call whenever I wanted to. But getting to learn more about them in Calculus and how much I can manipulate them, it has also translated to my programming skills. Instead of just a wrapper for my code, I treat them now like actual items that take in parameters and spits out an output. Of course like, duh, but it really has changed my perspective and style on how I code now. Back then, it's more programming first then do the math to check. Now, it's math first, and let my code check if my math was correct. If it's correct, my code runs. If not, then math was wrong.I just wanted to share this insight with you guys who may be struggling to grasp some concepts in programming. Maybe, learning where these concepts came from might actually give you a deeper understanding of what they actually do.",306,0.97,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k5tzx5/learning_math_made_learning_programming_easier/,2025-04-23 08:21:38,2025-04-25 01:38:12

For context, I have 2 years of work experience, meaning I'm a junior dev:## Don't learn many languages""Jack of all trades"" only applies at the mid-senior level. In junior->mid level, you should pick one language and framework and stick with it! Even if you want to do full-stack (React + Backend) you should pick a focus between the two.

I initially applied for machine learning/computer vision (my major at school) openings, but since there is no way I ever get one of those, I've widely reduced the importance of what I'd like to do in order to send more applications.Even when I get to go to the technical tests, and perform (I have had platforms telling me things like you performed better than 95% of candidates), I still get rejected without getting to the interview phase, ""we've had a lot of competitive applicants bla bla bla"". The only interviews I got are from Belgian societies, refusing me even though they don't pay their interns. I mean, even for free (for them bc it would be a lot of money for me to get there), they wouldn't have me work for them ??? This is just crazy.I have already worked half-time for more than 4 years alongside my studies, meaning that I have at the very least 2 years of full-time professional software engineering and that seems to not count at all, I've even had interviewers telling it didn't count as experience and that I was a junior with less knowledge than a student who wouldn't have worked during his studies (I admit that I left the interview after hearing this bs)I tried many different things on my resume & letters to not get rejected by the automated TAS. Many people reviewed what I sent, so I don't think that the problem comes from there.I mean, how are we supposed to find internships in CS ? Is this really the result of those 5 years of studies ? Absolutely no consideration from companies that I'd love to work for ? I'm losing my mind over this..That feeling of rejection/not being enough, even though I have proven multiple times that I can provide valuable workforce to campanies is just unbearable. Having people telling me that I should persist is now my new most listened song of 2025, but you guessed it : not my favorite.Sometimes it makes me want to scream after thinking of all those efforts to apply that won't ever bring me anything but sadness and despair.Finally, I don't understand why I should intern to graduate. How in the world can I not already look for a fucking job and call it a day since I already validated all the exams ? This just feel like I have to be a poorly paid (or not paid at all) person to graduate, even though the reason for that is absolutely unclear.Sorry if this is a little out of subject, I just wanted to share my experience of looking for internships after having decided, in 2019, that I wanted to learnprogramming.

Having to compile a program and using Makefiles seems like a better introduction to build systems and why we have them than the Python interpreter which just runs your code.

But since I'm a total beginner when it comes to learning how to program, I'm not quite sure where or how to begin.I've checked out websites like CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp. They're great in terms of explaining concepts, almost like dictionaries, but I find it hard tot transition from theory to actually building and applying what I've learned. That's where I feel stuck. What I'm not saying is that CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp and such websites are bad. It's just that because of my lack of knowledge and experience that I don't know where to begin. It could even be that after all recommendations I would apply for CodeAcademy or FCC even, its just that I don't know yet.Ideally I'm looking for a learning platform that balances **teaching core concepts** (like how API's work, how to build them) **with hands-on projects** so I can apply what I'm learning as I go. I'm willing to pay- my budget is up to 40 dollars a month, but I also want to make sure that I'm choosing a platform that helps me build confidence and skills gradually, not just throw everything at me at once.Luckily my job gives me time during working hours to invest in this learning journey, so I'd love to make the most of it.

I honestly don’t know how this doesn't qualify, since I’m trying to understand a conceptual difference.Anyway, here's my question.I got the structure of the `Memory` chip from GitHub. Everyone seems to be using the same implementation, and it works fine in simulation without any errors: CHIP Memory { IN in[16], load, address[15]; OUT out[16]; PARTS: DMux4Way(in=load, sel=address[13..14], a=loadram1, b=loadram2, c=loadscreen, d=loadkbd); Or(a=loadram1, b=loadram2, out=loadram); RAM16K(in=in, load=loadram, address=address[0..13], out=ramout); Screen(in=in, load=loadscreen, address=address[0..12], out=scrout); Keyboard(out=kbout); Mux4Way16(a=ramout, b=ramout, c=scrout, d=kbout, sel=address[13..14], out=out); }Now, based on this design, I expected the following code to read a value from the keyboard and store it into `RAM[1]`: (loop) @24577 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPHere's my reasoning:* `@24577` sets the A register to 24577.* That value is passed to the Memory chip as the address.* The most significant bits (bits 13 and 14) are both 1, so according to the HDL, the `Keyboard` chip should be selected.* So `out` should reflect the keyboard's output.* Then `D=M` loads the keyboard value into the D register.* `@1` sets A to 1, and `M=D` writes the value to RAM\[1\].Now, here’s my confusion: How is this different from the following? (loop) @24576 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPBoth 24576 and 24577 have the same top two bits (13 and 14 = 11), so shouldn't they both route to the keyboard? Why would one work differently from the other if the given chip structure is true?edit: in the code section some parts were typed as “u/…” instead of “@…” . I fixed them.

For example:* Some of my APIs return a Response object, while others return plain dict objects. This inconsistency feels extremely wrong.* I still don’t know how to implement a secure authentication system—a task that will likely fall to me soon.* To simulate real-time updates, I’m currently polling an API twice per second.

1k5y2ma,Big O notation and general misunderstanding,divad1196,learnprogramming,"Disclaimer: this post is also to vent.I got into a debate on something that I didn't think was so badly understood. The debate was with people claiming that ""big O notation is just counting the number of instructions"" and ""you must abstract away things like CPU"".These claims are formally incorrect and only apply for specific contexts. The big O (and little o) notation is a mathematical concept to explain how something grow. It is never mentionned ""instruction"" as this isn't a mathematical concept. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)The reason why we ""abstract"" the CPU, and other stuff, is because if 2 algorithms run on the same computer, we can expect them be impacted in the same way. ""All instruction take the same time"" (not all instruction take the same time, but the execution duration of an instruction is considered majored by a constant. A constant doesn't impact the growth, we can define this number to be `1`). In **simple** cases, the time is a function of the the number of instruction `n`, something like `duration(n) -> INSTRUCTION_DT * n` When you compare 2 univariate (""mono-variadic"") algorithms in the same context, you get things like `dt * n_1 > dt * n_2`. For `dt > 0`, you can simplify the comparison with `n_1 > n_2`.Similarly, when the number of instruction is fix on one side and vary on the other side, then it's easier to approximate a constant by `1`. The big O notation cares about the growth, there is none and that's all we care about, so replace a constant by 1 makes sense.Back to the initial point: we don't ""count the instruction"" or ""abstract"" something. We are trying to define how somethings grows.Now, the part where I vent.The debate started because I agreed with someone's example on an algorithm with a time complexity of `O(1/n)`. The example of code was `n => sleep(5000/n)`.The response I got was ""it's 1 instruction, so O(1)` and this is incorrect. `O(1)` in time complexity would mean: ""even if I change the value of N, the program will take the same time to finish"" whereas it is clear here that the bigger N is, the faster the program finishes.If I take the opposite example: `n => sleep(3600 * n)` and something like `Array(n).keys().reduce((a, x) => a + x))`Based on their response, the first one has a time complexity of `O(1)` and the second one `O(n)`. Based on that, the first one should be faster, which is never the case.Same thing with space complexity: does `malloc(sizeof(int) * 10)` has the same space complexity has `malloc(sizeof(int) * n)` ? No. The first one is `O(1)` because it doesn't grow, while the second one is `O(n)`The reason for misunderstanding the big O notation is IMO:- school simplify the context (which is okay)- people using it never got the context.Of course, that's quite a niche scenario to demonstrate the big O misconception. But it exposes an issue that I often see in IT: people often have a narrow/contextual understanding on things. This causes, for example, security issues. Yet, most people will prefer to stick to their believes than learning.Additional links (still wikipedia, but good enough)- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory (see ""Important Complexity Classes"")- DTIME complexity: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTIME",2,0.54,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k5y2ma/big_o_notation_and_general_misunderstanding/,2025-04-23 12:36:19,2025-04-25 01:38:12

1k41sgk,"What is a high level programming language in a computer? More guidance on CLI and local developer environments, please!",BenjaminFinestone,learnprogramming,"I'm trying to think from a first principles perspective about what a non-binary program is in a computer, before it is compiled into machine code. I may type, say, Javascript, or Dart, and I see text like ""let varName = ""example"" "". But, if a computer is made out of 1's and 0's in electrical logic gate representations, is not this text being displayed to me already 1's and 0's? The question being, what is a non-binary language in a computer \*before\* a compiler? When I type an English-esq programming language, and I have the visual illusion of this tool writing in an easy plain language, like Python or JS, etc, what is that text that I am reading before it gets compiled? What is that in a computer? How is that different from the end binary of a compiler? What does a compiler do? Question put from idea into time: when I finish writing a program in an easy to read programming language (I.E., not binary), and then I enter a command into a terminal line to run a compiler to compile it, and then it compiles it, and run it, what is the object inside the computer across this timeline, and how is it changing across this process? What is the easy to read programming language before and after compilation inside the computer?This question has grown out of a confusion about setting up a developer environment, with command lines and language-specific SDK's, and I am just trying to understand the developer environment, and what it is I am doing when I set up things like a Dart SDK for Flutter. Windows as a developer environment confuses me, because I don't have a framework of understanding of how all these downloadable packages have an organization schema with Windows in Windows Powershell. I am starting to look into Linux, with an integrated terminal; it seems much more organized to me. When I run a command on windows, and I am not sure about all this package stuff (I am a n00b learning), and Windows doesn't recognize it, I'm not sure what various different things are or aren't, because I don't have paradigms or conceptual frameworks to organize this. Clueless and lost. Tl;dr I tried to get Dart to run a basic ""Hello World!"" program, because I want to make an app with Flutter, but VS Code terminal wouldn't understand it, because I did not set up the developer environment correctly with the SDK. Now I've realized I don't understand a local developer environment, and I am taking a step back to understand CLI, terminals, and understanding the general organization of these things in a computer and what it even means to execute a CLI command, and for an operating system like Windows (in this case, Windows Powershell) to recognize new commands from new SDK packages and how it even locates/registers stuff like that in the computer (and thus also understand why it wouldn't be registering commands during failed attempts to use all this stuff). \*I don't understand local developer environments.\*",4,1.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k41sgk/what_is_a_high_level_programming_language_in_a/,2025-04-21 01:27:07,2025-04-25 01:38:12

His coworkers and management were nice and welcoming, and the company was very stable and recession proof. He also only had to go into the office once a week. He had time to go to the gym, spend time with family, and even work on side projects if he felt like itBut then he got tempted by the FAANG name and the idea of a shiny new title and what looked like better pay and more exciting projects, so he made the jump, thinking he was leveling up, thinking he was finally joining the big leaguesFrom day one it was a completely different world, the job was fully on-site so he was back to commuting every day, the hours were brutal, and even though nobody said it out loud there was a very clear expectation to be constantly online, constantly responsive, and always pushing for moreHe went from having quiet mornings and freedom to structure his day to 8 a.m. standups, nonstop back-to-back meetings, toxic coworkers who acted like they were in some competition for who could look the busiest, and managers who micromanaged every last detail while pretending to be laid-backHe was putting in 50 to 60 hours a week just trying to stay afloat and it was draining the life out of him, but he kept telling himself it was worth it for the resume boost and the name recognition and then just three months in, he got the layoff emailNo warning, no internal transfer, no fallback plan, just a cold goodbye and a severance package, and now he’s sitting at home unemployed in a terrible market, completely burned out, regretting ever leaving that insurance job where people actually treated each other like human beingsAnd the worst part is I watched him change during those months, it was like the light in him dimmed a little every week, he started looking tired all the time, less present, shorter on the phone, always distracted, talking about how he felt like he was constantly behind, constantly proving himself to people who didn’t even know his nameHe used to be one of the most relaxed, easygoing guys I knew, always down for a beer or a pickup game or just to chill and talk about life, but during those months it felt like he aged five years, and when he finally called me after the layoff it wasn’t just that he lost the job, it was like he’d lost a piece of himself in the processTo make it worse, his old role was already filled, and it’s not like you can just snap your fingers and go back, that bridge is gone, and now he’s in this weird limbo where he’s applying like crazy but everything is frozen or competitive or worse, fake listings meant to fish for resumesI’ve seen this happen to more than one person lately and I’m telling you, if you’re in a solid job right now with decent pay, decent hours, and a company that isn’t on fire, you don’t need to chase the dream of some big tech title especially not in a market like thisRight now, surviving and keeping your sanity is the real win, and that “boring” job might be the safest bet you’ve gotBe careful out there",5072,0.95,454,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k41ad2/reminder_if_youre_in_a_stable_software/,2025-04-21 01:00:37,2025-04-25 01:38:13

I'd rather not take a pay cut, but boy it looks like I would have to -- even after allowing for benefits etc in the calculation. So what's going on here? Are we just still kind of reshuffling from shift to remote work?

1k2dn78,"Engineer started my coding challenge timer 5 mins early, abruptly ended call for going THREE min over.",ThrowRADisgruntledF,cscareerquestions,"This is more of a vent but I had an absolutely ridiculous candidate screening experience. The funny thing is, it started off really well! I have 8 YOE and this was for a senior level position. The screener and I were vibing, I was nailing the technical questions. Then it was time for the coding challenge: screener emailed instructions, said I’d have 20 mins, and promised to give me a 10 min warning and a warning before time was up. This was literally the easiest coding challenge I've ever seen in a candidate screening. I shared my screen, clarified instructions before starting, and was ready to go.Right then, the screener's mic died. We spent about 5 mins troubleshooting, he left/rejoined, I left/rejoined, he even got new AirPods. Finally, audio fixed, I started the challenge.I created a folder and three files via command line, pasted some boilerplate HTML/CSS, did a quick google search (allowed per instructions) and found my answer immediately, right then I'm told there's 10 mins left. I briefly thought ""there is no way that took 10 mins"" but moved on. I finished the minimum requirements shortly after, confirmed out loud it met the spec and that I was effectively done. He hadn't indicated time running out, so I asked if I should adjust CSS to make the output more visible, he said ""sure,"" so I did. Still hadn’t announced time, so I ask “do you want me to keep going?” he shrugs lol. Eventually, I asked explicitly if there were edge cases or another part to the coding challenge bc he was making no verbal indications of anything, he said no and asked me to email my code.I'm super stoked because I know I just nailed that challenge, until he abruptly says he's ending the screening early because I went THREE MINUTES OVER and asks if I have any questions. So I asked if I’d missed a requirement, how long candidates are expected to take (the full 20 mins), if I missed an edge case, etc. Nothing was amiss. So why? Because I went ***three*** minutes over and he didn’t think I would be able to complete the virtual onsite (the next round) in time lmao.After the call (feeling completely demoralized by the cold ending), I checked the timestamps of when he sent the instructions and when I emailed my code. Only 21 mins in between each email, meaning I didn't actually go over, he likely started the timer early due to HIS mic issues. So I sent a polite, non accusatory follow up email letting him know this because he may have not realized and cc’ed the recruiter. No response, I was ghosted.I get that companies owe candidates nothing, but asking for 40+ hours upfront for a take home project (I did not spend 40 hours on mine, and I also will never do one again bc of this experience) then rejecting over something so trivial is absurd. Even if I had gone over, I aced that screening. I double checked my work after, sent it to ChatGPT, it was solid. Also, again, literally the easiest challenge I’ve ever done and pretty insulting to be told I failed it.I probably dodged a bullet, but still needed to vent.

1k6c2it,Actual career advice: Don’t argue with your manager (especially with feedback),mpaes98,cscareerquestions,"Wanted to share an anecdotal wisdom I’ve developed that I continue to see early career professionals do that hurts them; voicing disagreement with your manager will 99% of the time hurt you. Let’s say your manager corrects you over something that wasn’t your fault. In that case, trying to make an argument that you aren’t responsible for something is more likely to make you seem like you can’t take accountability.Or, in a feedback session, you get negative reviews from them on your performance for what seems like arbitrary reasons and you want to give an explanation/justification. In this case, there’s no explaining away what they’ve decided. You’re more likely to come off as insecure and argumentative for talking back.I’m not going to give a speech about how maybe you need to do self-reflection and practice humility; sometimes you’ll be in the right and you know you’re in the right. But career-wise, being right < manager being pleased.90% of the time, your manager has already made up his mind on how he feels about a situation.Part of your manager’s role is assessing your performance and giving feedback. So when you push back, not only are you expressing that you disagree with their opinion, you’re also coming across that you think you are better at their job than them (maybe you are?).I write this because I’m usually a self-advocate outside of work, but I’ve gotten to a point where I have to tell myself “it’s not worth it” quite a bit because of how important it is to not be a problem employee in this economy. The best recoveries I’ve had when I’m given feedback or told negative things (that I personally feel like are not my fault) is to not disagree or try to explain, it’s just thank them for the feedback and keep working.",249,0.89,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6c2it/actual_career_advice_dont_argue_with_your_manager/,2025-04-23 22:15:50,2025-04-25 01:38:13

Just two days ago, I found out from some of my co-workers that my startup might go under within a year or two.

Instead, they acquired another software company, and I’m solely responsible for maintaining and fixing bugs in that software. I have three years of experience as a full-stack developer, and in this company, I’m the only one working on this project. I’ve learned a lot over the past year, but after hearing this news, I just feel awful and completely clueless about what to do.I wouldn’t mind as much if this were a remote job, but I actually moved across states to this city because it’s an in-office position. It’s hard to get interviews these days, and when I do get them, most interviewers expect me to be available during work hours, which is difficult since my company isn’t very flexible with time off. I used to work 10-hour days, but my health took a toll, and I was diagnosed with hypertension at just 25. I'm now on medication and had just started setting personal boundaries. I joined a gym, began eating healthy, and made it a point to arrive and leave work on time. Things were starting to look up — but hearing this news killed what little motivation I had left.I also deal with anxiety, and interviews are a nightmare for me. I tend to completely blank out to the point where I can’t even answer simple questions. I don't know how to divide my time to properly prepare, and I’m not sure how to present myself as a capable software engineer on my resume.Right now, I feel completely lost and broken.

We feel lost about the fact that we were hired to help develop software but the circumstances don't help us grow or be better developers. In fact I feel like I am unlearning everything I learnt at uni because I cannot utilize it in the current architecture that is very customized from the general state of the art approaches I've usually been familiar with. We hardly get any support or feedback and it just sucks. Everytime we ask for structural changes and support we have to solve the issues ourselves.

Not positive I want to move yet, otherwise this would be the deciding factorStartup pros:- Higher potential payout- More exciting- Feel more valued by the company, more upward mobility - Great office vibeIf the startup hits series C, comp would pull slightly ahead of CB. Any further growth would expand that lead. I’ve done my research and feel good about the growth potential, but there’s always the risk it doesn’t pan out, especially with the current economic situation.One reason I decided to look at other jobs was my company returning to office 5 days a week. The commute sucks and I’m not a fan of the office. So remote sounds nice. That said, the startup is walkable, and I actually loved the vibe during my visits for interviews.I do have to be honest, I don’t push myself as hard working remote, and I think working in an office would boost my output/career growthInitially, I was leaning heavily toward CB, but the startup has been persistent, and I feel very valued by them.

Fairly personal each time so it’s felt authentic. Guess I’m not immune to flattery, because feeling so appreciated has me doubting my decision.I’d expect crazy hours from the startup, they’ve been transparent about expectations and it seems working late nights and weekends is not uncommon. I don’t prefer that, but if I really enjoy the work I think I’d be ok with it.I’m not sure how much I’m romanticizing the “fulfilling work/make more of an impact” aspect of the startup. My only experience has been with a big tech company, and the idea of working on something new without all the corporate song and dance seems refreshing.Ultimately it’s a personal decision, but I’m hoping for some insight from people who’ve gone down either path.

1k6nwhk,"Torn between SE, ES and ML",louleads,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR : I have built some projects in ES and SE and liked ES a bit more but find SE to have more opportunities even though it might become so boring and hellish. Didn't try building any ML projects but I think ML jobs will be highly demanded in the future due to the fast progress of AI and what people are saying online (maybe thats just hype).I can't decide between software engineering, embedded systems and machine learning. I like them all and have had experience with some of them but I know that I can't be a jack of all trades.For embedded systems, I have built 2 arduino projects back in high school (currently I'm in my second year of CS uni). First one was a basic project with some LEDs and some code to make the LEDs light in different ways. Second one was a car that follows a black line and avoids obstacles. I really enjoyed and loved it. Though I have no idea what the market is for ES.For software engineering, I have not made any full projects, just some basic terminal projects, like fizzbuzz and some python scripts that automated some tasks for me. I'm currently in the process of making my first uni project (a games library with search and user authentification functionalities). I'm also going to have an internship this summer as a web dev. I enjoyed the small projects a lot, but I don't know how I'll feel about this project by the time I finish it or about the web dev internship. However, I think I have the best chance at this since I'm from a third world country and I think finding jobs in SE would be easier (not easy, just easier).For machine learning, I haven't tried anything yet. I have planned a final project for my bachelors, which is going to be an AI customer support agent (a family member has a business and suggested I try making that tool for their business). I don't know anything about ML, but I know it requires a lot of math, and I've been a math nerd since high school (solved about 1000+ math problems in my last year of high school). I also think that ML will be a ""goldmine"" for those who choose it now because I keep seeing online that ML jobs will be in high demand in the future.I know I'm deciding what I want to do based on my feelings, but I want to choose something that I'm not gonna regret by the time I turn 30. For example, I like some aspects of software engineering, but I do know that many software engineers hate their jobs because of how shit the work environment is in many companies (too many meetings, coding the same shit everyday...etc).What should I base my decision on? Preference? Market state? Opportunities?And how should I know if I actually enjoy any of these (if I should choose based on passion)?I appreciate anybody who took the time to read this.",4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6nwhk/torn_between_se_es_and_ml/,2025-04-24 09:22:39,2025-04-25 01:38:13

1k68wj7,Dilemma: 6 Month Study Plan - What Language/Stack?,Danakazii,cscareerquestions,"Long story short, I have a safety net of around 6 months before I would 'need' to find a job (staying with parents etc, so no financial burden like rent/mortgage).I'm dedicating around **1000 hours** (+/- at around 45 hours per week incl. weekends) to learn a stack/system/framework that will see me ready for employment at the end of it.\----------------------------Here's some facts to know:\- I have 18 months professional experience as a Frontend developer working on JS/React/Next/MUI at a SME with <50 people. I was made redundant and was still very much a junior due to poor structure, management and tasks.\- I am completing my part-time MSc in Software Development that focusses on Java.\- I will not be working during this study time. My time will be 100% spent on this study plan.\----------------------------Here's the dilemma: I know it sounds like a given to just stick to frontend or atleast JavaScript, but here's the thing - **I don't want to end up in front end again**. I found the whole process tedious and perhaps I had a bad experience but I was doing nothing but working on the buttons the whole 18 months (seriously). I thoroughly enjoy UI/UX and believe in amazing interfaces to build products, but the actual pixel pushing part became very tiresome. This is the crossroad I am in at the moment:1. I've been thoroughly enjoying Java through my studies. Yes, it's not enterprise level at the moment (as I am in Year 1 of 3), but the whole jump from JS to Java has been great. I struggled on the foundations of JS but picked up and mastered them in Java. I know Java is still such a strong language for graduate roles, entry roles and for future proof, roles in FinTech, Government and FAANG types. I would love to be able to go down this path to secure a strong role somewhere and build my career this way. I know there is a harder barrier to entry here. I am willing to put in time to Leetcode, DSA and Algorithms too, in fact I want to.2. Given my previous experience in JS, I can knuckle down and use the 6 months to go over JS again, convert it all to learning TypeScript and go hard into mid-level React and Next.js knowledge and then start getting into Node.js, Databases and using TS as a backend language, showcasing fullstack capability. The advantage here is I know the stack (bar the backend) so the learning curve is less than Java. Other advantage here is there are more SME roles going in this stack and given my experience, it may be 'easier' to land a role in this space than trying to secure the first-time Java job not as a traditional Comp Sci BSC graduate. Disadvantage is that I'll fall into just frontend again.So, would love to hear everyone's opinions. I've done the ChatGPT debate for hours on end and at first it was hinting on staying with Java as it's a signal that I'll enjoy backend but then it switched over to saying stick to TS route as it will land me a job quicker and I can always do Java/Go/Rust etc in the background for my next step in my career. However, probably would be better to hear from you guys industry experts here.

(I don't have a car, so hoping if I can get my foot in the door, I can work out time to earn a paycheck and get a car). During the 5 months that I've been searching for a job, I've had one follow-up where someone said they were interested, and then ghosted. Other than that, it's been all rejections and no responses. I genuinely don't know what I'm doing wrong. I get that the industry is in crisis at the moment, largely due to the huge tax burden being a developer in the US causes now.Are y'all devs with more than 10 years experience also facing such huge challenges in finding a job? Are y'all using bots to apply or something? I'm out of ideas on what else to do and close to losing unemployment trying to stay afloat during this sucky time.
