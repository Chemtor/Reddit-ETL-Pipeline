1mupgrv,Finally Got a Job Offer,Optimal-Finish8744,dataengineering,"Hi AllAfter 1-2 month of several application, I finally managed to get an offer from a good company which can take my career at a next level. Here are my stats:Total Applications : 100+Rejection : 70+Recruiter Call : 15+Offer : 1I would have managed to get fee more offers but I wasn’t motivated enough and I was happy with the offer from the company.Here are my takes:1) ChatGpt : Asked GPT to write a CV summary based on job description 2) Job Analytics Chrome Extension: Used to include keywords in the CV and make them white text at the bottom.3) Keep applying until you get an offer not until you had a good inter view.4) If you did well in the inter view, you will hear back within 3-4 days. Otherwise, companies are just benching you or don’t care. I used to chase on 4th day for a response, if I don’t hear back, I never chased.5) Speed : Apply to jobs posted within a week and move faster in the process. Candidates who move fast have high chances to get job. Remember, if someone takes inter view before you and are a good fit, they will get the job doesn’t matter how good you are . 6) Just learn new tools and did some projects, and you are good to go with that technology.Best of Luck to Everyone!!!!",245,0.95,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mupgrv/finally_got_a_job_offer/,2025-08-19 17:44:14,2025-08-21 01:38:06

1mqertd,How do senior data engineers view junior engineers using LLMs?,Firefly-ssa,dataengineering,"At work, I'm encouraged to use LLMs, and I genuinely find them game changing. Tasks that used to take hours, like writing complex regex, setting up tricky data cleaning queries in SQL, or scaffolding Python scripts, now take way less time. I can prompt an LLM, get something 80% of the way there, and then refine it to fit the exact need. It’s massively boosted my productivity.That said, I sometimes worry I’m not building the same depth of understanding I would if I were digging through docs or troubleshooting syntax from scratch. But with the pace and volume of work I’m expected to handle, using LLMs feels necessary.As I think about the next step in my career, I’m curious: how do senior data engineers view this approach? Is leveraging LLMs seen as smart and efficient, or does it raise concerns about foundational knowledge and long-term growth?Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who mentor or manage junior engineers.",128,0.95,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mqertd/how_do_senior_data_engineers_view_junior/,2025-08-14 22:02:29,2025-08-21 01:38:06

1ms2j53,Data Engineer/ Architect --> Data Strategist --> Director of Data,Smooth-Leadership-35,dataengineering,"I'm hoping some experienced folks can give some insight. I am a data engineer and architect who worked his way up from analytics engineer. I've built end-to-end pipelines that served data scientists, visualizations, applications, or other groups data platforms numerous times. I can do everything from the DataOps / MLOps to the actual analytics if needed (I have an academic ML background). I can also troubleshoot pipelines that see large volumes of users on the application end and my last technical role was as an architect/ reliability engineer consulting across many different sized companies.I've finally secured a more leadership-type position as the principal data strategist (I have no interest in being middle management leading technical groups). The issue is the company is in the construction sector and largely only uses Microsoft365. There is some Azure usage that is currently locked down by IT and they won't even give me read-only access. There is no one at the company who understands cloud concepts or software engineering -- the Azure env is set up from consoles, there is no versioning (like no Git let alone Yaml), and the CIO doesn't even understand containers. The engineers vibe code and if they need an application demo for a client, they'll vibe the python and use Streamlit and put it on a free public server.I'm honestly beside myself and don't know what to do about the environment in general. IT is largely incompetent when it comes to any sort of modern practices and there's a lot of nepotism so no one gets fired and if you aren't related to someone, you're shit out of luck.I'm trying to figure out what to do here. Pros: \- I have the elevated title so I feel like that raises me to a different ""social level"" as I find higher leaders are now wanting to engage with me on LinkedIn \- Right now I kind of have a very flexible schedule and can decide how I want to structure my day. That is very different from other roles I've been in that had mandatory standups and JIRAs and all that jazz \- This gives me time to think about pet projects.\- Adding a pro I forgot to add -- there is room for me to kind of learn this type of position (more leadership, less tech) and make mistakes. There's no one else gunning for this position (they kind of made it for me) so I have no fear of testing something out and then having it fail -- whether that's an idea, a communication style, a long term strategy map, etc. They don't know what to expect from me honestly so I have the freedom to kind of make something up. The fear is that nothing ends up being accepted as actionable due to the culture of not wanting to change processes.Cons: \- I'm paid 'ok' but nothing special. I gave up a $40k higher salary when I took this position. \- There is absolutely no one who can talk about modern software. It's all vibe coders who try to use LLMs for everything. There is absolutely no structure to the company either -- everyone is silo'ed and everyone does what they want so there's just random Python notebooks all over Sharepoint, random csv files where ever, etc \- The company is very old school so everything is Microsoft365. I can't even get a true Azure playground. if I want to develop on the cloud, I'll need to buy my own subscription. I'm forced to use a PC. \- I feel like it's going to be hard to stay current, but I do have colleagues to talk to from previous jobs who are current and intelligent. \- My day to day is extremely frustrating because no one understands software in the slightest. I'm still trying to figure out what I can even suggest to improve their data issues. There are no allies since IT is so locked down (I can't even get answers to questions from them) and their leader doesn't understand cloud or software engineering. Also no one at the company wants to change their ways in the slightest.Right now my plan is: (this is what I'm asking for feedback on) \- Try to make it here at least 2 years and use the elevated title to network -- I suck at networking though so can you give some pointers? \- use this time to grow my brand. Post to Medium, post to LinkedIn about current topics and any pet projects I can come up with. \- Take some MBA level courses as I will admit that I have no business background and if I want to try to align to business goals, I have to understand how businesses (larger businesses) work. \- Try to stay current -- this is the hard one -- I'm not sure if I should just start paying out the nose for my own cloud playground? My biggest shortcoming is never building a high volume streaming pipeline end-to-end. I understand all the tech and I've designed such pipelines for clients, but have never had to build and work in one day to day which would reveal many more things to take into consideration. To do this on my own may be $$$. I will be looking for side consulting jobs to try to stay in the game as well. \- I'm hoping that if I can stay just current enough and add in business strategy skills, I'd be a unique candidate for some high level roles? All my career people have always told me that I'm different because I'm a really intelligent person who actually has social skills (I have a lot of interesting hobbies that I can connect with others over).Or I could bounce, make $45k+ more and go back into a higher pressure, faster moving env as a Lead Data Architect/ engineer. I kind of don't want to do that bc I do need a temporary break from the startup world. If I wait and try to move toward director of data platform, I could make at least $75k more, but I guess I'm not sure what to do between now and then to make sure I could score that sort of title considering it's going to be REALLY hard to prove my strategy can create movement at this current company. I'm mostly scared of staying here and getting really far behind and never being able to get another position.",72,0.89,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ms2j53/data_engineer_architect_data_strategist_director/,2025-08-16 17:54:55,2025-08-21 01:38:06

1mpo86v,# Roast my project: DataCompose: I brought shadcn's copy-to-own pattern to pyspark - am I stupid?,nonamenomonet,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, sorry for the provocative title. I'd love to get some feedback on a project I've been working on. I was inspired by how full-stack developers use shadcn and shadcn-svelte (svelte is superior to react btw) with their ""copy-to-own"" pattern. I think this pattern could solve a common pain point in data engineering: most of us work in environments where adding new dependencies requires extensive justification. What if we could get the functionality we need without adding dependencies, while still owning and understanding every line of code?Here's how it works: [DataCompose](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose) maintains a registry of battle tested (read: aggressively unit tested) data cleaning primitives. The CLI copies these directly into your repo as plain PySpark code. No runtime dependencies, no magic. You can modify, extend, or completely rewrite them. Once the code is in your repo, you can even delete the CLI and everything still works.**Note**: The generated code assumes you already have PySpark set up in your environment. DataCompose focuses on providing the cleaning logic, not managing your Spark installation. ## Code Example ```bashdatacompose init# Generate email cleaning primitivesdatacompose add clean_emails --target pyspark# Generate address standardization primitives datacompose add clean_addresses --target pyspark# Generate phone number validation primitivesdatacompose add clean_phone_numbers --target pyspark``````pythonfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSessionfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F# Import the generated primitivesfrom build.pyspark.clean_emails.email_primitives import emails# Create Spark sessionspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(""DataCleaning"").getOrCreate()# Load your datadf = spark.read.csv(""data.csv"", header=True)# Apply email transformationscleaned_df = df.withColumn( ""email_clean"", emails.standardize_email(F.col(""email""))).withColumn( ""email_domain"", emails.extract_domain(F.col(""email_clean""))).withColumn( ""is_valid"", emails.is_valid_email(F.col(""email_clean"")))# Filter to valid emails onlyvalid_emails = cleaned_df.filter(F.col(""is_valid""))````I wanted to bring some of Svelte's magic to this, so my personal favorite way to do data transformations is like this:```pythonfrom build.clean_emails.email_primitives import emails# Create a comprehensive email cleaning pipeline@emails.compose()def clean_email_pipeline(email_col): # Fix common typos first (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc) email = emails.fix_common_typos(email_col) # Standardize the email (lowercase, trim whitespace) email = emails.standardize_email(email) # For Gmail addresses, normalize dots and plus addressing if emails.is_gmail(email): email = emails.normalize_gmail(email) # Validate and mark suspicious patterns is_valid = emails.is_valid_email(email) is_disposable = emails.is_disposable_domain(email)# Apply the pipeline to your dataframedf = df.withColumn(""email_results"", clean_email_pipeline(F.col(""raw_email"")))```Or you can do it like this (like a normie):```pythondef clean_email_pipeline(col): # Fix common typos first (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc) col = emails.fix_common_typos(col) col = emails.standardize_email(col) # For Gmail addresses, normalize dots and plus addressing if emails.is_gmail(col): col = emails.normalize_gmail(col) return coldf = df.withColumn(""email_results"", clean_email_pipeline(F.col(""raw_email"")))```## Key Features- **Composable Primitives**: Build complex transformations from simple, reusable functions- **Smart Partial Application**: Configure transformations with parameters for reuse- **Pipeline Compilation**: Convert declarative pipeline definitions into optimized Spark operations- **Code Generation**: Generate standalone PySpark code with embedded dependencies- **Comprehensive Libraries**: Pre-built primitives for emails, addresses, and phone numbers- **Conditional Logic**: Support for if/else branching in pipelines- **Type Safe Operations**: All transformations maintain Spark column type safety## Why This Approach?- **You Own Your Code**: No external dependencies to manage or worry about breaking changes- **Full Transparency**: Every transformation is readable, debuggable PySpark code you can understand- **Customization First**: Need to adjust a transformation? Just edit the code## I AM LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK !!!! I WANT TO KNOW IF I AM CRAZY OR NOT!Currently supporting three primitive types: addresses, emails, and phone numbers. More coming based on YOUR feedback.**Playground Demo**: [github.com/datacompose/datacompose-demo](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose-demo) **Main Repo**: [github.com/datacompose/datacompose](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose)",59,0.93,13,https://i.redd.it/baop9lqmbwif1.gif,2025-08-14 02:27:00,2025-08-21 01:38:06
1mu2fj5,Too much Excel…Help!,Own-Raise-4184,dataengineering,"Joined a company as a data analyst. Previous analysts were strictly excel wizards. As a result, there’s so much heavy logic stuck in excel. Most all of the important dashboards are just pivot tables upon pivot tables. We get about 200 emails a day and the CSV reports that our data engineers send us have to be downloaded DAILY and transformed even more before we can finally get to the KPIs that our managers and team need. Recently, I’ve been trying to automate this process using R and VBA macros that can just pull the downloaded data into the dashboard and clean everything and have the pivot tables refreshed….however it can’t fully be automated (atleast I don’t want it to be because that would just make more of a mess for the next person) Unfortunately, the data engineer team is small and not great at communicating (they’re probably overwhelmed). I’m kind of looking for data engineers to share their experiences with something like this and how maybe you pushed away from getting 100+ automated emails a day from old queries and even lifted dashboards out of large .xlsb files. The end goal, to me, should look like us moving out of excel so that we can store more data, analyze it more quickly without spending half a day updating 10+ LARGE excel dashboards, and obviously get decisions made faster.

1mr5efi,A deep dive into what an ORM for OLAP databases (like ClickHouse) could look like.,Ok_Mouse_235,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, author here. We just published a piece exploring the idea of an ORM for analytical databases, and I wanted to share it with this community specifically.The core idea is that while ORMs are great for OLTP, extending a tool like Prisma or Drizzle to OLAP databases like ClickHouse is a bad idea because the semantics of core concepts are completely different.We use two examples to illustrate this. In OLTP, columns are nullable by default; in OLAP, they aren't. unique() in OLTP means write-time enforcement, while in ClickHouse it means eventual deduplication via a ReplacingMergeTree engine. Hiding these differences is dangerous.What are the principles for an OLAP-native DX? We propose that a better tool should:* Borrow the best parts of ORMs (schemas-as-code, migrations).* Promote OLAP-native semantics and defaults.* Avoid hiding the power of the underlying SQL and its rich function library.We've built an open-source, MIT licensed project called Moose OLAP to explore these ideas.Happy to answer any questions or hear your thoughts/opinions on this topic!",55,0.91,11,https://clickhouse.com/blog/moosestack-does-olap-need-an-orm,2025-08-15 18:02:00,2025-08-21 01:38:06

1mpsjqt,Airbyte vs Fivetran for our ELT stack?

SCD2 would mean custom dbt jobs, adding cost and complexity.Airbyte is quite flexible and there’s an open source advantage but maintaining connectors and building masking/SCD2 feels is too much DIY work.Looking for advice:- Is Fivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? Any other alternative setups that we can pilot?- Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it?- Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2?- If you have pulled data from Salesforce or HubSpot, were there any surprises around rate limits or schema changes?Ok this post went long.

I went with a small dataset here for the demo, but you can push limits and create your own benchmarks to test how the system performs under real conditions.And while the guide uses MySQL as the starting point, it’s flexible you can just as easily plug in Postgres or other sources.If you’ve been trying to build a lakehouse stack yourself something that’s open source and not too inclined towards one vendor this guide can give you a good start.Check out the blog and let me know if you’d like me to dive deeper into this by testing out different query engines in a detailed series, or if I should share my benchmarks in a later thread.

Now I've recently been approached for interviews externally though in a 'real' data engineer capacity using all the name brand tools dbt, Snowflake, AWS etc. I guess my question is how easy is it to start running assuming you finally get an offer made?

I got asked two SQL questions - Find the top 2 salaries per department AND find the top 2 increment salaries per department percentage wise. I had to write down queries. I wrote the first one with ease, for the second one i took a lot of time and thought a lot because at first i didn't understand what the question actually meant ( int pressure even though i had solved questions like this before) but i eventually solved it by taking a bit of help from the interviewer. He then asked me very basic statistical questions and i was able to answer 1.5 out of 4 (i wasn't prepared at all for this part). He then asked me the famous same 5 row same value question and asked for different joins. I answered it wrong and was so annoyed with myself because i didn't think properly and i knew the answer. Even for the second SQL question, i had messed up a bit wrt to basics because i wasn't thinking properly because of pressure. I might have given him the impression that i am weak wrt to basics. Don't think i am moving ahead to the next round despite solving 200+ SQL problems. We keep trying! PS : The interviewer was such a nice guy.

1mtsgz9,When should I start looking for a new job?,echanuda,dataengineering,"I was hired as a “DE” almost a year ago. I absolutely love this job. It’s very laid back, I don’t really work with others very much, and I can (kinda) do whatever I want. There’s no sprints or agile stuff, I work on projects here and there, shifting my focus kinda haphazardly to whatever needs done. There’s just a couple problems.1. I make $19/hr. This is astronomically low, though what I’m doing isn’t all that hard.2. I don’t think my work is the same as the rest of the industry. I work with mostly whatever tools I want, but we don’t do any cloud stuff, I don’t really collaborate with anyone, there’s no code reviews or PRs or anything like that. My work mainly consists of “find x data source, setup a way to ingest it, do some transformations, and maybe load it into our DB if we want it.” I mostly do stuff with polars, duckdb, and sometimes pandas. I also do some random things on the side like web scraping/browser automation. We work with A LOT of data, so we have 2 beefy servers, but even then not working with the cloud is really odd to me (though we are a niche government contracted company).3. The restrictions are kinda insane. First of all, because we’re government contractors, we went from 2/5 work from home days to 5/5 in office days (thanks Trump). So that sucks, but also the software I can use is heavily restricted. We use company PCs, so I can’t download anything onto them, not even browser extensions. Many sites are blocked, and things move slowly. On the development side, only Python packages are allowed on an individual basis. Anything else needs to go through the admin team and takes awhile to get approved. I’ve found ways around this, but it’s not something I should be doing.So, after working here for almost a year, is it time to look for other jobs? I don’t have a degree, but I’ve been programming since I was a kid with a lot of projects under my belt, and now this “professional” experience. Mostly I just want more money, and the commute is long, and working from home a bit would be nice. But honestly I just wanna make $60k a year for 5 years and I’ll be good.

1msstih,How to improve RAG retrieval to avoid attention distribution problem,jdnnendndb,dataengineering,"Hey community, I'm building an AI workflow for an internal tool and would appreciate some advice, as this is my first time working with something like that. My background is DevOps not AI so please excuse any ignorant question.Our company has a programming tool for controlling sorting robots, where workflows are defined in a YAML file. Each step in the workflow is a block that can execute a CLI tool.. I am using an LLM (Gemini 2.5 pro) to automatically generate these yaml files from a simplified user prompt (build a workflow to sort red and green cubes). Currently we have around 1000 internal helper CLIs for these tasks so no LLM knows about them.My current approach:Since the LLM has no knowledge of our interna CLI tools, I've come up with this two-stage process which is reecommend everywhere:1. **Stage 1** The users prompt is sent to an LLM. Its task is to formulate questions for a vector database (which contains all our CLI tool man pages) to figure out which specific tools are needed to fulfill the users request, and which flags to use.2. **Stage 2** The man page (or sections) retrieved in the first stage is then passed to a second LLM call, along with the original user prompt and instructions on how to structure the YAML. This stage generates the final output.So here is my problem or lack of understanding:For the first stage, how can I help the LLM to generate the right search queries for a vector database and select the right CLI tools from over these 1000? Should it also generate questions at this first stage to find the right flags for each CLI tool?Is providing the LLM with a simple list of all CLI tool names and a one-line description for each the best way to start? I'm not sure how it would know to ask the right questions about specific flags, arguments, and their usage without more basic context. But I also can't provide it with 1000 basic descriptions? Gemini has a large attention window but I mean its still a lot.For the second stage, I'm not sure what is the best way to provide the retrieved docs to the generator LLM. I've two options I believe?* **Option A: entire manpage** For each CLI tool chosen by he first LLM I pass in the entire man page. A workflow could have 10 manpages or even more, so I would pass 10 entire man pages to the second stage, that feels overkill. This for sure contains all info to the LLM but its enourmous and the token count is through the roof, and the LLM might even loose attention?* **Option B: chunks** I could generate smaller more targeted chunks of the man pages and add them to the Vector database. This would help with my token problem but I also feel this might miss important context since the LLM has 0 knowledge about these tools.So I am not sure if I identified the right problems, or if the problem I have is actually a different one. Can anyone help me understand this more?

1mrr9wl,Do your ETL jobs read from a replica?,greenrazi,dataengineering,"In the course of your ETL jobs, your Extract process may need input from your destination database (eg, a list of existing Customer IDs, current account balance, etc) to define which records are to be extracted from the source. Your destination may also be set up with a Read-Replica or Follower instance. When these inputs are queried from the destination database, do you typically read from the replica knowing that you will be writing to the primary, or do you just run your SELECT statement against the primary?It seems the safest pattern in terms of reducing resource contention and locking, particularly when you are running parallel jobs that write to the same group of tables, would be the former option.

A massive undertaking as part of building this dataset was labelling the dataset using LLMs. This involved:* 24 trillion tokens processed* 23.6B LLM queries in one week* 32K sustained requests/sec per VM* 90K GPU hours on AMD MI300X* 0 crashesWe viewed this problem actually as a data engineering problem - getting this data reliably and with high throughput through the LLMs/GPUs was done with async code on top of Daft.A few practical lessons:* **Data is super important:** one of the big challenges here was managing data egress from the cloud provider and ""streaming"" it through their GPU datacenter -- naively moving data across was just not possible. This means that the data engine needed really good cloud storage support as well as maintaining a stable rate of async requests.* **Reliability beats raw throughput:** retries at this scale/with GPU hardware are extremely expensive, so streaming execution and overall system health is incredibly important* **Seamless scaling from local → distributed** meant faster iteration and debugging - developer experience for building these pipelines is really important!Turns out that AI/ML is still a big data problem :)The Daft team is also going to be taking a lot of what we learned from this collaboration and baking it into open source.

I was brought in to establish both sides: create an organized database (pulling together all the scattered Excel files) and then build out dashboards and reporting templates. To be fair, the reason I got this opportunity is less about being a seasoned data engineer and more about my analyst background + the fact that my boss liked my overall vibe/approach. That said, I’m honestly really hyped about the data engineering part — I see a ton of potential here both for personal growth and to build something properly from scratch (no legacy mess, no past bad decisions to clean up).

I have one main ambiguity regarding that distinction: Every cost centre can be someone else's profit centre no? If we stick strictly to this definition, then the only safe place to work is more or less in the consulting business, where you charge for your hours. Maybe also businesses that sell the actual software. For example, in Google, is every unit a cost centre except the Ads department (and a few others)?Then also:1. If I'm a data engineer (hence this sub) writing the data pipeline to support the sales/support division, am I in a cost centre? 2. If I write internal software for other units within our org, including the traditional ""profit centres"", do I have no role in the profit making? 3.

This is why you have have samples or dummy data to supplement testing when not all data have been cleansed. However, my colleague seems to be adamant that from a risk mitigation perspective, it would be risky for developers not to insist on full data cleansing and migration before testing.

They’re all pretty similar, and I’m planning to manage them in a config-driven way, so that part is fine. The tricky bit is that all of them need to be upserts.In my last job I used SparkKubernetesOperator, and since there weren’t that many jobs, I just wrote to staging tables and then used MERGE in Redshift or ON CONFLICT in Postgres. Here though, the DB team doesn’t want to deal with 400 staging tables (and honestly I agree it sounds messy).Spark doesn’t really have native upsert support. Most of my data is inserts, only a small fraction is updates (I can catch them with an updated_at field). One idea is: do the inserts with Spark, then handle the updates separately with psycopg2.

1msp0i4,Starrocks Performance,Correct_Nebula_8301,dataengineering,"I recently compared Duck Lake with Starrocks. I was surprised to see that Starrocks performed much better than Duklake+duckdbSome background on DuckDb - I have previously implemented DuckDb in a lambda to service download requests asynchronously- based on filter criteria selected from the UI, a query is constructed in the lambda and queries pre-aggregated parquet files to create CSVs. This works well with fairly compelx queries involving self joins, group by, having etc, for data size upto 5-8GB. However, given DuckDb's limitations around concurrency (multiple process can't read and write to the .DuckDb file at the same time), couldn't really use it in solutions designed with persistent mode. With DuckLake, this is no longer the case, as the data can reside in the object store, and ETL processes can safely update the data in DuckLake while being available to service queries. I get that comparison with a distributed processing engine isn't exactly a fair one- but the dataset size (SSB data) was ~30GB uncompressed- ~8GB in parquet. So this is right up DuckDb's alley. Also worth noting is that memory allocation to Starrocks BE nodes was ~7 GB per node, whereas DuckDb had around 23GB memory available. I was shocked to see DuckDb's in memory processing come short, having seen it easily outperform traditional DBMS like Postgres as well as modern engines like Druid in other projects.Please see the detailed comparison here-https://medium.com/@anigma.55/rethinking-the-lakehouse-6f92dba519dcLet me know your thoughts.",7,0.7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1msp0i4/starrocks_performance/,2025-08-17 11:58:48,2025-08-21 01:38:06

1mvmawa,Recommendations for Where to Start,Thiseffingguy2,dataengineering,"Hi team,Let me start by saying I'm not a data engineer by training but have picked up a good amount of knowledge over the years. I mainly have analyst experience, using the limited tools I've been allowed to use. I've been with my company for over a decade, and we're hopelessly behind the curve when it comes to our data infrastructure maturity. The short version is that we have a VERY paranoid/old-school parent company who controls most of our sources, and we rely on individuals to export Excel files, manually wrangle, report as needed. One of the primary functions of my current role is to modernize, and I'd REALLY like to make at least a dent in this before starting to look for the next move.We recently had a little, but significant, breakthrough with our parent company - they've agreed to build us a standalone database (on-prem SQL...) to pull in data from multiple sources, to act as a basic data warehouse. I cannot undersell how heavy of a lift it was to get them to agree to just this. It's progress, nonetheless. From here, the loose plan is to start building semantic models in Power BI service, and train up our Excel gurus on what that means. Curate some datasets, replace some reports.The more I dive into engineering concepts, the more overwhelmed I become, and can't really tell the best direction in which to get started along the right path. Eventually, I'd like to convince our parent company how much better their data system could be, to implement modern tools, maybe add some DS roles to really take the whole thing to a new level... but getting there just seems impossible. So, my question really is, in your experience, what should I be focusing on now? Should I just start by making this standalone database as good as it can possibly be with Excel/Power BI/SQL before suggesting upgrading to an actual cloud warehouse/data lake with semantic layers and dbt and all that fun stuff?",2,0.63,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mvmawa/recommendations_for_where_to_start/,2025-08-20 18:02:10,2025-08-21 01:38:06
1muq3yh,"With the rising trends of finetuning small language model, data engineering will be needed even more.",dheetoo,dataengineering,"We're seeing a flood of compact language models hitting the market weekly - Gemma3 270M, LFM2 1.2B, SmolLM3 3B, and many others. The pattern is always the same: organizations release these models with a disclaimer essentially saying ""this performs poorly out-of-the-box, but fine-tune it for your specific use case and watch it shine.""I believe we're witnessing the beginning of a major shift in AI adoption. Instead of relying on massive general-purpose models, companies will increasingly fine-tune these lightweight models into specialized agents for their particular needs. The economics are compelling - these small models are significantly cheaper to train, deploy, and operate compared to their larger counterparts, making AI accessible to businesses with tighter budgets.This creates a huge opportunity for data engineers, who will become crucial in curating the right training datasets for each domain. The lower operational costs mean more companies can afford to experiment with custom AI solutions.This got me thinking: what does high-quality training data actually look like for different industries when building these task-specific AI agents?

Initially, it was mostly a data science project (NLP, model training, NER), but those are now long-forgotten memories. Instead, I've been diving deep into infrastructure, networking, and Terraform, discovering new worlds of pain every day while trying to optimize for every penny.After nearly a year of working on it at night, I'm proud of what I've learned, even though a public release is still a (very) distant goal. I was making steady progress... until four days ago.So far, I have a Lambda function that writes S3 data into my Postgres database. Both are in the same private VPC. My database password was fully exposed in my Lambda function (I know, I know... there's just so much to learn as a single developer, and it was just for testing).Recently, I tried to make my infrastructure cleaner by storing the database password in SSM Parameter Store. To do this, my Lambda function now needs to access the SSM (and KMS) APIs. The recommended way to do this is by using VPC private endpoints. The problem is that they are billed per endpoint, per AZ, per hour, which I've desperately tried to avoid. This adds a significant cost ($14/month for two endpoints) for such a small necessity in my whole project.I'm really trying to find a solution. The only other path I've found is to use a lambda-to-lambda pattern (a public lambda calls the private lambda), but I'm afraid it won't scale and will cause problems later if I use this pattern every time I have this issue. I've considered simply not using SSM/KMS, but I'll probably face a similar same issue sooner or later with other services.Is there a solution that won't be billed hourly, as it dramatically increases my costs?",4,0.76,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mu16in/how_to_access_aws_ssm_from_a_private_vpc_lambda/,2025-08-18 22:48:11,2025-08-21 01:38:06

You know the drill: you inherit a massive BTEQ script with no documentation and have to spend hours, sometimes days, just tracing the data lineage to figure out what it's actually doing before you can even think about modifying or debugging it.Out of that frustration, I decided to build a little side project to make my own life easier, and I thought it might be useful for some of you as well.**It's a web-based tool called SQL Flow Visualizer:** **Link:**[**https://www.dfv.azprojs.net/**](https://www.dfv.azprojs.net/)**What it does:** You upload one or more BTEQ script files, and it parses them to generate an interactive data flow diagram. The goal is to get a quick visual overview of the entire process: which scripts create which tables, what the dependencies are, etc.**A quick note on the tech/story:** As a personal challenge and because I'm a huge AI enthusiast, the entire project (backend, frontend, deployment scripts) was built with the help of AI development tools. It's been a fascinating experiment in AI-assisted development to solve a real-world data engineering problem.**Important points:*** It's completely free.* The app processes the files in memory and **does not store your scripts**. Still, obfuscating sensitive code is always a good practice.* It's definitely in an early stage. There are tons of features I want to add (like visualizing complex single queries, showing metadata on click, etc.).I'd genuinely love to get some feedback from the pros. Does it work for your scripts? What features are missing? Any and all suggestions are welcome.Thanks for checking it out!",3,0.72,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1muo6oj/i_built_a_free_tool_to_visualize_complex_teradata/,2025-08-19 16:58:39,2025-08-21 01:38:06

1mtcgcf,Stop being scared of AI and just learn to program.,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"Very often I'll see posts on here with a similar title. ""Should I learn to code considering AI?"" , ""Is it worth learning to code if AI exists"", and while you should definitely use Google and look at what the thousands of other developers are saying, the short answer is yes. It's worth it, even if you want a job.Programming is not coding and it has never been the same and it will never be the same. ChatGPT being able to create a game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript is not the same as what a Google senior software engineer is doing on a daily basis. Oftentimes you will hear that in professional settings you will spend more time writing out designs and reading code and in meetings that writing actual code and that is true. Meaning building out your problem solving and communication skills is way more important that anything AI could spit out. If you are truly investing all your time into AI thinking that you will get further than anyone else because you finished a To-Do app in 10 minutes, please think again. Anyone can learn to code. Coding is not what is in demand, it's programming.Coding is the tippity top of the iceberg, you will not get as far as you think you will without also training your brain. Your brain is the most important tool, not your keyboard. So, use AI wisely and do not fear the future, developers are needed because coding and programming are not the same thing. Learn it, it's fun, you can be very successful if you put in the work, and it can really change the way that you approach every day problems. AI will only replace you if you maintain that mindset of replacement and not of assistance.",674,0.94,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mtcgcf/stop_being_scared_of_ai_and_just_learn_to_program/,2025-08-18 04:38:45,2025-08-21 01:38:07

[https://kareemcarr.substack.com/p/the-hardest-part-of-learning-statistics](https://kareemcarr.substack.com/p/the-hardest-part-of-learning-statistics) .Allow me to summarize and paraphrase.People seem eager to dive into details of coding without having the structure in their life to study programming deeply. The 4 distinct subtasks are:Learning on your own - Recognize that doing things on your own is also doing things the hard way;Finding resources - finding resources that you can trust, and that fit your level of expertise and style of learning;Protecting time - regular, distraction-free time to think;Learning the content itself - syntax, semantics, libraries, development tools, algorithms, style.For me, when learning a new programming language I like to know who invented the language, what their motivation was, and what books (or blogs or channels) they have written or recommend.

1msa43x,Should I learn to code (From a 20+ year software developer),NumberNinjas_Game,learnprogramming,"Hey all, I'm David and I'm a professional software developer who still loves coding, 20 years after graduating from college with my degree. I've earned my Bachelor's in Computer Systems Engineering, my Masters in Computer Science, and I've worked across all industries: embedded ,web, automation and even making a few mobile games like my Number Ninjas game (on my profile). I'm starting with a little about me to not brag, but to a) give context on why my experience can be useful and b) to hopefully give you encouragement.As I'm sifting through the land of Reddit, I see this question come up so many times: should I learn to code? Follow on questions stem from the likes of ""is coding dead with AI,"" ""what programming language should I use"", ""Java or dotnet"", etc. Just this week with casual browsing, these all popped up on my feed. Let me break this up into parts:**1) Should I learn to code?**This is a problem that needs to be reframed at a deeper level involving your relationship with problems in life. There are two things we can encounter:1) Solving an existing problem2) Choosing better problems (or creating a good ""problem"") Think about the last time you were stuck on something. How motivated were you to fix it? When you hit roadblocks, did you just want to throw in the towel, or did you stick with it and feel REALLY good after making a breakthrough. Writing software isn't linear or not even always predictable. There will be good days. There will be days where things break, you have setbacks, and it may take WAY more time than you planned for. It requires patience, resilience and a strong mindset.I'll be honest with you. Coding is VERY polarizing. If you don't love it, you'll hate it. There really isn't much in between. Going back to problems in life, a big part of your success in life isn't living a problem-free life, but choosing better problems to have. Code is a weird dichotomy: you solve world problems by creating interesting, fun problems in the making. **2) Is coding dead with AI? Will it take my job?**There are many strong opinions on this. My personal one is that if you don't see AI as a companion versus a threat, you will be phased out. Like many things in life, mindset matters. I remember being out of shape and always being envious of people who ""seemed"" to have it ""easier"" by being in shape...until I put in the work and started crushing it myself. AI is no different. You will need to be more of a ""unicorn"" software developer these days that does ""more than their job"" used to be just a few years ago. Life has adapted quite a bit. It's faster and it's automated. You can either let it make you bitter or better. Use AI, embrace it. But also embrace the fact that AI is FAR from perfect. Make yourself irreplaceable in your craft by being ""that dev"" that understands the architectural limitations of AI today and how your solutions show why AI can't be solely relied on. Sure, you can't guarantee you'll never lose a job BUT you are in charge of your growth and becoming the best you can be. Heck, you can then make your own apps like I have with the help of AI. **3) What programming language should I use?**Very nuanced. Do you know what kind of job space you are looking at (mobile apps, security, etc)? Certain programming paradigms and even languages may be better or worse. Are you simply looking for an easy language? Sure, start with Python. My answer isn't the best or the right one for everyone, and that's the point: there's no perfect answer to this. You just need to dive into SOMETHING, write code ,make mistakes, and LEARN from them. It's just like when I was starting my math YouTube channel: instead of obsessing over making the first perfect video, many Youtubers talked about not overthinking it and to just build that muscle memory. DO SOMETHING!!! Java vs dotnet? I saw this question recently. I know both. I prefer dotnet. Why? I just do? I love the IDE I use and the tech stack a bit more (big fan of Rider IDE btw). But again, your choice may be different I hope this gives you some things to think about. Reframe those questions, really hone in on your relationship with problem solving, and just dive right in! All the best and God bless!Is your motivation simply money: I promise you, that's very fleeting and won't keep you entertained. I've met so many people, both in college and beyond, where they chased coding as the next big thing and the pay it provides, only to experience burnout and pivot entirely. Here's an interesting problem for you. Imagine I gave you 9 pennies and just one of the pennies weighs slightly more than the other pennies. You're given a weight scale where you can put any number of pennies on one side. One weigh means comparing the weight of the pennies on both sides and the scale will tell you some outcome: both sides way the same, the left side weighs more or the right. Each time you perform this measurement, that counts as a turn. Beginner programmer question: make an app to figure out which penny weighs the most. Given the assumption that penny exists, your program must ALWAYS choose the CORRECT penny. Does this problem sound fun to you? If you were to take a pause right now and try and figure it out, what's your experience (""good"" frustration, annoyance, wanting to really figure this out)? A simple ""problem"" like this can tell you a lot about your relationship with problem solving, the heart of coding. Believe me, there are days I get frustrated trying to figure out what's wrong, but it's a ""good"" frustration. Once solved, I still get that joy 20 years later.Btw, bonus problem: can you guarantee that program takes as few turns as possible :)",238,0.94,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1msa43x/should_i_learn_to_code_from_a_20_year_software/,2025-08-16 22:37:31,2025-08-21 01:38:07

I learned that bcrypt adds a random salt each time you hash a password, so even if two user have the same password it will produce different hashes for both of them.But then, how does `bcrypt.compare(password, hash)` actually verify the password later when user actually enters the password? If salt is randomly created even if for same password how can it verify the password entered after being stored in the database with the hashed password that DB contains. If the salt is random and different each time, how can it recreate the same hash to compare with the login password?I take time to search online and stumbled upon some explanations and I think bcrypt somehow ( I don't understand the how part as well ) stores the salt along with the hash string itself, then reuses it during comparison with the new password but I’m not 100% sure if I’ve understood it correctly and it feels like I haven't understand the core concept of this Bcrypt password hashing.

Ie. The value of knowing the language is that it lets you apply it however you want. (for example, Winston Churchill used english in a different way than JK Rowling).A programming example is Larry Page. At least, according to Paul Graham, ""The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search.""My question is: how much did you know when you built your domain knowledge? ie. what was the process like when you transitioned from ""learning programming"" --> ""solving problems""?For example, my car could break down and I would know it can be solved, but don't know how. Whereas my friend would be able to solve it because he's watched videos to mod his own car -- I suppose the answer is learn whatever you need to solve the problem.Well, in that case, how do I build an operating system? I want to make the movie Her. I suppose now, it makes sense to use the OS book to build it.What if I want to build a trading platform for AIs? Ie. how do I make a bank for them?

1mrvksn,Took the Code With Harry Data Science Course for 2900/- and feels like a huge L now,adityamishrxa,learnprogramming,"I have learnt most programming languages from Harry and when this course launched, I did not even give second thoughts because of the trust I had. Speaking of the course, the explanations are no doubt good because Harry explains well, however, it's clearly not worth 2900 and I'll tell the reasons I feel that way:You don't learn programming by just good explanations, you learn by solving more and more problems on a topic from basic to advanced. The problem in his courses is that in many sections, for example NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. There are just pure lectures and handbooks of the lectures. No questions to practice or use the things you learn in a lecture.Result? You have to search for questions yourself, filter for the basics to intermediate to advanced level questions and that would be scattered, which means , not curated to what you learnt after every lecture. And that is the second major part of why people prefer courses. It's for the ease of getting resources for practice curated to the teachings step by step.I've been a part of the Pierian Data Science Course on Udemy too, and the two MAJOR plus points of it were first, it had after every few lectures, practice questions, and that too on an integrated ipynb jupyter kernel on the website itself so you can do it then and there. And the second, the site allows you to take notes of yourself on any part of the video. And I got this course for 900/- only(on the udemy sale days which happen once a while quite often) which is more than 3 times cheaper than CWH Data Science course.And lastly, the course's availability is only for a timeframe, not lifetime access.",5,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mrvksn/took_the_code_with_harry_data_science_course_for/,2025-08-16 13:40:29,2025-08-21 01:38:07

I then completely changed the authentication flow to a token-based approach where the backend sends the JWT in the response body, and the frontend stores it in localStorage. Even this new method isn't working on Apple devices. Has anyone faced a similar issue with iOS browsers where a token isn't being stored or sent correctly, even when not using cookies?

Reason being is I (small background in programming for GPUs but not a CS major) recently learned Dijkstra's algorithm while checking out LeetCode for the first time and thought it was awfully serial looking. I'm guessing that there is some other algorithm which is actually used in industry since GPU zoomies often beat mathematical efficiency. Anyways, I took a stab at making a parallel version of the algorithm and wondered if these numbers look any good (basically should I write a paper on it). Total function calls scales worse than serial Dijkstra (obviously) but total parallel iterations (can be done in parallel in a thread-safe manner) does quite well. I am generating these graphs using a random graph generator.Results below are a check if answers are the same for all nodes (both codes find shortest paths from A to all other points since that's how Gemini decided to write Dijkstra's algorithm so I followed suite). Then comes iterations and then total function calls (meaning distance calculations here).Benchmarking Information: (Nodes, Edges) = (50, 150) Same results: (True, True) Total number of main loop iterations: (80, 6) Total number of 'function calls' (distance updates): (300, 378) (Nodes, Edges) = (100, 400) Same results: (True, True) Total number of main loop iterations: (184, 12) Total number of 'function calls' (distance updates): (800, 1667) (Nodes, Edges) = (200, 1200) Same results: (True, True) Total number of main loop iterations: (414, 11) Total number of 'function calls' (distance updates): (2400, 5331) (Nodes, Edges) = (400, 8000) Same results: (True, True) Total number of main loop iterations: (1271, 11) Total number of 'function calls' (distance updates): (16000, 46626)",4,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mtakw2/parallel_dijkstra/,2025-08-18 03:02:33,2025-08-21 01:38:07

1msxjho,Am I going in right direction in my drop year?,superpumpedo,learnprogramming,"Hey, so I wanted to get a sense of how should I approach this.I’ve taken a drop year and decided to make most out of it. All I want is being the guy who does some sort of technical work.It’s been around 2 months since the decision. So far I spent most of my time on YouTube, mainly CS50 playlist + tutorials on HTML, CSS, JS, Python (bro code channel). On the practice side I tried writing the code tutor writes just to understand better.Also made a small site with HTML, little CSS, wrote some JS logic for form submission using Google Appscript, and for Python wrote a script that saved me hours of manual work (basically extracting mails from long videos). Felt good to actually use code for my own need.Then in the last 2 weeks I wanted to be more focused, so I came across OSSU. Started it, been watching, reading, and solving problem sets. What I understood is OSSU community curated a CS curriculum which is kind of equivalent to a CS program, and they say it takes 13–30 months (42 courses).Now here’s the thing: I do spend around 12h a day on desk, not just tutorials/practice but also hardware related videos. Planning to get electronics starter kit too.But still I feel like, am I doing it right? Like after so many tutorials I still need help from LLMs while writing some Python logic (not for solving full problem sets but just small things). Is this normal?Leaving that aside, I wanted to know if I’m going in right direction or if there’s a more efficient/better path. My expectations are kinda crazy high, I want to get some technical job or work on some big project by the end of this.Would appreciate some perspective from people who’ve gone through self-learning / OSSU / drop year like me.",3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1msxjho/am_i_going_in_right_direction_in_my_drop_year/,2025-08-17 17:49:59,2025-08-21 01:38:07

You become that coworker who's stressed, short with people, and honestly just not fun to be around.**And here's the kicker—being pleasant to work with is literally the most important skill in Big Tech.**Think about it: The people who get shit done aren't grinding alone in a corner.

People avoid you. Your PRs sit in review hell. You get excluded from decisions. You end up working 2x harder for half the impact.**The counterintuitive solution: Embrace strategic calm.**I started doing less. I stopped panic-working. I took actual lunch breaks. I said ""I'll get back to you tomorrow"" instead of dropping everything.Result? My productivity went UP. My relationships improved.

I know I'm only a few months in but I'm working on things ranging from minor tickets to full blown apps and it's still the same CRUD work I used to do. In fact here, so many things are abstracted away that I don't need to worry about a ton of things so it feels even easier. That comes with having to setup a ton of boilerplate to create a simple route, but seeing how other routes have it setup basically lets you know all you need to know.Obviously there's issues regarding scale as I never had to worry about it, but again it's as straightforward as saying I want this new data model to be shared by having a keyword and boom, everything is taken care of. It's honestly incredible. So all that to say, I've realized that I've never felt comfortable or ""safe"" yet, like I'm almost waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like is this it?

1mumvef,"Graduated recently, no internships, working in a NYC restaurant making good money, is there still hope for me in tech in 2025?",Character_Community6,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I graduated about 2 months ago and decided to take a month off because finishing my degree was really stressful. Right now, I’m working at one of the most popular restaurants in NYC, making around **$115k working just 4 days a week**. This job put me through college and helped me graduate debt-free, which I’m super thankful for. Before this, the most I ever made was around $50k a year at any other restaurant, so this income honestly feels unreal.But being honest, seeing all the millionaires who dine here, I really want to break into the field I studied. I don’t want to be the server forever, I want to be the one being served, like those customers.That said, I never got an internship during college. I started at community college and thought internships were only for people already in a bachelor’s program. By the time I transferred, I felt like my projects weren’t strong enough, and I missed opportunities. Senior year came and went without an internship too.Now I’m job hunting. I’ve applied to 100+ positions this past month (mostly C++ and Python roles — C++ is really my strong suit). I do have some better projects now, but the market feels brutal. I’m not sure if I should set a “limit” on how long to keep applying before focusing my energy elsewhere.I love the restaurant job I have now, and I never expected it to be this lucrative, but at the same time, I don’t want to feel like I wasted 4 years of my life on my degree.So my question is, has anyone here broken into tech with a similar background (no internships, starting a bit late)? I’d love to hear your stories or advice.**TL;DR:** Graduated 2 months ago with no internships, applying to 100+ jobs (C++/Python).

I landed new jobs in what were historically some of the most difficult markets (2008, 2020, and 2025)- The industry is still growing in terms of jobs and revenue- Number of CS grads has more than doubled in recent years- CS program quality at most universities have not improved and weren't very good to begin with. Sorry, but your college probably ripped you off. take it up with them. seriously.- Efficiency in software development process has improved remarkably with cloud, devops- Most developers aren't really good at building resilient, hardened systems.- Many seasoned devs have a sense of entitlement and an aversion to acquiring new skills on their own- Offshoring is acceleratingAside from all of this, it is easy to get crushed by toxic management culture and most devs don't realize that they are actively competing for a piece of the pie with layers of useless middle managers who excel at stealing accomplishments. As the industry becomes more competitive you must adapt. If you aren't already raging, here's my advice:- Learn how to self-manage and take credit for your own work- Work fast, take risks, don't worry about tech debt (your managers don't)- Never stop expanding your skill set. We are never done learning. AI, infrastructure management, scalability, data pipelines- If you are American, fight offshoring and H1B head on by proving you are more valuable and less of a hassle, voting won't make a difference there.

1muzhe0,I just got laid off again after working for a year,Craexus,cscareerquestions,"Last year, I got caught up in one of those ""restructuring"" situations where the company eliminated a few positions from every team. Mine was one of them. That day was my first time being laid off.So when I was job hunting, I made sure to target more established companies this time as I thought it would bring me more stability. During interviews, I specifically asked about company stability related questions. For example, I asked questions about how often layoff occurs and about the length of the tenure of the employees on the team. The hiring manager gave me the usual spiel about how yes, they'd had layoffs the previous year, but my role would be ""more secure"" since those cuts mainly hit non-dev positions. When I asked about team tenure, the interviewers gave the impression that the people had been there for years.Today, my director messaged asking if I had ""a moment to chat"" and I knew I was about to be cut. It's the same dance as last year where manager suddenly requested a meeting with me. The director told me it wasn't performance orientated as 15% of the company got laid off but I still feel like maybe if I was better at my job I would be one of the ""safe"" people.I spent the rest of the day doing damage control on my finances, cancelling the subscriptions I don't need, trying to get my head straight. The timing just feels particularly brutal because my team has been grinding through overtime these past few weeks, pulling extra hours just to so we can finish our project on time and meet our side of the service level agreement.All those late nights, all that extra effort and for what? It's exhausting as none of it seems to matter in the end.

1mrltsk,26 4YOE Feel Like I haven’t learned much of anything?,InsaneAdoration,cscareerquestions,"Sorry if this sounds a bit of a rant, but I just passed the 4 YOE mark and am now starting to get extremely anxious over (how I feel anyway) not having learned much of anything/developed any skills as a SWE. I just need some hard truths/perspective/advice.I work for a company that is essentially a defense contractor (though not in the traditional sense). Started off at 90k with mid year and end of year raises. Am now at 132k. However, now that I look back, I feel like I haven’t learned much of anything. Listed below are the projects that I’ve worked through at my job:1. Started off by supporting a study/analysis where I was basically taking existing MatLab scripts, writing my own scripts, and cobbling them together (all in MatLab - no other tools/software) to generate, process, and manipulate data for analysis. Learned about a lot of stuff like Kalman filters, linear algebra, and math related etc, but Not software engineering - just a lot of MatLab scripting2. We received a black box software that needed to be installed and ran on my workplaces systems (including on a HPC). I had to get it running (as in, hit the executable and not have it crash). All I really did was make sure the .so files were properly linked, set up a few text config files, and figure out the right terminal command to input to get it running on the HPC. Pretty much no programming whatsoever.3. This was setting up a GitLab CI/CD for an existing project. Essentially, setting up the virtual machine for the runner, configuring the GitLab file to build and run, as well as creating a python script that analyzed unit/regression test outputs for correctness (automatically called by the runner). No real programming.4. What I consider to be my first actual large SWE project. However, the tech stack was pretty much non-existent. It was essentially a message based, event driven simulation in C++. The “database” was just a folder of CSV’s that were read in. I did create framework to connect to a MySQL server and/or SQLite server as alternatives to access the same data (learned more about abstract classes, etc). The build process was just a bunch of Make scripts (deadass just pure, rawdog Make scripts). I did implement new features, but frankly speaking, the code base was awful. The simulation framework itself was decent and I occasionally touched it, but the actual processing of events/messages was incredibly convoluted (culmination of literal generations of technical debt). I honestly felt like I was back in College, creating random ass functions and just writing huge chunks of code because to try and refactor it all was just not feasible. I did get some experience also writing BOOST unit/regression tests. 5. This was another simulation project. However, I was far less involved with the actual framework/architecture of the simulation. I mainly worked on algorithms for what was actually being simulated. IE, I did not have to think too much about classes, design philosophy. There was literally just an empty place holder function for some functionality, and I just had to come up with an algorithm to produce that functionality (think guidance and control for vehicles).6. This is what I consider to be the most “SWE” project so far (and is my current one). It’s essentially a Java desktop App (built as a Maven project) with JavaFx front end and pure Java back end. I’m still new to this project, but seeing how it’s been programmed, it looks beautiful with really clean/elegant code, though I couldn’t even explain WHY that code is clean/elegant (just the vibes). Learned more about socket connections and JavaFX. However, even in this project, we don’t really use all those full stack technologies you hear about like Kubernetes, React, Docker (I’ve also had to create Docker images before but not as part of like a larger tech stack).Essentially, I feel like nearly all of my experience has just been about hammering out code. I haven’t really touched any of that “tech stack” stuff I hear a lot about. Furthermore, just looking at how some of that code (#6) is written makes me realize that even when it comes to just hammering out code, I’m doing it in a very “College Undergraduate With a Vague Semblance of Best Practices” way instead of the clean/elegant (albeit complicated because I don’t understand all of the language’s features) way I witnessed. And don’t even get me started on system design. I know legit nothing about system design (aside from general terms like protocol, load balancing, etc).Is this normal for someone with a whole 4YOE to know this little? If not, how can I improve? I know the best way is to “create projects on your own time”, but are there any resources that that can give me starting pointers? Like a “suppose you want to create a full stack application that does whatever, here is every tech you need and how they relate” so I can at least fill out the details by myself in a project? Or what about resources that I can learn regarding elegant code (for example, I’ve been reading Effective Java 3rd Edition).",68,0.91,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mrltsk/26_4yoe_feel_like_i_havent_learned_much_of/,2025-08-16 05:27:15,2025-08-21 01:38:08

To the point where it came up in my performance review like ""you just aren't getting it""In my defense, this codebase was okay in the beginning working on certain layers and microservices, by the end it was just like WTF - I asked a senior to walk me through and I swear despite spending months understanding this codebase - it was like watching somebody pull a rabbit out of a hat with some of these solutions they were coming up with. Like the answer for the bug was somewhere in the codebase I wasn't even looking cause how did that area even have relevance to this particular service? They didn't even feel logically connected but somehow I guess they were? The stack trace is what I typically followed but it often led me down roads I already tried.I asked my internship peers for help but I got the cold shoulder ""idk"" and they were getting their tickets done - so somehow they did know but I think it was competitive or something so everyman for themselves kinda stuff?But I was just completing my tickets too slow - my manager was like ""these are like 5H tickets at most and they are taking you days""I feel like I'm not cut out for this if I can't do the ""easiest"" thing. Is this my cue to dip out/ I ain't cut out for this?I do like the work, even when I was frustrated and going in circles I enjoyed it on the inside tbh, but I don't like not getting results and people watching me not get results lol and the industry is all about results like sheesh.Edit: Thanks for the thoughtful replies guys , im taking lots of notes rn , I can't get back to everyone anymore but I'll be reading everything.",65,0.81,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mrmacl/is_software_testing_supposed_to_be_super_easy/,2025-08-16 05:51:50,2025-08-21 01:38:08

1msm0ae,New manager started complaining about my performance out of nowhere,tkyang99,cscareerquestions,"Not really looking for ""what should I do""? advice, because I already know in this situation the first thing to do is start sending out resumes. I'm more curious as to what could be behind the sudden change. It doesn't seem like my manager is actually the one behind it, but rather it's coming from upper management. Just for some more context I've been at the job for almost 2 years, always had great feedback from my previous manager, never really heard any complaints about my work. Then we got a new manager a few months ago, everything started ok, our one on one meetings are typically just him asking if I needed anything. Then a few weeks back he suddenly drops a bombshell, that I'm not performing to the level of expectations for a ""senior"" developer. And most of the reasons he gave are rather vague, ie not being ""independent"" enough, asking too many questions, etc. ie nothing to do with my work or getting stuff done. Then it just escalated, he started complaining about my pull requests with more vague things like ""why did you do it X way when Y way would have been better?"" Note that during all this time I just took it all in and never argued or tried to defend myself, because most of the things he mentioned are vague ie how do I respond to being told that I ask too many questions? I know all the signs are pointing to upper management wanting to replace me with someone who is probably cheaper(not that I'm making a lot to begin with), but who knows? They haven't officially put me on a PIP or anything, just non stop criticisms. It's just a bit weird that companies these days have to go thru so much trouble to come up with vague reasons to get rid of employees.

1muhjxw,"Meeting with my boss and skip manager about my boss being unusually ""aggressive"". How should I approach this?",Dreadsin,cscareerquestions,"So I'm *pretty sure* this all started one day where I was given a very large task, basically go through every design and break it down to components, then create a design system from that meeting some requirements. I made a notion doc, shared it, and worked through it. My manager told me to make tickets for it, I said I wasn't yet done with breaking things down, she got really mad and reassigned it to another teammate with no warning so I stopped working on itShe said (quote) ""\[redacted\] will be leading the theming & tokens initiative, but he's on PTO this week. he'll help build out the project w/ its various phases & tickets. i'm creating some tickets with explicit tasks for you to get started"". She then assigned me a small handful of tickets. I didn't totally understand what the actual implication of that new guy being the lead of the project meant, and she didn't explain it, so I figured it just meant ""stop working on this project"". I don't want to ask, because she responds to questions **very** negatively.We had a 1:1 where she mentioned a lot of very strange things. She said I should implicitly know what to work on 100% of the time and it's ""not her job"" to give me work to do. One thing that also came up was that I took a ticket which was ""meant"" to be for support, but was actually just sitting at the top of the backlog. To her, this was a really big miss on my part and she wouldn't stop talking about it. To me, I just saw a ticket with high priority on the backlog and grabbed itSince then, she was downright *aggressive*. I'm talking, every time I put in a pull request she'd rip it apart, but without looking at the code. She'll nitpick the description, the title, pretty much everything but the code. Some were such bizarrely small nitpicks. Prime example, I made a fix for a footer component so my commit message was like ""\[FE-29\] {footer} fixes the way images display in dark mode on the footer component"". She said that I really messed up because I didn't include a link to the storybook. I was a bit confused because a bot usually deploys it then comments the link. I asked what she meant, and she said ""I need an EXACT LINK to the footer component in dark mode"", followed by a lot of derisive comments about how I never do anything right. To me, I thought ""it says the component and it says dark mode... just click the link, click footer, and click dark mode...?"". It was never a stated convention that we would have to post a direct linkLater she comments how I'm on ""thin ice"" and how I need to tell her what I'm working on this week. I ask her a few things about prioritization, which I get a lot of non-answers to. So, I get really specific. ""Looking at both the boards, it appears the button component is the next highest priority. Is that right?"", she then explains what the component library *is* as if I haven't been working on it. The only hint is she said ""priority ahead of that is working on your existing PRs"", so it seems like she's saying ""yes, after you finish your existing PRs, do the button""Frankly, I'm a bit annoyed with the indirectness so I say ""so should I take the button component? Yes or no?"", which she said ""i'm looking for you to create a weekly work plan w/ prioritized tasks from the available information"". So then I say ""... ok... so I guess I'll take the button?"", and she replied ""i've asked for a weekly work plan — this includes a list of items that you plan to dedicate time to this week""So I gather 4-5 tickets and send them to her. I accidentally didn't include the button (just messed up one link) and before I could even edit, she started berating me and she said she was prepping to put me on PIP. I tried explaining to her, ""the reason I'm asking you this is because you reassigned that project to someone else and told me you'd make tickets for me. Because of that, I thought that you wouldn't want me to blindly take tickets and work on them"". Just the previous week, I got in trouble for taking one of ""her"" tickets, despite the fact that it was sitting in the backlog not assigned to herI got really frustrated with her at this point and reached out to my previous manager. I said I feel like I can't communicate clearly with this manager, and she set up a meeting with me and the skip. Really, I just can't deal with the leading questions, non answers, ""quizzing"" me, and negative responses to my questions. I feel unable to have an actual conversation with her without inadvertently pissing her off",51,0.89,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1muhjxw/meeting_with_my_boss_and_skip_manager_about_my/,2025-08-19 12:52:07,2025-08-21 01:38:08

1mppry5,Am I a poor developer and this is a standard dev experience?,TangeloTraditional36,cscareerquestions,"I was laid off from a job relatively recently. It was my first job out of college and it was at a small company. I wasn't included in meetings that decided my work and I was handed tasks from the lead dev, usually in the form of a paragraph with a visual and that was about it. I'd be told ""lets see what you come up with"" and from there I'd have to do my own research and planning. The lead dev already had a full idea of what the project should be, its requirements, and specifications and I would be penalized if what I came up with didn't line up with what he had. I essentially worked in a bubble and only had interactions once in a while, essentially starting projects from scratch. When I asked questions, I'd basically be given a 20 question knowledge check and denied answers if I didn't think the same way a dev with 10 years of experience did. I basically hit a point where my default assumption is that I'm always wrong. I was basically laid off for not operating like a dev with 10 years of experience because the assumption management and the lead dev had was that 3 years should mean I'm, on par with the lead dev. I also had no mentorship while on the job after the first 2-3 weeks.I guess I went in with the preconceived notion from college that there would be more collaboration and discussion on tasks and have a clear image of how a project should work what it should do and why before even starting to code. The expectation my manager laid out in my last few months was ""You've been here for 3 years, you shouldn't need to work with anyone on projects, you should be able to take projects yourself and do them by yourself."" I was then put on a big project that involved reworking a ton of code to be sent externally and me asking for stand up meetings to make sure I'm in expectations was considered a negative point against me. Is this just a standard developer experience, full on trial by fire every day and if you aren't solving every issue, it means you've failed as a developer? I'm assuming I'm just a bad developer who's not capable of handling this line of work because I need direction.",47,0.9,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mppry5/am_i_a_poor_developer_and_this_is_a_standard_dev/,2025-08-14 03:43:32,2025-08-21 01:38:08
1mt09p0,Hope this helps you improve your spoken communication skills like it did for me,SomeRandomCSGuy,cscareerquestions,"A while back, I made a post about how developing soft skills (alongside coding) helped me build visibility, trust, and alignment at work and eventually get promoted to senior much faster than others. You can check it out in my posts history if you are interested.One of the most common questions I got on that post was around how I developed my spoken communication skills because I think that is what a majority of engineers struggle with, so decided to make a separate post about it.For context, I have grown up very introverted and shy. Always have had trouble with clear spoken communication - I used to stutter, use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc, which really affected my confidence and made me want to stay quiet most of the times, even during meetings. I always used to think that this skill was reserved for extroverted people and naturals. Boy, was I wrongThis year I decided to do something about it. Since I was an introvert and used to be holed up in my apartment most of the time away from people, I used to spend an ungodly amount of time on Youtube lol. I noticed that some YouTubers that I had been following for a couple years, were just so charismatic, articulate, authentic and genuine but when I went back and saw some of their old videos, they were completely different - awkward, and ineloquent. Kind of made me realize that the fact that they had been making videos for so long, they have been training their speaking muscle over and over again, and over time got immensely good at it.This gave me the idea to try doing something similar. So I slowly started recording myself speaking to the phone camera. I wasn’t the most consistent with it but slowly overtime I slowly started seeing progress. I used to just talk / ramble about anything (my day, experiences etc) just to get comfortable and tried to keep speaking for at least 5 mins.I even started YouTube channels to keep myself accountable to keep practicing and slowly start following a structured pattern  - since at work, during meetings or presentations etc I wasn’t going to just talk about my day etc. I started off with having word for word scripted videos but that was making me come off as really inauthentic. But with consistent practice, overtime I became comfrotable enough to just riff off from the top of my head while having just 2-3 main points in front of me.This truly boosted my confidence more than I can put into words!This translated directly Into work as well because now I was able to talk a lot more fluently and eloquently, and with confidence + authority. I had fixed my issues - stuttering, losing track of thought, using filler words etc - almost by 80%+.***TL;DR*** Record yourself speaking daily (even just 5 minutes). It feels awkward at first, but it will transform how you communicate within a couple of months. Speaking really is a muscle.Thanks for reading this long post haha. Hope this helps anyone who’s struggled with speaking up!Happy to answer any questions in the comments or DMs :)",45,0.96,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mt09p0/hope_this_helps_you_improve_your_spoken/,2025-08-17 19:33:18,2025-08-21 01:38:08

1mrii9d,I think I actually am an imposter. What can I do?,A3kus,cscareerquestions,"I've spent a large part of my ""career,"" doing passable work on existing projects. I was hired at my current position without a relevant degree and the world's tiniest amount of existing work. I've been in a position for five years. The entire time, I vacillated between feeling like I could do anything, and feeling like I was lucky to accomplish what I'd set out to accomplish. I've always cognitively known that I wasn't as good as a trained professional, but I think I started to lose sight of what that actually meant as time went on. Add to that the fact that there's simply so much I don't know that I don't know. Ultimately, I think I've probably been blissfully ignorant. I used to think that if I spent enough time iterating, I could figure most things out. I've frequented tutorials, articles and the messing around and finding out I used to do back when I felt I had more time. I've also been leaning hard on AI to learn new tricks.I've got a few certifications, but I strongly suspect that's because I'm good at testing and preparing to test -- not because I know the content the certifications really ask for. It's always felt like there was a lot of knowledge that ""real,"" professionals just knew; that the certs assumed. I think a few superiors of mine have been sort of covering for me? I'm not sure. But I know I've given them a front row seat to my ignorance and I've seen how they've worked around it. I don't have those supports anymore. It's led to problems -- poor, inflexible designs when I could do things, and code built on what I could accomplish, not the best tools for the job, when I couldn't. Right now, I'm in a position where I have several complex problems on my plate including buggy systems that I've written and all I know is that if I'm lucky enough to solve any of them -- they'll probably be hacked together. I'm aware at the highest possible level of techniques and practices that would help, but I've never implemented them before, and I won't be able to just ""figure things out."" anymore. My job thinks I'm somewhere between mid and senior level, and I just... Am not. My ego has been all over the place and I think I've been projecting like I was better than I was without being 100% aware of it. I'm at the point where I'd quit, if I could. I don't want to be a hinderance; I'm worried that my coworkers are depending on me, and I'm so burned out from doing everything I can to get by (short of like....

I am about to start my CS Masters program at good public school (UMD) and am thinking about quitting my job where I feel stuck and see no future.I currently work at small somewhat dying government contractor company. I've been here for 3 years and I feel like the company been slowly dying: went from 1000 employees when I started to about 80 now, CEO/owner is not taking any pay this year, benefits are being cut, no new contracts, and list can go on. I've started as intern working with CEO 3 years ago and later moved into more of team lead position/developer position. Working with CEO introduced me to lots of cool tech and experiences, I went from student with 0 level of experience to someone who can lead teams and develop products. While I loved the experience - my income hasn't changed since I started 3 years ago and as for now I make only $40k/year. I've been doing great at school. Graduated this spring and was offered admission to CS Masters program at UMD which came with some financial offer (free tuition plus $1500k/month stipend) for at least 1 semester. I also got an offer to work for a lab (actually a few of them). Those labs look very promising and if that work out I might be able to get a research position that would cover my tuition for the whole time. Here is the conflict I have. While I don't feel like my job can help me to grow - I do like being employed, being paid, having health insurance and gaining the experience. On the other hand - I see lots of opportunities within academia and putting time and effort into working and networking might help me to secure much better position later.

I feel like it would be impossible for me to hold a job with 5 times the workload as before, but I've also heard from multiple tech people that tech doesn't require you to actually focus for the 40 hours. I've applied to SSDI, but given my education and experience, it's unlikely. (I have two friends, also with autism, on disability, but they were never college educated).So how many hours do you focus on coding? And I'm wondering if there's any advice on finding a ""laid back"" job, or any tips for holding a normal job, especially if you also have autism and/or adhd.

1msz953,Performance Dip from bad management and from life. Drowning. Not sure how to address.,GenuineClamhat,cscareerquestions,"Hey. A decade into a niche area of tech. I was an all star for the first few years, company was purchased, management changed and our roles have been changing. The last year my role has changed to something that looks nothing like my skillset and certainly not my area of talent. I was given the chat of ""We don't have enough work anymore in what you do, so you have to expand to stay relevant."" Fair, ok.Trouble is, I was immediately thrown into accelerated deadlines with no training. PMs recently were given more power due to trying to fix financial issues in the company. Basically, we charge clients a few lump sums of work and don't technically have billable hours. We track billable hours internally just to make sure things are still profitable. I got throw onto not one but two projects in which either the client misinterpreted the work and a non-technical person put together the contract which led to a loss. Or, the PMs made promises that couldn't be kept and tried to be technical and then tried to cover by forcing terrible deadlines (asking for 6 weeks of work in 4 days sort of nonsense).I've been getting whiplash and it's effected me negatively. Upper management doesn't like how to push back on timelines while at the same time stating that engineers tell the PMs what a reasonable timeline is and then reneg and support impossible goals. I keep asking for time to work on some training so I can do the new work, ask questions and actually make it my skillset (no, I can't do it in me free time, this is not a skillset that can be googled, it's purely mentored skills only, thing post-quantum crypto analysis activities in alignment with niche security standards in specific nations).I have been compensating for this lack of time being given on projects or training by working weekends...the last four. I've been 1-2 days behind on all my tasks even with long days and working weekends. I'm doing my best when management won't listen to me.Friday I saw the lab director looking at my work, he voiced he was upset I said work was done by 5PM when he found gaps. Our lead wasn't going to look at it until Monday, and I am spending the weekend making up the GAPs.They taught me that asking for the extra time was pushed back on. That the works ""should get done during the week"" while also ""recognizing the time constraints are a challenge."" I cannot win. I figure it's better to ask for forgiveness then permission. I am giving of myself.But my direct manager basically gave me a heads up that upper management is pissed and reactive right now. I have four deadlines next week on three other projects and I got scheduled for 5 hours of meetings with ominous titles. I am working on an exit strategy but am in the ""hurry up and wait"" for a clearance related job. There are four labs in the world that do what we do: none are hiring right now. This is a VERY niche area of tech.Trying to keep calm, work up a game plan. I'm biding my time until I leave. I hate that I have to have the conversation again of, ""I am compensating the best I can for poor timelines, but you're still getting quality of work. You won't OK more work days, get offended when I honestly log my hours for weekends, I'm salaried, you don't pay me more for it. You tell me engineers determine timelines, but allow the PMs to reject and reset them. Everyone is so overworked that no mentoring is available and we're getting more and more work outside of our individual scopes because you fired 70% of the lab in January. Please give me a clear and consistent response on what you need me to do, and I'll do it.""Objectively I am just in the time period of despair for some companies where management is failing hard and good workers can't compensate for their own ignorance and inconsistencies anymore. But I'm struggling. I have some real life things going on too, two deaths in the family in the last month, suing my insurance, husband had surgery, trying to squeak out some joy for myself...but I'm just drowning. I've been using my PTO liberally but it's going towards errands, those life things, and I even used a few to ""catch up on work without anyone talking to me.""

1msqr9u,Completing work that I wouldn't been able to complete without AI,Gonjanaenae319,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, this isn't ""career"" related question but something I've been experiencing recently. I'll give more concrete example for this case.I'm an L1 engineer with just under 2 YOE and my team recently started develping OpenAPI for our product. It's essentially an AWS API Gateway layer that will just redirect any incoming request to our internal endpoints with some middlewares such as authentiacation lambda and proxy for request and response transformation through VTL. Nothing too technically complicated.I realised that our team had to constantly deploy any changes made to endpoints to test them and this was delaying the development process significantly as we all had to wait 20 to 30 minutes for the whole application to test a minor change. So I started looking into testing this locally, and came across different ways such as using LocalStack or SAM Cli local and eventually settled on sam cli. I'm still not familiar with AWS and how these infrastructures work fully so I heavily relied on AI to explain to me how I can incorporate this into our existing system and get it eventually working. It ended up analysing the whole cdk and right up the entire mock auth and proxy system and start up a sam cli local server through docker. It didn't take me too long to understand what it has implemented and purpose behind it, although I knew that if I were to implement this on my own without AI, it would've taken a significant amount of time that it probably wouldn't have been worth keep digging and focus more on actual release of endpoints.It was definitely good learning experience and I feel like I learnt something quite useful and interesting but it also feels discouraging in some way that I would've not been able to deliver this in such short amount of time without AI as I basically did no coding in this context.I was wondering if I should take a different course of action in learning and developing something I have virtually no experience and knowledge in to actually learn it properly.",13,0.76,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1msqr9u/completing_work_that_i_wouldnt_been_able_to/,2025-08-17 13:20:27,2025-08-21 01:38:08

1mu5fks,Late career: Planning my final years & offramp,Repulsive_List_5639,cscareerquestions,"BLUF: I'm 45, MS & BS in CS and in technical management at a national lab. I came here because I was sick of industry, venture capital, layoffs, etc. The lab's comp and benefits package was enough for me to say fuqqit to private industry's higher comps and volatility. I also noticed the workforce skewed older, and surmised less ageism in the tech roles here. Glad to say I've been right so far. Finally, in the back of my mind I always wished I had earned a PhD so that I could be an expert in something. Doesn't mean I wanted to do pure research per-say, but just to have developed depth. The lab is supportive of that - extra time off, free grad school, connections, etc. Since I'm just over halfway through my career I've really started to map out my off ramp. The math says I can probably retire in 10 years (age 55) if I stay, thanks to a great 401K match and a small windfall I got earlier this year. There is also a tuition benefit for my kids: half off in-state if my kids qualify academically. Since I have 4, that's going to help a lot :). To make it work though, I feel a strong need to do one last push with my education and personal development, and that is where I could use some perspective from other late career folks in tech. Some paths open before me are:\- Project & Program Management. In addition to my tech management role, I manage a \~$16M contract (finances, staffing, direction, etc). I've thought I should just get a PMP so I can check the box and have some more options. (P.S. I feel like its fine to be ""older"" in these kind of management roles).\- Go for a PhD in CS with an AI focus. The lab has plenty of academic affiliations where I could seriously pursue this part-time. It would take a while, but I'd still feel good about it as a life goal. Then maybe I can teach at the community college nearby. My MS was relatively recent (5 years ago) with an AI/ML focus and straight As. I can do well academically when I put my mind to it. \- Get an MS/Dr. Eng in Systems Engineering so I can broaden the projects I work on. I've always been the guy who could extract requirements, model different approaches, build schedules, budgets, etc. I wrote plenty of code - but also raised my hand to do all the other stuff because I like variety. Probably why I'm doing some project management now.\- A wilder option is a (slow) pivot into computational physics, since we do tons of computational modeling and simulation for all sorts of scenarios that might arise in the defense of our nation. That just might mean an Applied Physics MS to start, but I could see going all the way with a PhD (probably earned at 60 though :) ). Intellectually, this grabs me the most because it would probably stretch me the most - I love learning - and get me into some really cool work.I haven't done exhaustive pros/cons to these and thats probably my next step. I'd still like some outside perspective from later career folks in CS who have maybe walked some of these paths and could provide an opinion. I'm wrestling with the feeling that this would be my last big career development goal, and I need to pick the ""right"" one.",12,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mu5fks/late_career_planning_my_final_years_offramp/,2025-08-19 01:53:32,2025-08-21 01:38:08

1mqdqlo,Is running arch Linux worth it from a learning time investment perspective if employment is the goal?,Cautious-Bet-9707,cscareerquestions,"With SWE employment being the goal, I wonder if this has any benefit. My leaning philosophy has always been to take the harder path, I want to become one with the terminal, started messing around with configs and p10k theme, but I always leave it on pure or bare bones settings, because I’m worried that if the console were somehow easier to use I would have a worse understanding of it and struggle with simpler terminals or actions on the job one day. I thought arch Linux was cool because of customization and needing to get really familiar with the terminal and maybe get a better understanding of os’s and such, initially it was for productivity, then aesthetics, then learning, but then the time commitment become so large I’m wondering if I’m misplacing it by not just building projects, learning more languages, or leet code. Do you think the true lower level understanding is necessary or am I wasting time and everything in that regard can be googled and I just need to learn to code?

While I’m very interested in both fields, the clock is ticking down till graduation and I still don’t have a good project out. I worked on a game engine for a while but ended up refactoring it and ruining it and eventually just discarded it.

1mqjui7,Need CS Career Advice,Successful_Archer315,cscareerquestions,"Hi, I'm a rising college sophomore aspiring to be a cs major. After essentially procrastinating most of my 3 month summer after freshman year, I feel like I desperately need some advice for how I'm going to enter this field. As of right now, I essentially don't have any projects, connections, or other relevant experience. The most I've done was focusing on my intro classes to get into my major. There's so much advice for how I go about my journey that it feels overwhelming to know what's right, especially since most said advice is fragmented or terribly vague. It also doesn't help that I've mostly been alone in my journey so far and hence haven't received much guidance or collaboration. One common dilemma I face is how I learn programming. Most guides I've seen online feel contradictory or, again, vague. Like they would say don't follow tutorials and immediately after promote some 6 hour course I'm never going to finish, or start honestly. Others say learn these languages and do projects right after. Great, but how do I learn those languages? You see where I'm getting here? Every time I try pushing forward in my journey, the more vague, confusing, and overwhelming everything seems to feel, especially with the rise of the intense market and ai. With all that being said, I chose this field for a reason. I've been genuinely interested in cs ever since I was in high school, and from then until now couldn't find any other profession that would be as well suited for me. So it's been quite frustrating getting hurdles like this and not really making any progress for the past couple of years, despite all the free time I had.
