1nbnucq,I am a DE who is happy and likes their work. AMA,MikeDoesEverything,dataengineering,"In contrast to the vast number of posts which are basically either:* Announcing they are quitting* Complaining they can't get a job* Complaining they can't do their current job* ""I heard DE is dead. Source: me. Zero years experience in DE or any job for that matter. 25 years experience in TikTok. I am 21 years old""* Needing projects* Begging for ""tips"" how to pass the forbidden word which rhymes with schminterview (this one always gets a chuckle)* Also begging for ""tips"" on how to do their job (I put tips in inverted commas because what they want is a full blown solution to something they can't do)* AI generated posts (whilst I largely think the mods do a great job, the number of blatant AI posts in here is painful to read)I thought a nice change of pace was required. So here it is - I'm a DE who is happy and is actually writing this post using my own brain.About me: I am self taught and have been a DE for just under 5 years ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lmi2lg/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/)). Spend most of my time doing quite interesting (to me) work where I have a data focussed, technical role building a data platform. I earn a decent amount of money with which I'm happy with.My work conditions are decent with an understanding and supportive manager. Have to work weekends? Here's some very generous overtime. Requested time off? No problem - go and enjoy your holiday and see you when you back with no questions asked. They treat me like a person, I turn up every day and put in the extra work when they need me to. Don't get me wrong, I'm the most cynical person ever although my last two managers have changed my mind completely.I dictate my own workload and have loads of freedom. If something needs fixing, I will go ahead and fix it. Opinions during technical discussions are always considered and rarely swatted away. I get a lot of self satisfaction from turning out work and am a healthy mix of proud (when something is well built and works) and not so proud (something which really shouldn't exist but has to). My job security is higher than most because I don't work in the US or in a high risk industry which means slightly less money although a lot less stress.Regularly get approached for new opportunities of both contract and FTE although have no plans on leaving any time soon because I like my current everything. Yes, more money would be nice although the amount of ""arsehole pay"" I would need to cope working with, well, potential arseholes is quite high at the moment.Before I get asked any predictable questions, some observations:* Most, if not all, people who have worked in IT and have never done another job are genuinely spoilt. Much higher salaries, flexibility, and number of opportunities than most fields along with a lower barrier to entry, infinite learning resources, and possibility of building whatever you want from home with almost no restrictions. My previous job required 4 years of education to get an actual entry level position, which is on-site only, and I was extremely lucky to have not needed a PhD. I got my first job in DE with £40-60 of courses and a used, crusty Dell Optiplex from Ebay. The ""bad job market"" everybody is experiencing is probably better than most jobs best job market.* If you are using AI to fucking write REDDIT POSTS then you don't have imposter syndrome because you're a literal imposter. If you don't even have the confidence to use your own words on a social media platform, then you should use this as an opportunity because arranging your thoughts or developing your communication style is something you clearly need practice with. AI is making you worse to the point you are literally deferring what words you want to use to a computer. Let that sink in for a sec how idiotic this is. Yes, I am shaming you.* If you can't get a job and are instead reading this post, then seriously get off the internet and stick some time into getting better. You don't need more courses. You don't need guidance. You don't need a fucking mentor. You need discipline, motivation, and drive. Real talk: if you find yourself giving up there are two choices. You either take a break and find it within you to keep going or you can just do something else.* If you want to keep going: then keep going. Somebody doing 10 hours a week and are ""talented"" will get outworked by the person doing 60+ hours a week who is ""average"". Time in the seat is a very important thing and there are no shortcuts for time spent learning. The more time you spend learning new things and improving, the quicker you'll reach your goal. What might take somebody 12 months might take you 6. What might take you 6 somebody might learn in 3. Ignore everybody else's journey and focus on yours.* If you want to stop: there's no shame in realising DE isn't for you. There's no shame in realising ANY career isn't for you. We're all good at something, friends. Life doesn't always have to be a struggle.AMAEDIT: Jesus, already seeing AI replies.

1n7fu2f,Confirm my suspicion about data modeling,DryRelationship1330,dataengineering,"As a consultant, I see a lot of mid-market and enterprise DWs in varying states of (mis)management.When I ask DW/BI/Data Leaders about Inmon/Kimball, Linstedt/Data Vault, constraints as enforcement of rules, rigorous fact-dim modeling, SCD2, or even domain-specific models like OPC-UA or OMOP… the quality of answers has dropped off a cliff. 10 years ago, these prompts would kick off lively debates on formal practices and techniques (ie. the good ole fact-qualifier matrix).Now? More often I see a mess of staging and store tables dumped into Snowflake, plus some catalog layers bolted on later to help make sense of it....usually driven by “the business asked for report\_x.”I hear less argument about the integration of data to comport with the Subjects of the Firm and more about ETL jobs breaking and devs not using the right formatting for PySpark tasks.I’ve come to a conclusion: the era of Data Modeling might be gone.

1n9s0o6,How did you get really good with SQL?,LongCalligrapher2544,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I’m currently working as a Data Analyst, and while I do use SQL daily, I recently realized that my level might only be somewhere around mid-level, not advanced.

1navs38,"After 8 years, I'm thinking of callling it quits",Fonduemeup,dataengineering,"**After working as a DA for 1 year, DS/MLE for 3 years, and DE for 4, my outlook on this field (and life in general, sadly) has never been bleaker.** Every position I've been in has had its own frustrations in some way: team is overworked, too much red tape, lack of leadership, lack of organization/strategy, hostile stakeholders, etc...And just recently, **management laid off some of our team because they ""think we should be able to use AI to be more productive"".** I feel like I have been searching for that mystical ""dream job"" for years, and yet it seems that I am further away from obtaining it as ever before. With AI having already made so much progress, I'm starting to think that this dream job I have been looking for may no longer even exist. Even though I've enjoyed my job at times in the past, **at this point, I think I'm done with this career.** I have lost all the passion that I originally had 8 years ago, and I don't foresee it ever returning. What will I do next? Who knows. I have a few months of savings that will keep me afloat before I figure that out, and if money starts running out, my backup plan is to become a surf instructor in Fiji (or something along those lines). Before the layoffs, my team was already using AI, and, while it's been increasingly useful, the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation. We've been pretty good on staying up-to-date with AI trends - we hopped on Cursor back in February and have been using Claude Code since April. However, our codebase is way too convoluted for consistent results, and we lack proper documentation for AI agents to implement major changes. After several failed attempts to solve these issues, I find Claude Code only useful for small, localized features or fixes. Until LLMs can extrapolate code to understand the underlying business context, or write code that is fully aware of end-to-end system dependencies, my team will continue to face these problems. **My favorite part about working in data has always been when I get to solve challenging problems through code, but this has completely disappeared from my day-to-day work**. Writing complex logic is a fun challenge, and it's very rewarding when you finally build a working solution. Unfortunately, this is one of the few things AI is much more efficient than me at doing, so I barely do it anymore. Instead, I'm basically supervising a junior engineer (Claude) that does the work while I handle the administrative / PM duties. Meanwhile, I'm even more busy than before since we are all picking up the extra workload from our teammates that were let go. As AI capabilities continue to improve, this part of my job will surely become a larger amount of my time, and I simply can't see myself doing it any more than I already am. I had a short stint as a manager a couple years ago, and while it wasn't for me, it was at least rewarding to help actual people. Instructing a LLM was interesting and fun at first, but the novelty wore off several months ago, and I now find it to be irritating above anything else. Most of my experience comes from startups and mid-sized companies, but it really hit me yesterday when talking to my friend who is a DS at a FAANG. She has been dealing with her own frustrations at work, and although her situation is very different than mine, she voiced the same negative sentiments that I had been feeling. I am now thinking that my feelings are more widespread than I thought. Or maybe I have just had bad luck.",212,0.93,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1navs38/after_8_years_im_thinking_of_callling_it_quits/,2025-09-07 15:13:59,2025-09-10 01:24:33

1n81kxy,I built a Python tool to create a semantic layer over SQL for LLMs using a Knowledge Graph. Is this a useful approach?,Key_Salamander234,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,So I've been diving into AI for the past few months (this is actually my first real project) and got a bit frustrated with how ""dumb"" LLMs can be when it comes to navigating complex SQL databases. Standard text-to-SQL is cool, but it often misses the business context buried in weirdly named columns or implicit relationships.My idea was to build a semantic layer on top of a SQL database (PostgreSQL in my case) using a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j. The goal is to give an LLM a ""map"" of the database it can actually understand.\*\*Here's the core concept:\*\*Instead of just tables and columns, the Python framework builds a graph with rich nodes and relationships:\* \*\*Node Types:\*\* We have \`Database\`, \`Schema\`, \`Table\`, and \`Column\` nodes. Pretty standard stuff.\* \*\*Properties are Key:\*\* This is where it gets interesting. Each \`Column\` node isn't just a name. I use GPT-4 to synthesize properties like:\* \`business\_description\`: ""Stores the final approval date for a sales order.""\* \`stereotype\`: \`TIMESTAMP\`, \`PRIMARY\_KEY\`, \`STATUS\_FLAG\`, etc.\* \`confidence\_score\`: How sure the LLM is about its analysis.\* \*\*Rich Relationships:\*\* This is the core of the semantic layer. The graph doesn't just have \`HAS\_COLUMN\` relationships. It also creates:\* \`EXPLICIT\_FK\_TO\`: For actual foreign keys, a direct, machine-readable link.\* \*\*\`IMPLICIT\_RELATION\_TO\`\*\*: This is the fun part. It finds columns that are logically related but have no FK constraint. For example, it can figure out that \`users.email\_address\` is semantically equivalent to \`employees.contact\_email\`. It does this by embedding the descriptions and doing a vector similarity search in Neo4j to find candidates, then uses the LLM to verify.The final KG is basically a ""human-readable"" version of the database schema that an LLM agent could query to understand context before trying to write a complex SQL query. For instance, before joining tables, the agent could ask the graph: ""What columns are semantically related to \`customer\_id\`?""Since I'm new to this, my main question for you all is: \*\*is this actually a useful approach in the real world?\*\* Does something like this already exist and I just reinvented the wheel?I'm trying to figure out if this idea has legs or if I'm over-engineering a problem that's already been solved.

1n9culi,The Anatomy of a S3-Native Distributed Query Engine,heisenberg_zzh,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering,I'm the co-founder of Databend, an open source Snowflake alternative, and I wanted to share a bit of our journey building a SQL query engine that's designed to live on cloud storage like S3. This isn't a sales pitch—just an honest, educational walkthrough of the ""why"" behind our architecture. If you've ever been curious about what happens inside a query engine or why your queries on data lakes sometimes feel slow, I hope this sheds some light.**The Dream: A Database on S3**Like many of you, we love S3. It's cheap, it's huge, and it's durable. The dream is to just point a SQL engine at it and go, without managing a complex, traditional data warehouse. But there's a catch: S3 is a network service, and the network is *slow*.A single data request to S3 might take 50-200 milliseconds. In that tiny slice of time, your CPU could have executed millions of instructions. If your query engine just sits there and waits for the data to arrive, you're essentially paying for expensive CPUs to do nothing. This latency is the single biggest monster you have to slay when building a database on S3.**Why We Built a New Query Executor**When we started, we naturally looked at classic database designs. They're brilliant pieces of engineering, but they were born in a world of fast, local disks.1. **The ""Pull"" Model (aka the ""Volcano"" model):** Think of this like a game of telephone. The final step of your query plan (e.g., `SUM()`) asks the step before it for a row, which asks the step before it, and so on, all the way down to the data source. It's simple and has a nice, natural flow. **But on S3, it's a performance disaster.** When the first operator in the chain asks S3 for data, the *entire assembly line* of operators grinds to a halt. Your CPUs are idle, just waiting for data to arrive, while you're burning money on compute you can't use.2. **The ""Push"" Model (Vectorized Execution):** This is more like a factory assembly line. The data source pushes batches of data to the first worker, which processes it and pushes it to the next. It's fantastic for raw CPU performance. **But on S3, it's a memory bomb.** S3 can send data in unpredictable bursts. A fast data-scanning step can easily flood a slower step (like a complex `JOIN`), causing data to pile up in memory until the system crashes.**From SQL to an Execution Plan**So, how does a simple SQL string like `SELECT * FROM ...` turn into a plan that our workers can run? It's a multi-stage process, a bit like a chef turning a recipe into a detailed kitchen workflow.1. **Parsing:** First, we parse the raw SQL text into a structured format called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is just a tree that represents the query's grammar, making it understandable for the machine.2. **Logical Plan:** Next, we convert the AST into a *logical plan*. This describes the *what* of the query—the sequence of high-level operations needed, like ""scan this table,"" then ""filter these rows,"" then ""aggregate the results."" It's still abstract and doesn't care about how the data is stored or how many machines we have.3. **Physical Plan:** This is where the magic happens. Our query optimizer takes the logical plan and transforms it into a *physical plan*. It looks at table statistics, data layout, and available resources to decide the most efficient *how*. For example, it decides whether to use a Hash Join or a Merge Join, how to distribute work across nodes, and in what order to join tables.4. **Executor Graph:** Finally, this physical plan is used to generate the actual graph of `Processor` actors that our scheduler will run. Each step in the physical plan becomes one or more workers in our asynchronous assembly line.This whole process ensures that by the time we start executing, we have a cost-optimized, concrete plan ready to go.**A New Plan: Building for the Cloud**The core idea was simple: **a worker should never block waiting for the network.** While it's waiting for S3, it should be able to do other useful work. This is the principle of asynchronous processing.We designed a system in Rust based on a few key concepts:* **Workers as Independent ""Actors"":** Each part of the query plan—a `Filter`, `Join`, `Aggregate`—is an independent worker. Think of it as a specialist on an assembly line with a simple job and its own state.* **A Central ""Scheduler"" as the Factory Manager:** Instead of talking to each other, workers report their status to a central scheduler. A worker can raise its hand and say: * ""I'm ready for data!"" * ""I have a batch of data and I'm ready to do some computation."" * ""I'm about to ask S3 for data, which will take a while. You can check back on me later."" * ""Whoa, I'm getting overwhelmed! My output buffer is full! Tell the upstream workers to pause.""* **Backpressure as the Safety Valve:** That last status is crucial. It's called **backpressure**, and it's the system's safety valve. It prevents the memory bomb. If a `JOIN` worker gets overwhelmed, it tells the scheduler, which then tells the `Scan` worker to stop fetching data from S3 for a moment. This allows the system to self-regulate and remain stable.* **IO Concurrency is Key to Hiding Latency:** Because asking for data is non-blocking, we can ask S3 for hundreds of different data chunks *all at once*. The scheduler then efficiently processes them as they arrive. This allows us to saturate the network connection and hide the latency of any single request, dramatically improving throughput.**How This Scales to Handle Complex SQL**This architecture allows us to scale in two ways:1. **Multi-threading (Scaling Up):** For a single, large query, we can duplicate parts of the query pipeline. For example, we can have multiple `Scan` and `Partial Aggregate` workers running in parallel on different CPU cores, each processing a different part of the data. A final `Merge` step combines their results.2. **Distributed Execution (Scaling Out):** To scale across multiple machines, we treat the network as just another connection between workers. A special `Exchange` worker on one machine can send data to another `Exchange` worker on a different machine. To the rest of the query plan, it's completely transparent. This lets us use the same logic for a single-node query and a 100-node distributed query.**A Few Hard-Won Lessons*** **Stability over raw speed:** Building in robust backpressure from day one was the single most important decision for system stability.* **Separate your concerns:** We run I/O-heavy tasks (like waiting for the network) and CPU-heavy tasks (like decompressing data) on separate thread pools. This ensures that a long computation doesn't stop the engine from handling new data arriving from S3.* **Observability is everything:** When you have thousands of tiny tasks running in parallel, you need great tooling to see what's going on, like query profiles, flamegraphs, and distributed tracing logs to find where the bottlenecks are and why a query is slow.I hope this was a helpful, non-hyped look into what it takes to build a modern, cloud-native query engine. The concepts of asynchronous processing and backpressure are becoming more and more relevant for all kinds of data systems, not just databases.I'm happy to answer any questions about our architecture or the trade-offs we made!

Do you mostly just write to S3/object storage and pick it up in the next step, or is XCom actually useful beyond small metadata?Basically I want to set this up the “right” way so it scales without turning into a mess.

1nayp2m,"Got hired as Jr DE, but now running the whole team alone burned out and doubting my path",OkSatisfaction7486,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, sorry if my English isn’t very good.**TL;DR:** I’m a fresh graduate in Actuarial Science. Got a Jr. Data Engineer role, but the Senior DE quit right before I joined now I’m the only DE. Everything is a mess (broken pipelines, legacy code, poor management, no guidance, layoffs). On top of that, they expect huge changes, endless requirements, and bad deadlines, with constant meetings leaving no time to work. I’m learning a lot, but I’m burned out and doubting if I should stay or return to actuarial work.I just graduated in May with a degree in Actuarial Science. And over here it’s common to have an internship while still studying during the semester, so almost everyone graduates with around two years of experience. During my internships, I worked on pension and macroeconomics analysis. Later, I had the opportunity to join a BI team at a fintech. There, I helped improve semantic models, fix dashboards with slow refresh times, and implement better practices. After that, I got another internship offer for the Data Engineering team, which was basically a one person team. I decided to give it a shot, and it turned out to be a good experience: I used Azure for the first time, learned some Scala, Airflow, and PySpark.Fast forward to one month before graduation: an international manufacturer contacted me for a Jr DE position. I doubted if I could fit in, since my technical skills weren’t as strong as CS graduates. After three interviews (one with the Senior DE, where we had an amazing conversation), I got the job offer. I was skeptical, but I accepted it because the Senior DE convinced me it was a great opportunity. I even turned down another offer from an insurance company.To my surprise, during onboarding they told me the Senior DE had just quit the Friday before, leaving me as the only DE. After some thought, I accepted. But I wasn’t ready for what I found:* No documentation* Broken pipelines* Tons of legacy code from outsourcing during the pandemic* Broken dashboards and angry users* A messy data lake with no organization* A passive-aggressive data steward whenever I try to improve workflows* A team using Scrum (my first time) with POs who don’t know what they need* A project manager who flames us whenever something goes wrong* A “data scientist” who is really used as an analytics engineerRight now, I’m doing my best: learning best practices, writing documentation, and even working extra hours. But it feels like I’m always just fixing problems. There’s one dashboard that breaks almost every day, pipelines that constantly need re-runs, and new business rules popping up all the time. On top of that, leadership keeps pushing for “big changes” with impossible deadlines, constant requirements, and back-to-back meetings that leave me with almost no time to actually focus on building things.After a 1:1 with my manager, he admitted the company’s vision changes almost daily. The CTO once told me about the importance of building a data driven mindset, but just three days later, layoffs happened and the CTO himself was gone. Now I have no guidance, I don’t know where we’re heading, and I’m doubting my skills.**What would you do in my position?

1n9rpok,Signs you shouldn’t use a streaming framework?,itamarwe,dataengineering,"I hope we can agree that streaming data pipelines (Flink, Spark Streaming) are tougher to build and maintain (DLQ, backfills, out-of-order and late events). Yet we often default to them, even when our data isn’t truly streaming.After seeing how data pipelines are actually built across many organizations, here are 3 signs that tell me streaming might not be the right choice:1. Either the source or the destination isn’t streaming - e.g., reading from a batch-based API or writing only batched aggregations.2. Recent data isn’t more valuable than historical data - e.g., financial data where accuracy matters more than freshness.3. Events arrive out of order (with plenty of late arrivals) - e.g., mobile devices sending cached events once they reconnect.In these cases, a simpler batch-based approach works better for me: fewer moving parts, lower cost, and often just as effective.How do you decide when to use streaming frameworks?",30,0.94,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n9rpok/signs_you_shouldnt_use_a_streaming_framework/,2025-09-06 05:45:26,2025-09-10 01:24:33

The sourced data is incorrect to begin with because of inconsistent data values and now thats being used to validate the pipeline.That doesn’t seem right to me, since the whole purpose of cleaning is to fix inconsistencies and remove bad data — so the totals will naturally differ by some margin.Is this a common practice, or is there a better way I can frame the validation I’ve already done to show it’s solid.

1nadpir,"Introducing Minarrow — Apache Arrow implementation for HPC, Native Streaming, and Embedded Systems",peterxsyd,dataengineering,"# Dear Data Engineers,I’ve recently built a production-grade, from-scratch implementation of the ***Apache Arrow*** data standard in **Rust**—shaped to to strike a new balance between ***simplicity***, ***power***, and ***ergonomics***.I’d love to share it with you and get your thoughts, particularly if you:* Work in the *(more hardcore end) of the* **data engineering** space* Us**e Rust for data pipeline**s, or the Arrow data format for systems / engine / embedded work* Build **distributed** or **embedded** software that benefits from Arrow’s memory layout and wire protocols just as much as the columnar analytics it's typically known for.# Why did I build it?***Apache Arrow*** (and `arrow-rs`) are very powerful and have reshaped the data ecosystem through zero-copy memory sharing, lean buffer specs, and a rich interoperability story. When building certain types of high-performance data systems in Rust, though (e.g., distributed data, embedded), I found myself running into friction.# Pain points:* **Engineering Velocity:** The general-purpose design is great for the ecosystem, but I encountered long compile times *(30+ seconds).** **Heavy Abstraction:** Deep trait layers and hierarchies made some otherwise simple tasks more involved—like printing a buffer or quickly seeing types in the IDE.* **Type Landscape:** Many logical Arrow types share the same physical representation. Completeness is important, but in my work I’ve valued a clearer, more consolidated type model. In shaping Minarrow, I leaned on the principle often attributed to Einstein: *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler"".* This ethos has filtered through the conventions used in the library.* **Composability:** I often wanted to “opt up” and down abstraction levels depending on the situation—e.g. from a raw buffer to an Arrow Array—without friction.So I set out to build something tuned for engineering workloads that plugs naturally into everyday Rust use cases without getting in the way. The result is an Arrow-*Compatible* implementation from the ground up.# Introducing: MinarrowArrow minimalism meets Rust polyglot data systems engineering.# Highlights:* Custom `Vec64` allocator: 64-byte aligned, SIMD-compatible. No setup required. Benchmarks indicate alloc parity with standard `Vec`.* Six base types (`IntegerArray`, `FloatArray`, `CategoricalArray`, `StringArray`, `BooleanArray`, `DatetimeArray`), slotting into many modern use cases (HFC, embedded work, streaming ) etc.* Arrow-compatible, with some simplifications: * Logical Arrow types collapsed via generics (e.g. DATE32, DATE64 → `DatetimeArray`). * Dictionary encoding represented as `CategoricalArray`.* Unified, ergonomic accessors: `myarr.num().i64()` with IDE support, no downcasting.* Arrow Schema support, chunked data, zero-copy views, schema metadata included.* Zero dependencies beyond `num-traits` *(and optional Rayon).*# Performance and ergonomics* **1.5s clean build,** <**0.15s rebuilds*** **Very fast runtime** *(See laptop benchmarks in repo)** **Tokio-native IPC:** async IPC Table and Parquet readers/writers via sibling crate *Lightstream** **Zero-copy MMAP r**eader *(\~100m row reads in \~4ms on my consumer laptop)** **Automatic 64-byte alignment** *(avoiding SIMD penalties and runtime checks)** `.to_polars()` and `.to_arrow()` built-in* Rayon parallelism* **Full FFI** via Arrow C Data Interface* **Extensive documentation**# Trade-offs:* **No nested types** *(List, Struct)* or other exotic Arrow types at this stage* **Full connector ecosystem** requires \`.to\_arrow()\` bridge to Apache Arrow *(compile-time cost: 30–60s)* . *Note: IPC and Parquet are directly supported in Lightstream.*# Outcome:* **Fast, lean, and clean** – rapid iteration velocity* **Compatible**: Uses Arrow memory layout and ecosystem-pluggable* **Composable**: use only what’s necessary* **Performance** **without penalty** (compile times! Obviously Arrow itself is an *outstanding ecosystem*).# Where Minarrow fits:* **Ultra-performance data pipelines*** **Embedded system and** **polyglot** **apps*** **SIMD compute*** **Live streaming*** **HPC** and low-latency workloads* MIT Licensed# Open-Source sister-crates:* **Lightstream**: Native streaming with Tokio, for building custom wire formats and minimising memory copies. Includes SIMD-friendly async readers and writers, enabling direct SIMD-accelerated processing from a memory-mapped file.* **Simd-Kernels**: 100+ SIMD and standard kernels for statistical analysis, string processing, and more, with an extensive set of univariate distributions.* You can find these on crates-io or my GitHub.Rust is still developing in the Data Engineering ecosystem, but if your work touches high-performance data pipelines, Arrow interoperability, or low-latency data systems, hopefully this will resonate.Would love your feedback.Thanks,PB **Github**: [https://github.com/pbower/minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow)",14,0.83,7,https://docs.rs/minarrow/latest/minarrow/index.html,2025-09-06 23:12:26,2025-09-10 01:24:33

Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):**1. Data ingestion**- Mix of **official APIs**, **custom scrapers**, and **file uploads (Excel/CSV)**.- APIs are great… until rate limits kick in.- Scrapers constantly broke due to DOM changes, so we moved towards a modular crawler architecture.**2. Transformation & storage**- For small data, Pandas was fine; for large-scale, we shifted to a Spark-based ETL flow.- Building a schema that supports both **structured fields** and **text blobs** was trickier than expected.- We store intermediate results to S3, then feed them into a Postgres + Elasticsearch hybrid.**3. Analysis & reporting**- Downstream consumers wanted dashboards and visualizations, so we auto-generate reports from aggregated metrics.- For trend detection, we rely on a mix of TF-IDF, sentiment scoring, and lightweight ML models.Key takeaways:- **Schema evolution** is the silent killer — plan for breaking changes early.- Invest in **pipeline observability** (we use OpenTelemetry) to debug failures faster.- Scaling ETL isn’t about size, it’s about **variance** — the more sources, the messier it gets.Curious if anyone here has tackled **multi-platform ETL** before:- Do you centralize all raw data first, or process at the edge?- How do you manage scraper reliability at scale?- Any tips on schema evolution when source structures are constantly changing?",10,0.82,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n9vqxt/lessons_learned_building_a_scalable_pipeline_for/,2025-09-06 10:01:03,2025-09-10 01:24:33

Said data will then be used for- Advertising profiles/segmentationSince the current data volume is so small, and reading several threads here, it seems the consensus is to use RDS for small outfits like this.

We will also get an understanding the development journey of any real world project and we will be able to create projects with professionalism.The first component of this project is complete and I want to share this with you all.The most important component of this project is the Data. The data component is divided into 2 parts:- **Content Metadata** and **Transactional Data.** The content data is the metadata of the movies and tv shows which will be rendered on the front end.

What we’ve used here are pre-built components already deployed in production by engineering teams.On top of that, we’ve just released the Pathway MCP Server, which makes it simple to expose your live ETL outputs and analytics to client apps and downstream services.Circling back to the example, here’s how you can set this up step by step:* Capture your data streams as Pathway tables (with CDC built in).

Sometimes, this is implicitly the poll date or current date.Do you pack all of this into the bucket uri? If so, are you scanning bucket contents to determine start point whenever you start the next batch?Do you maintain a separate `ops` table somewhere to keep this information? How is your experience maintaining the OPs table?Do you completely offload this logic into the orchestration layer, using its metadata store? Does that implicate on the difficulty of debugging in some cases?Do you embed this data in the response? If so, are you scanning your raw data to determine start point in subsequent runs or do you scan your raw table (table = post processing results of the raw formatted data)?Do you implement sensors between every stage in the data lifecycle to automatically batch process the entire process in an event driven way?

1ncdtru,First week as junior dev feels like a disaster — is this normal?,Revolutionary_Pop474,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone,I just started my first ever job as a junior dev last week (fresh out of school), and honestly it already feels like a disaster. I’m starting to question myself a bit.My first day was Monday, and by Friday I was already in home office. Same today too and Monday too. The only office days are Wednesday and Thursday, which feels a bit sad because I’m brand new and immediately working from home with barely any guidance is to much.I never really got a proper introduction to the project, the systems, or how tickets are normally solved. My very first ticket was basically: “Yo, look in our system, I have a ticket for you, try to solve it. If you have questions, ask me…” That’s it. No walkthrough, no explanation of where to start. I asked how they usually approach tickets or where to even find the relevant code, but I still felt pretty lost.To be fair, I did get a decent intro into the running software itself, so I kind of understand the product. But that’s where it ended. Meanwhile, I see other people who started just a month before me sitting next to their team lead getting tons of explanations and support.Somehow I managed to solve 3 tickets (a mix of with and without help), but most of the time I have nothing to do. I’m just sitting here, bored, not knowing what I should be learning or focusing on.I’ve tried to be proactive and ask what I could look into:Yesterday I asked if there were patterns or frameworks I should study. The response was just: “Take a look at EF and how we make the models"" EF and setting up a config for models isnt that hard so I understood it quite fast.Today I asked again and just got sent some tickets to read through “to see if I understand what the customer wants.” which is so overwhelming.Another coworker told me to check out their validation logic cause I will be working with this part of the project, but there are a ton of files with different rules and it’s overwhelming to dig into alone at home.So now I’m just sitting here wondering: am I doing something wrong? Is it normal to feel this lost and useless in the first week? Or did I pick the wrong career path entirely?It’s super frustrating because I want to learn and contribute, but right now it feels like I’m just drifting.Has anyone else been in this situation?

One argument I keep seeing repeated as one of the cardinal sins of OOP is that its structure encourages statefulness somehow. I understand the difference between stateful and stateless programs, but I struggle to think of a practical reason for reducing states.A lot of the applications of programming I can think of depend on state in some way or another (Saving and loading a game, text editors, email clients, image converters, etc.), and it feels like there is little to no point in having stateless programs as they would lack the ability to do anything because they would not be able to interact with other parts of the project.Essentially, my questions boil down to:1.

A bit of background: Back in 2020 I enrolled in a 2-year online university program for web development.

On the side, I also learned a bit of Python, mostly basic backend and some data analysis but nothing past tutorials. In 2022 I stopped coding for several reasons mainly due to family issues and low self-esteem. I even fumbled a trial opportunity at a company because I couldn’t finish the final project, I felt like I wasn't good enough to do a good job compared to the other ppl in the program; so I just dropped programming altogether and didn't really touch it for years. Now in 2025 I feel like I’m in a better mental state than a few years ago, but I feel kinda lost on where to start, specially with AI advancing so quickly, I sometimes doubt whether I'll be able to get a job out of it. On top of that, I don’t know where to start since I’ve forgotten so much. Should I go back to basics, or jump straight into a project and learn as I go checking documentation?

(Probably the best solution I’ve seen, but risky)- make a private repository for it (I think the whole account has to be private, so this is not ideal for an aspiring programmer, but still a good choice)- don’t use homework as GitHub material due to low value things.My thing is this: obviously you wanna steer clear of ‘nail on the head’ type of direct uploads for homework. That is fine. But if the numbers don’t match and there are some customizations in the code, is there really a problem there with university plagarism? Maybe, maybe not.I would argue that it’s worth uploading and documenting everything from ‘Hello World’ to the final project.

1nbx2fv,How do I become a better programmer?,ThomasHawl,learnprogramming,"Really an open ended question.I finished university (Master) 1.5 years ago. Of course the difficulty between university problems and work problems is tangible for me. I am working as an embedded software engineer, I consider myself a 3/10 programmer (due to the fact that I just started working, and CS was not my degree). I can solve a problem (in due time), with some help of either colleagues, internet, or LLMs, but I reckon there are people (mostly on youtube) that are like a few levels above me, like 11-12/10, I can't follow their reasoning most of the time. Also some people's ability to read a problem for the first time, and immediately come up with the optimal solution, is astonishing, while I have to iterate multiple times, and not without errors.So I guess, my question is more for the people with some experience on their side, either in corporate or in startups, or for big personal projects. How do you become a better programmer and a better problem solver?I'm not looking only for answers like ""Read X book from Y"" (although they are appreciated), but I am looking for what changed your approach in programming, problem solving, that made you go from ""I am able to read some code, write normal/trivial functions"" to ""I can start from an idea and turn it into a functional program, with all its libraries/dependancies developed from scratch"".",3,0.64,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nbx2fv/how_do_i_become_a_better_programmer/,2025-09-08 19:18:58,2025-09-10 01:24:34

It's because one person realistically can't keep track of so many people reporting information to them, so instead they have managers report to them all the way up the chain...This is where AI comes in. Instead of ICs reporting to managers, they just all report to the AI. Hell, the AI doesn't even need to be reported to because it already knows what everyone has been doing due to monitoring everyone's computers. All the CEO or board of directors needs to do is ask for updates from the AI. They can get very detailed information or high level overviews. No more time wasted on useless 1 on 1s, you just ask the AI how you could do better or the AI will automatically give you feedback or put you on PIP if needed based on a standard set of criteria, so no bias.That solves one problem that is faced by large organizations, but how about another one? Think about all the time spent in meetings between managers to only come up with stupid decisions because normally the loudest voice will just win out and it isn't always the smartest. Instead, the AI can interact directly with the SMEs to assess all the information available and make the most informed decisions. Think of the time savings!In conclusion, I think we are headed for a time where mid management will no longer exist. A near flat org mostly run by AI will be the most efficient corporate structure and will out compete all of the competition. Boards of directors will be forced to implement this type of structure because otherwise they will be failing their shareholders.Thoughts?",315,0.9,180,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n8il9w/how_come_no_one_is_talking_seriously_about/,2025-09-04 18:46:36,2025-09-10 01:24:35
1n8zdbs,I made a terrible mistake,ragesex,cscareerquestions,"I left my old job a few weeks ago because I was frustrated with the lack of growth and the salary not even keeping up with inflation. I jumped into what looked like a safer and more stable position. The onboarding was smooth and everyone was friendly but then reality hit me on day one.The department I joined is basically one guy and now me. The entire workflow is a storm of spreadsheets and manual emails. I realized almost immediately that the whole thing could be automated with a few scripts and dashboards. What currently takes a week could be done in a couple of hours. Which means the existence of the department itself is hanging by a thread.Here is the catch. To actually automate I would need direct access to the system and that access has to go through my boss. Doing it on my own is impossible without going through him, and going through him means making myself a direct threat to his role and survival.On top of that, in just two days of onboarding I was already dumped with actual work, despite only having the most superficial understanding of their processes and tools. The approach was basically “just figure it out.” There is no documentation at all, and to make it worse the processes themselves are arbitrary. One client gets handled one way, another client gets handled completely differently, with no clear rules or references for why things change. It feels random, improvised, and fragile.To make things worse the company has its own AI and digital transformation division. If they ever notice what is really going on, they could easily absorb or eliminate this function. Which leaves me in a place where my job is both fragile and painfully boring.Now I feel stuck. If I leave too soon my résumé will show a disastrous short stay and I will look unreliable. If I stay I risk wasting my time in something that feels pointless and might get axed anyway. Right now my plan is to keep my head down for a while and later reframe the story as “I improved and automated processes and then decided to move toward project or team management because there was no further path in that role.”I know a lot of people here have been through bad career moves.

1nbo335,Is trying to switch tech stacks equivalent to starting over in your career?,throwaway87234510921,cscareerquestions,"I have about 2.5 YOE working with C++ and Qt, it was my first job out of college and I just needed my foot in the door.

I was just given my first big project and am working with another mid-level engineer who has been here for about 2 years. We are both working under a PE who is leading the project. We have distributed the work and at the start I was wrapping up some bug fixes that my manager asked me to complete. The other mid-level im working with is a really nice guy and he is really motivated which I like. The problem is he is almost too motivated to the point that he has just started coding like crazy and in the first week did some of the work on my plate. I've seen him push code on the weekends at like midnight. One time I asked him if he works onthe weekends and he says sometimes he's bored at home and watches tv and code. I politely let him know that we should work together and I dont want him to feel like he did everything. So he backed off some of my stuff a bit. But throughout the project, it seems he is going 150% towards any little changes that need to be added. If we need to add a change, he has just added it. Since he has been here for 2 years, he knows which people to go to outside of us 3 for questions and a few times I heard he had a few meetings with people to discuss things, so i asked him to keep me included as well and to give me any resources of people in case I had questions. He has done better of doing that but a few times forgot to send me some useful stuff. I was gone for a couple days and in those days he made some major changes. Again I think it's great, but now it feels like the whole code is practically his (maybe 70% of it) and the PE has noticed and even in meetings will talk more to him and say (let's call my co-worker mike for the example) ""Mike can you write a note and make that change"". Barely has directed me. I feel like I have to step in and say ""ill make this change"" or make it clear that ill do the change. I feel like anything I have discovered ill reach out to him and let him know but I can tell that when it comes to visibility it looks like he's doing 90%. He has done more but I think it's more like 60%-70%. I dont think Mike really is doing this to be spiteful or anything I just think he's one of those people who is just really motivated and just starts and doesnt stop. Again, i think that's great and it definetely has kept me in my feet but I also feel like im getting pushed out. I should say that I got laid off from my last job before I got this job and i think a reason for it was because I was slightly a more passive engineer and I feel like this could be held against me that Mike did 70% of the work and it may look like I was lazy on this project.

A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer. I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a ""welcome to team"" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. I waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were ""waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer"", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes ""Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you"". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying ""hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?"". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). So... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a ""misstep"" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. Now... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like ""oh actually, forget that"" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already... I know they're a real company because I've checked several places and I know two people who work there (my former boss, and another person from a previous company I worked at), but doesn't this feel kinda scammy and all over the place? What would you do?Honestly, this trying to find something better has been so exhausting... It's either no answers at all, a lot of scams (got offered a ""job"" to pose as another developer while said developer would be working on something else which is basically, well, fraud) or a complete mess like this case.TL:DR: went through the whole process of interviews, got an offer from the company, a welcome meeting asking me what laptop I'd prefer to then getting an email three weeks later saying there was ""misstep"" in the process and the offer was not valid and that I need another round with live coding on Hackerrank and interviews again.",64,0.93,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n7ghxu/got_an_offer_a_welcome_meeting_with_the_manager/,2025-09-03 14:35:13,2025-09-10 01:24:35
1nco3wn,"Developers who are not passionate about programming, how are you doing and how's your career?",wigglepizza,cscareerquestions,"Hi, I'm a frontend developer from Europe with almost 4 years of commercial experience and a master's degree in CS. I chose this major because I had no better idea and it pays well. Anyway, I'm not passionate about IT for sure. I'm not a guy who codes after hours just for the sake of coding. I'm not into reading about new frameworks and libraries. I'm not a guy who'd go to some tech meetups and talk about code. But I feel it's necessary to stay on track, aka keep your job. Especially in AI era. Big FOMO. On top of that I don't work super fast. Don't get me wrong, I sort of like programming - building things that solve real life things with code. However the satisfaction is not there when I do it for work. I feel so excited about pet side personal projects but I have no time to build them. Not gonna lie, having been through 2 layoffs made me very pessimistic. I was really happy-go-lucky after landing my first SWE job after internship. The layoffs and lack of stability taught me I'm nothing but a number in excel spreadsheet. And that I can do my best and still be laid off ruthlessly.I don't know if I can ever become a senior, an architect or a team lead. I feel like those positions are reserved for people who are super passionate.

1nc4tl7,Is this good advice for a recent grad who didn't do internships?,btzmacin,cscareerquestions,"I'm a senior engineer (12 YOE), and a friend of the family's kid is a recent grad who, naturally, hasn't been able to land a job, given he didn't do any internships before graduating. His dad asked me if there was anything I could do and I cringed, but told him to have the kid text me and I'd see what I could do to get him on track, but not to expect miracles.My plan for advising him is to set expectations: not having any experience on his resume exiting college will make it impossible to land any engineering role in the current job market. He probably needs to run a 3-year-long marathon to get where he wants to be.I think his only shot is going to be a tech-adjacent role, probably helpdesk or support, but maybe a business analyst or junior product/project manager role if he is incredibly lucky. Of course, he needs to continue applying to junior engineer openings on the off chance they give him an interview, for the experience of interviewing alone.Even making these concessions, he needs to wrap his mind around 6 months to a year of applying everyday with nothing to show for it. If his parents need him to contribute to the household, a McJob will be necessary to make ends meet.While applying, I'd have him come up with a product. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, disruptive, profitable, or even revenue-generating. What's important is that he build it from zero, and that the result is usable by some audience. To build the product, I'd advise him to leverage AI the same way we used to leverage stackoverflow. Once he ships an MVP, he can include it on his resume, but he needs to continue to iterate on it.If he lands a eng-adjacent role, he needs to stay there for 2 years at least to avoid being labeled as a job-hopper. Keep working on the side project, or kick off a new one. Automate tasks at work with and without AI.Did I miss anything, or is anything above way off base? I don't want to scare the kid, but at the same time, this market is horrendous for seniors...I can't imagine having nothing but coursework on my resume right now.",51,0.85,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nc4tl7/is_this_good_advice_for_a_recent_grad_who_didnt/,2025-09-09 00:35:08,2025-09-10 01:24:35

1nakc3f,Struggling to fit in in big tech - advice for hitting high performer goals?,Icy-Cat-2658,cscareerquestions,"This isn’t a CS career question, but this subreddit is full of smart minds (please suggest another sub if there’s somewhere else to take this)! I’m about 10 years into my engineering career; self-taught and came into Disney as a senior mobile engineer, then left after five years to join a big tech. I came into big tech at a pretty high level role for an IC, which sometimes gets into my head that I have imposter syndrome.Any job I’ve ever had in tech, I’ve been a high performer. I got promoted at Disney after three months, highly unlikely because I’m any more skilled than anyone else (I’m definitely not), but probably I spent a weekend on a high-impact side project that was fun and had cross-functional impact, and I’m a good communicator. I sort of coasted there, but big tech has been a gut punch.I’m 6 months into my role at big tech and was rated as an underperformer. Given that I came in at a high level, I have no doubt the expectations were high, but I think I’m doing my best. I say yes to a lot (often a curse), take on whatever is asked of me, and try to push through learning complex systems and very frequent uncertainty of what I should be doing every day. I work with smart and very helpful people, but when I hit a technical glitch (often), rarely does anyone on my team have any solution that works, and I end up spending time finding more resources or trying to self-solve until I get it.This is the first time I’ve ever been anything but a star performer. I think I’m letting work for such a prestigious company get to me, but I also think I’m trusting colleagues to tell me where to focus each day and not delivering quickly at all because the systems are complex, ridden with issues, and while people try to help me, I don’t genuinely feel like I’m getting a lot of help or even know what questions to ask until I hit a problem.Has anyone else ever dealt with this? I know this is nuanced, but it’s causing me serious anxiety.",51,0.86,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nakc3f/struggling_to_fit_in_in_big_tech_advice_for/,2025-09-07 04:50:06,2025-09-10 01:24:35
1ncqxhi,Opinions wanted - Was my candidate cheating?,paynoattn,cscareerquestions,"**Original text:** Was interviewing a candidate today, she is from India (not my choice) - EDIT: SEE BELOW FOR WHAT I MEANT HERE. She has solid experience 5 years. We're trying to fill a full stack .net and angular role (once again, not my choice). We had three sessions - get to know you, framework and language knowledge, and then LC easy (13 - Roman numeral to integer) with screen sharing. She seems really stiff and nervous, but literally answers every question 100% accurately.For the knowledge section it would usually take her a couple stabs and seconds of silence to get to the right / correct answer.Me: ""What is the best data structure for storing 10 million records in memory?"" Her: ""A list or array but for that many records I think you should use a dictionary."" Me: ""How would you handle a sql query that takes 30 seconds to return?"" Her: ""blah blah blah, pagination, blah blah blah."" (in a follow up questions she finally got to indexes"" Me: ""What's SOLID"" Her: \*literally lists of the entire acronym correctly with what it means\*I'm really skeptical at this point she either has notes, or is using chatgpt on another monitor. I'm personally fine with this, because I find it pretty easy to sus out and honestly only do this section because it's required by our HR department (I told them I wanted to do a single 2 hour long session with two LCs and a live project collaboration and skip the knowledge check and they were like ""no, that's not how we do it."" >(ভ⤙ ভ "")<).Then we get to the LC. I share her a fiddle with the LC and tell her can use Visual Studio, or VS Code, or the fiddle - up to her. I tell her getting the solution isn't the important part - being able to explain her logic and thought process is. She then stumbles around with Visual Studio for like 3 minutes trying to create a solution, then switches to VS code - copies the fiddle into a FUCKING JAVASCRIPT FILE AND PROCEEDS TO RAW DOG THE C# WITHOUT SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING IN A JAVASCRIPT FILE. IN COMPLETE AWKWARD SILENCE TOO lol. I am floored. Is this cheating? Is she that nervous?But the problem with the cheating scenario is I can see her working through the problem like I would. I.e. first create a method to iterate the string and break it into chars, then a method where she used a switch to get the int value, then she put the check for the previous char is less than in a static method, etc.At the end, once again in complete fucking silence, she just dumps her javascript c# bastard child into the fiddle, runs it and gets the correct answer. I am so speechless at this. I ask her to explain her solution, which she does a decent job at and explains the business logic pretty well, then we drop from the interview.I use this same LC easy for pretty much every interview, and I literally have never seen such unhinged behavior in my life. My gut is telling me she just hates interviewing, but is secretly an interviewing chad and has done a TON of prep - but I also am out of the interviewee game - I haven't interviewed for a position since before COVID. Tell me, fellow gamers, is the cheating tech that good that it will tell you specifically how to fake reasoning out a solution? Or is it also giving nervousness / awkardness to you guys?**Edit**: I am leaving the original post body as to not receive criticism of secrecy. In my statement about the interviewee, I say ""*she is from India (not my choice)*"". What I meant by this is to say, I have no control over this decision - and to show that simplistic suggestions as ""just interview in person,"" won't work. Yes my company has an office in India that they could interview at, but there is nobody on my team or my boss' team that could do that for us. All five of my team leads are in N / S America. We do have employees on my team there, but they are all mid level. This is a senior role. I have in the past asked for support from other teams for this, but have been either ignored or told there isn't resources to support it.I personally fully support companies hiring everywhere in the world and employees being able to work everywhere in the world, at a good salary with no exploitation and nobody losing their jobs to accomplish this. Some of the best engineers I have ever worked with are Indian, both from collaborating across the world or as H1B on the path to green card and citizenship in the US. :India: :red_heart:Also, for this role, we cannot hire anywhere but in India as it is part of our companies expense budget for India. We are filling an open role from somebody who was already in India when I became manager of the team, who left some time ago. I can't go more into detail due to HR/Compliance reasons.I could have explained all of this above, yes, but I was already writing a really long post and wanted to just get to the point without detracting from it with a long winded explanation nobody could have wanted. Well here is the long winded explanation several have asked for.If you felt my comments about the interviewees ethnicity or national origin were offensive or mean - I apologize.Also for those that are wondering why I said (*once again, not my choice*) for .net / angular - yeah I fucking hate that shit.

1ncgjvi,"First dev job, struggling with unmaintainable React code",spurkle,cscareerquestions,"I’m an early-career frontend developer, and I’ve been at my first job (a startup) for about 10 months now.First, I was assigned to work on a product that had quite a few bad practices - not type-safe, over a thousand TypeScript/linter errors, and a huge 10k+ LOC table component. With a lot of effort from me and my teammate, we managed to make it somewhat decent and easier to work with.Apparently because I did a good job, I was thrown into another project that was built in-house, and honestly, I’m feeling extremely frustrated because it’s the same story all over again - the codebase is even harder to work with. Some examples:* Massive 2k+ LOC React components* Misuse of Context API for basically everything* Features tightly coupled, imagine component with 10+ useEffects, sockets, table column definitions, 10 level deep ternary operators, and subtle differences depending on ""mode"" - reused like 20 times throughout the app, used to display completely different entities.* Testing and modularization are basically nonexistent* Unclear dependencies (Entity info modal depends on a 2k LOC Loads context and on a common state that is consumed by chat modal, which depends on a 2k LOC NewLoads context, etc...)* This project is built on NextJS + It has a separate node backend. Why? Good question.Honestly, it’s just incredibly bad.I also position myself as a full-stack developer, so I took some tasks on the backend side - same story:* 8k+ LOC controllers mixing validation, service, and repository logic* Error handling? `res.status(500).json({ msg: ""Internal server error"" })` \- lol* Not using prepared statements (hello SQLi)* No pagination in a logistics app* Why assign some common processed data into a shared variable, when you can just copy and paste the processing part.* Copy-pasted logic with zero abstraction* Lots of inconsistencies (e.g., phone field required in some places, optional in others)* No tests and probably untestable - ZERO classes in a 100k LOC codebaseSo, honestly, I am extremely frustrated. It feels like everything I learned about writing maintainable code is being wasted.I’m considering leaving for a healthier codebase, but since this is my first job and I don’t have a formal CS degree, I’m worried about how it’ll look. I want to grow my skills, especially in maintainable React development, but I don’t want to feel stuck in this mess forever.So my questions:1. Is it reasonable to leave a first job after 10 months because the code is unmaintainable?2. How do I frame this experience positively in interviews?3. Any tips for surviving in such a codebase?

Option 2:TC ~200k (165 base + 10% bonus + 20k stock vest 4 years) with a tech stack that I am very familiar with but not interested in. I also don’t feel that I would learn / grow a lot here. Standard benefits (snacks and drinks, stipend for certifications, standard 401k match). <500 employees startup, and I would have 1 teammate. I’d be on the Business Apps team of the IT department of the company. My feeling:I feel like I want to go with Option 1 because it just feels way better. The interviews with Option 1 were better and the people seemed much better. They also have a dedicated QA team, product managers, real SDLC, and AGILE with sprints while Option 2 has none of these.

I've indicated that I'm very interested in the position, however I'm worried I may have been a bit too eager in showing my interest as the salary of the position wasn't disclosed, would require that I change from full-remote to hybrid, and the company is generally known for giving lackluster at best raises/promotions. I'm already on the lower end of the payscale for my current role, so I have a feeling they're going to try lowballing me on the salary extra hard for the new position by just offering like a 15% bump (for reference the low end of the band for the new role in my area on glassdoor/indeed is more like a 40-50% bump compared to my current salary), which I feel wouldn't be worth it at all when taking into account the additional responsibilities, costs of commuting, and degraded work/life balance. Assuming that the company does lowball me and isn't willing to budge, how would you guys recommend I handle things? Respectfully decline the position despite previously showing great interest in it and take this as a sign to start looking for a new position, or just grit my teeth and accept the lowball offer and try to leverage the new title to get a new job somewhere offering a salary and benefits more in line with what appears to be industry standard after 3-6 months in the new role?",7,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nbxa13/how_to_handle_a_potentially_disappointing/,2025-09-08 19:26:55,2025-09-10 01:24:35

How do you help a client figure out what they want when they’re not sure?

1n991uc,2.5 years employed with 3 months of agile related experience. What can I really say?,Ok_Practice_6702,cscareerquestions,"Many of the questions are very complex and detailed at interviews because they think my dates of employment consist of experience, when mostly we were just building our own projects and watching Udemy courses as all the new projects that were supposed to be coming were ones where the client backed out, or went with another firm because we didn't have anyone with 8 years experience on staff. Me and several others got on projects that lasted 2-4 weeks because our managers mislead our clients into thinking we were senior level and we told them we weren't when we started working and weren't as efficient as they expected us to be. So, there are questions like explain how you used JIRA to collaborate and work more effectively as a team or a time where you used Spring Boot to increase productivity and enhance a service. I've used both those tools, but coming up with such details of how I improved a legacy system with spring boot or more than just describing how JIRA works, I don't really have anything else to say. It's just that I've been mostly working on coding skills and creating some services with the limitations of what I can do in a short time as only one person, and I can't give them the answers they want. Am I supposed to lie and repeat other people's answers I find on the internet or is there a way to actually get this level of agile experience without working on an agile team first for long enough. One of those projects over the 3 months was a 2 month project where most of the time we were not doing anything because the client poorly planned the teams and 7 of us on a team that really only needed about 2 people with only a few services and very few bugs coming through on them. Are there any teams that are actually designing something new or re-creating services requiring actual coding skills instead of just fixing minor bugs that take about 5 minutes or migrating from something like Maven to Gradle?

Creating boring tasks every day is simply exhausting for me. I do not change jobs because in almost every software house you do the same thing, and I also don’t want to go through 10 steps of recruitment.I would gladly work on something innovative, even for less money. The problem is that such positions are only for people with 15+ years of experience, even if the work does not really require it. Either those people were smarter at convincing recruiters, or because of huge competition companies can now hire very experienced developers for the same salary as mid-level ones.I think I would probably fit well in a startup. I could even work 16 hours a day, but I would expect an interesting project and a fair salary.If not innovative projects, then at least some competition for monopolies (like Adobe, or browsers based on engines other than Chromium or Firefox). But it is also very hard to get into such projects.It looks like if I do not find a job for similar money (basically scraps, but still a bit more than McDonald’s and with home office), in another industry, then I will not have a happy career as a developer, even if I have enough skills.Of course, I could try to create my own product and become a founder. But then you need money for marketing — because even if the software is open source, without promotion nobody will hear about it, and there will be no money. This means hunger, and then going back to software houses to build CRUDs again.And this is exactly how I feel: like a chained dog that never goes for a walk, only sits tied up and howls at night.

What are my options?,Vegetable_Echo2676,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone, here is the scenarios, please mind you it's long and has vulgar languages. Furthermore, before reading this, some might say ""did you ask for help"", I did ask for help, I met them face-to-face for help, you can say that I'm borderline stalking them right now. The answer I got is ""do some (more) research"" LOL.I'm an intern, on week 2 - this week - today, I was given this absolutely questionable codebase, the BE server returns from boolean to string to array to json value, you never know what value type it will return and it's a nightmare to navigate because there is no documentation, there is nothing, the only way you gonna know is to print the result out. There is a log system, EVERYTHING is log in ONE PLACE, the tiniest thing is also logged, 1 request = a massive file containing every single log possible.Furthermore, each request goes through 2 BE, 1 is the BE server and the other is a low-code platform server BE, and ts suck nuts, because this low-code platform has a request limit and the server is running on an unstable docker image so when either of these thing crashes, you don't know which thing crashed because the person who coded this before me thought it was a good idea to return EVERY SINGLE ERRORS MESSAGE AS ONE and there is no try-catch block.Oh yeah, btw, I'm just an intern but I control the entire live production server of this project, this project doesn't have a development environment, I was tasked to research the dev environment + on top of maintaining abomination codebase + on top of developing new feature, I can literally use \`rm -rf\` this entire server.So, today I was asked to fix a core function of the BE server, this BE server was created solely for this function. I was able to mitigate it by creating more sessions but this approach was rejected because all sessions have been approved by the client superiors and there is no way to change it and I CAN'T CHANGE THE FUNCTION to fix this because the function is ""working correctly"" based on the customer requirements by my lead, mind you guys although I am alone on this project, I do not received any documentations not even the customer/client requirements.Oh and this job is below minimum wage in my country, I made triple being at mcdonald After the synopsis, I have a few questions or I need advices:1.

1n92xhl,"Thoroughly convinced my manager is attempting to sabotage me, and I feel out of options here",Dreadsin,cscareerquestions,"This situation started when my manager randomly re-assigned a project I was working on to someone else. She didn't tell me why or what this meant for me. I wrote up a big document on how to do this, she assigned me tickets from there, but someone else was listed as the lead. I talked to him, and it turned out he had no idea he was the lead of this project. I thought she might have done this simply because she prefers working with this guy, but now it seemed solely vindictive if I was still going to be doing all the workSo, I reached out to my manager trying to get clarity on what my role in this project was. She got defensive, deflected, asked leading questions, but never truly answered my one simple question: am I supposed to be working on this project or not? If I am, what of the document I wrote, is it still how we're doing it? If I am doing *all* the work, why'd you assign someone else as the lead? She got really frustrated and then eventually threatened to PIP me, so I disengaged.I went to my skip and talked to him, showing him the conversations. He seemed on my side for this conversation. Since then, I noticed that she had a lot of meetings with him. He told me that if I had conflict with her, I should post it in a public channel. I started doing this when she would nitpick my pull requests endlesslyFor example, I had a storybook instance where I was displaying all the components. She would constantly tell me to change stories, add stories, change how storybook works, etc. Her comments were vague, like ""make it match design"". Neither me nor the lead designer could tell what she was talking about. When confronted about how it ""doesn't match design"", she'd kinda react like ""I'm not telling :face_with_hand_over_mouth:"", so I guess I concluded that she was just wasting my time on purposeSo, I posted in the public channel, which then caused her to come into the thread and act very inappropriately. So much so, I got texts from people (privately) who work there like ""wow what did you do to piss her off???"". At the end, she said to get into a huddle with her, but my skip joined before me. I got in and my skip basically said ""dw we got it figured out"" and I looked at my PR and it was approvedFor a while, she backed off. However, recently I was given a big task to replace every button component across every app with the one from the component library (the project I mentioned before). I did all this, then she left a comment how she didn't like how the button worked. She left no details. She blocked the review and basically said ""button is awkward, go back to the drawing board"". I felt this was solely done to delay me. The button was literally just applying styles to a library (@headlessui/react)I went back and found the PR where I implemented the one decision she complained about. Not only was it documented in the PR itself, but it had unit tests, comments, and live documentation detailing how it works. It was merged two weeks ago, and she approved it. At this point, I noticed even my coworkers were coming to my defense and calling her unreasonable in the PRI sent this to my skip and mentioned that I really think I'm being set up for failure here. I showed this PR, but also showed that every PR I submitted was nitpicked endlessly by her while approved by others much quicker. I also showed that she seemed to *only* do this with me, as she approved other team mates PRs quicklyAt this point I'm really lost as to what to do. There is no HR department at my company. There's no team I can transfer to. I'm considering asking my skip to do *anything* to just get me off of her team even if it means becoming a backend engineer at this point.
