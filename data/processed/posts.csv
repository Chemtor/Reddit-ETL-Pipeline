Wouldn't using primary keys be the same? Is there any case in which surrogate keys are the way to go?P.S: Both surrogate and primary keys are auto generated by DB. Right?P.S.1: I understand that a surrogate key doesn't necessarily have to be the a primary key, so considering that both have no real meaning outside the DB, then I wonder what the purpose of surrogate keys are.P.S.2: At work (in different projects), we mainly use natural keys for analytical workloads and primary keys for uniquely identifying a given row.

1jnktzw,Passed DP-203 -- some thoughts on its retiring,EducatedEarthian-99,dataengineering,"i took the Azure DP-203 last week — of course, it’s retiring literally tomorrow. But I figured it is indeed a very broad certification and so it can give a ""grounding"" scope in Azure D.E.Also, I think it's still super early to go full Fabric (DP-600 or even DP-700), because the job demand is still not really there. Most jobs still demand strong grounding in Azure services even in the wake of Fabric adoption (POCing…).So of course here, it’s retiring literally tomorrow unfortunately. I have passed the exam with a high score (900+). Also, I have worked (during internship) directly with MS Fabric only. So I would say some skills actually transfer quite nicely (ex: ADF ~ FDF).---### Some notes on resources for future exams:I have relied primarily on [@tybulonazure](https://www.youtube.com/@tybulonazure)’s excellent YouTube channel (DP-203 playlist). It’s really great (watch on 1.8x – 2x speed). Now going back to Fabric, I have seen he has pivoted to Fabric-centric content — also a great news!I also used the official “Guide” book (2024 version), which I found to be a surprisingly good way of structuring your learning. I hope equivalents for Fabric will be similar (TBS…).---The labs on Microsoft Learn are honestly **poorly designed** for what they offer. **Tip:** @tybul has video labs too — *use these*. And for the exams, always focus on **conceptual understanding**, not rote memorization.Another **important (and mostly ignored)** tip: Focus on the **“best practices”** sections of Azure services in Microsoft Learn — I’ve read a lot of MS documentation, and those parts are often more helpful on the exam than the main pages.---**Examtopics** is obviously very helpful — but **read the comments**, they’re essential!---Finally, I do think it’s a shame it’s retiring — because the “traditional” Azure environment knowledge seems to be a sort of industry standard for companies. Also, the Fabric pricing model seems quite aggressive.So for juniors, it would have been really good to still be able to have this background knowledge as a base layer.",32,0.81,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jnktzw/passed_dp203_some_thoughts_on_its_retiring/,2025-03-31 02:48:14,2025-04-04 17:04:41

1jpxfch,"New to Data Engineering — Feeling a Bit Overwhelmed, Looking for Advice",ethg674,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice from fellow engineers. I'm pretty new to the data world — I messed up uni, then did an online analytics course, and after about a year and a half of grinding, I finally landed my first role. Along the way, I found a real passion for Python and SQL.My first job involved a ton of patchy reporting because of messy infra and data. I started automating painful tasks using basic ETL pipelines I built myself. I showed an interest in APIs and, out of nowhere, 6 months in, I was offered a data engineering role.Fast forward to now — I’ve been in the new role for a month, and I’m the company’s only data engineer. I’m doing a data engineering apprenticeship at the same time, which helps, but the imposter syndrome is real. The company’s been limping along with a 25-year-old piece of software that populates our SQL Server DB, and we’re now migrating to something new. I’ve been asked to learn MuleSoft for ETL and replace some existing pipelines that were built in Python.I love the subject — I’m genuinely passionate about programming and networking — and I’m keen to take on new tech, improve the infra, and build up strong skills. But I’m not sure if I’m going too deep too fast. For example, today I was learning Docker to deploy Python scripts, just to avoid issues with hundreds of brittle batch files that break if we update Python.My boss seems to think MuleSoft will fully replace Python, but I see it more as a tool that complements certain workflows rather than a full replacement. What worries me more is that I don’t really have any technical peers. Most people in my team only know basic SQL, and it’s hard to communicate strategy or get proper feedback.My current priorities are getting comfortable with MuleSoft, Git, and Docker. I’m constantly learning, but sometimes I leave work feeling overwhelmed. There’s so much broken or duct-taped together, I don’t even know where to start. I keep telling myself I don’t need to “save the world,” but I really want to do a good job and come away with solid experience.Long term, they want to deploy this new software, rebuild the database, and eventually use AI to help employees query the business. There’s a shit ton to do, and I’m still figuring out basics — like setting up a VM just so I can run Docker.Am I jumping the gun with how I’m feeling, or is this as wild a situation as it seems? Any advice for a new engineer navigating bad infra, limited support, and a mountain of work would be seriously appreciated.",14,0.89,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jpxfch/new_to_data_engineering_feeling_a_bit_overwhelmed/,2025-04-03 02:27:27,2025-04-04 17:04:41

1jqnphu,Code Exams - Tips from a hiring manager,jodyhesch,dataengineering,"I previously founded and ran a team of 8 as Director of Data Engineering & BI at a small consulting company, and I currently consult freelance through my own LLC (where I occasionally hire subcontractors).I wanted to share feedback to hopefully help some folks be successful with their Data Engineering code exams, especially in this economy.Below are my tips and tricks that would make *any* candidate stand out from the pack, even if they don't get the technical answer right, and even if they are very junior in their experience.I obviously can't claim to know what every other hiring manager might prioritize, but I would propose that any *good* hiring manager worth their salt is going to feel fairly similar to what I'm sharing below. ## What I'm Looking For I don't care all that much about whether a candidate gets the technical answers right. They need to demonstrate a base-level of technical skills, to be sure, but that's it.What I'm prioritizing is ""How do they solve problems?"" and what I'm looking for is the following: **1) Are They Defining & Solving the Right Problem**Most of us are technical nerds that enjoy writing elegant/efficient code, but the best Data Engineers know how to evaluate whether the problem they're solving is actually the right problem to solve, and if not - how to dig deeper, identify root cause issues, escalate any underlying problems they see, and align with the priorities of leadership. **2) Can They Think Creatively?** When setting out to solve a problem, unless it's a well-defined problem with a well-understood solution (i.e. based on industry best practices), I expect good Data Engineers to come up with at least 2 to 3 different ways to solve the problem. Could be different tech stacks, diff programming languages, different algorithms... but I want to see creative, out-of-the-box thinking across multiple potential solution approaches.**3) Can They Choose the Right Approach?** After sketching a few approaches to the problem, can the candidate identify the constraints and tradeoffs between each approach? Which is easiest to implement? Which is cheapest? Which is most maintainable in the long run? Which is the best performing? And what might limit/constrain each approach (time, cost, complexity, etc.)? A good Data Engineer will evaluate multiple solutions approaches across tradeoffs to decide on an ""optimal"" solution. A great Data Engineer will ensure that the tradeoffs they're considering are aligned with the priorities of their leadership & organization. So, in each problem in a code exam, if they can ""show their work"" across the points above, they will be way more competitive *even* if they get the technical answer wrong. ##Other Considerations**Attention to Detail**I won't ask candidates if they have good ""attention to detail"" because everyone will claim they do. Instead, I'll structure my exam in such a way that they won't be successful unless they pick up on the details.**Resourcefulness**I will give candidates a lot of leeway if they come up with the wrong answers, if they can demonstrate resourcefulness. If I know I can give them a problem, and know that they'll figure it out ""one way or the other"" - I'll hire them over a technical expert who isn't otherwise resourceful.**Ask Questions**I will also prioritize candidates who ask (good) questions. I often mention in the code exams to ask questions if they're confused about anything, and I'll ensure the code exam has some ambiguity in it. Candidates who ask for clarification demonstrate some implicit humility, a capacity for critical thinking, a deliberate approach to solving the right problem, and much better reflect real-world projects that require navigating ambiguity.Hope this is all somewhat helpful to candidates currently working through code exams!Edit: Formatting, grammar, spelling",11,0.87,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jqnphu/code_exams_tips_from_a_hiring_manager/,2025-04-03 23:56:26,2025-04-04 17:04:41

1jni0xm,Transitioning from DE to ML Engineer in 2025?,absurdherowaw,dataengineering,"I am a DE with 2 years of experience, but my background is mainly in statistics. I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). The position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?Furthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). Ultimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position?

1jlrnuh,Open source re-implementation of GraphFrames but with multiple backends (with Ibis project),ssinchenko,dataengineering,"Hello everyone!I am re-implementing ideas from GraphFrames, a library of graph algorithms for PySpark, but with support for multiple backends (DuckDB, Snowflake, PySpark, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, etc.. - all the backends supported by the Ibis project). The library allows to compute things like PageRank or ShortestPaths on the database or DWH side. It can be useful if you have a usecase with linked data, knowledge graph or something like that, but transferring the data to Neo4j is overhead (or not possible for some reason).Under the hood there is a pregel framework (an iterative approach to graph processing by sending and aggregating messages across the graph, developed at Google), but it is implemented in terms of selects and joins with Ibis DataFrames.The project is completely open source, there is no ""commercial version"", ""hidden features"" or the like. Just a very small (about 1000 lines of code) pure Python library with the only dependency: Ibis. I ran some tests on the small XS-sized graphs from the LDBC benchmark and it looks like it works fine. At least with a DuckDB backend on a single node. I have not tried it on the clusters like PySpark, but from my understanding it should work no worse than GraphFrames itself. I added some additional optimizations to Pregel compared to the implementation in GraphFrames (like early stopping, the ability of nodes to vote to stop, etc.) There's not much documentation at the moment, I plan to improve it in the future. I've released the 0.0.1 version in PyPi, but at the moment I can't guarantee that there won't be breaking changes in the API: it's still in a very early stage of development.I would appreciate any feedback about it.

The rotation I am currently on and where the company is placing me post program (I tried to get placed somewhere else) is as a data engineer on a data delivery team. When I was advertised this rotation and the team I was told pretty specifically we would be using all the relevant technologies and I would be very hands on keyboard building pipelines with python , configuring cloud services and snowflake, being a part of data modeling. Mind you I’m not completely new I have experience with all this in personal projects and previous work experience as a SWE and researcher in college. Turns out all of that was a lie. I later learned there is an army of contractors that do the actual work. I was stuck with analyzing .egp files and other SAS files documenting it and handing off to consultants to rebuild in Talend to ingest into snowflake. The only tech that I use is Visio and Word.I coped with that by saying after I’m out of the program I’ll get to do the actual work. But I had a conversation with my manager today about what my role will be post program. He basically said there are a lot more of these SAS procedures they are porting over to talend and snowflake and I’ll be documenting them and handing over to contractors so they can implement the new process. Honestly that is all really quick and easy to do because there isn’t that much complicated business logic for the LOBs we support just joins and the occasional aggregation so most days I’m not doing anything.When I told him I would really like to be involved in the technical work or the data modeling , he said that is not my job anymore and that is what we pay the contractors to do so I can’t do it. Almost made it seem like I should be grateful and he is doing me a favor somehow.It just feels like I was misled or even outright lied to about the position. We don’t use any of the technologies that were advertised (Drag and drop/low code tools seem like fake engineering), I don’t get to be hands on keyboard at all. Just seems like there really I no growth or opportunity in this role. I would leave but I took relocation and a signing bonus for this and if I leave too early I owe it back. I also can’t internally transfer anywhere for a year after starting my new role.I guess my rant is just to ask what should I be doing in this situation? I work on personal projects and open source and I have gotten a few certs in the downtime at work but I don’t know if it’s enough to make sure my skills don’t atrophy while I wait out my repayment period.

The company's policy regarding operating systems the employees are allowed to use is strange and unfair (IMO). All software engineers get access to Macbooks and thus, to MacOS while all other employees that have a differnt job title ""only"" get HP elite books (that are not elite at all) that run on Windows. WSL is allowed but a native Linux is not accepted because of security reasons (I don't know which security reasons).As far as I know the company does not want other job positions to get Macbooks because the whole updating stuff for those Macbooks is done by an external company which is quite expensive. The Windows laptops instead are maintained by an internal team.A lot of people are very unhappy with this situation because many of them (including me) would prefer to use Linux or MacOS. Especially all DevOps are pissed because half a year ago they also got access to MacBooks but a change in the policy means that they will have to change back to Windows laptops once their MacBooks break or become too old.My question(s): Can you choose the OS and/or hardware in your company? Do you have a clue why Linux may not be accepted? Is it really not that safe (which I cannot think of because the company has it's own data center where a lot of Linux servers run that are actually updated by an internal team)?",4,0.67,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jo9b0k/operating_systems_and_hardware_available_for/,2025-04-01 00:48:33,2025-04-04 17:04:41

1joo0ti,Ai is not taking your job and stop just learning another language to build your skill set,MCButterFuck,learnprogramming,"Learn a language then it is easy to pick up another. After you feel comfortable with a language learn more CS and software engineering topics. There is a reason they have you take all that math and theory classes in school. You don't need it for every job but it betters your problem solving. Learn oop data structure, algorithms etc. Look at a university class list to know what to learn. I was trying to get employed for 2 years listening to advice from this sub. Then I went back to school and learned so much more about what CS and software engineering is and realized that just learning another language is not going to mean you know anything. A lot of people who self teach also think it is a short cut to a massive pay raise. It is not. In fact going to school in my opinion is the easier option because you not only have that degree behind you but you also have direction and people to motivate you. I tried self teaching but was constantly lost and people online gave the worst advice now that I look back on it. If you already hold a bachelor's you likely only need to do your core classes which is about 2 years if you do fall and spring 16 credits each semester. Yes people get employed self teaching but it is not a short cut nor is it easier. It is so much harder and will likely take you longer than just attending a school. Plus if you are crazy like some dudes I know you can get your degree done even quicker by attending two schools at once and taking 21 credit hours. Not sure if it is worth it imo because you will go insane but some people can handle it.

1jmjrv6,Is Taking Notes While Learning to Code a Waste of Time?,AspiringTranquility,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone,I’m self-learning web development using books and online courses. At first, I took detailed notes in Obsidian, but it was very time-consuming. Then, I came across advice on *The Odin Project* that suggested taking fewer notes—or even none at all—and relying on documentation instead. Some people argue that writing detailed notes is counterproductive, and instead, we should create prompts for further research.However, yesterday, I revisited a book chapter I had already read but didn’t take notes on. While reading, I realized I had forgotten several small but important details. One key takeaway from that chapter was: *“The* `` *element should not be used for external links.”* Later, when I checked MDN’s `` documentation, I found no mention of this.Had I taken notes and revised them, I likely wouldn’t have forgotten this detail. Now, I worry that in the future, I might make similar mistakes due to gaps in my memory. If I forget such foundational details, wouldn’t that make me a weaker programmer?For experienced developers—do you take notes? If so, what’s the best approach? Or do you rely entirely on documentation? What’s the most effective long-term practice? Also, if you do take notes, could you share an example of how you structure them?Would love to hear your thoughts!",101,0.88,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jmjrv6/is_taking_notes_while_learning_to_code_a_waste_of/,2025-03-29 17:57:29,2025-04-04 17:04:43

This is probably fine for my personal projects, but is it ethical or frowned upon to use this method when I'm creating websites for paying clients?I am the type of person who prefers to do everything myself. I learned how to develop websites because I hated the limitations of website builders, I learned how to create my own vectors because of the vague licensing arrangements of free ones online. My friend says most programmers use tutorials, copy little snippets of code etc. and trying to do every little bit of dev myself is like trying to reinvent the wheel, but I always feel bad using things that didn't come from my brain (and don't want to get into deep trouble)**TLDR:** When being paid for freelance work, is using code from tutorials frowned upon or infringing on any copyright?

1jnouxn,Too damned much abstraction sometimes?,Enough-Reach4160,learnprogramming,"I fairly often violate the commonly-recommended coding practice of keeping my source code files short. I have created many files hundreds of lines long, even breaking 1000 or more.I'm recently retired now, so unless someone wants to bitch about my open source code, I can get away with it. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:While I might well err far too much on the wrong side of this recommendation, I'm having a hard time believing it's not possible to go *way too far* the other direction.It's what I'd like to call the ""can't find where the rubber hits the road"" problem. I've run into this many times before when I try to figure out how something works in someone else's code, and where I might go about changing how their code works, in projects where nearly every code file I open up is only about 10-20 lines long.The most recent example I've run into involves trying to change someone else's Markdown preview.For those of you familiar with the Intellij IDEA environment, if you're creating Markdown docs for your code, there's an preview panel where you can see what your Markdown is going to look like.You can add your own custom CSS to change how this Markdown preview is rendered. A common change is to try to render Markdown in Github style. I've recently discovered, however, there's an annoying limitation in how close you can get to Github style because there's no possible CSS to give you full control over syntax color coding inside code fences.IDEA takes those colors from your current IDE theme colors and hardcodes them as HTML style attributes with explicit colors. No CSS classes are used which could be conveniently overridden to render different colors, in particular the colors used by Github.Besides not being able to render specific alternate Github colors (a level of slavish adherence to Github standard I might be willing to live without), the colors forced on you this way can be very unreadable -- such as faint gray text on an only-slightly-lighter gray background.So...

This took me a while but I learnt some more into css and html but some of them were way to hard for my level but I think the idea of the course is to really show you what’s possible Then after a little break I started a web dev bootcamp online udemy which I’m currently doing. I guess I’m a classic example of tutorial hell. I’m kind of burnt out not sure whether to continue as it takes so much time and energy and I’m hearing a lot of things about saturated market and you need a CS degree etc. Plus the whole AI argument …Anyways, recently I asked chatgpt to ask me 5 challenges in JavaScript every day and to increase hardness level every month I was thinking after a while of this maybe doing the Odin project and then eventually applying for entry level jobs.My question is to you guys… do you think that would be possible or do I need to join an actual boot camp and pay hefty fees for it?

I learned things like html, css, javascript, then I started learning c# because I found a free bootcamp, which I gave up because I didn't have time to learn. I decided to restart with another bootcamp now being on vacation and getting past the overloaded period I had. I realized one of my mistakes(I didn't do projects, I was just following a lot of tutorials) and I started something where that's the only way you learn, making projects and adding them on github(Csharpacademy). However I don't feel very disciplined with this area, for example in the last days the average learning is 2h per day, which is extremely low, I lose my concentration very quickly. I thought that maybe it's because I'm not that logical as a person for something like this, I like more creative/visual things. My plan would be that this year I'll start the IT university at a distance and until then I'll keep doing projects on the platform([https://thecsharpacademy.com/Dashboard](https://thecsharpacademy.com/Dashboard)) until I have a decent portfolio. I realize though that I would be happy with a lower paid job in this field (such as UIUX, wordpress developer, QA tester and whatever) until I see myself on a more ""complete"" job as I see a full stack web developer, but I'm afraid that I will waste time learning something else and maybe there the situation is even harder as a beginner.

I.E, you create a class with a bunch of empty variables and then create objects to 'fill' those variables.

I'm loving learning CPP and having to complete the coding assignments, and it's all been very validating that I'm finally on the right path (28 y/o, 3 time drop out). But fucking calc man. I know it comes down to improper time management. If i had the energy and just like, a LITTLE more free time in the week, I would have a much easier time digesting the material. But my teacher, god love him, has a very thick accent, making his lectures difficult to understand to say the least. I know there are resources out there that could supplement it, but thats where the general exhaustion and time management comes into play. My current plan is to forgo taking any classes this summer as I had previously planned and just cram cal 1 basics into my head. It's not something I feel good about doing, but I feel like I'm just struggling to survive it at this point. I guess I'm hoping someone will tell me I'm not going to be a shit programmer/employee just because of this. I sit here, chat gpt window open, with a pit in my stomach over it.

1jm8n2g,How to become a more independent software dev,makeevolution,learnprogramming,"I have 2 YOE as a software developer, just got a new job in a consultancy as a new joiner and now in an intake process for a client that is a small company. I am looking to switch stacks, and the stack they are working on is exactly what I want to do. I do have some experience with the new stack already though.In my previous experiences, I have been working with a lot of guidance and clarity on what to do etc. There's always someone to help me out and the people are supportive. When I interviewed for this new one, they are expecting me to be more independent, although I still work within a team albeit small. They said there's no hand guiding and I have to work a lot more independently.I'm doubting my independence skills to be honest; I don't have much software architecture experience, mostly I implement features and extend existing functionality, but never from scratch and so the uncertainty is less, and there's always someone who can help me. Should I express this concern to them, or should I just take it? I'm afraid I'm gonna mess the project up if I take it due to my lack of architecting experience (In my previous experiences I was part of teams who delivered bad results, and I don't want to repeat the same)But I mean, in the end, as I gain more ""YOE"", the expectation from employers is that I am more independent right?

1jpp7rk,My humble take on the future of cs careers,NoWeather1702,cscareerquestions,"Don't know whether somebody needs it or not, but I will leave it here. I am a software developer and personally I am tired of all this AI buzz that's going around. You try to read something new about tech, learn something new, and you get overwhelmed with AI bros claiming that ""something wild is going on it's gonna replace us all"". Then some time passes and people forget about this and move to another hyped topic. The thing is, that software developer job is changing all the time. 10 years ago developers used completely different stack of tech. 15 years ago mobile developers as we know them today didn't exist. Gamedev was completely different years ago. So of course take 10 years from now and you'll have new generation of developers with new skills needed to keep working. Nevertheless, there still be lot's of legacy that works as it always worked. Like right now there are code written in the previous century that is still working and people who support it do not care about new version of Python.If you want to work in this field, learn the basics, learn new skills and build what you like and everything gonna be ok. It's not that easy to switch to CS after a month in bootcamp as it were some years ago, but it was an anomaly. But it is completely possible. Just believe in yourself. I don't think that software development jobs will go away anytime soon, because who is more suited for guiding all ghis code generating tools than us? In their current form they are not able to solve real life problems on their own and it doesn't look like they will any time soon.If you are afraid that AI will replace you as a developer, think that if this happens, it will replace not only you but millions of other people and you won't be alone. At least :)Also I'll share this advice. I stopped using reddit for a month in January and it was great. It's so beautiful to stay away from all the hype, made me more calm and I spend great time living my life. I think I will repeat it again. So if you feel anxious because of the news, stay away from them for a while. Delete social media apps or add rate limits at least.

If you’re considering applying to Nimbyx, read this first—you might save yourself from a toxic work culture.The CTO of Nimbyx was the one interviewing me, and from the start, the whole thing felt off.After introductions, she asked me to “tell her about myself.” Pretty standard, right? Well, as I was answering, she gave me this annoyed, almost hostile look. Before I could even finish, she cut me off mid-sentence and demanded that I answer in a specific way.I tried to continue, but she kept interrupting me over and over again. At one point, she straight-up told me how I should be speaking, giving me an example like I was a child. I finally had enough and told her that I felt uncomfortable and that she needed to chill.Her response? She doubled down and said that if I “couldn’t take it,” I wouldn’t survive at Nimbyx because their culture is all about brutal honesty. But let’s be real—this wasn’t brutal honesty, it was just rude and unprofessional. Then, as if that wasn’t enough, she randomly complained about how she had to wake up early and come to the Nimbyx office on a Saturday for this interview… and then told me that I was wasting her time.At that point, I was done. I told her “that’s fine” and walked out. But get this—while I was in the elevator, she actually shouted that there was something wrong with my head. Seriously??Why You Should Avoid NimbyxThis experience was a huge red flag for me, and I’m so glad I didn’t waste more time with Nimbyx. If their CTO behaves this way during an interview, imagine how bad it must be working there.

1jm3qos,Job Market POV from a dev with 5+ years experience,antdr0id,cscareerquestions,"I worked full-time jobs from late 2019 to early 2023 and haven't been able to land a full-time job since. I landed my most recent remote full-time job in Jan 2023 with decent comp (180k base + equity) only to be laid off 6 weeks later lol (the startup ended up shutting down completely that same year despite raising hundreds of millions in funding shortly before I was hired). Fortunately, I've been getting by on freelance/contracting part-time for the last 2 years so I haven't been applying to jobs urgently every single day. In the past years or so, I've been applying to jobs inconsistently on & off. And it's felt like a complete waste of time. \- 95% of job applications I've submitted have gone into a black hole where I never hear anything again \- >4% get an automated noreply@domain email rejection \- <1% get an interview I've had like 40-50 first round interviews with recruiters (both internal/external resepctively). I seem to have an 80% success rate on these. Glancing through the job posting and reciting an example of how my previous job's skills can segue to the role seems to always work. Applying to roles in similar industries almost always makes it to the next round. Then, the next round is typically an intro with the hiring manager (engineering manager). I probably have an 80% success rate with these too. These are usually just short 20-30minute discussions regarding experience in tech stack, team collaboration, communication, and work priorities .Then, the next interview is usually technical (take home or leetcode). In mobile dev interviews, I rarely see leetcode. I've probably done 10 take homes in the last year or so. These have typically been viable minimalistic challenges which involve an endpoint, list view, and demonstration of clean code. If I felt like I was being exploited for a ""free work sample"", I would run fast, but I can honestly say I feel like this hasn't happened to me. I have about 90% success rate on technical assessments. But nonetheless, you're either going to be prepping hours and hours on end for leetcode tasks, or you're going to take hours and hours for a take home. They are both time consuming. I've probably had like 10 final interviews in the last year. Some of these have been panel styles or just a one on one with an executive. I can never make it past this stage. I've been ghosted, I've been rejected and I've even been told I got the job verbally, just to never even receive the written offer.All this effort and time wasted. For what? Just to be back to the drawing board. In this industry/job market, finding a job seems to be much harder than performing on the job. Applying to jobs, scheduling interviews on my calendar, preparing for the interviews, reflecting on the interviews is all such a very exhausting/stressful process.

He said that I'm quiet, nobody at the company knows what I actually do, and that I need to start ""thinking outside of the box"" more if I want to work here. He said that there isn't much work at the company lately, and that I'd have to prove my worth over this next month until I graduate. I thought I was doing good, this completely shattered me. I'm somewhat introverted at work, but when we're working on projects or I get assigned tasks, I always got stuff done in a high quality and timely manner. We finished the main project I've been working on a couple months ago, I was the main developer for the module and I thought I did it very well. Even the CEO did a code review and said my code looked really good. Since then however I haven't been assigned any specific project or task, so it's been difficult for me to self start. I've been trying to keep myself busy, understanding the code base as well as reading documentation, asking others if there is any work they need help with, asking others what they're working on and if they need help. The reason I'm surprised is because I regularly asked my manager (maybe 1-2 times a month) if there's anything I'm not doing that I should be. I send him regular updates pretty much at the end of everyday, saying ""if there's nothing specific you'd like me to work on I'll be doing XYZ.."", he says I'm doing well and to keep doing what I'm doing.

1jlvm2h,Starting a business is not the solution for everything,Personal_Economy_536,cscareerquestions,"I graduated from a CS program in 2014. I spent 6 years working in corporate. Then in 2020 at the height of ZIRP I started my own consultancy. I primarily worked with startups helping to get their technical ideas up and running. The budgets were small but I got a lot of clients to make up for it. Unfortunately when the interest rates went up in the end of 2023 almost all my clients folded.I then pivoted to a completely separate brick and mortar retail business in a niche product. It took me a year of research to even start my business. I approached it like a software developer. I did a ton of analysis, rents, foot traffic, competition, catchment analysis, similar markets etc… I even worked minimum wage at competing businesses in order to learn what to do in ground level. Once I launched I joined trade organizations and gave a ton of free advice to anybody looking for help.First let me give you guys the good news. I launched in 2024 and it’s about to be a year now. I am lucky that I was able to break even my first year while also giving myself a small salary of 80k a year. Now here is the bad news.1) 50% of business fail within the first 5 years. That is only including business that fail. I would say of the remaining 50% only about 10-15% of them make decent enough money to be even worth vile. I have many friends from my trade association that are doing terrible numbers or have gone bankrupt completely.2) “When you own your business you have no boss.” This is one of the stupidest things I hear all the time. Yes you have a boss, it’s the customers/clients. Instead of having one boss you know and interact with. You will have tens or hundreds of strangers that you have to make happy. Yes you can tell them to f-off but in a competitive industry where one bad Google review or word of mouth complaints can ruin you? You’re held hostage by your customers expectations.3) “When you run your own business you’re in charge of your destiny!”Just think about what it took for software development to get it where it is today. A world wide pandemic along with the invention of generative AI. These are humanity defining events.In business? Hell all it takes for you to loose everything is some schmuck to open a store across the street from you. You own a burger place? Sorry McDonald’s comes into town. Oh you run a HVAC business? Sorry some hungry family just opened theirs and they are working for bottom of the barrel prices until they take all your customers.I seen people making millions loose everything because their landlord decided to retire and sell all his commercial properties to a real estate developer. He couldn’t renew his lease and had to move to another side of town with no customers. I seen the exact opposite happen where the landlord allowed sold the commercial property to the tenant allowing them to double the size of their store and save their failing business.Most small business are in a way more volatile situation then a 9-5 job. I actually know 2 senior FAANG guys in my trade association. They had an even more analytical approach to everything than I did and they are doing worse than me because of factors completely out of their control.Listen I am not writing all this to dissuade you guys from doing your own thing. I am doing it now but it’s been extremely difficult and a lot of luck was involved. At the end of the day this is a decision you have to make. It’s hard to own your own business but is it harder than getting a job in today’s tech market?

1jn9gvs,ChatGPT induced brain rot?,Zealousideal-Bus5365,cscareerquestions,"I have an engineering background (Non CS but used to code quite a bit in Python) but got into coding through my previous company. I decided I liked it and got into it full time. Fast forward to current company. It’s a startup, I’ve been here for 3 years and things are moving really fast. When I started 3 years ago, ChatGPT wasn’t that big. I would take the time to go through the docs, peruse stackoverflow and then deliver on my tickets. Same with my more experienced CS colleagues. Until ChatGPT kicked off. Also, pressure started piling from investors to deliver so everyone’s workload has doubled, mine included. My old ways of perusing docs, stackoverflow wasn’t delivering fast enough. My manager pulled me into a room 6 months ago and told me I needed to be more productive aka use ChatGPT/Copilot. Also, due to lack of resources, everyone’s doing everything. I mean, I’m coding in Java, Python, tiny bit of C++, writing CI pipelines, bash scripts, writing automated tests, little bit of infra, fiddling with the Linux machines (our software runs on a Linux machine), you name it. I’m getting recognized, getting pat on the back for going outside my comfort zone (everyone knows I don’t have a CS background) Only problem in my opinion? I’m using ChatGPT/Copilot for ALL of it! I mean ALL OF IT!! Have I learned quite a lot? Sure thing. For example: I got tasked with figuring out internet sharing/ICS between 2 Linux machines and bam! ChatGPT and I had it running in 2 days. Everyone’s impressed. But get this - Yesterday I needed to write a basic If conditional/control flow statement and my mind blanked. I tried it twice and did not get it right. I was seriously taken aback. I’m still quite young and have a lot of career in front of me. I feel like this is seriously turning into a curse instead of a blessing for me. How would you guys approach this? Any resources for going back to the basics? My dumb*** really needs to go back to re-learning /sharpening my mind. Any help? (Sorry for the wall of text but I hope you guys can point me in the right direction.

I got the job through an internship while I was in school, received a return offer, and have been here ever since. Honestly, it’s been a great experience. Pretty chill environment, meaningful contributions, and I’m on track for a promotion.But lately, I’ve been feeling a bit stuck. The pace of work is incredibly slow, and while that was nice at first, it’s starting to feel more draining than relaxing. What really kept me going was the people. I had a great group of coworkers. Unfortunately, many of them have moved to different states recently, and I’ve started to feel a bit isolated and I feel constantly sad.Lately I’ve been thinking maybe it’s time to shake things up and look for something new. Problem is, I’ve never interviewed for a full-time SDE role before (outside of that one internship grind). And in this market? Yikes. On top of that, balancing interview prep with a full-time job is not exactly a walk in the park.My biggest fear is making the leap and regretting it like what if I leave this stable role and things go downhill? But at the same time, I wonder if staying too long will make it even harder to take a leap later on. I’m stuck between comfort and curiosity.So, for those who’ve made a similar decision:How did you prepare while still working full-time? Was it worth it in the end?

So, I don’t dox myself. Some change I made during the weekly sprint ended up in production and caused an outage. I fixed it before the morning was over but it was apparently one mistake too many. When I got back from lunch my access was restricted not terminated but heavily restricted. I kind of had the keys to the kingdom before this. So, I knew the writing was on the wall. My boss called me into his office at the end of the day and said my contract was terminated. He looked super broken up about it. Which honestly surprising because I always thought he disliked me. But he was visibly teary eyed and said he tried to keep me on as hard as he could. I thought that was a very kind thing to do. I think he was expecting more from me but I felt relieved. It’s only way to describe what was feeling at that moment. No more looming deadlines. No more flood of emails in the middle of the night. Looking back it kind of felt like the warden had called me into his office to say I had made parole. I am so tired. I hadn’t taken a weekend off in four months. I’ve essential been doing nonstop overtime for months before that anyways. It was effecting my health. My apartment is a total mess. I was neglecting spending time with my family. I was having nightmares about my mother dying. I was so worried because she’s been sick and I haven’t been able to spend anytime with her. We’ve always been close and I don’t know what I’d do without her. The job used outdated tech stack. So, my technical skills were actually deteriorating. Despite all the work I was doing. We were always on call 24/7. You could expect pms our calls at all hours. They were making more and more restrictions on breaks and Work From Home. A new message had just came into the chat about an even stricter dress code we were suppose to be following right before the axe fell. I am pretty sure they working up to them having to wear suits in the office. Honestly, it felt like a good time to go. The job paid pretty well. So, I have a lot of money saved up. I always lived within my means and saved up thousands every month. Lucky my lease is over next month. So, I can move back in with my parents. Honestly could be way worse.

1jqvn8l,"Landed My First Tech Job in 2025 – Not What I Expected, But Exactly What I Needed",screenfreak,cscareerquestions,"Just wanted to share my journey landing my first job in tech after finishing a boot camp, because I know how brutal the job market is right now—and maybe my story can help someone else feel a little less alone.I wrapped up a full-stack coding boot camp in June 2024 (based in my country), and I was lucky enough to jump right into a 4-month contract-to-hire role. I loved it—but thanks to budget cuts, I didn’t get brought on full time. That was a tough hit, but I kept going.Over the next 6 months, I applied to over 350 positions. That’s not a typo. I barely got interviews. And when I did, they definitely weren’t for junior dev roles. I know a lot of us come out of boot camps dreaming of deploying APIs, but the 2025 market isn’t really handing out dev jobs like candy. I was told by many people I network with that their company is simply not considering people who don't have a computer science degree. Even that, I still know people with CS degree are still struggling. So I had to shift.Here’s what changed the game: I stopped trying to force myself into roles that didn’t want me, and I started looking at what I already had.I already had a bachelor's degree in media and video production. I worked for years as a video editor and in the advertising world. I was burnt out by the end of it, but I had a lot of client-facing experience and I understood tech—just not in the way job titles like to see.About two months ago, I overhauled my resume and LinkedIn to focus on technical solutions, client success, and transferable tech skills from my video background. Suddenly... people noticed. I started getting interviews. Out of those 350+ applications, I had about 7 interviews—almost all of them for technical support engineering or solutions-related roles. Most of them went to the final round.And last week, I finally got an offer. A real tech job at a massive cyber security company!It’s not a pure dev job. But it’s tech-adjacent, it pays well (67k take-home) and it uses both my new and old skill sets. It’s a role where I can grow, keep learning, and pivot again if I want to later. And most importantly: I’m in the door.One thing that really helped me: I stopped applying to every tech job under the sun. I know it feels like you need to cast the widest net—QA, junior dev, data analyst, support, solutions engineer, all of it. But once I leaned heavily into one direction (for me, that was technical support engineering), I was able to sharpen my messaging and actually connect with the right opportunities. Don’t spread yourself so thin you blend in everywhere and stand out nowhere.Through this journey, I also realized something huge: I’m really interested in developing solutions—what I’d call solutions engineering or even presales. The role I landed actually leans in that direction, and I’m excited because it still requires web development skills, which I picked up during the boot camp and my 4-month contract role. So it feels like a perfect hybrid of everything I’ve learned and everything I’ve done before.And finally—this might be the most important tip I can give: stop just clicking ""apply"" on LinkedIn. It almost never works. What actually moved the needle for me was reaching out directly to people at the company—recruiters, team members, anyone relevant. Internal resume forwarding is incredibly powerful. You’d be surprised how many people are willing to pass your name along. If you’re still searching, here’s my advice:-Use what you already have. Don’t ignore your past career—it might be your secret weapon.-Be open to tech-adjacent roles. Dev jobs are scarce right now, but there are tons of other paths in.-Tailor your resume to the job you’re applying for. A generic “junior dev” resume is not going to cut it for every role. Many recruiters and people I networked with would question if I was a developer, why was I apply for technical support engineering? Put yourself in their shoes. -Focus your energy where you shine. Find your lane and double down. -Network like hell. Reach out to real humans.

I’ve been into coding since my early teens (around 14–16 years old), and eventually went on to get a degree in Computer Science.After graduating, I didn’t land a job as a developer right away. Instead, I started out as a trainer, helping teach other developers. I did that for two years before finally getting a job as an actual developer, and I’ve now been working in the field for about four years.Here’s the thing though — I still don’t feel like a good developer. I get stuck easily, I can’t do LeetCode to save my life, I haven’t contributed to open source, I don’t have side projects, and I definitely don’t have a billion-dollar product idea to chase. Most of my work these past two years has involved modifying existing code, often with a lot of help from ChatGPT. I haven’t written anything I’d consider “original” in a long time, and that worries me.I used to *love* programming.

1jq8srm,Should I Pursue a Master's Degree While Already Having a Well-Paying Job and Experience in ML?,Raventhous,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I'm currently facing a crossroads and would greatly appreciate your perspective. Here's some context:**My Background:** I graduated top of my class in Computer Engineering (GPA 3.82) from a university in Turkey. During university, I landed a job as a Junior ML Engineer at a US-based AI startup (long before the current generative AI boom). I quickly advanced due to strong performance, but unfortunately, the startup went bankrupt after about two years, despite having a solid product. Shortly after, my former colleague started another generative AI startup, and I've been working there as a Machine Learning Engineer ever since. I'm genuinely passionate about the idea we're developing, love the startup freedom, fast iteration, and the overall culture. The downside is that it's a fragile situation—no paying customers yet and a precarious financial position based on hopes and dreams. Also it is an incredibly small team, with me being the most experienced developer...But to summarize, I have a very solid 3+ years of work experience all about GenAI.**Current Challenges I'm Facing:**\- **Social Isolation and Depression:** Working remotely has deeply affected my social life. In university, I had friends, community groups, and a vibrant social life, all effortlessly tied to my studies and interests. Now, despite trying coworking spaces, cafés, gyms, and networking through friends, I absolutely cannot meet new people and feel isolated and depressed. (people/friends in general, not specific to AI and my career) \- **Professional Stagnation**: Although I'm doing meaningful work, my technical growth feels limited. At university, I learned the fundamentals and core concepts of ML in-depth. Currently, my role involves high-level work with LLMs (prompt engineering, fine-tuning existing models), cloud infrastructure, and production deployments—but I no longer feel challenged intellectually by fundamental ML tasks (like data engineering, creating neural models from scratch, feature engineering, etc.). I worry that my skills might stagnate, and I feel like I'm doing stuff that I already know of everyday. I feel like I could be doing more. \- **Future Uncertainty and Ambitions Abroad:** I'm increasingly uncertain about my future prospects, especially in Turkey, in fact I see no future here in this country. I attempted to move to the US previously but faced visa challenges partly due to the lack of a Master's degree. I'm considering living and working abroad in the future, and a Master's might simplify immigration processes and open doors internationally. If I were to do a masters I would have to juggle this start-up with the masters together. But at the same time masters would be my gateway to living abroad.**Considering a Master's Degree:**\- Would a Master's help me reclaim the social aspects of university life, meet like-minded peers, and alleviate isolation?\- Could a Master's re-engage my passion for learning, particularly regarding the foundational elements of ML? Is it even necessary?\- Is obtaining a Master's from an internationally recognized institution essential for career advancement, credibility, and immigration? Or will I be stuck at my current salary just because I don't have a higher degree?\- Conversely, should I skip a Master's and focus entirely on my current career trajectory, despite feeling socially isolated and professionally unfulfilled? Hoping that it will go big, and I'd potentially earn more than I could even imagine in non-startup companies? I also feel hesitant getting back into doing a bunch of math stuff.\- If pursuing a Master's is beneficial, which countries and universities would be optimal for specialization in generative AI? (Considering the US, UK, Germany, Finland, etc.) - yes i've read the FAQ, but i want to hear your opinions - Also the field itself, and in general how one even applies to a masters? Do I have to pay more attention to the professors, and email them one by one? Do I have to have a plan before-hands?As you guys can see I am lost in so many decisions, it took hours to write my ideas down here and I still feel like I couldn't clearly explain myself. But hopefully I painted a somewhat clear picture of my current mental state, and I hope some of you can empathize with.***TL;DR:*** I'm currently a successful ML Engineer in a promising but unstable startup. I'm feeling socially isolated and professionally stagnant, contemplating a Master's degree abroad for personal, social, professional growth, and potentially easier international mobility. Is it worth pursuing, and if so, where, how?Thanks in advance for your advice and insights!",5,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jq8srm/should_i_pursue_a_masters_degree_while_already/,2025-04-03 11:01:33,2025-04-04 17:04:44

Of course, many startups will ask DSA questions, but the hiring signal there is way weaker for startups as they actually need engineers who can run the ground running and push a ton of feature code. If the recruiter tells you that there's going to be DSA problems, by all means grind. And if they say there isn't going to be any, just don't do DSA at all. *If they say neither and you have 0 idea if DSA will be on the interview, keep the LeetCode prep on the lighter side.* I would stick to LeetCode Easy + Medium only and spend just 30-45 minutes per day.",4,0.65,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jng6dq/are_coding_rounds_any_different_for_startups_vs/,2025-03-30 23:25:19,2025-04-04 17:04:44

1jmlx6u,CS Masters part-time while working?,worrisome_bloke,cscareerquestions,"Hi guys, just want to know your thoughts and experiences. I had an MMus. Completely worthless during 2020 when i graduated, so i self studied into a dev career. It’s been 3 years now since i landed a good role, and everything’s going fine. Kinda lucked out with a remote job, great team and good pay. Increments and promotions have been coming too and it’s been good.However, i recently floated my resume around, applying to 10-20 companies at a time, and have been getting flat out rejections. I just wanted to test the water around to gauge the hiring market, and i guess my resume’s getting filtered out straightaway. I know 3 years is still pretty early into a CS career, but wow, it’s pretty sobering to have some experience and projects under my belt yet (i think) a degree might still be king after all.Now onto my question. Is a masters in CS worth the trouble? My manager and skip says for a career it’s not needed, and we just have to be great at DSA & System Design, but judging from how resumes are plucked recently i’m thinking otherwise.What do you guys think?

1jqomr0,"How do we actually solve these ""bugs"" the end user has found ?",Competitive-Math-458,cscareerquestions,"So i honestly want to know what we can even do to help these people, we own a service that gets used by a help desk type team. Imagine a generic frontend with input boxes and buttons to submit and request information. A super basic example will be I want x details for this person I'm speaking to check its them. So they enter Cred12345 and press the search button and page url is updated it /getDetails/Cred12345 and now you have there details. You can enter some new details and press submit and get those details, if you enter something wrong or invalid as in it does not exist or is too short or long ect you get a nice error summary on the page with exactly what went wrong. It will say something like cred can only be x character long or you tried to submit with an empty input feild This went through lots of UX and testings. But the bug tickets the help desk team are making we never even considered as an option. There is also ways to update details and lots of other logic but I'll stick with just get Details for now. However we have now had several tickets raised for fixes we never thought was possible. For example people are manaully editing the url instead of using the frontend and then complaining when they get a 404 page not found as the url is now wrong. Or that they get an validation error on the page when they try to submit without any details or details that dont meet the length requirement for the input box. They think it should submit just incase maybe it does exist. Some example ticket is as follows - when they change the url to be /getDetails/allusers or /getDetails/* it does not work they get a 404 and they expect it to show all the information in the database on the page. - if they edit a url to be /deleteDetails/cred12345 it does nothing and they just get a 404. I have no idea why a helpdesk would even try this or need this as it was never discussed.- they pressed back in the browser several times and it took them off the frontendIt's now at the point I would not be surprised if we get a bug report that after closing the browser you can not acess the page. I'm like honestly not even sure what we can do about this, if the end user is going to manaully change your url to the wrong one is there any hope of fully fixing all the ""bugs"" they report.Honestly, do we just say sorry its user error that does not work its not a bug and ignore them ?",4,0.67,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jqomr0/how_do_we_actually_solve_these_bugs_the_end_user/,2025-04-04 00:31:25,2025-04-04 17:04:44
