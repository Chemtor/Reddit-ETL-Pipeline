1nxshi2,How to deal with messy database?,Which-Breadfruit-926,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, during my internship in a health institute, my main task was to clean up and document medical databases so they could later be used for clinical studies (using DBT and related tools).The problem was that the databases I worked with were really messy, they came directly from hospital software systems. There was basically no documentation at all, and the schema was a mess, moreover, the database was huge, thousands of fields and hundred of tables. Here are some examples of bad design: * No foreign keys defined between tables that clearly had relationships.* Some tables had a column that just stored the *name* of another table to indicate a link (instead of a proper relation).* Other tables existed in total isolation, but were obviously meant to be connected.To deal with it, I literally had to spend my weeks opening each table, looking at the data, and trying to guess its purpose, then writing comments and documentation as I went along.So my questions are:* Is this kind of challenge (analyzing and documenting undocumented databases) something you often encounter in data engineering / data science work?* If you’ve faced this situation before, how did you approach it? Did you have strategies or tools that made the process more efficient than just manual exploration?",66,0.97,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nxshi2/how_to_deal_with_messy_database/,2025-10-04 12:19:54,2025-10-08 01:25:43

1o0kyd0,I think we need other data infrastructure for AI (table-first infra),Fabulous_Pollution10,dataengineering,"hi! I do some data consultancy for llm startups. They do llm finetuning for different use cases, and I build their data pipelines. I keep running into the same pain: just a pile of big text files. Files and object storage look simple, but in practice they slow me down. One task turns into many blobs across different places – messy. No clear schema. Even with databases, small join changes break things. The orchestrator can’t “see” the data, so batching is poor, retries are clumsy, and my GPUs sit idle.My friend helped me rethink the whole setup. What finally worked was treating everything as tables with transactions – one namespace, clear schema for samples, runs, evals, and lineage. I snapshot first, then measure, so numbers don’t drift. Queues are data-aware: group by token length or expected latency, retry per row. After this, fewer mystery bugs, better GPU use, cleaner comparisons.He wrote his view here: [https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra](https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra)Does anyone here run AI workloads on transactional, table-first storage instead of files?

We moved to a cloud stack years back and implemented these complex transformations into Scala in Databricks although we have been doing more and more Pyspark. Over time, we've had issues deploying new gold-tier models in our medallion architecture. Whenever there are highly complex transformations, it takes us a lot longer to develop and deploy. Data quality is lower. Even with lineage graphs, we cannot answer quickly and well for complex derivations if someone asks how we came up with a value in a field. Nothing we do on our new stack compared to the speed and quality when we used to have a good GUI-based ETL tool. Basically myself and 1 other team member could build data warehouses quickly and after moving to the cloud, we have tons of engineers and it takes longer with worse results.What we are considering now is to continue using Databricks for ingest and maybe bronze/silver layers and when building gold layer models with complex transformations, we use a GUI and cloud-based ETL/ELT solution. We want something like the old PowerCenter. Matillion was mentioned. Also, Informatica has a cloud solution.Any advice?

1o023we,I keep making mistakes that impact production jobs…losing confidence in my abilities,eatdrinksleepp,dataengineering,"I am a junior data engineer with a little over a year worth of experience. My role started off as a support data engineer but in the past few months, my manager has been giving the support team more development tasks since we all wanted to grow our technical skills. I have also been assigned some development tasks in the past few months, mostly fixing a bug or adding validation frameworks in different parts of a production job. Before I was the one asking for more challenging tasks and wanted to work on development tasks but now that I have been given the work, I feel like I have only disappointed my manager. In the past few months, I feel like pretty much every PR I merged ended up having some issue that either broke the job or didn’t capture the full intention of the assigned task. At first, I thought I should be testing better. Our testing environments are currently so rough to deal with that just setting them up to test a small piece of code can take a full day of work. Anyway, I did all that but even then I feel like I keep missing some random edge case or something that I failed to consider which ends up leading to a failure downstream. And I just constantly feel so dumb in front of my manager. He ends up having to invest so much time in fixing things I break and he doesn’t even berate me for it but I just feel so bad. I know people say that if your manager reviewed your code then its their responsibility too, but I feel like I should have tested more and that I should be more holistic in my considerations. I just feel so self-conscious and low on confidence. The annoying thing is that the recent validation thing I worked on, we introduced it to other teams too since it would affect their day-to-day tasks but turns out, my current validation framework technically works but it will also result in some false positives that I now need to work on. But other teams know that I am the one who set this up and that I failed to consider something so anytime, these false positives show up (until I fix it), it will be because of me. I just find it so embarrassing and I know it will happen again because no matter how much I test my code, there is always something that I will miss. It almost makes me want to never PR into production and just never write development code, keep doing my support work even though I find that tedious and boring but at least its relatively low stakes…I am just not feeling very good and doesn’t help that I feel like I am the only one making these kind of mistakes in my team and being a burden on my manager, and ultimately creating more work for him with my mistakes…Like I think even the new person on the team isn’t making as many mistakes as I am..",21,0.9,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1o023we/i_keep_making_mistakes_that_impact_production/,2025-10-07 01:53:54,2025-10-08 01:25:43
1nzp92t,We just launched Daft’s distributed engine v1.5: an open-source engine for running models on data at scale,sanityking,dataengineering,"Hi all! I work on Daft full-time, and since we just shipped a big feature, I wanted to share what’s new. Daft’s been mentioned here a couple of times, so AMA too.Daft is an open-source Rust-based data engine for multimodal data (docs, images, video, audio) and running models on them. We built it because getting data into GPUs efficiently at scale is painful, especially when working with data sitting in object stores, and usually requires custom I/O + preprocessing setups.So what’s new? Two big things. **1. A new distributed engine for running models at scale**We’ve been using Ray for distributed data processing but consistently hit scalability issues. So we switched from using Ray Tasks for data processing operators to running one Daft engine instance per node, then scheduling work across these Daft engine instances. Fun fact: we named our single-node engine “Swordfish” and our distributed runner “Flotilla” (i.e. a school of swordfish).We now also use [morsel-driven parallelism](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/p743-leis.pdf) and dynamic batch sizing to deal with varying data sizes and skew.And we have smarter shuffles using either the Ray Object Store or our new Flight Shuffle (Arrow Flight RPC + NVMe spill + direct node-to-node transfer). **2. Benchmarks for AI workloads**We just designed and ran some swanky new AI benchmarks. Data engine companies love to bicker about TPC-DI, TPC-DS, TPC-H performance. That’s great, who doesn’t love a throwdown between Databricks and Snowflake.So we’re throwing a new benchmark into the mix for audio transcription, document embedding, image classification, and video object detection.

1nvialm,Git branching with dbt... moving from stage/uat environment to prod?,SeaYouLaterAllig8tor,dataengineering,"So, we have multiple dbt projects at my employer, one which has three environments (dev, stage and prod). The issue we're having is merging from the staging env to prod. For reference, in most of our other projects, we simply have dev and prod. Every branch gets tested and reviewed in a PR (we also have a CI environment and job that runs and checks to make sure nothing will break in Prod from changes being implemented) and then merged into a main branch, which is Production. A couple months back we implemented ""stage"" or a UAT environment for one of primary/largest dbt projects. The environment works fine the issue is that in git, once a developer's PR is reviewed and approved in dev and their code is merged into stage, it gets merged into a single stage branch in git. This is somewhat problematic since we'll typically end up with a backlog of changes over time which all need to go to Prod, but not all changes are tested/UAT'd at the same time. So, you end up having some changes that are ready for prod while others are awaiting UAT review. Since all changes in stage exist in a single branch, anything that was merged from dev to stage has to go to Prod all at once. I've been trying to figure out if there's a way to ""cherry pick"" a handful of commits in the stage branch and merge only those to prod in a PR. A colleague suggested using git releases to do this functionality but that doesn't seem to be (based on videos I've watched) what we need. How are people handling this type of functionality? Once your changes go to your stage/uat environment do you have a way of handling merging individual commits to production?",13,0.82,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nvialm/git_branching_with_dbt_moving_from_stageuat/,2025-10-01 19:41:52,2025-10-08 01:25:43

I’m in a decent position to move up.The company is big but my team is small (1 manager, 1 senior, 2 juniors). It’s generally a good place to work, though promotions and recognition are quite slow — most people move internally to progress. As the other junior and senior are on a single project, I'm doing all others currently.I normally get bored after about a year in a job, but I’ve been here for 2 years and still enjoy most of the work despite a few frustrations.Current situation:My girlfriend lives in Germany (we’ve been together for 4 years), and I want to move there. My current job doesn’t allow working abroad, so I’ll need to find something a way to make it happen. I do fortunately have EU citizenshipI’ve had a few opportunites in Germany. Some looked promising but didn’t work out (e.g. they needed someone to start immediately, or misrepresented parts of the process). Overall, though, I seem to get decent interest.Main issue:A lot of roles in Germany require a degree (I’m working on one but don’t have it yet).Many jobs also want fluent German. Mine is still pretty basic, but I’m learning.I'm considering:EU contracting - I like the idea of doing different projects every 6–12 months while living in Germany. I haven’t looked properly into the legal/tax side yet, but it sounds like it could fit well.Building a product/startup- I’ve built a very basic MVP that provides analytics (including some predictive analysis) for small–mid sized e-commerce companies.

You open a file, see dozens of functions, and instantly get lost. But learning to *read* code well is just as important as writing it. I have a few actionable tips to get started with reading code* Make a mental map of the functions: * When your going through the code always try a high level outline of the file and then build on that towards. Like for example, start at the top of the file and go through the functions clicking on them to go towards the source code* Run the code through a debugger : * One of the underrated ways to understand a codebase is to run the code that you are reading through a debugger. Attach a breakpoint and the simulate running the code, you will understand the flow of the code extremely well.* Start from the test cases: * If the project has test cases, that’s your entry point. Run them and *watch what happens*. * What objects are being created? * Which functions are called first? * What files are imported?Learning to read code well takes time. You won’t understand everything the first time and that’s okay.

I also started paying more attention to posture, feet flat on the floor, back supported, and trying not to crane my neck forward.I’m curious what’s worked for other people here.

What will be more beneficial here? Is it moving forward with CS50 or TOP or starting the C++ book as originally intended?I've always seen this idea reiterated quite often that choosing a programming language for a novice is not as important as it is to choose a good course that teaches the fundamentals of programming. But then you would eventually loose your time re-learning your target language. So I'm a bit confused and wanted to hear the opinions of intermediate and experienced programmers on this particular statement.Do you agree with this mentality of learning the fundamentals without being hyper-fixated about the language or do you think that learning your target language is more important from the get-go?Thanks in advance <3,11,0.87,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nx60yn/is_learning_programming_from_a_good_course_or/,2025-10-03 17:47:29,2025-10-08 01:25:44

Was it:* Open source / cross-platform freedom?* Microsoft lock-in concerns?* Better community or tooling at the time?* Enterprise demand / job market?* Something else entirely?And for those who’ve stuck with Java since then — do you still feel it was the right call?

1o0syuu,Looking for a generic data structure being able to describe complex domain specific filters ( or standardized query language ),m477h145h3rm53n,learnprogramming,"I'm searching for a very flexible data structure being able to describe what data to fetch from an API ( assuming I would own that API by creating a custom wrapper plugin ). The data itself is quite easy to fetch but the filters are very complex because the client domain is fully customizable.The system========Given an external project-based system. Each project contains multiple entities of different types ( e.g. *risk*, *hazard*, ... ). Each entity got an `id` field and can have additional custom fields ( e.g. *name*, *description*, ... ). It is possible to link entities via link definitions ( e.g. *hazard* **belongs to** *risk* ), so one entity is pointing to others.https://i.sstatic.net/lWWf5z9F.pngReading data via system GUI========The system itself provides 2 approaches to display data in its own GUI- writing raw SQL- providing a [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) query stringBoth approaches work for the most cases but complex queries are not possible. If the SQL query is too complex, the system won't execute it ( because of security reasons ), some SQL statements got blacklisted. Same for the Lucene query, you can only query very basic information. If you want to read complex data you have to write a custom Java plugin and query the database on your own.My current solution========There are several domains that require different domain specific queries ( e.g. Risk management, Cyper security, ... )Since I want to read complex data and visualize it in a table I thought it could be useful to separate the transformed UI data from the raw fetching data.So a very simple UI might look like this | Risks | Risks | Hazards || ----- | ----- | ----- || render some fields of Risk 1 | render other fields of Risk 1 | render Hazard 1 |As you can see one entity can be displayed differently in multiple columns. But since we only want to read it once ( to calculate a tree representing a table matrix ) I thought data sources would do the trick.A single data source describes which data to load. It is a pool of entities with their fields. There must be a leading data source and there can be a list of following data sources depending on each other.```tsdataSources: { leading: { id: ""unique-id"", // a unique ID for the data source entityTypeIds: [ ""entityType-1"", ""entityType-2"" ], // describe which types to load fieldIds: [ ""field-1"" ], // only fetch the desired custom fields }, following: [{ // ... following DS extends the leading DS ... dependsOn: { dataSourceId: ""id-of-the-related-data-source"", // point to the other data source ( e.g. leading ) relation: { // describe the link definition typeId: ""has"", // the ID of the link definition sourceIs: ""other"" // which direction to use? ( can be ""me"" or ""other"" ) } } }]}```Each data source loads entities with their fields based on its configuration. Related following data sources load entities based on the relation and the final result will be a data graph.Now this approach comes with some limitations:- You have to be sure that each field ID exists for each entity type- You have to be sure that the defined link definition matches each entity type of the related data source- leading data will be fetched from the current project only but related data will be fetched from everywhere ( no limits ) To add a filter to a data source I had a look at [MongoDB filter expressions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/eq/) and created my own simple filters, e.g.```ts// Comparison operators ( equals ){ ""$eq"": [""fieldId"", ""value""]}// Logical operators ( and | not | or ){ ""$and"": [] // Expecting other filters, e.g. comparison operators}```When it comes to very complex filtering, e.g.> Pick risk if linked to any hazard and at least one hazard is of category biological the only way I solved it was to hardcode some filter steps in the backend code and define them inside an action```ts// Filter action { name: ""my filter action"", // the name of the backend method param1: ..., param2: ..., ...}```With all the information the backend is able to process data source by data source ( ""column wise"" ) but my approach not ideal. Traversing 3000 risks with a generic SQL query ( by transforming the basic filters ) and applying filter methods on them is very slow. The external system is slow itself so rendering a table with ~30 columns and maybe 50 rows can take up to 1 minute ( depends on domain complexity ). ~5 seconds is considered ""fast"".I'm looking for a very generic data structure to describe exactly what I want in one run ( if possible )> Lessons learned: I think it's to slow to process data source by data source ( column wise ) because the UI has to wait everything to be fetched. It might be better to create a structure that resolves a whole ""UI"" row ( all data sources together ) because the backend could stream row by row so the client could start rendering some results earlier.So I'm thinking about overhauling the whole application in terms of flexibility and performance.""improve existing structure"" idea========As little dynamic as possible with a clear mapping```ts// Leading Entity DataSource{ ""projectID-1"": { // define project ID ""entityTypeID-1"": { // define entity type ID // define entity configuration ( e.g. fields ) } }}// Following Entity To Entity DataSource ( one to one mapping ){ ""parent-projectID-1"": { // define parent project ID ""parent-entityTypeID-1"": { // define parent entity type ID ""parent-linkDefinitionID-1"": { // define link definition ID fromTypes: { // specific link direction ( opposite is toTypes ) ""projectID-1"": { // define project ID ""entityTypeID-2"": { // define entity type ID // define entity configuration ( e.g. fields ) } } } } } }}```This structure gives you a lot more flexibility and the backend exactly knows what to do. Unfortunately I wasn't able to solve the filter part yet. How should I tell the backend> Pick this one if its status is ""open"" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.Reading every risk and applying a filter which checks every hazard relative to this risk can cause a massive slowdown ( when having many data sources )""use SQL"" idea========It would be easy to create a custom SQL string and pass it to the backend plugin which passes the SQL query to the system. Unfortunately this is not possible because- The system would block complex queries- There are no permission checks anymore""use Lucene"" idea========One could create a Lucene query string. While Lucene itself allows arbitrarily complex logical structures, the system enforces a few practical restrictions:- Security & Performance:Extremely deep nesting or very long OR chains (e.g., thousands of values) may be rejected by the system- Syntax filtering:The system only supports a subset of Lucene’s query syntax (for example, no wildcards in field names, no custom analyzer queries)- Fixed field names:You can only query fields that the system has indexed (e.g., type, status, severity, assignee, project, created, etc.)Complex queries not only check for field values but also for graphs and Lucene is not a graph database system.""filters"" idea========Think of everything being a ( known ) filter```ts// caution: this filter structure needs to be logically nested inside AND / OR / NOT{ /* Glob Pattern, e.g. ""100"" => Project 100 only ""!100"" => All projects except 100 ""100|200"" => Project 100 or 200 only ""*"" => All projects */ projectID: ""100"", entityTypeID: ""risk"", // Glob pattern similiar to project ID // ... additional filters ...}```This might work but it takes some time to resolve the request. And for now I didn't find a good structure for a very complex domain filter.---My questions:-----Is there a standard query language solving this? I want to avoid inventing my own query language.Do you have any ideas how to create a generic structure being able to solve complex domain cases?",2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1o0syuu/looking_for_a_generic_data_structure_being_able/,2025-10-07 22:11:28,2025-10-08 01:25:44

I instantly loved it , it felt meaningful, impactful, and technically interesting. So I jumped in, did a good bit of research, and started thinking about how I could make it my own.At first, my plan was to:* Build a basic sign language recognition system using a webcam, Python, and OpenCV.* Expand the word library beyond the typical 10-20 signs.* Focus specifically on Irish Sign Language (ISL) to localize it more.But as I kept researching, I realized I might’ve been on the wrong side of the internet early on, because it turns out that projects like this have already been done a *lot*. My additions (more words, ISL focus) don’t really feel like enough to count as a real advancement or innovation, especially for a final year project.I then thought: what if I added a region detection feature? Something that could detect which sign language dialect is being used (e.g., ASL vs BSL vs ISL). But again, the more I dig, the more I see that similar ideas have been explored — and I'm starting to feel like I’m just re-inventing existing wheels without offering anything new.To be honest, I’m really stuck now, I’ve backed myself into a project that’s been done too many times already, and I’m not sure how to meaningfully innovate it.I would love some advice on this, what more can i add, and should i just give up.

Maybe the site changed their structure since the package was last updated?My goal is to extract:* preparation time,* cooking time,* total time,* ingredients,* instructions,* maybe also tags/keywords.Has anyone worked with this library recently or knows a better way to parse recipes from Chefkoch? Should I instead scrape the site myself (e.g. with BeautifulSoup) or is there a more up-to-date package that I missed?As I'm a newbie, any advice would be appreciated",2,0.76,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nwtydy/trouble_extracting_recipe_data_with_pythonchefkoch/,2025-10-03 08:59:53,2025-10-08 01:25:44
1nv27jt,"Why do so many new grads cannot perform the ""basics""?",None,cscareerquestions,"I work in a FAANG, and my team hired around 3 new grads this year. Been looking at their code reviews and I often notice that it's about 90% LLM generated code that are often complicated, out of context, unnecessary addons and stuffs like that. While coaching them on 1:1, I notice they struggle to meet the basic SDE standards that are well within the scope of a new CS grad or at least something that is easy to find in internet.For example - there's a dude that wasn't able to understand that a javascript function can return another function and not just a concrete value/object. He also asked me how a basic lodash function work - which is basically 1 google search away. Another dude was not able to explain his thought process on the code he wrote because I found that there is no relevance of the change he made for the feature development that was assigned. So, on a high level, I have observed that they cannot grasp the understanding of the system, have patience to read through documentations, question what it does and how to think of when writing code. Now, there could be a couple of possibilities on this. First, maybe they are overwhelmed and feel like they need to push gold standard code from month 1, else they get fired. The brutal job market might be making them scared to lose the job and is presurring them to show up as an expert already. Second, maybe the ChatGPT really ruined their critical thinking ability and attention span for reading through documentations / articles. Third, could it be the toxic work culture at FAANG where there's a pressure of proving yourself to avoid layoffs? I am curious if the situation is same across all companies.",1094,0.91,514,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nv27jt/why_do_so_many_new_grads_cannot_perform_the_basics/,2025-10-01 07:55:53,2025-10-08 01:25:45

1nwef8o,Anyone lose their drive after reaching mid level?,Gold-Flatworm-4313,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Reached mid-level in a big tech company, haven't pushed myself to reach further after 3 years.Don't get me wrong. I still love coding. I still love my job. My reviews are great at work. I just... don't have the drive to work extra hard to reach senior level, much less staff/principal.I compare myself to when I was a new grad. Going to many tech events, networking, improving my Leetcode skills and constantly interviewing to improve my interview skills and to see what opportunities are available to grow or reach higher. I would read books, do side projects, keep up with the latest news and trends. My goal at the time was eventually become a staff/principal level dev earning 150-200k a year 10 years down the road. My hard work eventually paid off, I went from a no-name school to a few scrappy startups to better mid level company and eventually hit a big tech remote job. Been here three years now and I'm honestly content. Old me would have pushed for a promotion by year 1 (with an expectation of failure but that's okay! I tried to get internships my first semester in school too lol). I thought I'd ""rest"" from the grind for a bit and now 3 years have passed. Will probably reach year 4 without a promotion though my compensation has grown quite a bit regardless. I don't even interview around anymore (as that's one way to get to senior too!) Part of it seems to be that, from a compensation stand point, I had reached the upper band of my goal the moment I got the big tech job and am now at a point where I overshot it by more than 50%. I absolutely do not have the momentum to reach staff/principal in the next 5 years anymore.Anyone in the same boat? Anyone who was in the same boat and got out of it?

1nvfmny,Why does it seem like leadership at _all_ companies seems to have gotten much worse?,cs_____question1031,cscareerquestions,"Maybe I was naive at the time, but early in my career (early 2010s), it seemed like companies knew what they were doing a lot more. At my first two or three companies, the CEOs all had the same story: they came from outside of tech and decided to make software to solve some problem that they were having. They could clearly explain what the problems they were trying to solve were, and how the solution did thatThis seemed also true at bigger companies. Companies like google or netflix were at least *trying* to make products that appealed to consumers, even if it wasn't always a hit. Companies seemed to be run fairly well, or they were at least stable day to day. There was also lots of ""aspirational"" jobs, like places where if you got a job there, it felt like you hit the lotteryNowadays things just... don't really seem like that. It seems like every single company has *terrible* leadership. AI integration into *everything* seems like a good example, I don't know a single person in my life who has ever wanted to use one of these things, most (like me) find them actively annoying. Some of their ideas just seem really out there. Like how Zuckerberg was talking about making a social network where you interact with AI companions. ... Why would I ever want that?The companies just generally seem to be run more poorly. Vaguely communicated (if communicated at all) long term goals, seemingly no direction or conviction, no desire to compete and a seeming indifference to customer needs. Sometimes it even feels like they have an actively antagonistic view of their customers and people in general.

1nwss1b,"From 0 Offers to Multiple Opportunities – Job Search Season 2 Recap (7.5 YOE, Market Update, and Lessons Learned)",diabloallica,cscareerquestions,"Earlier this year, I shared a post about my *brutal job search season* — 7 years of experience, 0 offers, and a Sankey diagram of all my failures. At that time, I was struggling to get traction despite a ton of effort, and the funnel felt brutal. (For anyone curious, here’s the old post: [Brutal Job Search Season Recap - 7 YOE, 0 Offers, and a Sankey Diagram of My Failures : r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1irlf8b/brutal_job_search_season_recap_7_yoe_0_offers_and/))This time around, things went much better. With \~7.5 years of experience at a major cloud company, I decided to give the market another shot, and the difference was noticeable. I ended up landing **5 job offers, all at a higher level than my current role**, and had far more interview opportunities with larger, well-known companies compared to my last search.**What Changed Since Last Time:*** **Market conditions:** Hiring still isn’t easy, but compared to earlier this year, there’s clearly more activity. The bar is high, but not *as impossibly high*.* **Interview prep:** I doubled down on my weak spots. Coding used to be my #1 rejection reason. I kept grinding on patterns, mock interviews, and actually slowing down to talk through my thinking. That helped a lot.* **Mindset:** Last time, every rejection hit me hard. This time, I treated each round as “just another rep,” which helped me stay consistent across system design and behavioral interviews.**Results:*** Multiple onsites and final-round loops.* 5 actual offers on the table (finally!).* A more balanced funnel: coding wasn’t the auto-fail it used to be, and system design performance felt steadier.**Takeaways:**1. The market does ebb and flow. Timing matters more than we admit.2. Interviewing is a skill that compounds. The “wasted” interviews from earlier weren’t really wasted; they set me up to do better this time.3. Having \~7 years of experience doesn’t exempt you from practicing fundamentals. But it *does* give you more stories and perspective for behavioral/design rounds.Curious: has anyone else noticed interviews feeling slightly more reasonable lately? Or was this just lucky timing?**New Sankey diagrams:**[https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg](https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg) \- Without any failure reason categorization [https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2](https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2) \- With weighted failure reason categorization",80,0.89,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwss1b/from_0_offers_to_multiple_opportunities_job/,2025-10-03 07:42:49,2025-10-08 01:25:45

I got a mostly positive response to that mostly pessimistic post. I updated based on recent data and expanded to cover industries that rely on Tech and Quant related skills. I’ll repost to finance careers as well this time.In my original post, I shared that in my experience the job market largely reflects confidence that earnings growth will outpace inflation and bond markets. Here’s the S&P 500  [YOY RE growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-earnings-growth/table/by-quarter) over the last nine months:* Mar 31, 2025  10.58%* Dec 31, 2024  6.15%* Sep 30, 2024  6.11%* Jun 30, 2024  5.12%[Real M2 Money Supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2REAL) appears to have also reverted back to a normal rate of growth from before the pandemic. That, in addition to the earnings growth, should start a return to a “normal” job market. Unfortunately, back-to-normal is taking longer than anyone wants.I poked around a little more and noticed the following trend for S&P 500 [YOY Real Sales Per Share growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-sales-growth/table/by-quarter) over that same time period:* Mar 31, 2025  2.25%* Dec 31, 2024  2.24%* Sep 30, 2024  2.75%* Jun 30, 2024  1.95%That suggests that companies realized earnings growth not through sales but instead through cost cutting by presumably reducing headcount. I posted a public [dashboard on FRED that shows headcount growth flatlining](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/dashboard/121649) (you can create your own economic dashboard on FRED).Unfortunately, I don’t think lower rates alone from the Fed will be enough. Also, unlike what I wrote in my original post, I don’t think there are any safe jobs or companies. Here are some other larger trends I’ve begun looking at - I am curious if others on Reddit agree or disagree:1. Between security concerns, software as a service, and low/no code customization, the number of products and versions have shrunk. Hence, companies have eliminated many jobs patching older versions of SW or journeyman jobs maintaining custom code.2. Overall, [the number of publicly traded companies has shrunk](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LDOM.NO?locations=US) since the 1990s. If it wasn’t for SPACs, the numbers would likely have gone even further lower. With fewer companies, M&A, auditing, compliance, and finance all rely on less and less headcount.3. The [increase in college educated professionals](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MJlq) has diluted the unique value of any college degree. Even if you suspended H1B and OPT roles, it wouldn’t change the scale at which college educated professionals now participate in the job market relative to what they did 20 years ago.Growth in public companies followed public market deregulation by Reagan in the 1980s and not regulating the internet starting with Clinton in the 1990s (Sec 230).

1nxmaoq,Industry vs Academia for CS PhD,wonder-why-I-wonder,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,I’m finishing up a PhD in CS at a top U.S. school (think Stanford, MIT, CMU, or Berkeley). I recently received an industry offer that isn’t research-oriented (no publications involved), and I’m torn between taking it and graduating soon or going on the academic job market.For context, I have 10+ first-author papers at top AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) with around 400 citations in total. My advisor says I’m one of the best students they’ve had in the past decade and that I should be able to land a tenure-track position at a top institution.In terms of compensation, I can expect around $400–500K total in industry (with a $300K base). Assistant professors in my field at top schools seem to start around $160–180K including summer support and benefits. Tenured associate professors make roughly $220K+, full professors around $280K+, and side consulting can add a meaningful amount on top of that.Here’s my dilemma: I’m completely burned out from the publish-or-perish sprint. It feels impossible to truly rest from research, it follows you even into your dreams. I also sometimes feel empty producing papers that don’t seem to have much real-world relevance. Maybe things would get better once I settle into a tenure-track position with more autonomy, but I’m not sure. I don’t hate research, but the passion I once had for it is gone. These days, it feels more like a job I need to perform well in general at rather than something I’m genuinely excited about.That said, I absolutely love the flexibility and freedom academia offers. Being able to set my own schedule, take time off when needed, and choose topics that genuinely interest me has been invaluable. You also get summers (mostly) off from teaching and service, plus sabbaticals down the line. Most importantly, I find mentoring and teaching students incredibly meaningful in a way that publishing papers never has been. That’s the kind of “impact” that actually feels real to me.So… how do you decide between academia and industry when the pros and cons barely overlap? And is it reasonable to pursue an academic career if you don’t love research anymore, but deeply enjoy teaching and mentoring?I know no one can make this decision for me, but I’m feeling pretty lost right now and would really appreciate any perspectives or advice.Thanks a lot for reading.",42,0.83,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nxmaoq/industry_vs_academia_for_cs_phd/,2025-10-04 06:09:31,2025-10-08 01:25:45

Here are the contenders:1. M.S. in Software Engineering - Closest to what I do now. Could help fill in gaps in areas I haven’t worked in, but not sure how much employability upside it really has.2. M.S. in Computer Science - The title alone sounds stronger than Software Engineering. Has AI specializations that align with my new role. Might make me stand out more technically down the road.3. MBA in IT Management - I’m interested in becoming an engineering manager eventually, but I don’t know how much a specialization like this actually matters for that.4.

My previous role was at a much smaller company for just under 5 years, and I was a team lead/supervisor for the last 2.5 years there.I feel like I’m lacking foundational experience. I only really spent a few years as a pure application developer, and that whole time involved maintaining a relatively old ASP.NET application. As a supervisor I led a team working on a TypeScript web application using a number of more modern tools, but my focus was divided between active development and project management/team management.As a senior dev, it’s clear to me that there’s an expectation that I’m in a position to mentor less experienced devs and to lead work on our projects, as well as to be comfortable making high-level architecture decisions. Across the board, I just don’t feel like I have more experience or knowledge than the devs at a lower level.At the end of the day, I feel like I’m a mid-level dev who got hired as a senior, and continually feeling underqualified has me stressed.

It’s a SWE role at a pretty well-known Web3 company with a more than 30% total comp increase (about 265k vs my current 200k) and it's fully remote. The only catch is it's likely going to be intense with tight sprints, and fast-paced. I heard that they have a culture where people typically stay 1–2 years before moving on. But it's definitely a good place to make money.My **c**urrent job has pretty good job security at a company that works for the G. If I were to be honest to myself, I only do about 5 hours of real work per day. I go to the office twice a week for 30 mins each way. There are downsides (occasional confusion from unstructured sprints, tedious work, little growth), but overall it’s comfortable. But if I leave this job, it's quite difficult to return if I ever regret.The thing is I’ve always had this itch and dream of building my own product or small business someday. My logic was that this comfortable job would give me the time and space to pursue that dream. But in realityI haven’t much, just a tiny bit. I’ve been spending my extra time moving places, doing hobbies, or just unwinding.It makes me question if I can even trust myself to use free time productively for a side business.

And if I leave, I get more money, growth, and momentum but likely lose my free time and might burn out kept thinking of not scratching my itch.I’m nearing 40 already, so I also think about whether I should be prioritising stability or taking one last big career leap while I still can while I'm starting a family at the same time.How should I even decide especially for the long term?",18,0.76,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nyhodb/should_i_take_up_a_30_pay_raise_or_stay_at_a/,2025-10-05 07:18:56,2025-10-08 01:25:45

Where I am at in my technology career is that I am a reputable programmer, known as a high performer, who is now being considered for leadership roles in our software product team of increasing responsibility. Because my previous roles had me at the intersection of business and technology, my goal (known by my management team) is to eventually transition to the ""business side"" of our team/very well known company. I know that ideally I need to get credentials other than an associates degree, given today's market. I’ve been pricing out a CS Bachelor's degree and the time it would take to finish... I’m looking at like 3.5 years and $65k. That’s a lot. While I was doing this, I ended up coming across an opportunity to complete a Master’s Degree in CS (it is a performance based admissions which accepts applicants w/o a bachelor’s) at a reputable, accredited school  (CU Boulder Online) for 1/2 the time and a fraction of the cost.I know that given my current career trajectory, having that Master's would be really helpful to me. I also have credits in business that are transferrable, and found out that I could get an online BS in business from WGU in a relatively short amount of time (less than one year). Would having a Master's degree in CS without a CS bachelor (instead bachelor would be in business) be a detriment to me in applying/changing jobs/getting my resume through an ATS system in the future for tech and related roles that I cannot think of at the moment?I am just afraid that not having the CS Bachelor would be a deterrent. I am over 30 and being able to do these degrees online and specifically have the technology degree being ""higher level"" to match my skill set, would make it a lot easier to get through.  I figured this is an OK strategy, but I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot…maybe someone can see a risk that I can't.Thank you!P.S. - Edited to add:  My friend who is a manager said that the Master's would be good for leveling up in our system, but that it could potentially exclude me from job reqs that require a BS in CS... so that is what has me nervous about going down this path. However, I have been seeing more job posts in our system for 'Bachelor's Degree' and it doesn't say any specific disipline, whereas before many of our postings would say Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or Higher/Equivalent Experince. Our company is also very open to people with 'different' backgrounds as long as they can 'prove' they have the skills to do the work. With this in mind, do you think purely getting the Master's is a determent (and BS in CS is better) or is it a worthwhile path to pursue to get the MS as I have already planned?

For midtier/startups, maybe 2%, with 5-10% of those getting offers? Of course this will vary based on school and prior experience, but does this sound about right on average? It confuses me seeing some people with experience/target schools apply to thousands and get 1 response while others with neither get 20 interviews out of 500 applications. Maybe a lot of the ones without much luck are international. Does anyone have anything to add?Bonus question: If you're really really good at leetcode, like top 2% and can solve pretty much any unseen medium/hard in 25 minutes, is this typically enough to get into big tech or at least upper-middle tech within a couple years with an average resume?",9,0.7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nz8p1z/does_anyone_know_roughly_what_percent_of/,2025-10-06 03:39:24,2025-10-08 01:25:45

However, of all the interests and hobbies I have, it's probably the one that engages me the least. I've been getting on my guitar playing, fiction writing, whatever. But with coding, it's like I can't just sit down and work on my projects. I've also found that I've been losing skills or knowledge over time. I've been going to school part time and forgetting stuff that I did a couple of years ago. I just feel so demotivated and dispassionate from sitting down to do Leetcode problems or something. I find myself unable to solve some of the most basic questions.I'm asking because I'm not sure if this is me just finding these uninteresting to solve, working in languages I'm not comfortable with, being out of 'the game' for awhile so to speak, or just slowly realizing that CS isn't for me. Which sucks because this was supposed to be my ticket into doing more interesting work that would also provide financial stability for me.

I also hear from recruiters that they get inundated with hundreds of applications per opening. It's easy to get discouraged hearing this but there might be nuisances to this. Perhaps the low response rates are due to lack of qualifications on the candidate's part (ie, newly grads applying for experienced roles), or maybe the market is tough for entry-level jobs but not as bad for experienced roles.

Here's some considerations:- My job right now is stable, at a well established company with little chances of being let go, but no room for salary or career growth.- The new job is performance based, and a new subsidiary of a bigger company so a bigger risk- The new job requires a skill set I'm a bit out of practice with so it will likely require a lot of hard work to get skilled up - The parent company is well funded and well established - New job is paying double what I'm making now with more potential for growth - I don't have kids, my expenses are reasonable, and I have savings and experience as a fallbackPlease let me know what you all think, thank you!",8,0.76,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o0nanr/leaving_a_stable_job_in_this_market_for_double/,2025-10-07 18:40:07,2025-10-08 01:25:45
1nxjplt,Moving into tech from risk,rhohodendron,cscareerquestions,"I went to a T10 university for undergrad and did applied math & economics, wanted to work in tech but graduated into a horrible market so decided to do a masters in CS (ML focused) afterwards at the same university, then graduated into an even worse market. Spent months looking for a job and eventually landed a job in model risk at the associate level at a T1 bank in NYC focused on AI/ML models. This *felt* tech-adjacent enough that, as someone who had been searching for a job for a long time, I felt like I was obligated to take it. So I did.The role is ok. Definitely boring, only a bit of coding but alot of looking at code. It's close enough to the models themselves that I feel like I'm maintaining my technical chops. But I'm realizing that being at a bank is just not for me and I want to do something closer to the action. I've only been here for a few months but I fully intend to try and leave model risk after a year or two at this job.Not gonna lie, I've been kind of spiraling a bit lately since I've been scared that I've already boxed myself into a risk/compliance archetype that'll make it impossible to pivot to anything more exciting. Part of this is just the fact that model risk is an area thats kind of unique to banks and thus less transferable, but my cope is that since I'm working with AI/ML models more than financial models, that makes me marginally more ""tech-adjacent"" if you will. Ideally I would land a role in as a PM or TPM in AI/Responsible AI, as those *feel* like more natural pivots than trying to immediately start coding full-time again, but I worry about how my background will be perceived.This is my first full time role. Maybe I'm just overestimating how rigid career trajectories and exit opportunities and those things are. I just don't wanna be stuck doing this for the rest of my life. Yeah it pays pretty well but it's not fulfilling or exciting.

Maybe it’s just my imposter syndrome kicking in but I feel like some of these things should be intuitive, like how will I fare in exams, interviews, etc.I’m even looking into internships for next summer and I feel like I’m not prepared at all to even apply",7,0.89,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nvlax5/i_feel_like_im_not_smart_enough_for_this/,2025-10-01 21:35:17,2025-10-08 01:25:45
1nvdh61,8-month internship at a big brand vs full-time full stack dev role,FlyingRenMa,cscareerquestions,"I just graduated and need some advice. I recently started a full-time full stack developer role, but I’m already thinking about my options. I also have 8 months of internship experience at a small company from school before.Here’s the situation:Option 1: Stay at my current full-time role•Permanent position.•Cons: The company culture is toxic, lots of overtime, and not the healthiest environment.•Pros: Full-time experience means my next job hunt will be easier. I’m planning to quit after about a year anyway.Option 2: Take an 8-month internship at a large, globally recognized tech company•Pros: Amazing brand name for my resume, structured learning environment, mentorship, and likely healthier culture. Could open doors for interviews at top tech companies.•Cons: Only 8 months, so I’d be back on the job market afterward. Since it’s an internship, I’d likely have to apply for junior-level roles again and we all know how the junior dev market is rn. Pay would be 20–25% less than my current full-time role. No guarantee of full-time conversion.My dilemma:•Staying at the full-time role gives continuous experience and a higher paycheck, but the culture is toxic and might burn me out.•Taking the internship gives brand recognition and a healthier environment, but I’d earn less and likely have to apply for junior roles again after 8 months.I don’t care much about money right now at the moment, so the decision is more about career trajectory, learning, and next-job opportunities.",5,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nvdh61/8month_internship_at_a_big_brand_vs_fulltime_full/,2025-10-01 16:47:43,2025-10-08 01:25:45

1nxg7or,What to consider for a Founding Engineer role?,SuhDudeGoBlue,cscareerquestions,"I’m a Senior/Lead MLOps Engineer based out of Chicago. I work about 40-50 hours a week at moderate intensity and high flexibility. I make 170-190k/yr in TC and have pretty decent benefits and expect to take about 40 days off this fiscal year when you combine PTO and paid holidays. I have been getting a lot of additional responsibility and have been experiencing quite a bit of solid growth, but compensation is not keeping up and probably won’t in the future. The company name also isn’t one that provides a lot of external credibility.I have a good buddy who is launching a start-up. He doesn’t have an experienced dev, and wants one. A bit of a unique situation since he is currently being backed by his (very wealthy) family (think assets north of 100 MM). If he was able to provide a 230-250k base plus equity role with a 6 month guarantee of job security or payout, would this be something that isn’t completely crazy? No relocation required and mostly remote for the foreseeable future.He’s working on a very interesting problem and I have been thinking a lot of joining a start-up, and this seems like a way to maybe do it in a somewhat safer way?What should I be thinking about?",3,0.64,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nxg7or/what_to_consider_for_a_founding_engineer_role/,2025-10-04 00:45:59,2025-10-08 01:25:45
