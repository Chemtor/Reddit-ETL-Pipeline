1ktpgcf,"New data engineer getting paid more than me, a senior DE",Yoyo_Baggins,dataengineering,"I found out that a new data engineer coming onto my team is making a few thousand more than me (a senior thats been with the company several years) annually, despite this new DE having less direct/applicable experience than me. Having to be a bit vague for obvious reasons. I have been a top individual contributor on my team every year. Every review I've received from management is overwhelmingly positive. This new DE and I are in the same geographic area, so thats not the explanation. How should I broach this with my management without: - revealing that I am 100% sure what this new DE is making, - threatening to leave if they don't up my pay, - getting myself on the short list for layoffsWe just finished our annual reviews. This pay disparity is even after I received a meager merit raise. Anyone else navigated this? Am I really going to have to company hop just to get paid a fair market salary? I want to stay at this company. I like what I do, but I also need more money to make ends meet.EDIT (copying a comment I left): I guess I should have said this in the original post, but I already tried this before our annual reviews. I provided evidence of my contribution, asked for a specific annual salary increase, and wanted it to be part of my annual increase which had a specific deadline. What I ended up getting was a bunch of excuses as to why it wasn't possible, empty promises of things they might be able to do for me later this year, and a meager merit raise well below inflation.So, to take your advice and many others here, sounds like I should just start looking elsewhere.",236,0.93,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ktpgcf/new_data_engineer_getting_paid_more_than_me_a/,2025-05-23 17:31:03,2025-05-27 01:40:25

I recently started as a junior DE.Say we have a simple pipeline that pulls data from Postgres and loads into a Snowflake table. If I want to make changes to it without a Dev environment - I might manually change the ""target"" table to a test table I've set up (maybe a clone of the target table), make updates, test, change code back to the real target table when happy, PR, and merge into the main branch of GitHub. I'm assuming this is what teams do that don't have a Dev environment?If I did have a Dev environment, what might the high level process look like? Would it make sense to:- have a Dev branch in GitHub- some sort of overnight sync to clone all target tables we work with to a Dev schema in Snowflake, using a mapping file of some sort - paramaterise all scripts so that when they're merged to Prod (Main) they are looking at the actual target tables, but in Dev they're looking at the the Dev (cloned) tables?

1kw25lj,"The skills no one teaches engineers: mindset, people smarts, and the books that rewired me",Eastern_Ticket2157,dataengineering,"I got laid off from Amazon after COVID when they outsourced our BI team to India and replaced half our workflow with automation. The ones who stayed weren’t better at SQL or Python - they just had better people skills. For two months, I applied to every job on LinkedIn and heard nothing. Then I stopped. I laid in bed, doomscrolled 5+ hours a day, and watched my motivation rot. I thought I was just tired. Then my girlfriend left me - and that cracked something open.In that heartbreak haze, I realized something brutal: I hadn’t grown in years. Since college, I hadn’t finished a single book - five whole years of mental autopilot. Meanwhile, some of my friends - people who foresaw the layoffs, the AI boom, the chaos - were now running startups, freelancing like pros, or negotiating raises with confidence. What did they all have in common? They never stop self growth and they read. Daily.So I ran a stupid little experiment: finish one book. Just one. I picked a memoir that mirrored my burnout. Then another. Then I tried a business book. Then a psychology one. I kept going. It’s been 7 months now, and I’m not the same person.Reading daily didn’t just help me “get smarter.” It reprogrammed how I think. My mindset, work ethic, even how I speak in interviews - it all changed. I want to share this in case someone else out there feels as stuck and brain-fogged as I did. You’re not lazy. You just need better inputs. Start feeding your mind again.As someone with ADHD, reading daily wasn’t easy at first. My brain wanted dopamine, not paragraphs. I’d reread the same page five times. That’s why these tools helped - they made learning actually stick, even on days I couldn’t sit still. Here’s what worked for me:- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: This book completely rewired how I think about wealth, happiness, and leverage. Naval’s mindset is pure clarity.- Principles by Ray Dalio: The founder of Bridgewater lays out the rules he used to build one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. It’s not just about work - it’s about how to think. Easily one of the most eye-opening books I’ve ever read.- Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins: NYT Bestseller. His brutal honesty about trauma and self-discipline lit a fire in me. This book will slap your excuses in the face.- Deep Work by Cal Newport: Productivity bible. Made me rethink how shallow my work had become. Best book on regaining focus in a distracted world.- The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel: Super digestible. Helped me stop making emotional money decisions. Best finance book I’ve ever read, period.Other tools & podcasts that helped - Lenny’s Newsletter: the best newsletter if you're in tech or product. Lenny (ex-Airbnb PM) shares real frameworks, growth tactics, and hiring advice. It's like free mentorship from a top-tier operator.- BeFreed: A friend who worked at Google put me on this. It’s a smart reading & book summary app that lets you customize how you read/listen: 10 min skims, 40 min deep dives, 20 min podcast-style explainers, or flashcards to help stuff actually stick. it also remembers your favs, highlights, goals and recommend books that best fit your goal. I tested it on books I’d already read and the deep dives covered ~80% of the key ideas. Now I finished 10+ books per month and I recommend it to all my friends who never had time or energy to read daily.- Ash: A friend told me about this when I was totally burnt out. It’s like therapy-lite for work stress - quick check-ins, calming tools, and mindset prompts that actually helped me feel human again.- The Tim Ferriss Show - podcast – Endless value bombs. He interviews top performers and always digs deep into their habits and books.Tbh, I used to think reading was just a checkbox for “smart” people. Now I see it as survival. It’s how you claw your way back when your mind is broken.If you’re burnt out, heartbroken, or just numb - don’t wait for motivation. Pick up any book that speaks to what you’re feeling. Let it rewire you. Let it remind you that people before you have already written the answers.You don’t need to figure everything out alone.

But the need — a simple, internal way to spin up data environments, turned out to be much more universal. Onyxia is now used by teams in Norway, at the UN, and in the US, among others.At its core, Onyxia is a web app (packaged as a Helm chart) that lets users log in (via OIDC), choose from a service catalog, configure resources (CPU, GPU, Docker image, env vars, launch script…), and deploy to their own K8s namespace.Highlights:- Admin-defined service catalog using Helm charts + `values.schema.json` → Onyxia auto-generates dynamic UI forms.- Native S3 integration with web UI and token-based access. Files uploaded through the browser are instantly usable in services.- Vault-backed secrets injected into running containers as env vars.- One-click links for launching preconfigured setups (widely used for teaching or onboarding).- DuckDB-Wasm file viewer for exploring large parquet/csv/json files directly in-browser.- Full white label theming, colors, logos, layout, even injecting custom JS/CSS.There’s a public instance at [datalab.sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) for French students, teachers, and researchers, running on real compute (including H100 GPUs).If your org is trying to build an internal alternative to Databricks or Workbench-style setups — without vendor lock-in, curious to hear your take.",41,0.92,18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvpNfVrxBFM,2025-05-21 09:21:39,2025-05-27 01:40:25

1ktkqj6,Modular Data Pipeline (Microservices + Delta Lake) for Live ETAs – Architecture Review of La Poste’s Case,Typical-Scene-5794,dataengineering,"In a recent blog, the team at La Poste (France’s postal service) shared how they redesigned their real-time package tracking pipeline from a monolithic app into a modular microservice architecture. The goal was to provide more accurate ETA predictions for deliveries while making the system easier to scale and monitor in production. They describe splitting the pipeline into multiple decoupled stages (using Pathway – an open-source streaming ETL engine) connected via Delta Lake storage and Kafka. This revamped design not only improved performance and reliability, but also significantly cut costs (the blog cites a 50% reduction in total cost of ownership for the IoT data platform and a projected 16% drop in fleet capital expenditures, which is huge). Below I’ll outline the architecture, key decisions, and trade-offs from the blog in an engineering-focused way.From Monolith to Microservices: Originally, a single streaming pipeline handled everything: data cleansing, ETA calculation, and maybe some basic monitoring. That monolith worked for a prototype, but it became hard to extend – for instance, adding continuous evaluation of prediction accuracy or integrating new models would make the one pipeline much more complex and fragile. The team decided to decouple the concerns into separate pipelines (microservices) that communicate through shared data layers. This is analogous to breaking a big application into microservices – here each Pathway pipeline is a lightweight service focused on one part of the workflow.They ended up with four main pipeline components:1. Data Acquisition & Cleaning: Ingest raw telemetry from delivery vehicles and clean it. IoT devices on trucks emit location updates (latitude/longitude, speed, timestamp, etc.) to a Kafka topic. This first pipeline reads from Kafka, applies a schema, and filters out bad data (e.g. GPS (0,0) errors, duplicates, out-of-order events). The cleaned, normalized data is then written to a Delta Lake table as the “prepared data” store. Delta Lake was used here to persist the stream in a queryable table format (every incoming event gets appended as a new row). This makes the downstream processing simpler and the intermediate data reusable. (Notably, they chose Delta Lake over something like chaining another Kafka topic for the clean data – a design choice we’ll discuss more below.)2. ETA Prediction: This stage consumes two things – the cleaned vehicle data (from that Delta table) and incoming ETA requests. ETA request events come as another stream (Kafka topic) containing a delivery request ID, the target destination, the assigned vehicle ID, and a timestamp. The topic is partitioned by vehicle ID so all requests for the same vehicle are ordered (ensuring the sequence of stops is handled correctly). The Pathway pipeline joins each request with the latest state of the corresponding vehicle from the clean data, then computes an estimated arrival time. The blog kept the prediction logic straightforward (e.g., basically using current location to estimate travel time to the destination), since the focus was architecture. The important part is that this service is stateless with respect to historical data – it relies on the up-to-date clean data table as its source of truth for vehicle positions. Once an ETA is computed for a request, the result is written out to two places: a Kafka topic (so that whoever requested the ETA gets the answer in real-time) and another Delta Lake table storing all predictions (for later analysis).3. Ground Truth Extraction: This pipeline waits for deliveries to actually be completed, so they can record the real arrival times (“ground truth” data for model evaluation). It reads the same prepared data table (vehicle telemetry) and the requests stream/table to know what destinations were expected. The logic here tracks each vehicle’s journey and identifies when a vehicle has reached the delivery location for a request (and has no further pending deliveries for that request). When it detects a completed delivery, it logs the actual time of arrival for that specific order. Each of these actual arrival records is written to a ground-truth Delta Lake table. This component runs asynchronously from the prediction one – an order might be delivered 30 minutes after the prediction was made, but by isolating this in its own service, the system can handle that naturally without slowing down predictions. Essentially, the ground truth job is doing a continuous join between live positions and the list of active delivery requests, looking for matches to signal completion.4. Evaluation & Monitoring: The final stage joins the predictions with their corresponding ground truths to measure accuracy. It reads from the predictions Delta table and the ground truths table, linking records by request ID (each record pairs a predicted arrival time with the actual arrival time for a delivery). The pipeline then computes error metrics. For example, it can calculate the difference in minutes between predicted and actual delivery time for each order. These per-delivery error records are extremely useful for analytics – the blog mentions calculating overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and also segmenting error by how far in advance the prediction was made (predictions made closer to the delivery tend to be more accurate). Rather than hard-coding any specific aggregation in the pipeline, the approach was to output the raw prediction-vs-actual data into a PostgreSQL database (or even just a CSV file), and then use external tools or dashboards for deeper analysis and alerting. By doing so, they keep the streaming pipeline focused and let data analysts iterate on metrics in a familiar environment. (One cool extension: because everything is modular, they can add an alerting microservice that monitors this error data stream in real-time – e.g. trigger a Slack alert if error spikes – without impacting the other components.)Key Architectural Decisions:Decoupling via Delta Lake Tables: A standout decision was to connect these microservice pipelines using Delta Lake as the intermediate store. Instead of passing intermediate data via queues or Kafka topics, each stage writes its output to a durable table that the next stage reads. For example, the clean telemetry is a Delta table that both the Prediction and Ground Truth services read from. This has several benefits in a data engineering context:Data Reusability & Observability: Because intermediate results are in tables, it’s easy to query or snapshot them at any time. If predictions look off, engineers can examine the cleaned data table to trace back anomalies. In a pure streaming hand-off (e.g. Kafka topic chaining), debugging would be harder – you’d have to attach consumers or replay logs to inspect events. Here, Delta gives a persistent history you can query with Spark/Pandas, etc.Multiple Consumers: Many pipelines can read the same prepared dataset in parallel. The La Poste use case leveraged this to have two different processes (prediction and ground truth) independently consuming the prepared\_data table. Kafka could also multicast to multiple consumers, but those consumers would each need to handle data cleaning or maintaining state. With the Delta approach, the heavy lifting (cleaning) is done once and all consumers get a consistent view of the results.Failure Recovery: If one pipeline crashes or needs to be redeployed, the downstream pipelines don’t lose data – the intermediate state is stored in Delta. They can simply pick up from the last processed record by reading the table. There’s less worry about Kafka retention or exactly-once delivery mechanics between services, since the data lake serves as a reliable buffer and single source of truth.Of course, there are trade-offs. Writing to a data lake introduces some latency (micro-batch writes of files) compared to an in-memory event stream. It also costs storage – effectively duplicating data that in a pure streaming design might be transient. The blog specifically calls out the issue of many small files: frequent Delta commits (especially for high-volume streams) create lots of tiny parquet files and transaction log entries, which can degrade read performance over time. The team mitigated this by partitioning the Delta tables (e.g. by date) and periodically compacting small files. Partitioning by a day or similar key means new data accumulates in a separate folder each day, which keeps the number of files per partition manageable and makes it easier to run vacuum/compaction on older partitions. With these maintenance steps (partition + compact + clean old metadata), they report that the Delta-based approach remains efficient even for continuous, long-running pipelines. It’s a case of trading some complexity in storage management for a lot of flexibility in pipeline design.Schema Management & Versioning: With data passing through tables, keeping schemas in sync became an important consideration. If the schema of the cleaned data table changes (say they add a new column from the IoT feed), then the downstream Pathway jobs reading that table must be updated to expect that schema. The blog notes this as an increased maintenance overhead compared to a monolith. They likely addressed it by versioning their data schemas and coordinating deployments – e.g. update the writing pipeline to add new columns in parallel with updating readers, or use schema evolution features of Delta Lake. On the plus side, using Delta Lake made some aspects of schema handling easier: Pathway automatically stores each table’s schema in the Delta log, so when a job reads the table it can fetch the schema and apply it without manual definitions. This reduces code duplication and errors. Still, any intentional schema changes require careful planning across multiple services. This is just the nature of microservices – you gain modularity at the cost of more coordination.Independent Scaling & Fault Isolation: A big reason for the microservice approach was scalability and reliability in production. Each pipeline can be scaled horizontally on its own. For example, if ETA requests volume spikes, they could scale out just the Prediction service (Pathway supports parallel processing within a job as well, but logically separating it is an extra layer of scalability). Meanwhile, the data cleaning service might be CPU-bound and need its own scaling considerations, separate from the evaluation service which might be lighter. In a monolithic pipeline, you’d have to scale the whole thing as one unit, even if only one part is the bottleneck. By splitting them, only the hot spots get more resources. Likewise, if the evaluation pipeline fails due to, say, a bug or out-of-memory error, it doesn’t bring down the ingestion or prediction pipelines – they keep running and data accumulates in the tables. The ops team can fix and redeploy the evaluation job and catch up on the stored data. This isolation is crucial for a production system where you want to minimize downtime and avoid one component’s failure cascading into an outage of the whole feature.Pipeline Extensibility: The modular design also opened up new capabilities with minimal effort. The case study highlights a few:They can easily plug in an anomaly detection/alerting service that reads the continuous error metrics (from the evaluation stage) and sends notifications if something goes wrong (e.g., if predictions suddenly become very inaccurate, indicating a possible model issue or data drift).They can do offline model retraining or improvement by leveraging the historical data collected. Since they’re storing all cleaned inputs and outcomes, they have a high-quality dataset to train next-generation models. The blog mentions using the accumulated Delta tables of inputs and ground truths to experiment with improved prediction algorithms offline.They can perform A/B testing of prediction strategies by running two prediction pipelines in parallel. For example, run the current model on half the vehicles and a new model on a subset of vehicles (perhaps by partitioning the Kafka requests by transport\_unit\_id hash). Because the infrastructure supports multiple pipelines reading the same input and writing results, this is straightforward – you just add another Pathway service, maybe writing its predictions to a different topic/table, and compare the evaluation metrics in the end. In a monolithic system, A/B testing could be really cumbersome or require building that logic into the single pipeline. Operational Insights: On the operations side, the team did have to invest in coordinated deployments and monitoring for multiple services. There are four Pathway processes to deploy (plus Kafka, plus maybe the Delta Lake storage on S3 or HDFS, and the Postgres DB for results). Automated deploy pipelines and containerization likely help here (the blog doesn’t go deep into it, but it’s implied that there’s added complexity). Monitoring needs to cover each component’s health as well as end-to-end latency. The payoff is that each component is simpler by itself and can be updated or rolled back independently. For instance, deploying a new model in the Prediction service doesn’t require touching the ingestion or evaluation code at all – reducing risk. The scaling benefits were already mentioned: Pathway allows configuring parallelism for each pipeline, and because of the microservice separation, they only scale the parts that need it. This kind of targeted scaling can be more cost-efficient.The La Poste case is a compelling example of applying software engineering best practices (modularity, fault isolation, clear data contracts) to a streaming data pipeline. It demonstrates how breaking a pipeline into microservices can yield significant improvements in maintainability and extensibility for data engineering workflows. Of course, as the authors caution, this isn’t a silver bullet – one should adopt such complexity only when the benefits (scaling, flexibility, etc.) outweigh the overhead. In their scenario of continuously improving an ETA prediction service, the trade-off made sense and paid off.I found this architecture interesting, especially the use of Delta Lake as a communication layer between streaming jobs – it’s a hybrid approach that combines real-time processing with durable data lake storage. It raises some great discussion points: e.g., would you have used message queues (Kafka topics) between each stage instead, and how would that compare? How do others handle schema evolution across pipeline stages in production? The post provides a concrete case study to think about these questions. If you want to dive deeper or see code snippets of how Pathway implements these connectors (Kafka read/write, Delta Lake integration, etc.), I recommend checking out the original blog and the Pathway GitHub.

We also want to enable chat searches, and since search will inevitably lead to random chats, we want that perf to be consistently excellent.We are planning to use Django (with channels) as our backend. What database is recommended to use with Django to persist the messages? I read that Discord used to use Cassandra, but then it started acting up due to garbage collection, so they switched rto Scylla, and they are very happy with trillions of messages on it. Is ScyllDB a good candidate for our purpose to use with Django? Do these two work together well?

1kut9e6,Ideas on how to handle deeply nested json files,BlueAcronis,dataengineering,"My application is distributed across several AWS accounts, and it writes logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in the `.json.gz` format. These logs are streamed using a subscription filter to a centralized Kinesis Data Stream, which is then connected to a Kinesis Data Firehose.

The difficulty arises because the JSON files are deeply nested (up to four levels deep) as shown in the example below. I would like to hear suggestions on how to handle this. I have tested Lambda Transformations but I am getting errors since my json is 12x longer than that. I wonder if Kinesis Firehose can handle that without any coding.

I’d like to do something similar via an API: the user sends input like `{col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}` to an endpoint, and the API returns the output of the dbt model (e.g., `{out_col_1: ""out_val_1"", out_col_2: ""out_val_2""}`), having used that input as the data behind `ref('input_model_or_data')`.What’s the recommended way to do something like this?",9,0.91,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kr1azg/how_to_build_an_api_on_top_of_a_dbt_model/,2025-05-20 10:15:49,2025-05-27 01:40:25

I also wrote some APIs for the db to pull schema data, active/recently retired listings, etc. I'm at an impasse with what to do next. I am considering three paths:1.

Frontend would consist of a Django/Flask interface that shows active dog listings and/or links to a Tableau dashboard that displays data on old listings of dogs who have since left the shelter.2. Refactor my code with PySpark. Right now I'm storing data in basic Pandas dataframes so that I can clean them and push them to a single Azure PostgreSQL node. It's a fairly small animal shelter, so I'm only handling up to 80-100 records a day, but refactoring would at least prove Spark skills.3.

1ktn8tv,Should I switch teams? Manager limiting my growth opportunities,eatdrinksleepp,dataengineering,"Background: I’m on a support data engineering team and have recently been working on a full stack project that helped me learn new tools and skills that I was really interested in. I really enjoyed the work and felt like I was growing in the right direction. I also expressed my interest in this work with my manager and he said he would forward any similar projects to me as they come. The issue: However, now my manager seems to have changed his mind and told me that any future full stack opportunities will go to other team members instead of me because “I’ve had enough.” His reasoning is that projects should rotate through the team members one by one before coming back to me. While I understand wanting to give everyone opportunities, this feels like it’s limiting my ability to build expertise and grow in areas where I’m performing well.I’m also sensing some tension from teammates who seem to think I’m being “greedy” for wanting to continue with this type of work, even though I’m just trying to advance my career like anyone else would.My question: I’m considering talking to the director of data engineering about potentially switching to a different team that focuses more on core data engineering work rather than support. Is this a reasonable move, or should I try to work things out with my current manager first?Additional context:- I’ve been doing well in the full stack/data engineering work and it aligns with my career goals- This seems to be part of a broader pattern where I feel like growth opportunities are being limited- The team culture feels like it discourages ambition or self-advocacyHas anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?TL;DR: Manager is rotating opportunities away from me after I had success with a project. Considering switching teams.

1kvbr5b,"Learning About GCP BigQuery Table Schema - Please help me understand the real world use cases of when and how often you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" and ""normalized relational schema"" when constructing your GCP BigQuery tables.",Original_Chipmunk941,dataengineering,"**Question:**I am currently learning Google Cloud Platform for data engineering. I learned that there are three types of schemas that I can use when constructing tables in BigQuery: 1) Normalized relational schema, 2) Nested & Repeating Schema, 3) Denormalized schema. I am trying to understand when I will realistically use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" instead of ""normalized relational schema"" for the tables that I construct in BigQuery.Please answer both of these questions below:1. When do you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" over ""normalized relational schema"" when you construct tables in BigQuery?2. When constructing tables within BigQuery data warehouses, how often do you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema""? How often do you use ""normalized relational schema""? If possible, please provide me a ballpark percentage (Ex. 40% Nested & Repeating Schema vs. 60% normalized relational schema). **My Current Rationale:**I understand that BigQuery is a columnar oriented database. I learned that ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" is a more cost-effective for querying and more efficient than ""normalized relational schema"". However, even after researching it, I do not fully understand the real life advantages of ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" over a ""normalized relational schema"".Although ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" is more efficient and cost-effective for querying, I think a ""normalized relational schema"" makes more sense because it allows you to update records more easily like a traditional SQL RDBMS.I understand that columnar oriented databases are great when your historical data within the BigQuery table does not change. However, from my experience on working as a data analyst, historical data frequently needs to change. For example, lets say you have an external OLTP RDBMS that feeds into BigQuery daily. This external OLTP RDBMS contains a table named sales data. This table contains a column named ""Member Status"" and returns either one of two outputs: ""Active"" or ""Inactive"". ""Member ID"" 123456 has a ""Member Status"" of ""Active"". The data for that daily load is sent from the external OLTP RDBMS to the BigQuery table containing the data of ""Member ID"" 123456 with a ""Member Status"" of ""Active"". Three months later, the ""Member Status"" of ""Member ID"" 123456 changes to ""Inactive"" within the external OLTP RDBMS.From my understanding, now I cannot change that data easily within the BigQuery table if it has ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" . If my BigQuery table had ""normalized relational schema"", it should be able to update the ""Member Status"" of ""Member ID"" 123456 very easily.This is my rationale on why I think a ""normalized relational schema"" is better than ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" for the majority of real world use cases. Please let me know if you agree, disagree, etc. I would love to hear your thoughts. I am still learning GCP and data engineering.

Each table has a different schema, so I'm avoiding creating a data frame that could include extra irrelevant schemas for my tables rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(offset_tuple_list) fetch_rdd = rdd.flatMap(lambda tuple:get_data(tuple,extraction_date,token)).cache() ## filter RDD per table invoices_rdd = fetch_rdd.filter(lambda row: row[""table""] == ""Invoices"") purchaseOrders_rdd = fetch_rdd.filter(lambda row: row[""table""] == ""PurchaseOrders"") ## convert it to json for automatic schema inference by read.json invoices_json_rdd = invoices_rdd.map(lambda row: json.dumps(row)) purchaseOrders_json_rdd = purchaseOrders_rdd.map(lambda row: json.dumps(row)) invoices_df = spark.read.json(invoices_json_rdd) purchaseOrders_df = spark.read.json(purchaseOrders_json_rdd)I'm using cache() to avoid multiple API calls and do it only once. My problem is that caching won't work for me if **invoices\_df and purchaseOrders\_df** are running by different executors. If they are run on the same executor then one takes 3 min and the other a few seconds, since it uses the cache(). If not both take 3 min + 3 min = 6min calling API twice. This behaviour is random, sometimes it runs on separate executors and I can see locality becomes RACK\_LOCAL instead of PROCESS\_LOCAL Any idea how I can make all executors use the same cached RDD?",2,0.67,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ktqbov/sharing_cache_between_spark_executors_possible/,2025-05-23 18:06:20,2025-05-27 01:40:25

Query the output, see what's missing, then process that. Seems simple, but has scalability limitations because you need to list the entire history. Would need to query both GCS and BQ to compare what files are still missing.2. Have some external system or work queue that keeps track of incomplete work. Scales better, but has the potential to go out of sync with reality (e.g. if Extract fails to write to the work queue, the file is never transformed or loaded).I suppose this is a common problem that everyone has solved already.

1kv520y,Decentralised vs distributed architecture for ETL batches,Historical_Ad4384,dataengineering,"Hi,We are a traditional software engineering team having sole experience in developing web services so far using Java with Spring Boot. We now have a new requirement in our team to engineer data pipelines that comply with standard ETL batch protocol. Since our team is well equipped in working with Java and Spring Boot, we want to continue using this tech stack to establish our ETL batches. We do not want to pivot away from our regular tech stack for ETL requirements. We found Spring Batch helps us to establish ETL compliant batches without introducing new learning friction or $ costs.Now comes the main pain point that is dividing our team politically. Some team members are advocating towards decentralised scripts that are knowledgeable enough to execute independently as a standard web service in tandem with a local cron template to perform their concerned function and operated manually by hand on each of our horizontally scaled infrastructure. Their only argument is that it prevents a single point of failure without caring for the overheads of a batch manager. While the other part of the team wants to use the remote partitioning job feature from a mature batch processing framework (Spring Batch for example) to achieve the same functionality as of the decentralized cron driven script but in a distributed fashion over our already horizontally scaled infrastructure to have more control on the operational concerns of the execution. Their argument is deep observability, easier run and restarts, efficient cron synchronisation over different timezones and servers while risking a single point of failure.We have a single source of truth that contains the infrastructure metadata of all servers where the batch jobs would execute so leveraging it within a batch framework makes more sense IMO to dynamically create remote partitions to execute our ETL process.I would like to get your views on what would be the best approach to handle the implementation and architectural nature of our ETL use case?We have a downstream data warehouse already in place for our ETL use case to write data but its managed by a different department so we can't directly integrate into it but have to do it with a non industry standard company wide red tape bureaucratic process but this is a story for another day.",3,0.81,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kv520y/decentralised_vs_distributed_architecture_for_etl/,2025-05-25 15:20:26,2025-05-27 01:40:25

1kvsdt5,How does create or replace table work exactly in BigQuery (table got deleted in STG using DBT),Daniearp,dataengineering,"So first of all, it's not ""urgent"", this happened in a non prod environment, while running tests.I don't know if DBT did this or if it was me hitting the task on airflow to run a model two times in a row.We have an airflow connected to DBT using astronomer. One of our models is a simple materialized = table model.I was testing some changes in it and hit the clear task in airflow, maybe I did it twice, I don't know. But checking the BigQuery job logs, I can see that the query was tried two times, within 20 seconds of each other, this particular query takes around 1 minute to run, but this change I made had a partitioning error, so it failed very quickly with error **\[PARTITION BY expression must be DATE() etc...\]**. timestamps for creation and end time for both queries were:|| || |2025-05-25 13:00:35.436000 UTC|2025-05-25 13:00:36.598000 UTC ||| || |2025-05-25 13:00:55.847000 UTC|2025-05-25 13:00:56.810000 UTC |The table definitely existed previous to 2025-05-25 13:00:35.436000 UTC, we test on it all the time. I went to check the table in stg today and it doesn't exist anymore.I don't know if it matters but the SA that uses DBT was also running other jobs/queries in bigquery, non related to dbt, but those other jobs started 1 minute after my DBT queries were tried, probably doesn't affect this whole thing.My questions are:1. **how on earth did this happen? Is it possible that during CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE the table was dropped and not recreated, because of the invalidQuery? How does CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE work under the hood?**2. **Can I recover a deleted table like this in the future? I worry about this happening in PRD environment - I don't need to recover this one, I can just re run the DBT model with the correct partition and it's fine, after all it's a materialized = table model and I have the data to repopulate it. I worry about this happening on incremental models in the future, though.**Thanks in advance!EDIT: I found out that, a few milliseconds before the CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE took place, there was a delete request (saw it in the log explorer), by the same service account that DBT uses, I'm assuming DBT did this?

1kujmka,New to programming? Don't fall for the myth of the genius programmer.,Loremporium,learnprogramming,"This was a video from Google I/O way back in 2009 that I still think about it to this day. It discusses the way we hide our work, our questions, and our projects until one day we just showcase something amazing that built, first try, no errors, ya know because we're geniuses.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ) The talk was hosted by Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman, in which they give this introductory description of the talk:""A pervasive elitism hovers in the background of collaborative software development: everyone secretly wants to be seen as a genius. In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration. We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.""One part that resonated with me greatly was regarding the human developer. ""I will toil in this cave and no one will know this code exists until it is perfect, at which point I will emerge and be recognized for the genius I am."" On reddit, have you ever done some quick research before clicking that ""post"" button, out of concern you may be wrong or fearful of backlash? Same concept.The consequence of this (among others) is that neither your team nor the newer generation of programmers will get to see all of the failure you had to endure, to achieve that one cool thing, because of the way we want to be viewed. Enduring those failures and overcoming them, I believe, is more important then, and required by, any programming language, framework, tool, etc.Newcomers have all the resources, AI, and work previous generations have accomplished to look up to but we are doing those people a disservice by hiding our failures due to human emotion wether thats how we want to be viewed or general fear of negative feedback from our work.Hopefully this doesn't offend anyone or become divisive, it's just some unspoken honesty that I have appreciation for and it stuck with me because honestly... it hit close to home when I saw it back then.",687,0.96,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kujmka/new_to_programming_dont_fall_for_the_myth_of_the/,2025-05-24 19:23:24,2025-05-27 01:40:26

I don’t play games, don’t use social media, don’t waste time. I stopped talking to friends to avoid distractions. YouTube and AI chatbots are my only source of learning and motivation.I started with C++ via BroCode, then jumped to PHP (watched freeCodeCamp playlist), then to JavaScript.

But I don’t ship projects, or try freelancing because I feel like “it’s not good enough.”Before tech, I worked jobs in hotels (cashier, counter helper), and I even did graphic design, video editing, 2D/3D animation.

But the backend takes the cross site request, runs the request, and sends a proper response like how it would do for a genuine request. so now I don't understand what if [bank.com](http://bank.com) has some endpoint like /sendmoney, that returns success or failure. and [evil.com](http://evil.com) makes cross site request to that endpoint. Will the backend still execute the /sendmoney? what I understand is, backend does the work and returns response, then browser blocks [evil.com](http://evil.com) from seeing the response(which doesnt matter in this case).so if this is how it works, CORS is to stop [evil.com](http://evil.com) from only viewing resources/responses of [bank.com](http://bank.com) it wont stop from making it hit some endpoints?I have read about CSRF tokens.

1ksjv0u,"Feeling lost in tech. Burned out, falling behind, and scared I’ll stay mediocre forever.",idk-who-you-are,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I’m 22 and about to graduate with a Master’s in Computer Applications. I don’t have a job yet, and honestly, I feel completely stuck and left behind.When I was 14, I found out about software engineering after my neighbor moved to the US. That lit a fire in me—I started dreaming of becoming a great engineer, moving abroad, doing something meaningful. I pushed hard through 9th and 10th grades believing that hard work now would lead to success later.Then the lockdown hit just as I entered my Bachelor's. I learned a bit of programming, but I also wasted a lot of time—watching movies, helping at home, and losing direction.In 2022, I tried learning web development. I got a job I didn’t enjoy, then an internship where I couldn’t perform well. I tried React, but it felt overwhelming. Since then, I’ve bounced between DSA, frontend, Golang, and trying to build projects—but nothing sticks. Most projects remain unfinished. I’m not proud of anything I’ve built.I try starting projects, but I lose interest after two or three days. The initial excitement fades quickly, and I struggle to push through once things get repetitive or challenging. I feel stuck in a loop—excited to begin, but unable to finish. This keeps happening, and it kills my confidence even more.Now it’s 2025, and I feel like I’ve lost the **curiosity and excitement** that got me into tech in the first place. Programming doesn’t excite me anymore—it feels like just another boring subject I’m forcing myself through. I accept that YouTube and social media made tech look glamorous, and I got pulled into that version. But now I realize—it’s only fulfilling if you truly love the work.I have a short attention span. I give up easily when I hit bugs. I don’t learn frameworks or concepts as fast as I think I should. I feel like I’m not cut out for this.The worst part? I’m scared I’ll be stuck as someone mediocre forever. I lie awake at night thinking, *What if I’m falling behind in this race? What if I missed the boat? What if I end up like someone who fell out during the dot-com bubble and never recovered?*Meanwhile, I see people younger than me building amazing things, earning well, learning fast. It crushes me.My family—especially my parents and older brother—are amazing and supportive. They never pressure me, but I know deep down they want me to start earning. A few days ago, my mom quietly said, *“I thought you’d do something to change things at home, but you couldn’t.”* That sentence shattered me. I want to help them financially and emotionally. But I haven’t earned a single **dime** yet.I’ve been cold-emailing founders, CTOs, and employees on LinkedIn, and applying to jobs almost every day—but I keep getting rejections or no responses at all. It’s disheartening.Sometimes, I want to give up. But I also don’t want to. There’s still a small part of me that wants to break through, to build something meaningful, and to prove to myself that I *can* do it.I want to make it in tech. I want to be good at it. I still dream of building cool products and figuring out how things work. But I just don’t know how to keep going when everything feels overwhelming. I want to feel motivated again. I want to believe it’s not too late for me.Lately, I’ve been interested in backend development, but I know frontend is important too—and after failing so many times at it, frontend feels boring and intimidating. Starting again feels stupid and exhausting.Sorry if I sound like a complaint box or just another burnt-out CS guy. I just needed to get this off my chest.If anyone has been through this—or made it out of this kind of mental/emotional/technical rut—please let me know: **How do you stay consistent when your confidence is shattered?** **How do you bring back the excitement and curiosity for tech?** **How do you stop feeling like a failure?**Thanks for reading.**TL;DR:** 22, finishing MCA. Lost interest and motivation in programming. Tried web dev, Go, DSA—nothing sticks. Projects remain incomplete. Haven’t earned a dime yet. Family is supportive but I feel like I’ve let them down. Programming feels boring now; glamorized YouTube content pulled me in. I’m cold emailing founders, CTOs, employees and applying for jobs—but facing rejections. I’m scared of falling behind forever.

1kumill,"When You're Great at Programming, But You Suck at Programming",Voxmanns,learnprogramming,"In my 10 years so far with tech, I have had the absolute pleasure to work alongside some brilliantly talented and well educated programmers. However, I have seen those same developers have their arguments and perspectives fall flat, despite their technical prowess, while less technically gifted minds withhold tremendously valuable ideas for fear of being caught on a technicality or unknown detail.TL;DR - We are taught that cleanliness and efficiency of code is the earmark of a quality solution. While important, we fail to educate programmers on the importance of factors beyond the code and how to navigate the complexity and priorities of a real application. This post is for anyone who is truly curious about what ""good code"" really means, and for those who suspect the answer has more to do with the problems you solve than the language you use to do it.**Introduction**Goodhart's Law - ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.""I think most of us have experienced those often frustrating debates between programmers where one is claiming the other has an inferior approach because ""I could write it faster by doing x."" or ""I could write it with less complexity by doing y.""My goal with this post is to primarily open up discussion around this topic and hopefully provide something valuable from my 10 years of doing software development.Before I dig in, I think it's only fair to say where I come from. I have worked the last 10 years in cloud development, working with a lot of different SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS technologies. I have dabbled a LITTLE in hardware and lower level languages - but never really had to do much in terms of deploying code for a new piece of hardware and have, admittedly, been a bit spoiled on not having to deal with things like managing pointers or resolving memory errors at a lower level. However, what I want to talk about should be a fair bit removed from that level of granularity and speaks more to how we as programmers approach a problem. That being said, I have worked as an admin using declarative tools, managed code bases of several million lines, and successfully implemented several medium and large scale system architectures in my time. That is to say, I've seen a lot of shit in the last decade.**Conflating personal skills with solution quality**With the preface out of the way, let me put my assertion straight. I see a lot of programmers conflating their proficiency with coding (speed to write code, initial resilience of code, complexity mitigation, readability, testability, etc.) as a reflection of solution quality. It is a frequent and concerning problem that many programmers are taught or conclude that the quality of how the code is written is above the functionality of the existing application.For clarity, I am not saying that things like readability are irrelevant to the measurement of a solution's quality. Of course, all other things equal, a solution with more readable code is a better solution than the same with less readable code. What I am saying is that the actual influence of these metrics varies depending on the environment and context of the implemented solution.For example, a small scale and local utility (such as a simple script for managing files in a folder) does not gain nearly as much proportional benefit from more readable code as a large scale ETL job managed by multiple people from multiple teams working in multiple frameworks. We could deliberate endlessly on what the ""correct"" weighting of these metrics are for any given project, but the real issue is when these metrics become surrogates for the strategic goal of the application.The reality is that, when it comes down to the application running and doing its job, the only thing that matters is how well it does its job: How efficiently does it succeed when it is provided valid inputs, how effectively does it recover from unexpected inputs/results, and how safely does it fail in the event of an unrecoverable error?Nobody cares that you made it super readable if it doesn't work. Nobody cares that you wrote it faster if it's laden with bugs. No one is happy that you reduced 30 lines to 2 lines if it makes the application a total resource hog. Similarly, nobody cares if it runs 500ms faster UNLESS that 500ms makes a difference in the grand scheme of the tech.Simply put, there is an important and clear distinction between your skills as a programmer, and the quality of the solution you produce. While your technical skills as a programmer are EXTREMELY important, they do not necessarily ensure that the solutions you produce are quality solutions. It's a mistake I have seen a lot of developers make, and it leaves them bewildered because they felt they did everything right. It reminds me of the classic Indiana Jones scene when Jones simply shoots the guy showing off all his fancy moves. It looks cool, super impressive, but totally useless in the wrong context.**Programming and solution quality is impacted by the real world and supporting relationships.**""I would've never written it this way. They could've easily done x to make this better.""We've all felt that way at least once. You are SO blessed to finally work on that bit of code that hasn't been touched in 25 years just to find it is such a convoluted mess of outdated checks, redundant assignments, tightly coupled classes, et al. The feat of the developers goes from ""This is really nice and sensible code that I can work with."" to ""How the hell did the last guy keep this thing running at all?""This sentiment that you would've done it better by doing it your way is almost always a lie you're telling yourself. Here's why:Programming, as we all hopefully understand by now, is an iterative process. That means to reach your ideal state, you necessarily cannot jump from step 0 to the final step. There are checkpoints you must cross in order to get there. However, these checkpoints are marked by the application's functionality, and the structure/ease of the code is loosely implied by the business/client at best.In other words, the developer will always be pressured to produce functional code over ""clean"" code. I am not referring to the actual principles of Clean Code necessarily, just whatever your idea of the ""right way to write the code"" is.This means that leading into these checkpoints, there are always unanswered questions and missing pieces of context that we wish we would have had in the beginning. I just recently was working on a report generation tool for a friend when, just a week before we needed it to be done, they decided to clarify that certain parts of the report needed to have dynamic labeling and columns when we had already understood them as static elements. As you can imagine, that's a totally different approach than I had originally planned for. With not enough time to totally rewrite the program, I had a choice:1. Quickly refactor the code, accept that it'll be a bit messy, defer proper restructuring, happy client because it works.2. Ask for an extension to the deadline, customer misses their reporting window, blame them for not being clear and not knowing that information at the beginning?I, of course, asked for the extension. They, of course, denied the request. So, I went with option 1. Why? Because the relationship was more valuable to me than the structure of my code. I will absolutely take on a bit of a messier solution on the backend to secure another future project and ensure the client is happy **in this scenario**.That's not to say it's always the right answer. I have refused to deploy changes that were of security or regulatory concern because not going to jail was more important than winning another project. I'm not even saying I am always right in which options I take for these situations. My point, as highlighted by the title of this section, is that the world around the application matters a LOT. Assuming you would have done it better without knowing all of the context for why those decisions were made is not only unfair to the previous developers, but is simply a conclusion driven by ego.Tying this back to our main theme, you are measuring the quality of the solution based on metrics which are not the goal. The goal was a functional app that satisfied the defined requirements within the allotted timeline. That's it.**Programmers have limitations. It's okay to not be a superhuman.**I'm going to pivot the focus a bit and talk more about you - the programmer. I'm not going to say that every programmer is an antisocial basement dweller who would never suffer the presence of another human being or (God-forbid) a team building exercise. We know that already (jk).Seriously, though, there are some INCREDIBLE programmers out there. I've seen people who have mastered a multitude of frameworks, seem to 100x processing times every time they touch something, and can build a decent MVP, if given all the info up front, at a break-neck pace.But, I have also seen programmers who are incredible in a different way. They may be slower on the keyboard, but they do a much better job at diagnosing issues and getting to the root cause of a problem. Some of them are incredible at interpersonal relationship building (very valuable in tech as a programmer, just saying). Some can understand a seemingly limitless amount of complexity and boil things down to a simple direction that everyone understands. I've met and managed a few that seemed to be able to do all of it and more entirely on their own (usually 25+ YoE on those guys/gals).We say this all the time, but I think we forget to take our own advice: Programming is so much more than the code. For every rockstar programmer I have had the pleasure of working with, I could identify several issues working with them. Even the guy who does it all tends to be a victim of their own success and struggles to not dominate the room when collaboration is a must. Everyone has their gaps in knowledge and that's okay. Programming is an absurdly broad, dense, and deep discipline.I say this, because I still see it as a big issue in tech today. I think AI has really inflamed the issue too (I won't be getting into that) because of how many different ways there are to use this, frankly, very powerful tool. Please, for the sake of your sanity and enjoyment of programming, do not measure yourself OR OTHERS on a single dimension. It is my belief that a pillar of a good programmer is the ability to appreciate solutions and strengths which they do not possess nor understand, and the ability to keep the big picture in mind when addressing a potential weakness in themselves, the solution, or another programmer. Remember, comparison is the thief of joy.**What leads to the surrogation of goals in software?**I think it takes a lot of tolerance for uncertainty to work in tech. After all, your job is to essentially invent things that don't exist yet. Sure, there's a million pdf parsers out there, but there isn't one that does EXACTLY what you need the EXACT way you need it. There are 1000s of security camera models out there, but your new camera design (hopefully) taps into something the market is being starved of.But, what the hell do you do when something like blockchain hits it big? What if you're required to use a library you've never even heard of? What if Maggie in accounting can't so much as find the damn Windows start button, yet she's the VP of your project and wants to know every little technical detail just to ridicule things she doesn't understand? Dammit Maggie, it's a REST call! IT'S JUST A....On top of that, we hardly have much consensus on what ""good code"" even is - or the ""right"" way to do it. We had waterfall for some 30 years, then Agile happened, but we still have waterfall and now we have hybrid Waterfall/Agile teams with varying adherence to either paradigm. Sometimes they just make up their own rules and call it Agile because they do stuff on a bi-weekly cadence.Plus, you have Scrum and Kanban muddying the waters. But, you also have standards like TOGAF and ITIL. Let's also not forget how SaaS providers like Jira have their own rules to abide by. Honorable mention to the books and onslaught of professionals saying ""I have figured it out! Buy my shit."" That's all before you even get to the framework you're going to be working in. It's a freaking mess!The reality is, we just don't know what perfect code is. We can generally approximate when code is written poorly or well, and we can loosely articulate the reasons and speculations around that approximation, but we don't \*know\* if it's right except for very specific cases (of which there are still many examples). Nearly everything is up to debate, and it can be really hard to be certain that the code we write is good. Except, it doesn't need to be.**Preventing surrogation of goals.**Ironically, one of the most important lessons I have learned in tech has been from the least technical users I have encountered. I learned that there are two questions that should always be guiding a solution.1. Why does this work?2. Why doesn't this work?If you're underwhelmed, you probably should be. If you're enraged because of questions like -1. What about the code structure and efficiency?2. What about security?3. How does this help me implement design patterns into my work?\- bear with me.As I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I have seen many programmers prioritize the quality of the code over the functionality of the app. I've seen it in practice as well as in conversations/debates amongst programmers. These questions still matter, but their relevance is predicated on how it answers the question of ""Why does this work,"" and/or ""Why doesn't this work?""What about structure and efficiency? Is that why it does/doesn't work? If the current code structure does not significantly impact the solutions ability to work or not work, then it's a moot question. It's moot, because it has no meaningful bearings on how well the app does its job (or fails to do its job).For a personal utility script where the focus is on development efficiency and functionality, not raw execution speed, a few seconds' difference in runtime is inconsequential. So the practical value of a faster script is diminished if it sacrifices development efficiency. Ultimately, **the script's success is defined by whether or not it works as intended.** In that regard, a 'slower' script developed in one hour can be a more pragmatic solution than a 'faster' one that took three hours to build.Now, I said a lot about strengths and weaknesses of a programmer. So let's take it a step further and address the speed at which coding is done. I, frankly, am not a super fast coder. I'm not the slowest in the room, but I was never the guy who could just churn code like a factory (pattern).I know, way to show my ass to the crowd. The thing is, I am simply stronger in analysis and communication than I am in writing code. I'm cool with being that guy. I love working with developers who are code factories and don't want to deal with people as much, because that's a complementary counterpart to what I bring to the table. So, while I focus on drafting demos and POCs and diagrams and all of these things about the application, they can focus on the real meat of the application, preventing backdoors, scaling efficiency, obscure mathematical theorems, etc.However, since we are talking about a collaborative environment, it is important to note that this is not a siloed effort. I NEED to write production code because I NEED to understand what goes into it, pitfalls, and tricks. I may be subordinate to the code master next to me, but I cannot circumvent the necessity of actually doing the work. The same goes for the code master. They NEED to create diagrams and explain concepts because they NEED to understand how the customer feels, whether or not their idea can conceptually make sense to another person, and so on. Just like they bail me out if I back myself into a corner, I bail them out if they start fumbling the presentation. It goes both ways, and we both become exceptional for it.**The True Programmer, and respecting your colleagues**I know advocating for respect on an internet forum is a quintessential example of ""screaming into the void,"" but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.Just like how I said we don't know a lot of things, we (as a society) don't know what a true programmer is. Something to do with writing code, something to do with building applications. I'm not here to claim that I have the be-all-end-all answer to what a true programmer is. Quite the opposite.The literal definition of a programmer is pretty vague when you look at it from a technical perspective. There's a lot of nuance and layers to writing a computer program that we could spend a long time deliberating over. That is precisely why we must be very careful, or downright avoid, the argument that ""someone who does x"" or ""someone who doesn't know y"" is or is not a ""true programmer."" Fans of the True-Scotsman fallacy will know exactly what I mean here. It's an argument that leads to nowhere.The reality is technology is a part of everyone's life, and everyone's perspective on it matters. We need non-technical users to break our apps and force us to come up with more resilient and intuitive designs. We need semi-technical users to help translate the real world to technical ideas with new and creative inspirations outside of the conventional walls. We need deeply technical users to navigate the gritty details of building the applications when they're 9 layers removed from the original problem. Most importantly, we need all of them to work together to build anything meaningful.Everyone gets into tech with their own perspective for their own reasons. But what technology is, fundamentally, doesn't change. Whether it's writing a new business integration or starting a SaaS company or building robots or even developing new devices that don't require a plug - the whole idea of technology is rooted in discovery. We take the chaos the world presents us, and learn how to contain it and use it to achieve our goals. Fire became torches, circuits became software, and Maggie became a great lesson for me in what really matters in software.I hope this post serves as a valuable reminder of all the things we still don't know in software and technology as a whole. I hope it reassures newcomers that it's okay to feel like everything is a hot mess - because it is. I also hope it helps to soothe some of the hardened veterans who know things and learned lessons that the vast majority of society could hardly understand, let alone be expected to know. Finally, I hope it helps everyone make better applications by focusing on what really matters. Whether it's an actual project, or just discussing ideas with a stranger, we should always focus on why it does or doesn't work first, and remember that what is most valuable to us as programmers is not always what's most valuable to the applications themselves.**P.S. Counter arguments and the importance of taking different approaches**I am acutely aware that there are many software that are vastly different than the cushy business applications I have come to know. Even banks have a higher tolerance of failure than, say, the technology responsible for safely landing your aircraft. Furthermore, there is a very real snowball effect poorly written code has where tech debt and developer morale go in the wrong directions quickly.This is not me advocating for haphazardly writing code and being complacent with what we do not know. If you've got 30 layers of if statements in your method, I'm inclined to believe that you did something wrong and should have fixed it a long time ago. Getting the job done tomorrow matters as well as getting it done today, usually. You'll never solve for everything, so you always try to solve what matters the most first, and there are times that your application can ""get the job done"" today, but should absolutely not see the light of production until it is completely reworked into a sensible architecture.The answer to ""Why doesn't this work?"" can very likely be ""Because it's so impossible to understand that we won't know why it fails."" or ""Because this bug introduces a 0.1% chance that the plane slams into the ground upside down and kills everyone on board.""This is a bit more philosophical, but I am of the mind that you should always have unresolved reasons for why something doesn't work. If you don't, you probably don't know your application very well. This ultimately gets into risk assessment and whether or not the risk/reward is worth it. A tiny risk of a minor issue, like a script running a few seconds slow, may not be worth hours of work. However, a tiny risk of a major disaster, like a plane crash, is unacceptable and must be addressed. Deciding what risks to tackle is a judgment call based on the severity of the potential outcome.Remember, the definition of what does and does not work varies. You need to be aware of it and set your own standards (at least, as much as you're able to) to ensure that the software you produce is to the quality it needs to be. Knowing the implications of not following a best practice, and accurately determining if it's a meaningful risk, is an extremely delicate decision. You need to know the rules and respect the rules before you go off deciding to intentionally break them.",26,0.82,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kumill/when_youre_great_at_programming_but_you_suck_at/,2025-05-24 21:37:16,2025-05-27 01:40:26

He has done some scratch animation projects in school however I came across a course which teaches scratch more in depth with more projects. He said he would be interested in doing it, however I was relaying the information to some people and they’ve said that programming is dead now because of AI and a lot of people are not able to make use of their skills anymore. They said that it’s not worth it to learn how to code.

Although it can be hard to handle frustration, I like being challenged by a problem4. Another important reason is the financial stability that programming can offer.5.

As a part of a final project we have been tasked to create a Finder class that accepts pointers to any type of object. It assumes the object has a get rectangle function that gives it's left, right, top and bottom coordinates. It must be able to add, erase, and update the positions.The last function must return a set that contains the pointers to the objects that are inside or intersect with a given rectangle. and the problem is we have to do it in O(log n) with n being the number of rectangles on the container.In my research I've found that to accomplish this I've gotta use complex (at least for me) data structures like rtrees or quadtrees, which doesn't seem very reasonable to me. And we haven't been given any more guidelines how or what we can and cannot do. Do you guys think I should investigate and implement one of these tree structures? Or is there a simpler alternative?Thanks in advance to everyone.Update: I wasn't expecting this many responses, wow. So I took your advice and spent the whole day learning and implementing this quad tree fucker because I had to deliver it for today, it works and all the automatic test give the ok.

A bit of context, my dad was a programmer for the Romanian naval systems. He passed away a while ago, but he left behind this old coding book he wrote notes in. I’ve been learning from it, bit by bit, trying to make sense of how to build stuff from scratch.Now I’m trying to make my own web project (“Obscuria Terminal”, don’t laugh, I know it sounds dramatic :face_with_tears_of_joy:). Instead of putting everything in one CSS file, I ended up splitting it into a bunch of smaller files like `header.css`, `utilities.css`, `modals.css`, and so on. Here’s a screenshot of what my VS Code looks like:[https://prnt.sc/eauZsZQNvkXP](https://prnt.sc/eauZsZQNvkXP)I just thought it would be easier to keep things organized, but now it feels like maybe I’m making it harder for myself?So here are my questions:* Is this normal, or way too much for a beginner?* Is this something actual devs do, or am I going down the wrong path?* Would you have stuck with one big CSS file instead, or split things up differently?Sorry if this sounds clueless.

1ks61v4,Is there a way to verify file accuracy after creating a zip file?,rawaka,learnprogramming,"Hello. I have been making a VB .Net WinForms app to archive project directories at work to a different storage raid by scanning all the files/folders recursively and ensuring everything is older than a specified date. It then copies the files to our archive drive. then, it does a binary comparison of the source and copied files to ensure everything was 100% successful before deleting the source file. All that functionality works PERFECTLY. (Picture a shared drive full of folders, each of which is a complete project. If no changes have happened to a project in at least a year, it's safe to archive. Stuff on the archive drive is read-only for most of the company to keep it safe for record keeping and not cluttering up daily work)For the next phase, I want it to go through that archive drive and put all the archived directories into compressed files (Zip or 7Zip). So, each project folder becomes its own zip file. Our data is highly compressible, and we can save about 30% space by compressing files that we don't need to be regularly accessing.I see that this line of code easily creates the zip file for me: System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory(FolderPath, OutputZipPath, CompressionLevel.SmallestSize, True)My questions are:* Is there a way to verify the file accuracy after zipped before I delete the source files? * I may be over-cautious, but I don't want to risk any file corruptions* Is there a different way to compress folders that I should research? * I did my proof-of-concept testing using a batch file that triggered 7zip, but I prefer to keep everything integrated into a single program if possible unless there's a good reason not to. edit: minor error: i flipped the percentage of saved space, sorry. they compress to 70% of original size, saving 30%.",6,1.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ks61v4/is_there_a_way_to_verify_file_accuracy_after/,2025-05-21 19:00:59,2025-05-27 01:40:26

I'd only consider it for a very high salary (mid-level developer range), which might be unrealistic for an entry-level hire.---### Internship at a Startup- **Status:** Offer available.- **Details:** The startup recently closed a big contract and is expanding.- **Pros:** I'd probably learn a lot quickly.- **Cons:** Very low pay. Feels unstable. Work would include a mix of backend, data, and no-code frontend (only one other dev on the team).

I'm trying to build a reddit-like app for a practice project, and I'm wondering if anyone could shed some light on how a site like reddit would structure its data? One schema I thought of would be to have: a table of users, referencing basic user info; a table for each user listing communities followed; a table for each community, listing posts and post data; a table for each post listing the comments. Is this a feasible structure? It seems like it would fill up with a lot of posts really fast. On the other hand, if you simplified it and just had a table for all users, all posts, all comments, and all communities, wouldn't it also take forever to parse and get, say, all the posts created by a given user?

1kslf3b,"After 4 years at Google, here's my honest take on why their work culture and processes didn't work for me.",dethstrobe,cscareerquestions,"I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.Just to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.# Agile is a SinI come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?Wrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.It is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.Also, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for ""X"" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.# The Doc MachineSo, if you're not regularly shipping software, how can you possibly measure impact?Docs.Endless docs.Countless docs.So many docs that it can be impossible to find what doc says what you did.Google's mission is to ""organize the world's information."" Internally in Google, they generate a lot of information in docs, and it's very hard to search and find the information you're looking for.What's the point of docs no one reads? Well, since software doesn't get shipped, I assume it just acts as a laundry list of links when attempting to show impact for your performance reviews or promotions. You might not have shipped anything, but at least you left a paper trail of what you didn't ship.You want to know the worst part of it? They want you to write a doc on a system you don't understand. So you write it up, make some assumptions and send it out for approval. No one reads it to approve it. Let's say you get your single approver and start implementing. Guess what, your core assumption is wrong. The data isn't in the right place, or the data you thought had what you needed, doesn't. Now you need to rewrite the doc.What's the point of getting approval? What's the point of a doc that is wrong from the start? What's the point of upfront design that is wrong? Why not just implement and find out what actually is going on and make it work?The point is, it's just theater to make it look like we're doing our jobs. Why isn't the software the evidence we're doing our job?I'm not trying to say docs are bad, and everything should just be tribal knowledge. But I am saying docs that need to be rewritten from the get-go are a waste of time.# Bad docsIronically, despite needing to write so many docs to implement things. When you read other people's docs, you might notice something. They're very high-level. They're more like a thesis, then like actual documentation on how to use an API.What is the point of docs that don't answer how to use an API?Focusing on the high-level philosophy of a service is honestly distracting and unhelpful. I think I understand why this happens. It's hard to keep docs up to date. So if you keep them high-level, they won't become obsolete or need to be updated. But I don't care about your thesis defense; I just want to use your software to solve my problem.And I know Google can write good docs. [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) has fantastic documentation. [Proto Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview/) have great docs. Both of these are made by Google. I guess the difference is they're public facing and Google doesn't prioritize internal docs like they do their external facing ones.# A Culture of SilenceSo, there is a lot of lip service towards how open Google is. Say how they're trying to encourage employees in fireside chats to not ask anonymous questions so that leadership can follow up with the individual to gain more context. (This, by the way, does not prevent people from asking anonymously, which they do.)There is also a culture of no-blame retrospectives. They don't run regularly, even when I advocate for them. And worst of all, when we finally do run retrospectives, we don't discuss challenges and problems we are encountering. So, what's the point of a retrospective that doesn't talk about pain points and mitigation strategies? From my perspective, it just looks like theater and a way to paint a false view that everything is good and we have nothing to complain about. Or worse, that we are helpless and we really cannot change anything.Coming from companies with genuinely open cultures where we fostered candid and open discussions, it's baffling to me that no one seems willing to put in the minimal effort to improve everyone's lives.It is better to be positive about a broken system and keep the status quo than it is to ask people to put in a laughable small level of effort to make everyone's life better. Not everything is going smoothly all the time. And assuming we **want** it to run smoothly, we should probably discuss the pain points and workarounds or solutions to them. Knowledge silos are bad. More open discussions can reduce knowledge silos which reduces the burden on individuals and gives everyone a balance for job responsibilities.# A Culture of Bottom-Up (but only if it's top-down)So, in meetings with leadership. They emphasize that our *bottom-up culture* is how we do such great work. And by *bottom-up*, they apparently mean *top-down*.# When Bottom-Up Meets Brick WallSo, let's say our UXR (user experience research team) has come up with an obvious gap in our offerings. What would you do? Perhaps gather some people from multiple disciplines and brainstorm a solution. Or maybe you just get leadership and design in a room and iterate on who knows what behind closed doors for literal months, before you ever even involve engineering. And for those few months, you pull engineering off their current teams in a large-scale reorg and don't give them marching orders instead just give them a bunch of vague ideas of what they might want to build. Like...what is engineering supposed to do? Build against an invisible moving target? The answer is, that is exactly what we do. Not because it's a good use of our time, but because we have nothing better to do and we have no input into the vision of the product.So let's say, you're an engineer, like yours truly, and you think that process is stupid, and instead you really do want to try to implement a bottoms up initiative. So maybe, see a feature, we originally spec'd out but was dropped because they didn't see the current value in implementing it. But it sounds kind of cool, and shouldn't be that difficult to get an MVP for this feature. Maybe you go to reach out across teams, pull in people that own data you need, a team that works on Android and iOS, and try to get people from the backend team so you can make an e2e MVP to demonstrate this feature is doable. Also, act as a test bed to show smaller agile processes work and probably how we should handle work in the org.Sounds pretty encouraging, right? But here is the real problem, one of the teams is a no-show. Not only are they a no-show, they also refuse to work with you and ignore your messages. You escalate to your manager and tech lead, and that team also ignores them too. You work with the other teams and implement everything, but say the one thing to tie everything together and make it work e2e. Let's say a backend team refused to work with you. So, naturally, offer to do the work for them. And they tell you to not do that. Because it's not my code base, I'm not on call, and I don't have to maintain it. So what do you do?What I did was create a video demo that made it look like it should work and presented it to leadership. We were reorged before this demo was even presented, so the feature died on the vine.# The Only MVP Is Minimum Viable Plausible DeniabilityLet's say that you do still believe in the rhetoric that, *the organization really does believe in bottom-up*. So you take some time and write up a doc (which is an activity you don't enjoy but if that's how the game is played, and you want to play ball, you do it). The doc outlines an open source initiative that is coincidentally attempting to solve the space we just tried to fill. But since there's an open-source community trying to solve the same problem space, maybe we can just leverage that and even help them grow at the same time. Anyway, it was super nice to have leadership hear me out, but they didn't want to go with it, because it turns out that one of the reasons we hamstrung our last project was because we were attempting to skirt a legal definition that the open source project is tackling head on. Suddenly, it made more sense: The original project was destined to fail, not because it was a bad idea, but because they were trying to handicap the implementation to avoid legal scrutiny.Fundamentally, we're not trying to build good software or solve problems. We're just trying to do something without bringing legal scrutiny to Google.I understand getting sued sucks, and the law is often weaponized against Google. But why handicap ourselves? There are so many other ideas out there. Why not pursue things that are higher value and lower risk? I cynically believe it could just be virtue signaling to investors, to show Google is trying new things and still taking risks. But their risks seem high-risk, low-reward, compared to the normal practices I'm used to, which focus on mitigating risk and prioritizing high value. Taking risks here seems to be about signaling growth, but are they truly growing? Wouldn't the more obvious path be to take the calculated legal risk to solve a real problem and potentially achieve genuine growth? I don't know; I'm not in leadership. I just had a worm's-eye view of the machine.# Grassroots Agility, Stomped by ApathyLet's say you came from an agile background and you even believe it. Because you've seen it solve very obvious communication issues that you see arise in large organizations. You've experienced it firsthand, you know it works. You go and explain it to your manager, they say that there are organization issues and leadership is resistant to change. They don't discourage you from trying, but they kind of set the expectations that nothing will change. But, what else are you supposed to do? Nothing?So you have a meeting with your skip manager (your manager's manager) once again advocating to adopt agile processes and maybe get more stakeholder buy-in. And they give you the advice to do it locally with your team. You know, ""bottom-up"" kind of stuff.You present it to the team. They hate it. They don't want processes. They don't want collaboration or more communication. They say agile practices are dehumanizing and that we are not interchangeable cogs in the machine. A bit of a disservice towards agile processes. But they are willing to try some of the ceremonies.But literally, for any reason whatsoever, they cancel meetings, like retrospectives or stand-ups. Maybe we need more time to finish a feature, or maybe it's a holiday, or we get reorged. And we never start up the meeting again, at least until I ask for it. Followed by it once again being canceled at the drop of a hat. And no one cares. They don't see the value in it. And to be honest, the ceremonies are toothless because we don't discuss actual problems, we don't discuss work progress to reduce knowledge silos, and action items are never done and are also usually not meaningful anyway.The reason people don't see the value of agile processes is not that it's not a good framework to address communication gaps, but because just doing the ceremonies without the communication makes them pointless. There is value in the ceremonies if they're being used to address the problems. But actively ignoring the problems, even with ceremonies, means we're now just wasting people's time.# Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Going NowhereIf there is a bottom-up culture at Google, it is self sabotaging. There is so much momentum for the status quo that actual process change is near impossible. The only change that appears to work is a top-down mandate, which they try every year with constant reorgs and get the same results.# There is No Team in ISo, coming from an agile background (I know I sound like I'm in a cult, with how much I bring it up, but bear with me), I've come to the understanding that I as an individual do not necessarily matter. It's about putting aside ego and working together on a larger goal. This also comes with a nice benefit of distributing responsibility, and reducing burn out.That's pretty damn *ungoogley*. At Google, they're rugged cowboys. They pull themselves up by the bootstrap and don't care about your collaboration. You need to own everything. Your work, your feature, your project, your process, your career. No one is here to help you. You need to just do it yourself. Which is ironic, as [googley-ness](https://staffeng.medium.com/being-googly-62b75dd642df) should theoretically not embody it. But the performance evaluation surely doesn't emphasize trying to make teamwork work.[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.I hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.It could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *""leaning on others too much.""* How else am I supposed to read that?I've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.# Performative TheaterI hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.So, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.When they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.# Tech Debt ForeverTo say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.Cryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.So I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, ""It sounds like you need mentorship."" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, ""maybe you should find your own mentorship."" And it does make me wonder, ""what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?"" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.# I'm outSo I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.They gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.There is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.I used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",2206,0.96,343,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kslf3b/after_4_years_at_google_heres_my_honest_take_on/,2025-05-22 08:13:58,2025-05-27 01:40:27

1ksxljy,Just Received a Fully Remote Job Offer as a Self Taught SWE - Spreading Some Positivity and Hope,yan_kh,cscareerquestions,"For anyone looking at my Reddit post history, it would be easy to notice that I have been struggling to land a new job in this tough market.As a completely self-taught backend engineer, without a university degree nor boot camp, rather just a love for technologies and programming from a young age, and a few years of experience in a very small non-profit organization, the market has not been easy on me at all. During my job hunting journey, I have applied for more than 800 jobs, conducted more than 70 interviews, and was a finalist in the hiring process about 10 times. Yet regardless of that, there was always a candidate more favorable than me which got chosen, until this exact day.Today I have received an email which was quite unexpected. I have been offered a full-time remote position as a junior software engineer in an international mid-sized company, with big customer base and highly distributed systems. The offer I received is realistic and slightly above average for my years of experience and the consideration it's a fully remote position, therefore I have gladly signed it and accepted it.The agenda of my post is first and foremost spreading some positivity and hope in this Subreddit in these tough market conditions, because I feel like many people can use it here as a motivation to keep trying. Secondly, I would like to celebrate this moment here in this Subreddit and post about the good times, the same as I did when I posted about the bad times.I wish everyone out there the best of luck in their job hunting journey, and as I said I want to shed some light and spread positivity proving that it is possible to get offers with the right skills, hard work, consistency, and a bit of luck.Good luck everyone!",527,0.93,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ksxljy/just_received_a_fully_remote_job_offer_as_a_self/,2025-05-22 18:08:07,2025-05-27 01:40:27

This is interview 3 after a video interview, technical test and HR casually drops that it's a being your own device company. Like are you guys for real? You go through the hassle of looking for a senior engineer and you can't get them a dedicated laptop separate from their own personal life not to mention the safety of your IP? I find that shocking and disrespectful. I've been applying for jobs for months and I would rather continue my freelance practice than be subjected to the equivalent of a sweatshop. Needless to say I just dead face told her I'm not going to waste your time after she mentioned this is company policy. Rant over. Edit : as some of you noted I didn't get an offer, apologies about the unclear titleEdit 2: i will expand on this in a few hrs cause I've written most of my comments with a 6m old trying to eat my phone Edit 3: OK now that I can sit on my PC, let me just explain a few things that have caused some confusion in the comments. I'm mostly a python/ML/AI freelancer who wants to get into a full time position. I've worked with many big names in this industry and generally take every interview that I'm given whether it is a small company or not.

It has about 2.1 stars on Glassdoor in their recent reviews and honestly, I wasn't expecting too much from the job but was giving them the opportunity to show themselves for who they are. I don't really care too much about buying my own laptop per se. It's about how they approach onboarding new employees. I've worked in companies where I was thrown into legacy systems from the first day and I can see the signs written on the wall from a mile away, which is why I decided that I shouldn't proceed. For those of you who say that I'm spoiled and entitled. Bruh, I literally make less than average salary working as a freelancer, all of this while paying 100% more the taxes for CCP of what full time employees pay while having to do my own accounting.

Also, often times no healthcare coverage paid for that a layoff would provide.But the biggest thing is it comes with you being labelled a ""bad worker"" in the press, which other hiring managers will see. Even though it was just a way to lay you off in secret. If you were not a bad performer, then this is defamation of character and is affecting you financially. Both from losing benefits you would receive from a normal layoff, as well as the potential financial pain that comes from not being hired due to being falsely labeled a ""poor performer"".It is time employees start suing these companies.

But I wouldn't be able to implement something from scratch with ambiguous to no information or even rewrite or refactor a module.OK. So, i've been browsing this sub for maybe 3 years? and I would sometimes read opinons here or other subs just how easy their software dev job is and that the challenging part is just passing the interview..And I feel like that is a lie.. obviously jobs differ from company to company, project to project etc.. In my case I was lucky enough to deal with good people, managers, business analysts, stuff people would complain about but if there is something I would complain is the work itself.There were moments where I would ask myself wtf am I doing working as a developer because some tasks just made me feel like I was staring at a wall, I had no idea how to approach this issue, I would have an idea but going deeper I would eventually get lost and forget why I went down the path the first place.Right now i'm on a new project which is basically rewrite from scratch of an older project that was done in a couple of years and they want some core functionality implemented in a matter of months..You might think, oh that doesn't sound so bad.. the logic is already there. Well imagine that programming paradigm changed so from functional to OOP and that you need to integrate 3rd party vendors as well.Oh yeah I forgot, nobody really talks about how most projects IRL deviate in some way from the online tutorials you're used to, that medium article you though is relevant to your problem? yeah nah. How about that StackOverflow answer? how inconvenient it can't be applied to that one specific use-case you're dealing with.Right now, i'm questiong myself and my ability to continue a career in this industry, I invested way too much time learning and investing time in another degree will be quite a setback in terms of career growth as well as age.

CS degree, working retail job.",whoami_jav,cscareerquestions,"Seeking some advice… In March 2023, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science from a UC in Southern California after returning to school following a break in 2019. While in college, I completed an internship at a local tech company doing software engineering and also picked up some freelance web development work.After graduation, I spent about five months preparing for technical interviews and applying for jobs. Unfortunately, I drained my limited savings during that time and didn’t land any offers. I eventually stepped away from the job search, partly due to frustration and loss of professional motivation and because I really needed money quickly.Since then, I’ve been working at an organics grocery store (the rain forest one) for the past year and eight months. I currently make $18.67 per hour, working 30 to 35 hours a week. I’ve recently been offered a leadership-track role that would bump my pay to around $21.50 per hour with a 40-hour workweek. Still, I’m not happy with my financial situation or this job.Despite working in retail, I continue to code and try to learn software engineering topics on my days off or when I have the energy after work. That said, it has been difficult to maintain momentum, and I feel like I’ve lost touch with many of the CS fundamentals needed in the field.Part of me regrets not going all in on the job search earlier and settling for a grocery store job. Another part of me is grateful for the soft skills I’ve developed in the meantime.Now, I want to pivot back into tech and become a software engineer. At this point, I’d take almost any role in the field just to gain experience and start building a network. I know the job hunt will require time, discipline, and financial commitment. Preparing through LeetCode, system design, and personal projects is going to be time consuming, but it’s necessary. I am rusty on a lot topics. That said, reading about the current job market has me feeling anxious.I’m at a crossroads and feel completely lost. My options are:1. **Stay in my current role**, working 30–35 hours per week. Continue saving and use my days off or evenings to focus on technical prep (LeetCode and NeetCode). Once I feel ready, start applying.2. **Accept the leadership position**, work full-time for six months, and save aggressively. This will net me roughly $20,000 in savings considering holiday pay and OT. After that, step back to part-time (I’m able to work from 4 to 24 hours a week) and use my savings to support myself while focusing full-time on interview prep and project work.

This isn’t about fluff, it’s about **real growth*** Every Thursday or Friday we could have a community event like DSA Thursday/Friday* After internship, or if you want to skip it would be **Entry-Level** (the initial commitment would be **6 to 12 months**)* Everyone begins by building a **personal project** to set a baseline and gauge their current level.* If possible, everyone at this stage is assigned an accountability buddy, preferably one that isn't on the same team so that one person isn't doing the work of another. * After that, we begin and transition into **collaborative projects** run in an agile team format. Everyone keeps their main role they want and rotates any unused/unsure roles: designer, dev, PM, tester, to build real-world skills.# The exposure strategy:Once a project is finished, we create a **video breakdown** and post it on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, or wherever else makes sense. Each person is credited for their work and gets the exposure they deserve.Let’s be real: Most of us are **introverts**. Some of us are **highly skilled**. And many of us are **still unemployed**, even while being more capable than folks earning six figures.This isn't just about skill, it's about being **seen**. We need a system that clears the dust off our shine. Many of us are grasping at straws. **Maybe this is what we actually need: real experience, real proof, and real support.**# Long-term vision:* After 6+ months, or if your **personal project** stands out, you transition into a **junior developer role** within the group.* You start to take on leadership responsibilities and begin developing those soft skills like communication, initiative, and mentoring.* By then, or even earlier, you should be ready for a paid role. If not, you’ll still have a strong portfolio, exposure, and momentum to start freelancing or even launch your own thing.# What a full journey might look like (if starting from zero):1. **Internship Phase (Learning Phase):** * Java I & II (MOOC.fi), or Full-Stack, or Python, or 2x+ CS50 courses, etc. * \~6 months total (self-paced) * Initial project (\~1 month) * Career development + feedback2. **Entry-Level Phase** * 3 to 12 projects built with team * Weekly GitHub updates, project demos, and social proof * Lasts 6 to 12 months3. **Junior Phase** * \~6+ months of group work and possible freelancing * Exposure, mentorship, and leadership opportunitiesIn total, you’d have **about 2 years of experience**, real-world projects, team collaboration skills, leadership development, and consistent exposure. With that kind of portfolio and growth, **you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t hire you**.I may start this, but I obviously can’t do it alone. If you’re interested, or if you have suggestions to improve the idea, **drop a comment or DM me**. Please share this with anyone you think may benefit from this style of rigor, discipline and community.Let's stop moping and wallowing away our best years in self pity.Let’s stop waiting for experience and start **building it**.",20,0.71,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1krqwwm/possible_ray_of_hope_in_trying_times_lets_build/,2025-05-21 06:17:27,2025-05-27 01:40:27

I never saw a researcher get their work out to production early on in my career, and now it seems like ops is an expectation of the ML / researcher role. part of the reason thats possible is how good the tooling is now. not everything has to be rewritten to c, or created from scratch in a matrix compatible arrangement of html + css + vanilla js.I havent worked with young devs since 2018. so I guess I am wondering, what kinds of work are jr developers being expected to do today? is there still a lot of the same kind of work I started out doing or is it different? appreciate any insights people might offer.",12,0.85,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kuhu65/what_kinds_of_work_are_jr_developers_expected_to/,2025-05-24 18:03:54,2025-05-27 01:40:27

I’m about 9 months into my first role, and while things have improved a bit, I’m still really struggling and could use some career advice.So heres a bit about my background. I started in tech through a conversion Master’s and landed a graduate role in a Big 4 consultancy. The first few months were rough. I was getting minimal work, no mentorship, and I felt totally lost. I nearly quit, but after speaking to management, I was paired with a senior dev and shifted to frontend (React), which I’m more comfortable with.My problem is that I’m still not learning like I want to. I lean too heavily on ChatGPT and feel like I don’t really understand what I’m doing. I feel stuck and like I’m not becoming a better software engineer. I’m constantly being rejected from even other graduate level dev jobs, and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I have completed a couple of interviews, one company was kind of a dream role which I do think I was pretty unqualified for but I did get to the final stage of the process. I actually pulled out of another interview process because I realised during the first interview that this wasn’t the right job for me.So here’s what I’m doing to try to learn and get better. I have an active github with personal projects, and a publicly available CV website. I attempt most leetcode daily challenges, and complete online udemy courses. I also attend local tech meetups and listen to tech podcasts to expand my knowledge.So these are my questions:* *How do I get better as a software engineer when I feel like I’m just guessing or relying on AI?** *What do other junior devs do to actually learn rather than just getting by?** *Why do I keep getting rejected from other jobs/how can I make myself stand out?*Any advice, resources or honest stories from other devs would really help.

The thing is:1. They pay less2. It’s for a US-based startup , and there aren’t many real benefits3. It’s full-time (not contractor)4. It’s kind of weird because the technical interview is basically a classic FullStack mini-project, nothing AI-related… it seems like the position is more oriented towards FullStack work and consuming LLMs. My friend told me he’s now learning TensorFlow/PyTorch (which is actually what interests me the most, same as Architecture modeling), but apparently he doesn’t work strictly with that.----------------------------------------I’ve been looking for Senior Mobile jobs in my stack for the past 6 months — they obviously pay more and have better benefits (though I haven't been lucky, I always make it to the 3rd interview only).---My questions are:1- What future do you see for Mobile?

So maybe this lends itself to bots, etc.Dice/Indeed seemed very scammy with overall lower quality postings than the last time I tried using them.

1ks05ut,How do you explain your thought process while programming?,djmax121,cscareerquestions,"I absolutely suck at this on a comical level. SWE with 3 almost 4 years of industry experience with a good amount of projects and some Leetcode practice also. I can program. Doing it live, in 15 minutes, while explaining what I’m thinking, with 3 other engineers watching over me though? Feels like a 30 IQ debuff at the very least.It’s honestly like language processing and logical reasoning exist on separate threads, in different languages in my brain. So not only do I have to interrupt the logic thread which is necessary for a coherent, correct solution, I also need to translate it into English language to be presentable and make sense, on the fly. But also keep enough reference of the logic to have something to return to once I explain a point. The result is both threads are interrupted frequently and produce incoherent responses. On top of the pressure of being watched and judged for it.That’s why I can program a solution in whole, then I can explain it well after it’s all done. Each thread can complete one by one without loss of context mid execution.Does anyone have any advice? Ideally if you used to be bad at this, but got significantly better? Is it just a matter of more exposure? This feels insurmountable since I’ve always been this way. Top of math class, but teacher asks me to walk through a solution on the whiteboard?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on which path would be best to start my career. Ideally, I’d like to stay flexible and be able to explore different areas in the future if my curiosity changes, so I don't want an area that will specialize me too much too early. I have always heard BE engineering seems to be the best role for this kind of felxibility, but please let me know what you think!Here's the list of opportunities, ordered from most attractive to least (in my opinion):### Backend Engineer Internship at a Product Company- **Duration:** 9-month internship, with a possibility of a full-time offer afterwards.- **Tech stack:** Spring, Kafka, SQL and NoSQL databases.- **Pros:** I love everything about this—tech stack, company culture, team vibe.- **Cons:** The pay is lower than the other (non-internship) offers for the first 9 months.---### Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at a Product Company- **Status:** Interview scheduled next week.- **Details:** The company was acquired by a major player, so it seems relatively stable.- **Pros:** I find SRE work interesting.- **Concerns:** I'm worried that starting my career in SRE might limit my ability to change into other areas later on.---### Backend Engineer at an Outsourcing Consultancy- **Status:** Passed HR round; they're waiting on salary expectations.- **Details:** They want to move me forward to client interviews.- **Pros:** I expect to learn a lot, and they were open to salary negotiations—even with my slightly above-entry-level ask.- **Cons:** Still unclear which client or project I'd end up on.---### Data Scientist at a Consulting Company- **Status:** Just received the message; haven't responded yet.- **Details:** Seems to involve in-house consulting, with a focus on machine learning.- **Pros:** They seem very enthusiastic about some ML stuff in my CV and my Python experience (pretty advanced for an entry level).- **Cons:** I’m not particularly interested in data roles right now. I'd only consider it for a very high salary (mid-level developer range), which might be unrealistic for an entry-level hire.---### Internship at a Startup- **Status:** Offer available.- **Details:** The startup recently closed a big contract and is expanding.- **Pros:** I'd probably learn a lot quickly.- **Cons:** Very low pay. Feels unstable. Work would include a mix of backend, data, and no-code frontend (only one other dev on the team). Might make transitioning to more traditional jobs harder later on.Thank you so much in advance! :)",4,0.67,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktrop2/help_choosing_my_first_tech_job_backend_sre_or/,2025-05-23 19:02:05,2025-05-27 01:40:27

It's been going great, but the work is relatively easy and fast. I have had extra time to work on features that are adjacent to our main project. For example, me and another intern are building a internal dashboard that shows certain security metrics within the company on a daily basis and we figured out a way to use AI to give a debrief to the person that will be using the dashboard (For example: ""X has increased Y% from Z location in the past A days, resulting in aprox $B loss.""). We worked with the person who is using the dashboard to understand what his wants are, so we are confident he will like the new addition. With that said, we don't know the best way to go about presenting this work to our manager in hopes that we can boost our chances of getting a return offer. She never talked about doing things on our own time and she has quite the attitude. Im not interested in the money, more about making an impact/helping people at the company out and growing skills. I also don't want to get our work stolen by her, which unfortunately is a possibility I fear. Do both of us just set a meeting with her? Do we write a proposal? Do we just go up to her at lunch? For those of you that have been in the industry, what works when talking to a manager/exec? For those of you in the position of managing interns, what do you wish they would do?
