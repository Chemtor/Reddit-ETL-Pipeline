I went full enterprise when a simple Power BI embedded report in Teams would’ve solved it.Lesson learned: not every client wants “scalable,” some just want usable.

1ox84x9,"Sanity check: am I crazy for feeling like my ""data engineering"" position is a dead end?",lostmyway573,dataengineering,"Obvious throwaway account is obvious.My job is a data engineer for a medium-ish sized company, been here for just over 4 years. This is my first ""data"" job, but I learned a good bit about SQL in previous roles. Our department / my team manages our BI data warehouse, and we have a couple of report developers as well. When I read and study about modern data engineering practices, or modern development practices / AI usage, I feel like I'm a caveman rubbing sticks together while watching flying cars go by me every day. I'm considering switching to a DevOps position in my company because I enjoy working with Linux and smaller applications, but also because I feel like this position is a complete dead end - I have no room to exert creativity or really learn anything on the job because of the reasons I'll detail below.Until about 2 years ago, our data warehouse was basically one large SQL database (MS SQL). Standard Kimball-style facts/dimensions, with a handful of other nonstandard tables scattered here and there. We also have a few separate databases that act as per-department ""sandboxes"" for business analysts to build their own stuff, but that's a whole separate story. The whole thing is powered by SSIS packages; OLTP data transformed to a star schema in most cases. Most of it appears to be developed by people who learned SSIS before SQL, because in almost every process, the business logic is baked into transformations instead of scripts or code. I expected this from a legacy setup, and shortly after I started working here it became known that we were going to be migrating to the cloud and away from this legacy stuff, so I thought it was a temporary problem that we'd be walking away from.How naive I was.Problem #1: We have virtually no documentation, other than the occasional comment within code if I'm lucky. We have no medallion architecture. We have no data dictionary. Pretty much all the knowledge of how a majority of our data interacts is tribal knowledge within my department and the business analysts who have been here for a long time. Even the business logic of our reports that go to the desks of the C-levels gets argued about sometimes because it's not written down anywhere. We've had no standard code practices (ever) so one process to the next could employ a totally different design approach.Problem #2: Enter the cloud migration phase. At first, this sounded like the lucky break I was hoping for - a chance to go hands-on with Snowflake and employ real data engineering tools and practices and rebuild a lot of the legacy stuff that we've dealt with since our company's inception. Sadly, that would have been way too easy... Orders came down from the top that we needed to get this done as a lift-and-shift, so we paid a consulting company to use machine learning to convert all of our SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory pipelines en masse. Since we don't have a data dictionary or any real documentation, we really had no way to offer test cases for validating data after the fact. We spent months manually validating table data against table data, row by row. Now we're completely vendor-locked with ADF, which is a massive pile of shit for doing surgical-level transformations like we do. Problem #2A: Architecture. Our entire architecture was decided by one person - a DBA who, by their own admission, has never been a developer of any sort, so they had no idea how complex some of our ETL processes were. Our main OLTP system is staying on-prem, and we're replicating its database up to Snowflake using a third-party tool as our source. Then our ADF processes transform the data and deposit it back to Snowflake in a separate location. I feel like we could have engineered a much simpler solution than this if we were given a chance, but this decision was made before my team was even involved. (OneLake? Dynamic Tables?)Problem #3: Project management, or the lack thereof. At this inception of this migration, the decision to use ADF was made without consulting anyone in my department, including our manager. Similarly, the decision to just convert all of our stuff was made without input from our department. We were also never given a chance to review any of our existing stuff to determine if anything was deprecated; we paid for all of it to be converted, debugged it, and half of it is defunct. Literal months of manpower wasted. Problem #4: Looking ahead. If I fast forward to the end of this migration phase and look at what my job is going to be on a daily basis, it boils down to wrestling with Azure Data Factory every day and dissecting tiny bits of business logic that are baked into transformations, with layers upon layers of unnecessary complexity, let alone the aforementioned lack of code standardization.This doesn't feel like data engineering, this feels like janitorial code cleanup as a result of poor project planning and no foresight. I'm very burned out and it feels hopeless to think there's any real data engineering future here. I recently picked up the Snowflake SnowPro Core certification in my downtime because I really enjoy working with the platform, and I've also been teaching myself a bit about devops in my spare time at home (built a homelab / NAS, stood up some containers, gonna be playing with K3S this weekend). Am I crazy, or is this a shitshow? Would anybody else stay here, or how would anyone else proceed in this situation? Any input is welcomed.edit: for clarity, current architecture boils down to: source OLTP > replicated to Snowflake via third-party tool > ADF for ETL/ELT > destination Snowflake",79,0.9,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox84x9/sanity_check_am_i_crazy_for_feeling_like_my_data/,2025-11-14 20:49:34,2025-11-17 01:42:24

1owxk6b,Why is transforming data still so expensive,Hofi2010,dataengineering,"In an enterprise setting we spend $100k+, in bigger orgs even $xM+ for transforming data at scale. To create the perfect data source for our business partners. Which often or most of the time is under utilized. To do this we use a data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake) or lakehouse (Databricks, ADF, …). The new platform made it easier to handle the data, but it comes with a cost. They are designed for big data (TB’s to PB’s of data), but arguably in most organization most data sources are a fraction of this size. Those solutions are also designed to lock you in with proprietary compute and data formats as they say necessary to provide the best performance. Whenever our Redshift Datawarehouse struggled to keep up AWS’s answer was, “oh your cluster head node is not keeping up with the demand you should upgrade to the next bigger instance type” problem solved and cost was doubled. But now with cheap object storage and open data formats like iceberg it should be possible to get the same performance than Snowflake, Redshift and Databricks at a fraction of the cost. But in order to transform your data you need compute and your data need to be ingested into the compute, transformed and written back in the transformed format to your datalake. The object storage and network speed between storage and compute is usually your bottleneck here. I made some experiments with different EC2 instances and duckdb (just saying I am not affiliated with the product). I had a 85GB timeseries data stream (iceberg) that needed to be pivoted and split into 100 individual tables. On a regular general purpose compute instance t3g.2xlarge that took about 6-7 hours to complete. Then I used i4g memory optioned instances with more memory and network bandwidth up 25 Gbps and it halfed the time. Then I found these new instances network optimized c8gn and they managed to do all 100 tables in 20 mins. Compare this to databricks (Databricks was reading from s3), which took 3 hours. Databricks cost for this transform was $9.38 and the EC2 instance did it for $1.70. So huge savings with a bit of engineering.Wanted to share this and wanted to hear some stories from others in their pursuit of cheaper data transformation options EDIT: just to clarify. I am not proposing get rid of data warehouse or lakehouse, just saying you can save by “outsourcing” compute for batch transformations to much cheaper compute options so you can keep your actual warehouse/lakehouse small.",64,0.89,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1owxk6b/why_is_transforming_data_still_so_expensive/,2025-11-14 14:13:07,2025-11-17 01:42:24

1ota9vg,How are you handling projected AI costs ($75k+/mo) and data conflicts for customer-facing agents?,Worried_Teaching_707,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I'm working as an AI Architect consultant for a mid-sized B2B SaaS company, and we're in the final forecasting stage for a new ""AI Co-pilot"" feature. This agent is customer-facing, designed to let their Pro-tier users run complex queries against their own data.The projected API costs are raising serious red flags, and I'm trying to benchmark how others are handling this.**1. The Cost Projection:** The agent is complex. A single query (e.g., ""Summarize my team's activity on Project X vs. their quarterly goals"") requires a 4-5 call chain to GPT-4T (planning, tool-use 1, tool-use 2, synthesis, etc.). We're clocking this at **\~$0.75 per query**.The feature will roll out to **\~5,000 users**. Even with a conservative **20% DAU** (1,000 users) asking just **5 queries/day**, the math is alarming: \*(1,000 DAUs \* 5 queries/day \* 20 workdays \* $0.75/query) = **\~$75,000/month.**\*This turns a feature into a major COGS problem. How are you justifying/managing this? Are your numbers similar?**2. The Data Conflict Problem:** Honestly, this might be worse than the cost. The agent has to query multiple internal systems *about* the customer's data (e.g., their usage logs, their tenant DB, the billing system).We're seeing conflicts. For example, the **usage logs** show a customer is using an ""Enterprise"" feature, but the **billing system** has them on a ""Pro"" plan. The agent doesn't know what to do and might give a wrong or confusing answer. This reliability issue could kill the feature.**My Questions:*** Are you all just eating these high API costs, or did you build a sophisticated middleware/proxy to aggressively cache, route to cheaper models, and reduce ""ping-pong""?* How are you solving these data-conflict issues? Is there a ""pre-LLM"" validation layer?* Are any of the observability tools (Langfuse, Helicone, etc.) actually helping solve this, or are they just for logging?Would appreciate any architecture or strategy insights.

1ovb4ww,Organizing a climate data + machine learning research project that grew out of control,thiago5242,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I’m data scientinst and master’s student in CS and have been maintaining, pretty much on my own, a research project that uses machine learning with climate data. The infrastructure is very ""do it yourself"", and now that I’m near the end of my degree, the data volume has exploded and the organization has become a serious maintenance problem.Currently, I have a Linux server with a /data folder (\~800GB and growing) that contains:* Climate datasets (NetCDF4, HDF5, and Zarr) — mainly MERRA-2 and ERA5, handled through Xarray;* Tabular data and metadata (CSV, XLSX);* ML models (mostly Scikit-learn and PyTorch pickled models);* A relational database with experiment information.The system works, but as it grew, several issues emerged:* Data ingestion and metadata standardization are fully manual (isolated Python scripts);* Subfolders for distributing the final application (e.g., a reduced /data subset with only one year of data, \~10GB) are manually generated;* There’s no version control for the data, so each new processing step creates new files with no traceability;* I’m the only person managing all this — once I leave, no one will be able to maintain it.I want to move away from this “messy data folder” model and build something more organized, readable, and automatable, but still realistic for an academic environment (no DevOps team, no cloud, just a decent local server with a few TB of storage).What I’ve considered so far:* A full relational database, but converting NetCDF to SQL would be absurdly expensive in both cost and storage.* A NoSQL database like MongoDB, but it seems inefficient for multidimensional data like netcdf4 datasets.* The idea of a local data lake seems promising, but I’m still trying to understand how to start and what tools make sense in a research (non-cloud) setting.I’m looking for a structure that can:* Organize everything (raw, processed, outputs, etc.);* Automate data ingestion and subset generation (e.g., extract only one year of data);* Provide some level of versioning for data and metadata;* Be readable enough for someone else to understand and maintain after me.Has anyone here faced something similar with large climate datasets (NetCDF/Xarray) in a research environment? Should I be looking into a non-relational database?Any advice on architecture, directory standards, or tools would be extremely welcome — I find this problem fascinating and I’m eager to learn more about this area, but I feel like I need a bit of guidance on where to start.",16,0.85,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ovb4ww/organizing_a_climate_data_machine_learning/,2025-11-12 17:15:53,2025-11-17 01:42:24

1oxggmk,"Need to scale feature engineering, only Python and SQL (SQL Server & SSIS) available as tools (no dbt etc.)",Comprehensive_Award3,dataengineering,"My main question is at what point and for what aggregations should I switch from SQL to Python?My goals being:1. Not writing endless amount of repeated tedious code (or having AI write endless repeating tedious code for me). What I mean is all of the CTEs I need to write for each bucket/feature requested, so like CTE\_a\_category\_last\_month with a where clause on category and timeframe. My first thought was doing the buckets in Python would help but upon research everyone recommends to use SQL for pretty much everything up until machine learning.2. Run-time. Because of the sheer amount of features that were requested of me (400 for now, but they want to go more granular with categories so it's gonna be like 1000 more), the 400 take a while to run, about 15 minutes. Maybe 15 minutes isn't that bad? Idk but the non-technical people above me aren't happy with it.Pre-Context:I am not the one coming up with the asks, I am a junior, I have very little power or say or access. This means no writing to PROD, only reading, and I have to use PROD. Yes I can use AI but I am not looking for AI suggestions because I know how to use AI and I'm already using it. I want human input on the smartest most elegant solution.Also to preface I have a bunch of experience with SQL, but not so much experience with Python beyond building machine learning algorithms and doing basic imputation/re-expression, which is why I'm not sure what tool is better.Context-context:I work with transaction data. We have tables with account info, customer info, transaction code info, etc. I've already aggregated all of the basic data and features, runs pretty fast. But once I add the 400 buckets/features, it runs slow. For each transaction category and a bunch of time frames (ie. month buckets for the past two years, so you'll have a\_category\_last\_month, a\_category\_last\_last\_month, b\_category\_last\_month, etc) I need to do a bunch of heavy aggregations ie minimum amount spent on a single day during given month.Right now it's all done in SQL. I'm working on optimizing the query, but there is only so much I can do and I dread working on the new 1000 categories they want. What is the best way to go about my task? What would SQL handle better and be better/more elegant for code written vs Python? AI suggested to create a row for each feature instead of column for every single customer and then have Python pivot it, is this a good option? I feel like more rows would take even longer to run.",15,0.94,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oxggmk/need_to_scale_feature_engineering_only_python_and/,2025-11-15 02:50:04,2025-11-17 01:42:24

1ouz5fq,Re-evaluating our data integration setup: Azure Container Apps vs orchestration tools,remco-bolk,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,At my company, we are currently reevaluating our data integration setup. Right now, we have several Docker containers running on various on-premise servers. These are difficult to access and update, and we also lack a clear overview of which pipelines are running, when they are running, and whether any have failed. We only get notified by the end users...We’re considering migrating to Azure Container Apps or Azure Container App Jobs. The advantages we see are that we can easily set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy new images and have a straightforward way to schedule runs. However, one limitation is that we would still be missing a central overview of pipeline runs and their statuses. Does anyone have experience or recommendations for handling monitoring and failure tracking in such a setup? Is a tool like Sentry enough?We have also looked into orchestration tools like Dagster and Airflow, but we are concerned about the operational overhead.

1oubfow,Data PM seeking Eng input - How do I convince head of Product that cleaning up the data model is important?,PuzzleheadedCrow5186,dataengineering,"Hi there, Data PM here.I recently joined a mid-sized growing SaaS company that has had many ""lives"" (business model changed a couple times), which you can *see* in the data model. Browsing our warehouse layer alone (not all the source tables are hooked up to it) you find dozens of schemas and hundreds of tables. Searching for what should be a standard entity ""Order"" returns dozens of tables with confusing names and varying content. Every person who writes queries in the company (they're in every department) complains about how hard it is to find things. There's a lack of centralized reference tables that give us basic information about our clients and the services we offer them (it's technically not crucial to the architecture of the tools) and each client is configured differently so running queries on all our data is complex.The company is still growing and made it this far despite this, **so is it urgent to address this right now?** I don't know. But I'm concerned by my lack of ability to easily answer ""how many clients would be impacted by this Product change."" (though I'm sure with more time I'll figure it out)**I pitched to head of Product that I dedicate my next year to focusing on upgrading the data models behind our core business areas**, and to do this in tandem with new Product launches (so it's not just a ""data review"" exercise), but I was met with the reasonable question of ""how would this impact client experience and your personal KPIs?"". The only impact I can think of measuring is reduction in hours spent by eng and data on sifting through things (which is not easy to measure), but cutting costs when you're a growing business is usually not the highest priority.My question: **what are metrics have you used to justify data model reviews?** How do you know when a confusing model might be a problem and when?Welcome all thoughts - thank you!",6,0.8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oubfow/data_pm_seeking_eng_input_how_do_i_convince_head/,2025-11-11 14:53:05,2025-11-17 01:42:24
1ox5kta,Would using Azure Data Factory in this Context be Overkill?,Sea_Manufacturer2244,dataengineering,"I work for a small organization and we have built an ETL pipeline with Python and SQL for Power BI dashboards. Here is the current process:There are multiple python scripts connected to each other by importing in-memory dataframes. One script runs multiple complex SQL queries concurrently and there are other scripts for transforming the data and uploading to SQL server. The pipeline transfers 3 MB of data each time since it queries the most recent data and takes 2 to 3 minutes to execute each day.This is hard to automate because the databases require VPN which needs 2fa. So we have been working with the IT solutions team to automate the pipeline.The easiest way to automate this would be to deploy the code onto a VM and have it run on a schedule. However, the solutions team has proposed a different approach with Azure Data Factory:* ADF orchestrator invokes ""Copy Data"" activity via self-hosted IR via to the source DB* Data is copied into Azure Blob Storage* Function App executes transformations in the Python scripts* Self-hosted IR invokes ""Copy Data"" with Source as transformed data and the SQL Server as the sinkThe IT solutions deparment said this is the best approach because Microsoft supports PaaS over IaaS and there would be overhead of managing the VM.I am just wondering if this solution would be overkill because our pipeline is very small scale (only 3 MB of data transferred on each run) and we are not a large company.The other problem is that nobody on the team knows Azure. Even though the IT solutions team will implement everything, it will still need to be maintained. The team consists of a business analyst who only knows SQL and not Python, a co-op student who changes every 4 months and myself. I am just a student who has worked here on many co-op and part time roles (currently part time). The business analyst delegates all the major technical tasks to the co-op students so when I leave, the pipeline will be managed by another co-op student who will only be there for 4 months.Management currently support the ADF approach because it is Microsoft best practice. They believes that using a VM will not be best practice and they will need to hire another person to fix everything if it breaks. They also want to move to Fabric in the future for its AI/ML capabilities even though we can just build ML pipelines in Python.I am not sure if I am overthinking this or the ADF solution is truly overkill. I am fine with learning Azure technologies and not opposed to it but I want to build something that can be maintained.",5,0.86,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox5kta/would_using_azure_data_factory_in_this_context_be/,2025-11-14 19:10:54,2025-11-17 01:42:24
1ox4uvz,Need tips on a hybrid architecture for both real-time BI and ML,overwhelmed_and_shy,dataengineering,"Hello everyone,I’m a CTO of a small startup in South America (limited budget, of course) with a background in software development. While I have academic knowledge in Machine Learning, AI explicability, and related topics, I’ve never worked on a professional data team or project. In most academic projects, we work with ready-to-use datasets, so I’ve never had to think about creating datasets from scratch.We’re a 60-person company, with only 5 in tech, working in the accounting industry. We have four main applications, each with its own transactional Postgres database:- Backend: Serves a hybrid mobile/web app for customers and a back-office application for employees. It handles resources for customer enterprises and our in-house CRM.- Tasks: An internal task and process orchestration app (using Camunda).- CMS: A content system for website campaigns, offers, landing pages, etc.- Docs: An internal Wiki with markdown files documenting processes, laws, rules, etc.The databases are relatively small for now: Backend has 120 tables, Tasks has 50, and most tables have around 500k rows from 4 years of operation. We’ve plugged all of them into Metabase for BI reporting. We have some TVs around the office with real-time dashboards refreshing every 30s (for example for the sales team tracks daily goals and our fiscal team tracking new urgent due tasks). Employees also use detailed tables for their day-to-day needs, often filtering and exporting to Excel.We’ve hit some bumps in our performance and need advice on how to scale efficiently. Most BI reports go through a view in the Backend database that consolidates all customer data, which contains many joins (20+) and CTEs. This setup works well enough for now, but I’m starting to worry as we scale. On top of that, we have some needs to keep track tasks in our Camunda system that are late but only for delinquent customers, so I have to join the data from our Backend database. I've tried Trino/Presto for that but it had a really bad performance and now we are using a Postgres Foreign Data Wrapper and its working well so far... Joining data from our Camunda system with the Backend database to track late tasks, the query performance takes a big hit since it's going through the same consolidated view (it was either that or repeat the same joins over and over again). To address this, we’ve decided it’s time to create a Data Warehouse to offload these heavy queries from the databases. We’re using read replicas, indexes, etc., but I want to create a robust structure for us to grow.Additionally, we’re planning to integrate data from other sources like Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads, partner APIs (e.g., WhatsApp vendor), and PDF content (tax guides, fiscal documents, bank reports, etc.). We’d like to use this data for building ML models and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), etc.We’ve also been exploring the idea of a Data Lake to handle the raw, unstructured data. I’m leaning toward a medallion architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold layers) and pushing the ""Gold"" datasets into an OLAP database for BI consumption. The goal would be to also create ML-ready datasets in Parquet format.Cost is a big factor for us. Our current AWS bill is under USD 1K/month, which covers virtual machines, databases, cloud containers, etc. We’re open to exploring other cloud providers and potentially multi-cloud solutions, but cost-effectiveness is key.I’m studying a lot about this but am unsure of the best path forward, both in terms of architecture and systems to use. Has anyone dealt with a similar scenario, especially on a budget? Should we focus on building a Data Warehouse first, or would implementing a Data Lake be more beneficial for our use case? What tools or systems would you recommend for building a scalable, cost-efficient data pipeline? Any other advice or best practices for someone with an academic background but limited hands-on experience in data engineering?Thanks in advance for any tip",4,0.67,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox4uvz/need_tips_on_a_hybrid_architecture_for_both/,2025-11-14 18:44:04,2025-11-17 01:42:24

EU vs non-EU)?,LankyImpression8848,dataengineering,"I keep running into conflicting opinions on this, so I’m curious how other teams actually handle it in practice.Context: think of a product with **EU customers and non-EU engineers**, or generally a setup where data residency / GDPR matters and you still need to debug real issues in production.I’d love to hear how your org does things around:**1. Where you are vs where the data is*** Which country/region are *you* working from?* Where is your main production DB / warehouse for that data (EU region, US, multiple regions, etc.)?**2. Who gets to touch production data*** Do individual engineers have **direct access** to prod DBs/warehouses/logs, or is it mostly through internal tools / dashboards?* Is access **permanent** (e.g. read-only role you always have) or **on-demand / temporary** (someone grants it when needed)?* Are credentials shared (team accounts, jump boxes) or strictly individual + SSO?**3. Debugging real issues**When you hit a bug that *only* shows up with real production data, what do you actually do?* Point a debug build at prod?* Query the prod DB/warehouse directly?* Ask a DBA / data / platform team to pull what you need? How often does this happen for you (roughly per week / month)?**4. Data residency / regional rules in practice**If you’re **outside** the region where the data “should” live (e.g. you’re in the US/UK, data is “EU-only”): what’s the real process?* You still query it directly (VPN/bastion/etc.)* Someone *in-region* runs queries / exports for you* You rely on pre-built tooling / dashboards and never see raw rows Are there any “unofficial” workflows (Slack messages like “hey can you run this query for me from EU?”)?**5. Guardrails & horror stories*** Do you have masking / RLS / separate views specifically for debugging?* Any guardrails like time-limited accounts, strict audit logs, approvals, etc.?* Have you seen any near-misses or incidents related to prod access (accidental UPDATE without WHERE, GDPR concerns, etc.)?**6. If you could change one thing*** If you had a magic wand, what’s the first thing you’d fix in your current “debugging with prod data” setup? (Could be policy, tooling, process, anything.)Feel free to anonymize company names, but rough industry and team size (e.g. “EU fintech, \~50 engineers” or “US B2B SaaS, mixed EU/US users”) would be super helpful for context.Really curious how different teams balance “we need real prod data to fix this” with “we don’t want everyone to have God-mode on prod”.",5,0.7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ovxzl7/how_does_your_team_handle_debugging_with/,2025-11-13 10:48:31,2025-11-17 01:42:24

I needed:\- handles ""real-world"" CSV including edge cases such as double-quotes in the middle of values with no surrounding quotes, embedded newlines, different types of newlines, data rows that might have a different number of columns from the first row, multi-row headers etc\- fast and memory efficient. None of the python CSV packages performed remotely close to what I needed. Certain C based ones such \`mlr\` were also orders of magnitude too slow. xsv was in the right ballpark\- compiles for any target OS and for web assembly\- compiles to library API that can be easily integrated with any programming languageAt that time, SIMD was just becoming available on every chip so a friend and I tried dozens of approaches to leveraging that technology while still meeting the above goals. The result is the zsv parser which is faster than any other parser we've tested (even xsv).With parser built, I added other parser nice-to-haves such as both a pull and a push API, and then added a CLI. Most of the CLI commands are run-of-the-mill stuff: echo, select, count, sql, pretty, 2tsv, stack.Some of the commands are harder to find in other utilities: compare (cell-level comparison with customizable numerical tolerance-- useful when, for example, comparing CSV vs data from a deconstructed XLSX, where the latter may look the same but technically differ by < 0.000001), serialize/flatten, 2json (multiple different JSON schema output choices). A few are not directly CSV-related, but dovetail with others, such as 2db, which converts 2json output to sqlite3 with indexing options, allowing you to run e.g. \`zsv 2json my.csv --unique-index mycolumn | zsv 2db -t mytable -o my.db\`.I've been using zsv for years now in commercial software running bare metal and also in the browser (for a simple in-browser example, see [https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/](https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/)), and we've just tagged our first release.Hope you find some use out of it-- if so, give it a star, and feel free to post any questions / comments / suggestions to a new issue.[https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv)",6,0.87,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ouf9je/zsv_a_fast_simdbased_csv_parser_and_cli/,2025-11-11 17:16:06,2025-11-17 01:42:24

That's when I started the journey of learning how databases are implemented.After a few weeks of research and coding, I've completed the first version of my file-based database. This version is append-only, using LSN to insert, update, delete, and locate records. It also uses a B+ Tree for collection entries, allowing for fast ID:LSN lookup. When the B+ Tree reaches its max size (I've set it to 1500 entries), the tree will be encoded (using my custom encoder) and atomically written to disk before an empty tree takes the old one's place in-memory.I'm sure I'm there are things that I'm doing wrong, as this is my first time researching how databases work and are optimized. So, I'd like feedback on the code or even the concept of this library itself.Just wanna state that this wasn't vibe-coded at all. I don't know whether it's my pride or the fear that AI will stunt my growth, but I make a point to write my code myself. I did bounce ideas off of it, though. So there's bound to be some mistakes made while I tried to implement some of them.",3,0.81,2,https://github.com/neisanworks/neisandb/pkgs/npm/neisandb,2025-11-13 17:20:14,2025-11-17 01:42:24

In third try, I kept all the settings same as 2, but this time changed the max concurrent connections from blank to 10 and it worked. I can't figure out why changing max concurrent connections to 10 worked because adf automatically chooses the appropriate connections based on the data.

1oucznb,Tips for managing time series & geospatial data,beiendbjsi788bkbejd,dataengineering,"I work as a data engineer in a an organisation which ingests a lot of time series data: telemetry data (5k sensors with mostly 15 min. intervals, sometimes 1. min. intervals.), manual measurements (couple of hundred every month), batch time series (couple of hundred every month with 15 min. interval) etc. Scientific models are built on top of this data, and are published and used by other companies.These time series often get corrected in hindsight, because they're calibrated, find out a sensor has been influenced by unexpected phenomena, or have had the wrong settings to begin with. How do I deal best with this type of data as a data engineer? Putting data into a quarantine time agreed upon with the owner of the data source, and only publishing it after? If data changes significantly, models need to be re-run, which can be very time consuming.For data exploration, the time series + location data are displayed in a hydrological application, while a basic interface would probably suffice. We'd need a simple interface to display all of these time series (also deducted ones, in total maybe 5k), point locations and polygons, and connect them together. What applications would you recommend? With preference managed applications, and otherwise simple frameworks with little maintenance. Maybe Dash + TimescaleDB / PostGIS?What other theory could be valuable to me in this job and where can I find it?",3,0.81,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oucznb/tips_for_managing_time_series_geospatial_data/,2025-11-11 15:52:45,2025-11-17 01:42:24

If I could go back, I'd start with something a bit more challenging that actually teaches you the fundamentals.**2. Don't rely on AI chatbots.**I spent months having chatbots ""help"" me write code.

Stop just following tutorials.**I wasted months cloning tutorials, thinking I was learning. Most of it didn't stick. The moment I started building tiny projects I actually cared about, things finally clicked.

The one skill I've always prided myself on is my adaptability. I pick things up pretty fast. The thing is, since I started this job, I feel like my stress and anxiety have been really high. It's not my boss, because honestly the work environment and my boss are absolutely amazing. They've been really supportive and encourage me to ask more questions, and they have told me that they know I'm new and will be slow, and with time and understanding I'll get faster, but I'm really paranoid that it's been 4 months and even though I'm a bit faster, I'm still pretty slow and for the past 3 months or so, I've been delivering tasks later than I'm supposed to, sometimes by a day or two, sometimes even longer. I feel like the stress is really clouding my thinking and it's causing me to feel really overwhelmed, and because I'm not able to get done within the working hours, I've been working off the clock too, and it feels like practically every waking hour I'm either worried about work or I'm working. Even my dreams are work related now. I feel like I'm not too bad yet, because I'm somehow still functioning, but I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a breakdown. The other day, I was really stressed out about not being able to complete work on time, and the team was testing the product, and found a bug in some code I had written a week ago. It was really minor, a change that I'd forgotten to push, but for some reason I started panicking a lot over it, and ended up leaving office early because I started to feel dizzy. Earlier this week, I was so stressed out while working from home that I straight up cried for almost an entire day. I've communicated the stress aspect with my boss a little bit, and he's been really understanding and kind, telling me that he understands that people don't function well under stress, asking why I'm feeling this way, if changing the scope of my work would help, and encouraging me to ask others for help more. He even told me I have an excellent work ethic, and that his only feedback for me so far is that I need to communicate more, rather than just giving status updates.The thing is, I don't know how to get out of my own head about this. I feel like I'm the slowest one at work, and everyone at work seems to know what they're doing. I feel like I am really far behind them in terms of skill, and it makes me even more worried about the fact that I'm slow. There isn't any external indication that they may fire me anytime soon, and I know that this is just a job and others will come along, but I just, don't know what to do. I barely have a life outside work, my parents are always worried when I call, because I barely talk to them, and when I do talk to them about how I'm doing, they're worried that I may be depressed or that the job is too much for me. I'm also really scared that I might be pushing the limits with how understanding my boss is.

This is my pragmatic breakdown of monads in practice.In essence there are two distinct topics that concern monads:* Purity* Chaining of operations / compositionKey points i have gathered so far, correct me please:* Monads wrap around other ""things""* The ""thing"" the monad wraps around can be operated on within the monad * This operation can also be a ""chain of operations"", monads can do many things internally while appearing to be ""one abstract step"" on the outside* Monads that ""do something"" (= arent simply context), like IO, are ""lazy"". They are representation for computations that are yet to run (unrelated to lazy vs strict languages)* The ""result"" of the monad can be retrieved/calculated and we call that retrieval ""unwrapping""* Making, baking, and eating the monad are pure operations, from an outside perspective, while the inside of the monad *could* practically do whatever impure nonsense it wants * They always are 100% pure ""representations of 1) a value within a context or 2) an operation that produces a value"" * Some have impure operations. For example doing I/O * The impure operation is abstracted away (into oblivion) so the process that ""runs"" the monad does not have to and cannot care about the purity implications of the operation, it simply cares about ""in -> out""If all above points are correctly describing them, monads are not ""that difficult to understand"", so I have to have missed something, right?I guess the biggest hurdle towards understanding monads stems from them coming in many different flavors... Maybe *seems different* from IO when looking from the side, But looking each of them straight in the face they both ""let you get a value, no matter what they have to do to get that value"".",10,0.92,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ot3bss/ignoring_the_burrito_analogy_breaking_down_monads/,2025-11-10 03:27:59,2025-11-17 01:42:25

1oybuhw,Is MSIX Packaging Tool a pile of horseshit for anyone else?,donotfire,learnprogramming,"I realize this might not be within the rules of the sub. If not, I’m sorry.Rant time. If you don’t want to hear a rant, leave now. I’ve tried 30 times to make an MSIX package using the tool from an installer I made that works perfectly fucking fine. The process is completely unpredictable, the only thing I know with certainty is that it will fail. Well, one time I managed to make a working package but I was unable to reproduce it even when doing the exact same thing.The error logs. When I look at the error logs, it is like Greek. It makes no fucking sense. It will tell me I had a file name that was too long. Which file? No clue. What the filename was? Not provided. Utter horseshit. Another example: it tells me a file name somewhere in my 1.5GB of dependencies has an incorrect character. Which one? Who fucking knows. Horse shit.Meanwhile, you can download Advanced Installer to do the work for you. Oh wait, the professional license you need to make an MSIX installer is SIX HUNDRED fucking dollars; straight up evil. It’s like they know how fucking shit this process is and decided to take advantage of the pain. I honestly don’t know how anyone gets an app onto the Microsoft store. It seems impossible for a team of one, me, to do this. This process is so bureaucratic and bloated that you need about 20 different identifiers over your numerous files to all line up, just so you can say “yup, I made this.” Horse shit. Not to mention the signing process which is annoying as fuck.On the MSIX Packaging Tool, if your thing fails for whatever reason, you have to restart the process, meaning you have to uninstall your app, remove any extraneous files, restart your computer for good measure, and have a perfect working environment because it “watches” you install your app. What a great fucking idea. I’m sure nothing would interfere with that, ever.I’m angry. I’m pissed the fuck off. I have wasted so much time on this. I just want to submit something to the fucking Microsoft store. Why is that so fucking brutally hard? I have a perfectly working .exe installer and they could look at my source code for all I care. It’s so dumb.I’m tired. I guess I just won’t submit an app to the Microsoft store. Their loss. Assholes.

1oy9jzz,Where to go after you're no longer a beginner?,ToeConsumer420,learnprogramming,"Hello, I've been using Lua and Unity for a bit now. I understand the basics of creating simple programs using functions, loops, etc. I also understand OOP and Functional programming, but now I am a little stuck. I've been wondering if I should try to learn C or C++ next? I understand C++ as C but with additional functionality and tools, but I don't know what those specific tools are.I like learning about how computers work under the hood and wish to expand my knowledge but don't know which one to choose. I am likely looking into getting a CS degree and want a head start before I start applying and want to expand my knowledge and understanding.After that, I don't know exactly what kind of project I should make. If you have any suggestions, that'd be greatly appreciated! I want more to do projects for the sake of learning over any practicality. If you have any books you find to be helpful, please send them. I like having something in my room full of information that reminds me to try to complete it. If you have any online resources, that'd be appreciated as a stepping point for the book.Thanks in advance!EDIT: I should've clarified my question to ""after you're no longer a COMPLETE beginner."" Another thing I should've clarified is my understanding. I should've said now that I have a simple understanding of OOP and functional programming, not an understanding.

1oundq4,How do you deploy the backend for your project?,Lavaa444,learnprogramming,"I run into this situation a lot when programming full-stack apps. Paricularly, with my most recent project.I am making a Chrome extension, and without getting into details, it has a Flask backend that the app needs to request in order to work, because the library it uses is not available in JavaScript land.Naturally, when I found out that you have to deploy the backend in order to use it in production, I was hesitant, because if it's just going to be on the web, anyone can take the URL and request it even from outside the extension. I don't have anything expensive going on now, but if I did, that would not be good at all. I can't imagine tech companies deploying backends that way. So, what can I do?Ideally, I would only allow the backend to be requested from inside the app itself, not as a separate thing, but I haven't heard of a way to do that.I suppose what I'm getting at is: if your project has some API on the backend that you want to protect, what can you do about it?

If someone using Interview Coder performs like a top 1% developer, should we consider that ""cheating,"" or does it suggest that our interview process was never as robust as we thought? Perhaps the definition of merit is evolving from “I can solve this alone” to “I know how to use tools effectively.”",7,0.89,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1otmr5n/tools_like_interview_coder_are_making_me_rethink/,2025-11-10 19:05:50,2025-11-17 01:42:25

How do I recover?,Muted_Protection_383,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone,I'm a junior dev and I just spent the last few weeks building a passion project, EduRank - a modern professor rating app for students. I went all-in on the frontend, but I completely botched the backend and now I'm stuck. I could really use some advice on how to dig myself out of this hole.What I Built (The Good part): · Tech Stack: React Native, TypeScript, React Native Reanimated · The Look: A custom iOS 26 ""Liquid Glass"" inspired UI. · The Feel: Buttery 60fps animations, a type-safe codebase with zero errors, and optimized transitions. · Status: The entire frontend is basically done. It's a high-fidelity prototype. I can even show you a screen recording of how smooth it is.Where I Failed (The ugly part ):· The Mistake: I started coding with ZERO backend design or data model. I just started putting stuff in Firestore as I went along. · The Stack: Firebase Auth & Firestore. · The Problem: My database structure is a complete mess. It's not scalable, the relationships between users, universities, professors, and reviews are tangled, and I'm now terrified to write more queries because nothing makes sense anymore. I basically built a beautiful sports car with a lawnmower engine.What I’m blabbing about is:1.⁠How do I approach untangling this? Do I just nuke the entire Firestore database and start over with a clean plan?2.⁠What are the key questions I should be asking myself when designing the data structure for an app like this?3.⁠Are there any good resources (articles, videos) on designing Firestore structures for complex relational data?4.⁠If you were to sketch a basic data model for this, what would the top-level collections be and how would they relate?Infact what should be my best approach to transitioning to backend then to a Fullstack Developer?

So don’t bogged down by the hype.[Twitter post](https://xcancel.com/AndrewYNg/status/1989003741316673714)[Blog post](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-327/)Highlighting the most relevant bits:> Andrew Ng @AndrewYNg > I recently received an email titled “An 18-year-old’s dilemma: Too late to contribute to AI?” Its author, who gave me permission to share this, is preparing for college. He is worried that by the time he graduates, AI will be so good there’s no meaningful work left for him to do to contribute to humanity, and he will just live on Universal Basic Income (UBI). I wrote back to reassure him that there will still be plenty of work he can do for decades hence, and encouraged him to work hard and learn to build with AI. But this conversation struck me as an example of how harmful hype about AI is.> […]> Even though LLMs can handle a much more general set of tasks than previous iterations of AI technology, compared to what humans can do, they are still highly specialized. They’re much better at working with text than other modalities, still require lots of custom engineering to get it the right context for a particular application, and we have few tools — and only inefficient ones — for getting our systems to learn from feedback and repeated exposure to a specific task (such as screening resumés for a particular role).> […]> AI has stark limitations, and despite rapid improvements, it will remain limited compared to humans for a long time.> […]> Modern AI is a general purpose technology that is enabling many applications, but AI that can do any intellectual tasks that a human can (a popular definition for AGI) is still decades away or longer. This nuanced message that AI is general, but not that general, often is lost in the noise of today's media environment.> […]> Similarly, the progress of frontier models is amazing! But not so amazing that they’ll be able to do everything under the sun without a lot of customization. I know VC investors who are scared to invest in application-layer startups because they are worried that frontier AI model companies will quickly wipe out all of these businesses by improving their models.

I was laid off ~1.5 months ago from my previous firm and worked with a specialized headhunter who focuses on placing prop trading SW and FPGA engineers. I didn't personally submit any applications—everything was handled by my HH. We applied to eight firms/quant funds in a targeted fashion. My HH's relationship with certain firms allowed me to bypass a few bureaucratic HR stages and get in front of hiring managers immediately.This was my first time on the market as a Senior and my interview experience mostly aligned with how I chose to prepare. The mix of questions I encountered was roughly 9:1 domain-specific C++ to LeetCode-style DSA. There were a bunch of questions on deep C++ features, trading-specific minutiae (exchange protocols, executing a low latency strategy on a particular exchange), lock-free algo knowledge, etc. Ironically, the rounds that tripped me up the most _were_ LeetCode-style questions, so I regret not doing more than the 10-15 questions I practiced but overall my preparation was accurate.I withdrew from the interview process at three firms since I received a solid offer from a firm I liked (on a desk/team I liked as well). I anticipate I would've gotten another 1-2 offers had I seen those through to the end but I was satisfied.* Timeline from start of search to offer: 1 month* TC: ~$500K* Location: Chicago* Preparation: 10-15 LeetCode questions and implementing dozens of lock-free/high-performance data structures in C++.

I think I need a reality check, especially from those who have worked in this field for a number of years.**TL;DR:** Top-tier education (CS PhD). Landed a quant developer job at a fund in a low-tax / no-tax region. Pay is relatively good (\~$185k tax-free money). Job was a ""bait-and-switch"", which went from building cool new tech to endless data-munging. I'm miserable and have lost passion for coding.**My Background:*** **Education:** PhD in CS (Systems and Networking) from a top Asian university. BSc from another top Asian university.* **Current Role:** 1 year as a quant developer at a financial firm (think HFT or fund) in a major hub with very low / no taxes.**The ""Golden Handcuffs"":*** **Salary:** In the $180-190k USD range, tax-free.* **Perks:** Good vacation and remote policy.**The ""Bait-and-Switch"" Problem:*** The first 6 months was great. I was tasked with a challenging R&D project using a modern tech stack (Rust), which I had to learn on the fly. It was exactly what I wanted.* Afterwards, that project was suddenly and quietly de-prioritized. My manager reassigned me to what is effectively a data integration role. My entire job now is just endless, repetitive grunt work, fighting with terrible data formats from vendors and doing basic ETL.* To make it worse, the senior devs on the team have all managed to get themselves onto new, interesting projects, leaving me and other juniors to handle this ""data plumbing."" Management is vague when I raise concerns. Changing teams isn't an option either.I feel that my passion for coding is gone, extinguished by this job. I feel miserable and am experiencing burnout symptoms. I have zero energy or interest in side projects or open source (which I was quite keen on before).**My Questions:**1. Is this loss of passion just a temporary reaction to this specific job? Or is it a sign I'll just end up in another ""boredom -> misery"" cycle if I change jobs?2. Am I just being an entitled or lazy person who ""hates all work""? The relatively decent salary makes me feel incredibly guilty for complaining.3. What's a viable path?

1ovrqsj,Leaving job for founding engineer role?,happishly,cscareerquestions,"For context I am currently employed as a SWE in Texas. MCOL. I am currently making 135k at 2 YOE for a big boring mega corp (5 days RTO), not a tech company. I personally know founders of a YC backed startup that’s post revenue. They want to bring me in as a founding engineer. They are based in SF and are offering me $185k base with 2% equity. I do believe the company can be successful as they already have clients. I know the odds of the equity ever being worth anything are quite low as well. However, do you think the move to SF and the opportunity is worth pursuing for career growth? I will be losing the stability of my current company and probably the current WLB, but I don’t want this to be window that closes that I regret in 10 years.

1otfdox,Nine months into a Vue dev job and I feel like I’m failing. Any advice from those who have experienced this?,HYV_Empathy,cscareerquestions,"For context, I'm 27m and I used to work as a team lead for high-level FE development (HTML/JS/CSS only work, basically). My role was basically Technical Project Manager (who sometimes writes code or makes websites) by the end of it, and I was hating it. I wanted to leave management and get back to development, so I self-taught Vue and React basics to the point of being able to pass an interview and learn on the job.About 9 months ago, I got a new job as a Vue developer. During the interview process, my now-boss said that she understood the level to which I understood Vue was below what they'd expect of an employee, but they were willing to train me.Perfect! That's exactly what I was looking for, especially since the money was a significant increase compared to what I was earning in my old role as a team lead, so I thought I'd struck gold. And for the first 6 months, it felt that way.Going from knowing Vue at a hobby/passing activity level to a professional level was a difficult climb, but I felt like I was still making progress each day.Lately, however, I have felt like a wasted paycheck and a burden to the team. My main mentor figure changed departments as experienced resource was needed elsewhere, and while I have people I can still reach out to for help, I just keep hitting block after block and feel over-reliant on them.We use Sentry for bug management, and I absolutely cannot stand it. I keep trying to investigate issues, get stuck, reach out to a colleague only for them to say ""Oh, that's likely due to xyz"" when ""xyz"" never even crossed my mind.It feels like I've been plateaued for months now, and I can't get past it. I asked my now-boss for help a while back, and she's given me the advice of ""When you encounter something you don't understand, research the technology."" along with ""Create a simpler, working version of the part that's broken, then try and apply that logic.""This advice is great...for simple issue that can be Googled or technology I understand the concepts of. If I see ""Axios error 123"" or ""Apollo error: this is what's wrong..."" then brilliant! I can read the documentation!But for more vague issues like ""This is our component that's nested in 13 other components, it's not working as intended, figure out why."" I can SOMETIMES get to the bottom of it, but I have just kept hitting walls of bugs where someone who wrote the system is needed because they understand how it works (the company seems entirely averse to adding comments explaining their code).What I'm struggling with is I just don't know if I enjoy this anymore. A few months ago, I LOVED my job - I'd hit the gold mine and life was going great.Lately though...I have spoken to a therapist and three separate GPs who signed me off for the last two weeks due to ""Acute stress reaction"" (probably not allowed to go into detail on this sub). I'd done a lot of thinking and soul-searching over the last two weeks, hit today (my first day back) with a positive attitude, and yet within 4 hours I'd returned to my habit of crying at my desk.It doesn't help that I work from home, since I'm alone in my room all the time. We go to the office once a week, but I'm the only one from my department and actually works on this codebase who goes in, so I just end up working in a room full of people who are more intelligent and experienced than me, but have never looked at a single line of code that I'm responsible for working on.I just feel stuck. I want to love this job and this career, but the way this job has made me feel lately...it's not living.Has anyone else experienced this? Going from light FE work (HTML, JS, and CSS only) to Vue/React development, picking up the basics, and then just hitting a brick wall 9 months later?Does anyone have any advice?P.S. My therapist has recently advised she thinks I have ADHD, and that perfectionism and unreasonable standards for myself are some of my symptoms and trigger my mental overload/shutdown when I hit my fifth brick wall of the day.

1oxdjf3,While do I always fail hiring manager screening round?,qrcode23,cscareerquestions,"Hey fellow dev,The job search has been rough these past couple of months. Ever since the H1B visa tax changes, I’ve seen an uptick in interview requests, but landing offers is still proving to be a real challenge. Many companies have packed interview calendars, which makes scheduling and momentum tough. Out of all the interviews I’ve done, I’ve only made it to one on-site so far. In one case, an interviewer even called in sick mid-interview, so I had to reschedule.One company had me go through three phone interviews. The recruiter later told me they’re considering down-leveling me because I don’t have experience with Java Spring—even though I’ve been solid on the technical side. They want one more phone round to “get more signal.”I’ve noticed a pattern: when the phone screen is purely technical, I tend to do well—about half the time I make it to the onsite. But I’ve never cleared a hiring manager screening round in my entire career. Ironically, I’ve passed hiring manager interviews during onsites, probably because they’ve already seen strong technical feedback by then.Over the past month, I’ve been working on STAR-formatting my past impact stories and aligning them with the usual “ideal corporate teammate” attributes. Still, I’m not sure if I’m hitting the mark.One recent hiring manager screen was especially tricky. It was a 30-minute video call. The first half was standard—what I’ve worked on, what technologies I’ve used. Then came the curveball: “Is there anything you don’t like about your current company or would want to change?” I figured dodging it would tank the interview, so I answered honestly. I said that if I were to start a company, I’d invest more in engineering processes and development environment, since I currently spend about 20% of my time firefighting. He followed up by asking what I’ve done about it. For the record, I had raised concerns with my manager (who brushed them off). I told the interviewer that I’ve been pushing for simplification in all aspect.I’ve seen this pattern before—where the interviewer asks what language I prefer for the next step in the interview process (I said Python), and it feels like a setup to give me false hope. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but these interviews are really tough when you’re not naturally social or charismatic.I guess I’m wondering: am I overthinking this? Or are hiring managers just extra picky right now? I’d love to hear how others have navigated this, especially if you’ve struggled with the same kind of behavioral hurdles.Thanks for reading.------------------------------------I've been employed a lot.

I'd say the main problem has been that managers, which feel like a flip of a coin in terms of if it's gonna be a problem. Half the time, we get along perfectly and there's no problems whatsoever. The other half, it seems like the manager disdains me on a nearly personal level. At times, some have even explicitly told me this, saying they don't like me and don't like working with me. It seems like there's nothing I can do to change their mind. I've tried to be perfectly compliant in every way, but it never worksI don't really have a problem working with ""co-equal"" engineers though.

1otvrwv,How do I navigate my current situation to be working on what that matters vs doing what my gut feeling tells me? I have been working with the same employer for past six years,bad_detectiv3,cscareerquestions,"How do I grow from where I am? I feel either I’m losing steam or don’t have a defined plan, hence not truly working toward some goal.My goal is simple — to get or be in a position where I am employable. But to make myself employable, I am either overwhelmed or do not have a clear direction on what to prioritize.I started my career late — I got a true programming job at 28 years old. Since then, I’ve been with my current employer doing Java and legacy C# development for six years. I started job hunting three years ago, on and off. It has been a learning experience since then — crafting my resume better and using the time to upskill in domains like cloud (Azure) and doing mini personal projects to gain exposure to different technologies.In the past three years, I have gone through system design and done LeetCode. Lately, I’ve given up on LeetCode or lost motivation for it since I legitimately believe it’s not providing any real conversion. I have failed onsite not on LeetCode but on general full-stack knowledge — like authentication — or failed system design on “design of a job scheduler.” More importantly, since my day job doesn’t involve building projects from scratch and mostly focuses on enhancing legacy or large codebases, I don’t have real exposure to building, I guess.What can I realistically do right now? What should I prioritize as short-term and long-term goals? For the long term, I feel I’m either at a fork in the road or should use what I have so far and somehow leverage it. Since my background really isn’t related to true backend, DevOps, or cybersecurity — at its core, it’s just debugging and solving proprietary problems.As I type this, I have headhunters reaching out and I have two CodeSignals to complete, but I just don’t feel motivated at all and feel like there’s been a massive waste of time — or that there’s something I’m doing wrong.With that said, my thoughts for next steps are:1. Dive into the world of machine learning to gain exposure to another segment and see if it sticks with me or not.2. Get comfortable with React, which might open doors to building serious full-stack applications — this will give me much-needed hands-on experience in building and deploying solutions end to end. 3. Pursue Azure Solution Architect/DevOps certification — there is an intermediate Azure certification that’s just boring AF, and I lose interest really fast. It deals with group policy and similar things — the stuff an Azure admin would do. Is this something a SWE should really know?4. Skip the whole machine learning world and try exploring MLOps — I found resources on Reddit. My biggest issue is that since they don’t have any certificate or real-life usage at my current workplace, my gut feeling is that after spending months and months, I’ll have nothing to show for it.Given all this, with limited exposure in my day job, how do I leverage my current situation and make the most of it? As of now to 'grow', I will do item 2 since I am fairly comfortable getting the back-end working in either Java/Node.js and deploying to local VMs. Deploying to K8S will be interesting task.Before other folks say it, I should mention transferring to another role within the org is not possible. It will reset promo cycle. Some days, I feel my life would be so much easier if I had just worked at FAANG - it might be fallacy but perhaps working there automatically drives your career to the next level. But as of now, I am not that talented with LC at all. I suffer from ADHD which might be another issue.",5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1otvrwv/how_do_i_navigate_my_current_situation_to_be/,2025-11-11 01:00:54,2025-11-17 01:42:27
