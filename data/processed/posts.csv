1kc2mff,Guess skills are not transferable,vitocomido,dataengineering,Found this on LinkedIn posted by a recruiter. It’s pretty bad if they filter out based on these criteria. It sounds to me like “I’m looking for someone to drive a Toyota but you’ve only driven Honda!”In a field like DE where the tech stack keeps evolving pretty fast I find this pretty surprising that recruiters are getting such instructions from the hiring manager!

1kfdl1e,I f***ing hate Azure,wtfzambo,dataengineering,"*Disclaimer: this post is nothing but a rant.*---I've recently inherited a data project which is almost entirely based in Azure synapse.I can't even begin to describe the level of hatred and despair that this platform generates in me.Let's start with the biggest offender: that being Spark as the only available runtime. Because OF COURSE one MUST USE Spark to move 40 bits of data, god forbid someone thinks a firm has (*gasp!*) small data, even if the amount of companies that actually need a distributed system is less than the amount of fucks I have left to give about this industry as a whole.Luckily, I can soothe my rage by meditating during the downtimes, beacause testing code means that, if your cluster is cold, you have to wait between 2 and 5 business days to see results, meaning that each day one gets 5 meaningful commits in at most. Work-life balance, yay!Second, the bane of any sensible software engineer and their sanity: Notebooks. I believe notebooks are an invention of Satan himself, because there is not a single chance that a benevolent individual made the choice of putting notebooks in production.I know that one day, after the 1000th notebook I'll have to fix, my sanity will eventually run out, and I will start a terrorist movement against notebook users. Either that or I will immolate myself alive to the altar of sound software engineering in the hope of restoring equilibrium.Third, we have the biggest lie of them all, the scam of the century, the slithery snake, the greatest pretender: ""yOu dOn't NEeD DaTA enGINEeers!!1"".Because since engineers are expensive, these idiotic corps had to sell to other even more idiotic corps the lie that with these magical NO CODE tools, even Gina the intern from Marketing can do data pipelines!But obviously, Gina the intern from Marketing has marketing stuff to do, leaving those pipelines uncovered. Who's gonna do them now? Why of course, the same exact data engineers one was trying to replace!Except that instead of being provided with proper engineering toolbox, they now have to deal with an environment tailored for people whose shadow outshines their intellect, castrating the productivity many times over, because dragging arbitrary boxes to get a for loop done is clearly SO MUCH faster and productive than literally anything else.I understand now why our salaries are high: it's not because of the skill required to conduct our job. It's to pay the levels of insanity that we're forced to endure.But don't worry, AI will fix it.",667,0.96,202,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kfdl1e/i_fing_hate_azure/,2025-05-05 14:53:40,2025-05-07 01:40:32
1kb974e,Spark is the new Hadoop,rocketinter,dataengineering,"In this opinionated article I am going to explain why I believe we have reached peak Spark usage and why it is only downhill from here.# Before SparkSome will remember that 12 years ago [Pig](https://pig.apache.org), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) and MapReduce were all the rage. Many of us were under the spell of [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) during those times.# Enter SparkThe brilliant [Matei Zaharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateizaharia/) started working on Spark sometimes before 2010 already, but adoption really only began after 2013. The lazy evaluation and memory leveraging as well as other [innovative features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Tisli7zn4&t=97s) were a huge leap forward and I was dying to try this new promising technology. My then CTO was visionary enough to understand the potential and for years since, I, along with many others, ripped the benefits of an only improving Spark.# The LosersHow many of you recall companies like [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Webinar.HDP2_.20131112.pdf) and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/about.html)? Hortonworks and Cloudera merged after both becoming public, only to be taken private a few years later. Cloudera still exists, but not much more than that.Those companies were yesterday’s [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) and they bet big on the Hadoop ecosystem and not so much on Spark.# Hunting decisionsIn creating Spark, Matei did what any pragmatist would have done, he piggybacked on the existing Hadoop ecosystem. This allowed Spark not to be built from scratch in isolation, but integrate nicely in the Hadoop ecosystem and supporting tools.There is just one problem with the Hadoop ecosystem…it’s exclusively **JVM based**. This decision has fed and made rich thousands of consultants and engineers that have fought with the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) and inconsistent memory issues for years…and still does. The JVM is a solid choice, safe choice, but despite more than 10 years passing and Databricks having the plethora of resources it has, some of Spark's core issues with managing memory and performance just can't be fixed.# The writing is on the wallChange is coming, and few are noticing it ([some do](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This change is happening in all sorts of supporting tools and frameworks.What do [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [Deno](https://deno.com), [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) and the Linux kernel all have in common that no one cares about...for now? They all have a Rust backend or have an increasingly large Rust footprint. These handful of examples are just the tip of the iceberg.Rust is the most prominent example and the forerunner of a set of languages that offer performance, a completely different memory model and some form of usability that is hard to find in market leaders such as C and C++. There is also Zig which similar to Rust, and a bunch of other languages that can be found in TIOBE's top 100.The examples I gave above are all of tools for which the primary target are not Rust engineers but Python or JavaScipt. Rust and other languages that allow easy interoperability are increasingly being used as an efficient reliable backend for frameworks targeted at completely different audiences.There's going to be less of ""by Python developers for Python developers"" looking forward.# Nothing is foreverSpark is here to stay for many years still, hey, Hive is still being used and maintained, but I believe that peak adoption has been reached, there's nowhere to go from here than downhill. Users don't have much to expect in terms of performance and usability looking forward.On the other hand, frameworks like [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io) offer a completely different experience working with data, no strange JVM error messages, no waiting for things to boot, just bliss. Maybe it's not Daft that is going to be the next best thing, but it's inevitable that Spark will be overthroned.# AdaptDatabricks better be ahead of the curve on this one. Instead of using scaremongering marketing gimmicks like labelling the use of engines other than Spark as *Allow External Data Access*, it better ride with the wave.",319,0.91,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kb974e/spark_is_the_new_hadoop/,2025-04-30 05:45:51,2025-05-07 01:40:32

1kbbgjb,Why are more people not excited by Polars?,hositir,dataengineering,"I’ve benchmarked it. For use cases in my specific industry it’s something like x5, x7 more efficient in computation. It looks like it’s pretty revolutionary in terms of cost savings. It’s faster and cheaper.The problem is PySpark is like using a missile to kill a worm. In what I’ve seen, it’s totally overpowered for what’s actually needed. It starts spinning up clusters and workers and all the tasks. I’m not saying it’s not useful. It’s needed and crucial for huge workloads but most of the time huge workloads are not actually what’s needed.Spark is perfect with big datasets and when huge data lake where complex computation is needed. It’s a marvel and will never fully disappear for that.Also Polars syntax and API is very nice to use. It’s written to use only one node. By comparison Pandas syntax is not as nice (my opinion). And it’s computation is objectively less efficient. It’s simply worse than Polars in nearly every metric in efficiency terms.I cant publish the stats because it’s in my company enterprise solution but search on open Github other people are catching on and publishing metrics.Polars uses Lazy execution, a Rust based computation (Polars is a Dataframe library for Rust). Plus Apache Arrow data format.It’s pretty clear it occupies that middle ground where Spark is still needed for 10GB/ terabyte / 10-15 million row+ datasets. Pandas is useful for small scripts (Excel, Csv) or hobby projects but Polars can do everything Pandas can do and faster and more efficiently.Spake is always there for the those use cases where you need high performance but don’t need to call in artillery. Its syntax means if you know Spark is pretty seamless to learn.I predict as well there’s going to be massive porting to Polars for ancestor input datasets.You can use Polars for the smaller inputs that get used further on and keep Spark for the heavy workloads. The problem is converting to different data frames object types and data formats is tricky. Polars is very new.Many legacy stuff in Pandas over 500k rows where costs is an increasing factor or cloud expensive stuff is also going to see it being used.",175,0.95,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kbbgjb/why_are_more_people_not_excited_by_polars/,2025-04-30 08:27:02,2025-05-07 01:40:32
1kf661p,What does the Director of Data and Analytics do in your org?,ivanovyordan,dataengineering,"I'm the Head of Data Engineering in a British Fintech.

It's my responsibility not only to take code (I love this part of the job), but also to develop a long-term data strategy. Think about team structure, infrastructure, tooling, governance, and everything in that direction.I can confidently say, every big initiative we worked on in the last couple of years came from me.So, when I applied for this position, the current director (ex-analyst), who's leaving and the VP of Finance (think CFO) interviewed me. On the second stage, they asked me to analyse some data.I'm not talking about analysing it strategically, but about building a dashboard and talking to them through.My numbers were off compared to what we have in reality, but I thought they had altered them. At the ned of the day, I don't even think it's legal to share this information with candidates.When they rejected me, they used many words to explain that they needed an analyst for this role.My understanding is that a director role means more strategy and larger-scale solutions. It is more stakeholder handholding.

1kbctlt,Reflecting On A Year's Worth of Data Engineer Work,imperialka,dataengineering,"Hey All,I've had an incredible year and I feel extremely lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm a relatively new DE, but I've covered so much ground even in one year.I'm not perfect, but I can feel my growth. Every day I am learning something new and I'm having such joy improving on my craft, my passion, and just loving my experience each day building pipelines, debugging errors, and improving upon existing infrastructure.As I look back I wanted to share some gems or bits of valuable knowledge I've picked up along the way:* Showing up in person to the office matters. Your communication, attitude, humbleness, kindness, and selflessness goes a long way and gets noticed. Your relationship with your client matters a lot and being able to be in person means you are the go-to engineer when people need help, education, and fixing things when they break. Working from home is great, but there are more opportunities when you show up for your client in person.* pre-commit hooks are valuable in creating quality commits. Automatically check yourself even before creating a PR. Use hooks to format your code, scan for errors with linters, etc.* Build pipelines with failure in mind. Always factor in exception handling, error logging, and other tools to gracefully handle when things go wrong.* DRY - such as a basic principle but easy to forget. Any time you are repeating yourself or writing code that is duplicated, it's time to turn that into a function. And if you need to keep track of state, use OOP.* Learn as much as you can about CI/CD. The bugs/issues in CI/CD are a different beast, but peeling back the layers it's not so bad. Practice your understanding of how it all works, it's crucial in DE.* OOP is a valuable tool. But you need to know when to use it, it's not a hammer you use at every problem. I've seen examples of unnecessary OOP where a FP paradigm was better suited. Practice, practice, practice.* Build pipelines that heal themselves and parametrize them so users can easily re-run them for data recovery. Use watermarks to know when the last time a table was last updated in the data lake and create logic so that the pipeline will know to recover data from a certain point in time.* Be the documentation king/queen. Use docstrings, type hints, comments, markdown files, CHANGELOG files, README, etc. throughout your code, modules, packages, repo, etc. to make your work as clear, intentional, and easy to read as possible. Make it easy to spread this information using an appropriate knowledge management solution like Confluence.* Volunteer to make things better without being asked. Update legacy projects/repos with the latest code or package. Build and create the features you need to make DE work easier. For example, auto-tagging commits with the version number to easily go back to the snapshot of a repo with a long history.* Unit testing is important. Learn pytest framework, its tools, and practice making your code modular to make unit tests easier to create.* Create and use a DE repo template using cookiecutter to create consistency in repo structures in all DE projects and include common files (yaml, .gitignore, etc.).* Knowledge of fundamental SQL if valuable in understanding how to manipulate data. I found it made it easier understanding pandas and pyspark frameworks.",101,0.9,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kbctlt/reflecting_on_a_years_worth_of_data_engineer_work/,2025-04-30 10:07:50,2025-05-07 01:40:32

1kdhmnn,Did I approach this data engineering system design challenge the right way?,bdadeveloper,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I recently completed a data engineering screening at a startup and now I’m wondering if my approach was right and how other engineers would approach or what more experienced devs would look for. The screening was around 50 minutes, and they had me share my screen and use a blank Google Doc to jot down thoughts as needed — I assume to make sure I wasn’t using AI.The Problem:“How would you design a system to ingest ~100TB of JSON data from multiple S3 buckets”My Approach (thinking out loud, real-time mind you):•I proposed chunking the ingestion (~1TB at a time) to avoid memory overload and increase fault tolerance.•Stressed the need for a normalized target schema, since JSON structures can vary slightly between sources and timestamps may differ.•Suggested Dask for parallel processing and transformation, using Python (I’m more familiar with it than Spark).•For ingestion, I’d use boto3 to list and pull files, tracking ingestion metadata like source_id, status, and timestamps in a simple metadata catalog (Postgres or lightweight NoSQL).•Talked about a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold):•Bronze: raw JSON copies•Silver: cleaned & normalized data•Gold: enriched/aggregated data for BI consumptionWhat clicked mid-discussion:After asking a bunch of follow-up questions, I realized the data seemed highly textual, likely news articles or similar. I was asking so many questions lol.That led me to mention:•Once the JSON is cleaned and structured (title, body, tags, timestamps), it makes sense to vectorize the content using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence-BERT, etc.).•You could then store this in a vector database (like Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate) to support semantic search.•Techniques like cosine similarity could allow you to cluster articles, find duplicates, or offer intelligent filtering in the downstream dashboard (e.g., “Show me articles similar to this” or group by theme).They seemed interested in the retrieval angle and I tied this back to the frontend UX, because I deduced the target of the end data was a front end dashboard that would be in front of a client The part that tripped me up:They asked: “What would happen if the source data (e.g., from Amazon S3) went down?”My answer was:“As soon as I ingest a file, I’d immediately store a copy in our own controlled storage layer — ideally following a medallion model — to ensure we can always roll back or reprocess without relying on upstream availability.”Looking back, I feel like that was a decent answer, but I wasn’t 100% sure if I framed it well. I could’ve gone deeper into S3 resiliency, versioning, or retry logic.What I didn’t do:•I didn’t write much in the Google Doc — most of my answers were verbal.•I didn’t live code — I just focused on system design and real-world workflows.•I sat back in my chair a bit (was calm), maintained decent eye contact, and ended by asking them real questions (tools they use, scraping frameworks, and why they liked the company, etc.).Of course nobody here knows what they wanted, but now I’m wondering if my solution made sense (I’m new to data engineering honestly):•Should I have written more in the doc to “prove” I wasn’t cheating or to better structure my thoughts?•Was the vectorization + embedding approach appropriate, or overkill?•Did my fallback answer about S3 downtime make sense ?",82,0.98,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kdhmnn/did_i_approach_this_data_engineering_system/,2025-05-03 01:42:09,2025-05-07 01:40:32

Where it falls short is if we need to do any sort of analytical work. As soon as the queries get complex, the time to complete skyrockets. I started using duckDB and that helped tremendously. The only issue was the scaffolding every time just so I could do some querying was tedious and the overall experience is pretty terrible when you compare writing SQL in a notebook or script vs an editor.I liked the duckDB UI but the non-persistent nature causes a lot of headache. This led me to build [soarSQL](https://soarsql.com/) which is a duckDB powered SQL editor. soarSQL has quickly become my default SQL editor at work because it makes working with OLTP databases a breeze.

1kbt10i,An open-source framework to build analytical backends,Playful_Show3318,dataengineering,"Hey all! Over the years, I’ve worked at companies as small as a team of 10 and at organizations with thousands of data engineers, and I’ve seen wildly different philosophies around analytical data.Some organizations go with the ""build it and they will come"" data lake approach, broadly ingesting data without initial structure, quality checks, or governance, and later deriving value via a medallion architecture.Others embed governed analytical data directly into their user-facing or internal operations apps. These companies tend to treat their data like core backend services managed with a focus on getting schemas, data quality rules, and governance right from the start. Similar to how transactional data is managed in a classic web app.I’ve found that most data engineering frameworks today are designed for the former state, Airflow, Spark, and DBT really shine when there’s a lack of clarity around how you plan on leveraging your data. I’ve spent the past year building an open-source framework around a data stack that's built for the latter case (clickhouse, redpanda, duckdb, etc)—when companies/teams know what they want to do with their data and need to build analytical backends that power user-facing or operational analytics quickly.The framework has the following core principles behind it:1. Derive as much of the infrastructure as possible from the business logic to minimize the amount of boilerplate2. Enable a local developer experience so that I could build my analytical backends right alongside my Frontend (in my office, in the desert, or on plane)3. Leverage data validation standards— like types and validation libraries such as pydantic or typia—to enforce data quality controls and make testing easy4. Build in support for the best possible analytical infra while keeping things extensible to incrementally support legacy and emerging analytical stacks5. Support the same languages we use to build transactional apps. I started with Python and TypeScript but I plan to expand to othersThe framework is still in beta and it’s now used by teams at big and small companies to build analytical backends. I’d love some feedback from this communityYou can take it for a spin by starting from a boilerplate starter project:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart)Or you can start from a pre-built project template for a more realistic example:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates)",23,0.79,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kbt10i/an_opensource_framework_to_build_analytical/,2025-04-30 22:15:45,2025-05-07 01:40:32

1kdfzoi,A data lake + warehouse architecture for fast-moving startups,wearz_pantz,dataengineering,"I have this idea for a data lake/data warehouse architecture for my startup that I've come to based on a few problems I've experienced, I'd like to hear this subreddits' thoughts.The start up I work for has been dancing around product-market fit for several years, but hasn't quite nailed it. We though we had it in 2020 but then zero-interest rate ended, then AI, and now we're back to the drawing board. The mandate from leadership has been to re-imagine what our product can be. This means lots of change and we need to be highly nimble.Today, I follow an ELT approach. I use a combination of 3rd party ingestion tools+custom jobs to load data, then dbt to build assets (tables/views) in BigQuery that I make available to various stakeholders. My transformation pipeline looks like the following:1. staging - light transformations and 1:1 with raw source tables2. intermediate - source data integrated/conformed/cleansed3. presentation - final clean pre-joined,pre-aggregated data loosely resembling a Kimball-style star schemaStaging and intermediate layers are part of a transformation step and often change, are deleted, or otherwise break as I refactor to support the presentation layer.[Current architecture which provides either 1 type of guarantee or no guarantee](https://preview.redd.it/lw8za6s3ggye1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36ac4259058bcce5ae72fbdef1e8bb7ec2e2eb5)This approach has worked to a degree. I serve a large variety of use cases and have limited data quality issues, enough that my org has started to form a team around me. But, it has created several problems that have been exacerbated by this new agility mandate from leadership:1. As a team of one and growing, it takes me too long to integrate new data into the presentation layer. This results in an inability for me to make data available fast enough to everyone who needs it, which leads to shadow and/or manual data efforts by my stakeholders2. To avoid the above I often resort to granting access to staging and intermediate layer data so that teams are unblocked. However, I often need to refactor staging/intermediate layers to appropriately support changes to the presentation layer. These refactors introduce breaking changes which creates issues/bugs in dependent workflows/dashboards. I've been disciplined about communicating to stakeholders about the risks involved, but it happens often.3. Lots of teams want a dev version of data so they can create proof-of-concepts, and develop on my data. However many of our source systems have dev/prod environments that don't integrate in the same way. ex. join keys between 2 systems' data that work in prod are not available in dev, so the highly integrated nature of the presentation layer makes it impossible to produce exact replicas of dev and prod.To solve these problems I've been considering am architectural solution that I think makes sense for a fast-moving startup... I'm proposing we break the data assets into 2 categories of data contract...1. **source-dependent**. These assets would be fast to create and make available. They are merely a replica of the data in the source system with a thin layer of abstraction (likely a single dbt model) with guarantees against changes by me/my team, but would not provide guarantees against irreconcilable changes in the source system (ie. if the source system is removed). These would also have basic documentation and metadata for discoverability. They would be similar to the staging layer in my old architecture, but rather than being an unstable step in a transformation pipeline, where refactors introduce breaking, they are standalone assets. These would also provide the ability to create dev and prod version since they are not deeply integrated with other sources. ex. \`salesforce\_\_opportunities\` all opportunities from salesforce. As long as the opportunity object in Salesforce exists, and we continue to use Salesforce as our CRM, the model will be stable/dependable.2. **source-agnostic**. The assets would be the same as the presentation layer I have today. They would be a more complex abstraction of multiple source systems, and provide guarantees against underlying changes to source systems. We would be judicious about where and when we create these. ex. \`opportunities\`. As long as our business cares about opportunities/deals etc. no matter if we change CRM's or the same CRM changes their contract, this will be stable/dependable[Proposed architecture which breaks assets into 2 types with different guarantees](https://preview.redd.it/mqt2ojo7ggye1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=070c5524998a56569b96fda3201a4567489cd89d)The hope is that source-dependent assets can be used to unblock new data use cases quickly with a reasonable level of stability, and source-agnostic assets can be used to support critical/frequented data use-cases with a high level of stability.Specifically I'm curious about:1. General thoughts on this approach. Risks/warnings/vibe-check.2. Other ways to do this I should consider. It's hard to find good resources on how to deliver stable data assets/products at a fast-moving startup with limited data resourcing.

1kda94y,dbt to PySpark,tripple69,dataengineering,Hi allI’ve got two pipelines built using dbt where I have bunch of sql and python models. I’m looking to migrate both pipelines to PySpark based pipeline using EMR cluster in AWS.I’m not worried about managing cluster but I’m here to ask your opinion about what you think would be a good migration plan? I’ve got around 6 engineers who are relatively comfortable with PySpark.If I were to ask you what would be your strategy to do the migration what would it be? These pipelines also contains bunch of stored procedures that also have a bunch of ML models.Both are complex pipelines.Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated!,15,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kda94y/dbt_to_pyspark/,2025-05-02 19:58:00,2025-05-07 01:40:32
1kdpy62,Is this a good starting point for a Data Engineering career?,YerayR14,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I’m currently based in Spain, so while the job market isn’t great, it’s not as tough as in the US. A few months ago, during my final year of Computer Engineering, I realized I’m genuinely passionate about the data field, especially Data Engineering and Analytics. Since then, I’ve been self-studying with the goal of starting as a Data Analyst and eventually becoming a Data Engineer.Since January, I’ve been doing an internship at a large consulting firm (180K+ employees worldwide). Initially, they didn’t give much detail about the technologies I’d be working with, but I had no other offers, so I accepted. It turned out to involve Adelia Studio, CGS, AS400, and some COBOL, technologies unrelated to my long-term goals.These teams usually train interns in legacy systems, hoping some will stay even if it’s not what they want. But I’ve been clear about my direction and decided to take the risk. I spoke with my manager about possibly switching to a more aligned project. Some might have accepted the initial path and tried to pivot later, but I didn’t want to begin my career in a role I have zero interest in.Luckily, he understood my situation and said he’d look into possible alternatives. One of the main reasons they’re open to the change is because of my attitude and soft skills. They see genuine interest and initiative in me. That said, the feedback I’ve received on my technical performance has also been very positive. As he told me: *“We can teach someone any tech stack in the long term, but if they can’t communicate properly, they’ll be difficult to work with.”* Just a reminder that soft skills are as important as hard skills. It doesn’t matter how technically good you are if you can’t collaborate or communicate effectively with your team and clients.Thankfully, I’ve been given the chance to switch to a new project working with Murex, a widely used platform in the banking sector for trading, risk, and financial reporting. I’ll be working with technologies like Python, PL/SQL (Oracle), Shell scripting, Jira... while gaining exposure to automated testing, data pipelines, and financial data processing.However, while this project does involve some database work and scripting, it will largely revolve around working directly with the Murex platform, which isn’t strongly aligned with my long-term goal of becoming a Data Engineer. That’s why I still have some doubts. I know that Murex itself has very little correlation with that career path, but some of the tasks I’ll be doing, such as data validation, automation, and working with databases, could still help me build relevant experience.So overall, I see it as a better option than my previous assignment, since it brings me closer to the kind of work I want to do, even if it’s not with the most typical tools in the data ecosystem. I’d be really interested to hear what others think. Do you see value in gaining experience through a Murex-based project if your long-term goal is to become a Data Engineer? Any thoughts or advice are more than welcome.It’s also worth mentioning that I was told there may be opportunities to move to a more data-focused team in the future. Of course I would need to prove my skills whether through performance, projects, technical tests or completing a master’s program related to the field.Thanks to anyone who took the time to read through this and offer any kind of feedback or advice. I genuinely appreciate it. Have a good day.",14,0.75,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kdpy62/is_this_a_good_starting_point_for_a_data/,2025-05-03 10:34:52,2025-05-07 01:40:32

I'm only really familiar with a handful of these platforms but even just selecting a column I normally have to go and dig up it's data type from some other interface, let alone getting any of the engineers' documentation on it.Snowflake for instance allows us to create `comments` pinned to tables, views, schemas , columns. The lot basically. Why are these comments so hidden to our users whilst they're actually writing the queries that make use of these tables, columns, etc?Our team goes to a decent amount of effort to build useful and readable documentation around each table but is it any use if the end users have to pull up the docs in a separate tab before they understand that they're using the wrong column for their joins?This feels like something that's not too hard to implement, I know having objects tagged with a comment or description is already a nice to have in the data world but surely we can do better?

When it’s time to build BI dashboards or forecasting models, they export **flat, denormalized CSV files** often multiple files filled with repeated data, inconsistent column names, and no clear keys.Even the core databases behind the scenes are sometimes just raw transaction or log tables with minimal structure. And when we try to request a cleaner version of the data, the response is often something like:>“We can’t share it, it contains personal information.”So we end up spending days writing custom scripts, drawing ER diagrams, and trying to reverse-engineer schemas and still end up with brittle pipelines. The root issues never really go away, and that slows down everything: dashboards, models, insights.After running into this over and over, I built a small tool for myself called **LayerNEXUS** to help bridge the gap:* Upload one or many CSVs (even messy, denormalized ones)* Automatically detect relationships across files and suggest a clean, normalized (3NF) schema* Export ready-to-run SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite)* Preview a visual ERD* Optional AI step for smarter key/type detectionIt’s free to try no login required for basic schema generation, and GitHub users get a few AI credits for the AI features. :link: [https://layernexus.com](https://layernexus.com) *(I’m the creator just sharing for feedback, not pushing anything)*If you’re dealing with raw log-style tables and trying to turn them into an efficient, well-structured database, this tool might help your team design something more scalable and maintainable from the ground up.Would love your thoughts:* Do you face similar issues?* What would actually make this kind of tool useful in your workflow?**Thanks in advance!** Max",12,0.84,11,https://layernexus.com/,2025-05-04 11:53:20,2025-05-07 01:40:32

Are there established best practices or conventions by layer (raw/staging/core) that you follow for datetime handling?2. For wallclock `DATETIME` values (timezone-naive), is it recommended to convert them to a standard timezone-aware format during ingestion?3. Regarding the presentation layer (specifically Looker), should time zone conversions be avoided there to prevent inconsistencies, or are there cases where handling timezones at this layer is acceptable?Any insights or examples of how your teams have handled this would be extremely helpful!Thanks in advance!",9,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kfjka8/best_practices_for_standardizing_datetime_types/,2025-05-05 18:50:33,2025-05-07 01:40:32

Here I see that Airflow has disadvantges compared to most of ""next-gen"" tools like Dagster?

1kd34is,Data infrastructure for self-driving labs,xiexieni9527,dataengineering,"Hello folks, I recently joined a research center with a mission to manage data generated from our many labs. This is my first time building data infrastructure, I'm eager to learn from you in the industry.We deal with a variety of data. Time-series from sensor data log, graph data from knowledge graph, and vector data from literature embedding. We also have relational data coming from characterization. Right now, each lab manages their own data, they are all saved as Excel for csv files in disperse places.From initial discussion, we think that we should do the following:A. Find databases to house the lab operational data.B. Implement a data lake to centralize all the data from different labsC. Turn all relational data to documents (JSON), as schema might evolve and we don't really do heave analytics or reporting, AI/ML modelling is more of the focus.If you have any comments on the above points, they will be much appreciated.I also have a question in mind:1. For databases, is it better to find specific database for each type of data (neo4j for graph, Chroma for vector...etc), or we would be better of with a general purpose database (e.g. Cassandra) that houses all types of data to simplify managing processes but to lose specific computing capacity for each data type(for example, Cassandra can't do graph traversal)?2. Cloud infrastructure seems to be the trend, but we have our own data center so we need to leverage it.

1kg5ifd,Suggestion for my studies plan,chongsurfer,dataengineering,"I would like to hear any recommendations for my future studies.I'm a Data Engineer with 3YOE, and I'm going to share some of my background to introduce myself and help you guide me through my doubts.I'm from third world country and have an Advanced English already, but still today working for national companyes earning less than 30k USD yearly.I graduated in Mechanical Engineering, and because of that, I feel I lack knowledge in Computer Science subjects, which I'm really interested in.Company 1 – I started my career as a Power BI Developer for 1.5 years in a consulting company. I consider myself advanced in Power BI — not an expert, but someone who can solve most problems, including performance tuning, RLS, OLS, Tabular Editor, etc.Company 2 – I built and delivered a Data Platform for a retail company (+7000 employees) using Microsoft Fabric. I was the main and principal engineer for the platform for 1.5 years, using Azure Data Factory, Dataflows, Spark Notebooks (basic Spark and Python, such as reading, writing, using APIs, partitioning...), Delta Tables (very good understanding), schema modeling (silver and gold layers), lakehouse governance, understanding business needs, and creating complex SQL queries to extract data from transactional databases. I consider myself intermediate-advanced in SQL (for the market), including window functions, CTEs, etc. I can solve many intermediate and almost all easy LeetCode problems.Company 3 – I just started (20,000+ employees). I'm working in a Data Integration team, using a lot of Talend for ingestion from various sources, and also collaborating with the Databricks team.Freelance Projects (2 years) – I developed some Power BI dashboards and organized databases for two small companies using Sheets, excel and BigQuery.Nowadays, I'm learning a lot of Talend to deliver my work in the best way possible. By the end of the year, I might need to move to another country for family reasons. I’ll step away from the Data Engineering field for a while and will have time to study (maybe for 1.5 years), so I would like to strengthen my knowledge base.I can program in Python a bit. I’ve created some functions, connected to Microsoft Graph through Spark Notebooks, ingested data, and used Selenium for personal projects. I haven't developed my technical skills further mainly because I haven't needed to use Python much at work.I don’t plan to study Databricks, Snowflake, Data Factory, DBT, BigQuery, and AIs deeply, since I already have some experience with them. I understand their core concepts, which I think is enough for now. I’ll have the opportunity to practice these tools through freelancing in the future. I believe I just need to understand what each tool does — the core concepts remain the same. Or am I wrong?I’ve planned a few things to study. I believe a Data Engineer with 5 years of experience should starts understand algorithms, networking, programming languages, software architecture, etc. I found the OSSU University project (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Since I’ve already completed an engineering degree, I don’t need to do everything again, but it looks like a really good path.So, my plan — following OSSU — is to complete these subjects over the next 1.5 years:Systematic Program DesignClass-based Program DesignProgramming Languages, Part A (Is that necessary?)Programming Languages, Part B (Is that necessary?)Programming Languages, Part C (Is that necessary?)Object-Oriented DesignSoftware ArchitectureMathematics for Computer Science (Is that necessary?)The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (Looks interesting)Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to TetrisBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part IIOperating Systems: Three Easy PiecesComputer Networking: a Top-Down ApproachDivide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized AlgorithmsGraph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data StructuresGreedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic ProgrammingShortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About ThemCybersecurity FundamentalsPrinciples of Secure CodingIdentifying Security VulnerabilitiesIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities in C/C++ Programming or Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java ApplicationsDatabases: Modeling and TheoryDatabases: Relational Databases and SQLDatabases: Semistructured DataMachine LearningComputer GraphicsSoftware Engineering: IntroductionEthics, Technology and Engineering (Is that necessary?)Intellectual Property Law in Digital Age (Is that necessary?)Data Privacy FundamentalsAdvanced programmingAdvanced systemsAdvanced theoryAdvanced Information SecurityAdvanced math (Is that necessary?)Any other recommendations is very welcoming!!",6,0.8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kg5ifd/suggestion_for_my_studies_plan/,2025-05-06 14:12:59,2025-05-07 01:40:32

An image may have any number of associated annotations from human and models.

Currently I'm tempted to roll out a relational DB to keep track of the image S3 keys, image metadata, collections/datasets, and labels... but surely there's a solution for this kind of thing out there already.

The problem we have rn is that our older cluster version is very old (19.x.x), and our team could not update it for the past few years. After trying to upgrade the cluster gracefully, we have decided to go against it, and deploy a new cluster, sync the data between these two and then retire the old one. Both clusters are only getting inserts by a set of similar kafka engine tables that are inserting new data into materialized views that populate the inner tables. But the inner table schemas have changed a bit. I tried clickhouse-backup, but the issue is that the database/metadata have changed, the definition of our tables, zookeeper paths and etc (our previous config had faults). For this issue, we could not also use clickhouse-copier. I'm currently thinking of writing an ELT pipeline, that reads that from our source clickhouse and writes it to our destination one with some changes. I tried looking up AirByte and DLT, but the guides are mostly about using clickhouse as a sink, not a source. There is also the option of writing the data to kafka, and consume it on the target cluster from kafka, but I could not find a way to do a full kafka dump using clickhouse.

1kgassj,How do you scale handling with source schema changes?,Altrooke,dataengineering,"This is a problem I'm facing at my new job. Situation when I got here:\- very simple data setup \- ruby data ingestion app that ingests source data to the DW \- Analytics built on directly top of the raw tables ingested Problem:If the upstream source schema changes, all QS reports breakYou could fix all the reports every time the schema changes, but this is clearly not scalable.I think the solution here is to decouple analytics from the source data schema. So, what I am thinking is creating a ""gold"" layer table with a stable schema according to what we need for analytics then add an ETL job that converts from raw to ""gold"" (quotes because I don't necessarily to go full medallion)This way, when the source schema changes, we only need to update the ETL job rather than every analytics report.

1kfggac,Handling data quality from multiple Lambdas -> DynamoDB on a budget (AWS/Python),BlackLands123,dataengineering,"Hello everyone! :waving_hand:I've recently started a side project using AWS and Python. A core part involves running multiple Lambda functions daily. Each Lambda generates a CSV file based on its specific logic.Sometimes, the CSVs produced by these different Lambdas have data quality issues – things like missing columns, unexpected NaN values, incorrect data types, etc.Before storing the data into DynamoDB, I need a process to:1. Gather the CSV outputs from all the different Lambdas.2. Check each CSV against predefined quality standards (correct schema, no forbidden NaN, etc.).3. Only process and store the data from CSVs that meet the quality standards. Discard or flag data from invalid CSVs.4. Load the cleaned, valid data into DynamoDB. This is a side project, so minimizing AWS costs is crucial. Looking for the most budget-friendly approach. Furthermore, the entire project is in Python, so Python-based solutions are ideal. Environment is AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).**What's the simplest and most cost-effective AWS architecture/pattern to achieve this?**I've considered a few ideas, like maybe having all Lambdas dump CSVs into an S3 bucket and then triggering *another* central Lambda to do the validation and DynamoDB loading, but I'm unsure if that's the best way.Looking for recommendations on services (maybe S3 events, SQS, Step Functions, another Lambda?) and best practices for handling this kind of data validation pipeline on a tight budget.Thanks in advance for your help! :)",3,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kfggac/handling_data_quality_from_multiple_lambdas/,2025-05-05 16:48:16,2025-05-07 01:40:32

As an addendum, here’s my plan to address all the security concerns that have been brought up:(First, though, I’ve already revoked/made new API keys and haven’t committed them to GitHub, so please don’t worry about that anymore.)1. I think I’m going to go with GitHub secrets as the most simple way to still have the page functional and secure on pages to share with potential co-ops. Alternatively, I’m going to look into Netlify, which a lot of people have recommended as a simple solution. 2. After that’s done, I’m going to create an alternate version where I use PHPmyAdmin to store the keys and then retrieve them with PHP to showcase doing both (that’s the plan anyways). I’ve avoided PHP since I don’t really understand servers and hosting (haven’t had a class on that yet).

1kg8ndf,Can't really understand the benefits of object oriented programming compared to procedural approach...,travel_through_r,learnprogramming,"Hi! I'm new here, so sorry in advance if I broke some rule.Anyway... During high school, I learned procedural programming (C++), basics of data structures, computer architecture... and as a result, I think I've become somewhat skilled in solving algorithmic tasks.Now at university, I started with object oriented programming (mostly C++ again) and I think that I understand all the basics (classes and objects, constructors/destructors, fields/methods, inheritance...) while all my professors swear that this approach is far better than procedural programming which I used to do (they mostly cite code reusability and security as reason why).The problem is that, even though I already did dozens of, mostly small sized, object oriented programs so far, I still don't see any benefits of it. In fact, it would be easier to me to just make procedural programs while not having to think about object oriented decomposition and stuff like that. Also, so far I haven't see any reason to use inheritance/polymorphism.The ""biggest"" project I did until now is assembler that reads contents of a file with assembly commands and translates it to binary code (I created classes Assembler, SymbolTable, Command... but I could have maybe even easier achieve the same result with procedural approach by simply making structures and global functions that work with instances of those structures).So, my question is: **can someone explain me in simple terms what are the benefits of object oriented programming and when should I use it?**To potentially make things easier to explain and better understand the differences, I even made a small example of a program done with both approaches.So, lets say, you need to create a program ""ObjectParser"" where user can choose to parse and save input strings with some predefined form (every string represents one object and its attributes) or to access already parsed one.Now, let's compare the two paradigms:**1. Procedural:**\- First you would need to define some custom structure to represent object: struct Object { // fields }\- Since global variables are considered a bad practice, in main method you should create a map to store parsed objects: std::map objects;\- Then you should create one function to parse a string from a file (user enters name of a file) and one to access an attribute of a saved object (user provides name of the object and name of the attribute) void parseString(std::map& objects, std::string filename) { // parsing and storing the string } std::string getValue(std::map& objects, std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) { // retrieving the stored object's attribute }\* Notice that you need to pass the map to function since it's not a global object\- Then you write the rest of the main method to get user input in a loop (user chooses to either parse new or retrieve saved object)**2. Object oriented**\- First you would create a class called Parser and inside the private section of that class define structure or class called Object (you can also define this class outside, but since we will only be using it inside Parser class it makes sense that it's the integral part of it).One of the private fields would be a map of objects and it will have two public methods, one for parsing a new string and one to retrieve an attribute of already saved one. class Parser { public: void parseString(std::string filename) { // parsing and storing the string } std::string getValue(std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) { // retrieving the stored object's attribute } private: struct Object { // fields Object(...) { // Object constructor body } } std::map objects; }\* Notice that we use default ""empty"" constructor since the custom one is not needed in this case.\- Then you need to create a main method which will instantiate the Parser and use than instance to parse strings or retrieve attributes after getting user input the same way as in the procedural example.**Discussing the example:**Correct me if I wrong, but I think that both of these would work and it's how you usually make procedural and object oriented programs respectively.Now, except for the fact that in the first example you need to pass the map as an argument (which is only a slight inconvenience) I don't see why the second approach is better, **so if it's easier for you to explain it by using this example or modified version of it, feel free to do it.****IMPORTANT**: This is not, by any means, an attempt to belittle object oriented programming or to say that other paradigms are superior. I'm still a beginner, who is trying to grasp its benefits (probably because I'm yet to make any large scale application).Thanks in advance!**Edit**: Ok, as some of you pointed out, even in my ""procedural"" example I'm using std::string and std::map (internally implemented in OOP manner), so both examples are actually object oriented. For the sake of the argument, lets say that instead of std::string I use an array of characters while when it comes to std::map it's an instance of another custom struct and a bunch of functions to modify it (now when I think about it, combining all this into a logical unit ""map"" is an argument in favor of OOP by itself).",81,0.88,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kg8ndf/cant_really_understand_the_benefits_of_object/,2025-05-06 16:19:57,2025-05-07 01:40:33

1kf7jhg,Confused Programmer,Mr_Strange6,learnprogramming,"I started my programming journey almost four years ago when I was 18, with no background in computers. I began with HTML, basic CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. Later, I discovered Laravel, a PHP framework, and started working on backend development. Over time, I became skilled in Laravel and really enjoyed building applications.As I grew, I realized that I needed a deeper understanding of PHP itself, so I took the time to learn PHP as well. I ended up creating the backend for many mobile applications and worked on complex projects. At that time, I was working at a service-based company, so I had to work on whatever came my way. That’s how I also ended up learning Node.js.You could say I’m a backend developer who can work with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, Livewire, CakePHP, and Node.js.Currently, I’m working at a fintech, product-based company. But here’s the funny part — even after four years of experience, I still feel like something is missing. I’m not sure what to learn next to truly grow. I've never done LeetCode problems, but I’m very good at solving real-world, complex problems that arise during application development.I also have a basic understanding of low-level languages like C++. But now I’m at a crossroads. Sometimes I feel like I should improve my JavaScript skills and learn React. Other times, I feel drawn toward AI and want to explore how to get better at that.There’s a lot of confusion in my mind right now.I’m 22, and I still love learning and building new things.

1kg9bqy,Coming back to software engineering after 25 years,TemperatureStandard6,learnprogramming,"I was a math/CS major in college, and afterwards worked for two years as a software engineer (in Java/SQL). I then switched careers and spent the next 25 years successfully doing something completely unrelated, writing code only extremely occasionally in essentially ""toy"" environments (e.g., simple Basic code in Excel to automate some processes). In the meantime, I sort of missed ""real"" coding, but not enough to switch back careers, and I completely missed all the developments that happened during those 25 years, in terms of tooling, frameworks, etc. Back when I was coding, there was no GitHub, Stack Overflow, Golang, React, cloud, Kubernetes, Microservices, etc., and even Python wasn't really a thing (it existed, but almost nobody was using it seriously in production). I now have an idea for an exciting (and fairly complex) project, and enough time and flexibility (and fire in the belly) to build it myself - at least the initial version to see if the idea has legs before involving other people. Haven't had such an itch to code in 25 years :) So my question is - what is the fastest and most efficient way to learn the modern ""developer stack"" and current frameworks, both to start building quickly and at the same time make sure that whatever I do is consistent with modern best practices and available frameworks? The project will involve a big database on the backend, with a Web client on the frontend, and whatever is available through the Web client would also need to be available via an API. For the initial version, of course I don't need it to support many requests at the same time, but I do want to architect it in a way that it could potentially support a huge number of concurrent requests/be essentially infinitely scalable. I'm not sure where to start ""catching up"" on the entire stack - from tools like Cursor and GitHub to Web frameworks like React to backend stuff - and I am also a bit worried that there are things ""I don't know that I don't know"" (with the things I mentioned, at least I know they exist and roughly understand what they do, but I am worried about ""blind spots"" I may have). There is of course a huge amount of material online, but most of what I found is either super specific and assumes a lot of background knowledge about that particular technology, OR the opposite, it assumes no knowledge of programming at all, and starts out with ""for"" loops and such and moves painfully slowly. I would very much appreciate any suggestions on the above (or any parts of the above) that would help me catch up quickly (obviously not to the expert level on any of these, but to a ""workable"" one) and start building.

1kcz3yz,the Developer Academy is unprofessional in my experience,Tough_Trust5713,learnprogramming,"The prior post about this provider of bootcamps has been archived by Reddit and doesn't allow to post comments, and the only allowed comment isn't genuine in my view: I believe the DfE should initiate an investigation into the Software Development online bootcamp by this provider that they fully subsidise, to ensure accountability and protect future participants from what I deem unprofessional and childish behavior by its leads.Below, I outline my key concerns:1) **Misleading duration.** The bootcamp was advertised on the Academy website as a 16-week training program to qualify participants as full-stack software developers, and when I enrolled I confirmed I agreed to 16 weeks. However, when I asked for proof of studies letter, the founder informed me via email that the duration was only 12 weeks, undermining the program’s promised scope and depth. I believe that shortening the DeF-agreed programme undermines the DfE’s expectation of transparency and value for money, and might reduce its effectiveness.2) **Misleading capacity.** The program was promoted as limited to 10 students, ensuring a 1:10 instructor-to-student ratio for personalized learning, including 1:1 office hours during lunch breaks, as described in the enrollment interview. Yet, an email from the administrator was sent to 24 students, significantly exceeding the advertised capacity and diluting the quality of instruction. This is concerning because Skills Bootcamps under the NSF must provide ""intensive, focused training to ensure participants gain employable skills"", and overcrowding can compromise this.3) **Breach of DPA.** The administrator failed to use Bcc in group emails, publicly disclosing the personal contact details of all participants without consent. This violates the data protection standards outlined by the DfE, which emphasize the need to protect personal data and respond effectively to breaches. Additionally, not offering an option to use an alternative email for Teams access further exacerbates the privacy breach, as it forces participants to expose private email addresses, violating GDPR’s requirement for informed consent, and the NSF expected compliance with DPA standards to ensure participant trust and safety.4) **Lack of planning and transparency**. Despite repeated requests, neither the founder nor the administrator provided a provisional timetable detailing the breakdown of hours for technical and soft skills training. Furthermore, the founder claimed daily sessions would start at 9:00 AM, but Teams instructions indicated 9:30 AM, with no clarity on end times or offline breaks, hindering effective preparation. This again infringes the DfE requirement for funded training to operate transparently, while poor planning could be seen as a failure to deliver the agreed provision effectively.5) **Unreasonable funder's behavior**. **One hour before the bootcamp’s start, I was removed from the program and blocked from accessing the academy’s Slack and Teams platforms. This decision was based on a trivial matter: the change of my 3mm Slack thumbnail picture the night before, which was deemed “unflattering” to the interviewer despite being a tiny, totally unrecognizable image.** This action demonstrates a lack of professionalism, fairness, and equitable access. Given that the DfE expects funded programs to ensure equitable access to education for eligible participants, the unreasonable removal could be seen as a failure to deliver the program.6) **Lack of empathy**. I explained to the founder and administrator that I had made significant financial and physical sacrifices to attend, including relocating to a new residence to ensure a suitable remote working environment. Despite these efforts, they refused to reinstate me, showing disregard for the challenges faced by participants, the public resources invested, and the support provided by others, such as my landlady, whose assistance was ultimately wasted. 7) **Possible systematic waste of public funding received by the DfE.** Upon joining the academy’s Slack account, I noticed a “General” channel where instructors posted notes and recordings of the first lesson for the prior cohort, but engagement in that channel ended abruptly. This suggests the possibility of early termination of the bootcamp in the past. Additionally, the lack of transparency in participant identities on Slack, combined with the ease of removing participants, raises concerns: the program could misrepresent its impact by attributing employment outcomes to others who are not their students but find employment as developers.8) **Poor communication.** Essential details, such as session start times and access links, were buried in irrelevant information within login emails, raising questions about their fitness for role.9) **Gender Bias.** During the enrollment interview, I mentioned a podcast highlighting that women often end up in front-end development roles, which are less paid and more tedious than back-end roles dominated by men. The interviewer responded by stating that, in her view, this is because women are less capable in mathematics than men.  This bias contradicts the principles of equality and meritocracy in the tech industry and raises concerns about their inclusivity, especially given the DfE’s awareness of gender imbalances in Skills Bootcamps.",8,0.9,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kcz3yz/the_developer_academy_is_unprofessional_in_my/,2025-05-02 11:56:42,2025-05-07 01:40:33

I have the impression that I’m about to be fired and that finding a good job will be impossible. I don’t know if I’m super lucky but… CS has been a good and easy field for me.I have graduated from an average european engineering school. Did a three year apprenticeship in an average company. Moved to Switzerland and tripled my salary. A couple years later changed company and I’m almost at 160k fixed salary.All that and… I’m not a super good developer. Honestly, compared to my peers I would say I’m slightly (very slightly) above average. I never did leetcode. I havent read a CS book in the last 10 years. I don’t keep up with new technologies (I’m a Java dev and I dont know what’s the latest version).But hey, looking back on my career, I do think I have a few positive points that made me get here :- I have more social skills than 90% of my dev colleagues. Yes this in an stereotype. Some of the best developers I met are completely autistic. These guys can’t hold a normal conversation for 5 minutes. Let alone when there’s a woman in the conv- Learn languages. I’m one of the only ones on my team who can write in english correctly and speak without a heavy accent. I have been put in so many meetings just because I spoke english. Languages really open doors.- I never refused work. Whenever my boss asks me to do some menial, non-interesting, boring task… I just do it. When someone needs to do it, I volunteer for it. Really, it’s that simple, even if the task is dumb- When someone asks you do somethint, always ask for a ticket or an email. You’re not a decision taker, you’re a developer. This will get you out of trouble.- Be friends with people from other : have a DBA friend, have a DevOps friend, have a Sec engineer friend. You’ll need them. That’s it guys.

1kewxbe,Entry Level Developers: Try not to stay at a company for too long if they are using old tech stacks,megariffs,cscareerquestions,"If you work at a company that uses old tech stacks and processes, try not to stay at that company for too long (unless they are transitioning to using a newer tech stack and processes) because when it's time to work at another company, your lack of experience in newer tech and processes may come back and bite you. They're good to gain professional experience but after a couple of years, you should try and find another job that's more in line with what industry is going towardsWhen I graduated from college in 2016, my first job was a full-stack developer at a company I was working at while I was in college doing completely different work. I became their first in-house developer after I developed their Intranet site (as an internship project for my university) and redesigned their one of their customer referral forms. Their tech stack at the time was [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for their customer portal and VB6 for the application that their employees used.After getting an opportunity to work at a startup that my former boss help start in 2022, I quit my then current job to work there. Less than a year later, I was let go due to ""inexperience"" even though I've done all my tasks on time, quickly learned React (the company initially was using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms as a proof of concept before switching to React and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Web API), and I was receiving good reviews from my manager a month earlier. I believe I was scapegoated because the team itself was under performing, but I digress. With that being said, I learned quite a bit before I was let go. My first employer never used GitHub/Azure/etc, so I was unfamiliar with committing code, branch concepts, creating a PR, etc. I was also unfamiliar with newer [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) concepts like Dependency Injections, Program.cs, Middleware, etc that were in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core. Working at the startup exposed me to all of that.Luckily, I was able to find another job (which paid even more money) in less than 3 months. It was another company that used [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for one of their applications and a mixture of [VB.NET/VB6](http://VB.NET/VB6) for another application. Fast forward to last month (April 3rd 2025), my position was eliminated. Therefore, I got laid off due to the company restructuring after having a bad financial outcome from the previous year. This time around, I wasn't let go due to performance. In fact, they emphatically praised me for being a great developer. My boss's boss emailed me afterwards to let me know that I can use him as a reference for another job and he'll reach out to contacts to see if anyone of them are looking for a developer to hire.Within the last several weeks, I was able to get an interview at 3 companies (2 contract jobs and one direct to hire). This week, I made it to the second round of one company before they decided to go in another direction. They told my recruiter that my in-person interview was excellent but another candidate they interviewed had more experience, so they decided to go with the other candidate. This time around, the companies I worked at previously never used automated testing, Microservices, CI/CD pipelines, service bus technology, etc. I felt like my lack of experience using those concepts came back and bit me.Regarding the two other companies, I did make it to the third round of the direct to hire job, but I'm afraid that my lack of experience using .NET based service bus tech and potentially other tech may get in the way of me landing this job. I'm going to spending the entire week brushing up on those concepts before my final interview. I did get a job offer from the first company I interviewed at, but I'm hesitant to work there because it's only 3 month contract, it's a long commute to another state (40-45 min drive), and they want me to use React. I haven't used React in over a year.TLDR; Don't be like me and stick around at a company for too long that uses old tech stacks and processes or not spending enough time to learn newer tech. Granted, I tried to do that at times, but I have a newborn now. Also, my partner can be quite needy and wants to spend a lot of time with me. We've got into arguments in the past over me wanting to spend time after work to work on projects to develop new skills.Edit: Grammar",246,0.9,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kewxbe/entry_level_developers_try_not_to_stay_at_a/,2025-05-04 22:59:51,2025-05-07 01:40:35

I graduated in the fall semester of 2014 and have been working as a developer for 7 and a manager for the last 4 years.Recently I began applying for jobs as an engineering manager. I have to say it’s been though in our side as well. While the amount of call backs I get is very high the amount of jobs for this level are also very low. I have applied to a mixture of companies from Fortune 50, to Fortune 500 in all sectors from Fintech to healthcare.I have had maybe 32 conversations with recruiters. I have a very specific requirement. I do not want to manage an overseas team especially if I have to go the office 5 days a week to do it.Out of those 32 conversations only one company Capital One had me managing developers in the USA. Every single other company was in India EVERY single other company. Sometimes I would get a mix where there would be 2-8 US devs just doing high level architecture design then handing the work over.I thought about the Capital One job and I reached out to a contact at there and he told me pretty much the whole team was basically here on H1B visas including the other engineering managers. I’ve been around long enough to know how bad monoculture work environments are especially with H1B’s AND stack ranking so I declined that job as well.I have to be honest with you guys. I am going to need a job soon. I have been trying my best not to contribute to this outsourcing mess especially when it’s denying opportunities to people like me who came from bad social economic backgrounds and a no name school and was blessed to get a junior role where I could grow.I been reaching out to my network and it’s the same everywhere. Whole teams are getting replaced. I have friends that used to work normal hours waking up in the middle of the night to jump into sprint planning meetings. I got people crying and hugging their employees as their entire in office team is laid off then they have to drive into the office everyday just to hop on zoom calls with people in Argentina.If we don’t get some legislative solutions for this I think our sector is going to go the way of manufacturing.

1kbk3go,Why do people blame new grads for organizational failures so much?,GaslightingGreenbean,cscareerquestions,"This is a response to that post on why new graduates are so unhirable. There’s a weird idea floating around that these senior developers and tech leads are born with some genetic advancement that makes their brains better at coding. I highly doubt that. I think they’ve just had years of experience. Software development is learned over time, it’s not something you’re just born good at. If this were basketball, ok this guys born with genetics that make him 7 feet tall. If this were football, ok this kid was born to be 260 pounds at 16 years old. But software development? That’s like… just being exposed too and practicing a tech stack repeatedly.If your new grad is failing or not getting hired, let’s exclude new grads who genuinely just don’t want to be software developers or can’t work in an environment without freaking out and punching someone. They’re not who I’m talking about. Since the bare minimum requirement to even have a seed to grow into a good developer is the ability to break down complex problems, patience, persistence, and willingness to learn, I think the vast majority of people can grow into good developers. But people need structure, exposure, and practice with a consistent stack before you make judgement calls on their overall lifetime ability to excel in technology.Basically, I’m babbling, but new grads who want to be software developers being incompetent isn’t the problem here.

Not worried about LLMs writing code better than me—maybe that’s coming, but whatever. What I’m actually scared of is this: a lot of the SaaS world runs on CRUD apps. Dashboards, admin panels, internal tools, basic workflow platforms—99% of it is forms and tables over a database with some business logic sprinkled in.But now we’ve got agents that can insert structured data directly from natural input (emails, PDFs, speech, whatever), and LLMs that can query and visualize that data however you want. Why bother building a UI at all? Why have a separate analytics dashboard if you can just ask for “revenue by cohort for Q2” and get a chart back?Feels like we’re heading toward a world where the core “app” isn’t a UI anymore—it’s just a schema + an agent + a model. And if that’s the future… does most CRUD work just evaporate?I know not everything can or should be replaced by this (think banking, social media etc), but I can’t shake the feeling that a lot of what we currently build is basically middleware between users and structured data—and LLMs are starting to eat that.Anyone else thinking about this?

I provided him a detailed explanation of the flow and even pointed out how very similar bugs in the past have been fixed (the same solution as the one liner).

How much long-term value does a FAANG role really add to your resume and career growth? Is the FAANG name and learning actually that impactful on your career? (I think it is but could use perspectives)2. Do you think the payoff could be worth uprooting our lives on the East coast? 3. How many years of experience at FAANG really makes a difference on your resume and your learning? It’s easier for us to consider moving for just a few years, and then coming back East.

It was never a large team to begin with, 5 developers plus my manager, managing ecommerce platforms, data, internal business applications, b2b systems, AI services, etc.Last year we lost one developer who was frustrated by the direction we were going. Her position was never filled, instead they hired a developer from India in an adjacent team, to focus on software for the warehouse. Then one developer was moved to a specific niche dealing with our internal Microsoft integrations. Now finally, another developer is being removed from my team. They carried a lot of weight because they were one of those ""say yes to everything"" work 16-hour day folks. However, now they are being completely removed from our area of the company and reassigned. I'm left with 1 other developer and he is very junior.In 1 year, I've gone from a 5 person team to a 2 person team, and yet no expectations have been adjusted. I am being told that I should take on all the responsibilities of the developer that's now being moved, while maintaining my current responsibilities, compensating for the 2 developers that left last year who were never filled, and on top of all that with the company breathing down my neck wanting to start no less than 5 new major projects.And my manager is acting like everything is completely normal and seems to have no concept that this is completely impractical. I have asked for more staff for a year but it's falling on deaf ears, even when projects that were supposed to take 4 months ended up taking us close to a year. At the very least I have been asking for the opportunity to pair-program and work with some of the more senior developers that have left or are being reassigned, and yet the company cannot make time for that. There's always an excuse, some other ""more pressing issue"" that I have to focus on before training can happen.I feel like I'm being set up to fail and I have no idea how to plan for this. I am obviously looking for other jobs, but this is the worst market in a long time. I have some financial cushion, but I don't want to quit because of how the Economy is looking.

1kf8qw7,Is Your Career Just What People Think of You?,Raladin123,cscareerquestions,"For a long time, I’ve been obsessed with prestige and what people think of me. Only recently have I started to realize that this focus has been damaging.Back in college, I struggled to land strong internships. When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.This past new grad job hunt season was different. I did extremely well. But instead of simply feeling proud, I found myself bringing it up in almost every conversation — how many offers I got, how hard the decision was. My close friends pointed out that my conversations shifted away from hobbies and life to career decisions, leveling systems, and growth.When it came time to choose between job offers, I tried everything to make the “right” decision. I asked all my friends and family. I read every blog and polled every possible forum. I was obsessed with finding the most validated, socially acceptable path — the one society would approve of. Obviously it didn’t work. Eventually, I had to ask myself: *Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing?* And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, **career advancement almost entirely depends on perception.** Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.That’s why I find myself highlighting my accomplishments and leaning toward prestige. I want to be seen as someone worth helping, worth investing in. I want future recruiters to see my resume and not hesitate. But in the process, I’ve started to value prestige more than my own long-term goals and personal values.Choosing between offers this season was especially hard because they represented opposite sides of this internal conflict — one path aligned with prestige, the other with personal fit.Conventional advice says to “stop caring what people think.” But is that even realistic when almost every system in tech (and the world in general) is based on what others think of you and how you're ranked?",24,0.82,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kf8qw7/is_your_career_just_what_people_think_of_you/,2025-05-05 10:58:58,2025-05-07 01:40:35
1kedgw3,"Disabled, chronically ill, and now put on PIP: Need career advice",Tandoori_Chicken_69,cscareerquestions,"***Disclaimer: This post is not about me but a friend of mine. That nevertheless doesn't invalidate the seriousness of the situation. There’s a TL;DR at the end if you need it.***I've been working as a software engineer at my current company for about 2 years. From the very beginning, I disclosed that I have SLE lupus (an autoimmune condition), which means I’m constantly on anticoagulant medication. I also have a physical disability that makes daily commuting difficult.Thankfully, things were manageable for a long time—my role allowed for hybrid work, with some days in-office and others WFH. That balance helped me stay productive and committed despite my health challenges.But everything started shifting this year.The company is preparing to go public and has been carrying out silent layoffs—mostly through performance improvement plans (PIPs). WFH flexibility has been dialed back, and there's increasing pressure to be in-office regularly. I complied with the new expectations despite the strain, kept putting in the hours, met all deadlines, and consistently received positive feedback.However, over the past couple of weeks, my health has taken a serious turn. I’ve developed gangrene in my left index finger—there’s a chance I could lose it, or even more fingers if it spreads. I was terrified to ask for leave, hoping things would heal. I kept working—coding one-handed with my right hand—just to avoid raising red flags.Then two days ago, I was blindsided.My manager scheduled a recorded meeting and placed me on a PIP, claiming I had negative feedback from past team leads. This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager. After the meeting, my manager called me privately, off the record. He implied that he had no real control over the situation and gently suggested I start looking for a new role while going through the PIP.So here I am—on a one-month PIP, with a two-month notice period after that if things don’t improve.And now my health is at a breaking point. I need time off, but I can’t afford to lose this job. My medical expenses are piling up fast. If I lose this income, I’ll probably have to leave my apartment and move back in with my parents, who are already under financial strain.I need advice. Please.* Should I try explaining the full extent of my condition to HR or management again and ask to pause the PIP or adjust expectations?* Should I ask for a quiet exit now with some kind of severance instead of going through a likely-failed PIP?* Has anyone faced something similar—being disabled and seriously ill while also under pressure to perform or leave?Please don’t just say “prioritize your health and quit”—I wish I could, but I don’t have that privilege. I'm trying to survive, not just live. Any practical advice or shared experiences would really mean a lot right now.**TL;DR:** **Software engineer with lupus + physical disability. Was managing well with hybrid work until company began silent layoffs via PIPs. Now being forced into WFO, health has worsened (developed gangrene in hand), but afraid to take leave. Just put on a PIP despite positive past feedback. Manager privately suggested I start job hunting. Can't afford to lose job due to high medical costs.

Initially came way via their summer analyst program and then returned as part of their Graduate Rotational Analyst program. In my current role as a Systems Engineer I support trading infrastructure its kind of a mix of implementation, weekly meetings with vendors, benchmarking new and emerging technologies like processors and a lot of dealing with compliance issues because of the nature of being at a bank. Though I’m hitting my 5 year mark soon and I pretty stagnant where I’m at. On that note I did make it to few final rounds at a few Trading firms in Chicago but it was a typical case of me being too junior senior if that makes sense. There are times when I learn a bit but a major of my time is chasing and mitigating risk and compliance stuff as new tech is introduced to the firm.Its more of an infrastructure role and not much of a dev/swe role though I done some automation with python. and on occassion do things in ansible, bash and so forth. Haven’t been promoted nor had a raise in the last 2 years or so. Although each time i was close my team was realigned or got a new manager about 2-3 times. Home is LA/Southern California and would like to stay on the west coast to be near family and my girlfriend so I’m looking at Seattle & The bay area.

1kd6i45,What would you have told your mid career self to do if you could go back in time ?,jacquesroland,cscareerquestions,"I am a big proponent in that we should improve ourselves by relying on ourselves only, but after a decade of working in tech, and many more years being a student, I realize that unless you are extremely talented or lucky (or both), even just talking to a willing mentor can get you astronomically ahead in any endeavor, whether it be school or career. For example I’ll talk about myself: I am first generation college grad in my family. My parents did not know anything about tech or software or even how you use a college degree to start a career. My pre-college education was also similarly ignorant of these things (I learned to programmed as sophomore in college!). In my Senior year in high school I took a university class and got the highest grade; it was surprisingly easy for me. Had my parents or teachers encouraged me much earlier I could have likely started college earlier even as a sophomore in high school or at least taken college classes alongside high school and gotten quite ahead when starting in university. A 2nd example, I majored in CS but nobody advised me on anything nor did I know what I had to do. I only majored in CS after a professor strongly advised me to. I had a single internship simply due to a connection with that same professor. But I didn’t know I should be studying LeetCode or applying at internships for big tech. I didn’t get my first real job until 1 year after I graduated. So imagine if I never talked to that professor or took their advice ! One single person made an infinite positive difference in my life by just talking to them !OK, now let’s move to current day. I am mid career SWE, I write lots of code but also manage other SWEs. I want to keep advancing because I have strong options about how things should be done, and I see a lot of inefficiency in current engineering leadership. I guess you could call me Sauron if you know the analogy. I actually prefer being an IC but the amount of incompetence I observe at eng leadership drives me crazy and I feel it is my duty to course correct and help rather than just shrug my shoulders and keep my nose to the grinding wheel.

The work has been very stable. Luckily it's not an industry that gets affected much due to recent economic events. However with that said, we're only a startup and my salary is 96k CAD.In terms of the position/job, I have literally zero complaints. I've never worried about my performance, the work itself is very chill, I get to work remote and I only do actual work for around 3-4hrs a day (usually less). The people are also incredibly nice and I truly believe I'll never meet a management team that's better than my current one. However, the pay is still pretty low, especially considering I now have over 4 years of experience. The only other con is that due to the work being so chill, I have recently felt like I've stopped learning new things. Every day it's the same CRUD operations in a different format so I feel like if I continue down this path I may end up with 6 YoE but not much talent to show for it. Don't get me wrong though, I've definitely learned a ton at my current company and how to build a system from end to end, but I don't think I can learn anymore as our use base is pretty small.So, I've started to look around as to what's available. If I get a FAANG offer with 200k+ salary, I'd take it in a heartbeat but putting that to the side, I've slowly started getting responses from other startups and small companies with salaries ranging from 100k to 150k.

I had no internships during college, but after graduating I've been doing some freelance/contract work with the company that I did my senior capstone with, and recently started working with a startup, but am looking again for a new position due to the company's financials. I'm probably close to 1000+ applications sent out over the last year with only a few callbacks. I've even been borrowing friends addresses (with permission) for jobs that prefer local candidates to have a better chance at getting past ATS. I have a feeling it might be my resume, but I've had a couple of reviews and still no luck. I haven't been picky about the kind of companies or roles I've been applying for either. I know the market is bad for entry/junior level positions, but I really love doing this kind of work and don't want to give it up. Any advice is appreciated!

I have a love/hate relationship with WFH but was feeling settled into it after a while. Team dynamic was also good after some time, we got to know each other better, had happy hours, etc. In the past few months it's gotten really bad. Lots of upper management has left, some coworkers have left. Seems like things are always on fire every week. The thought of being oncall makes me cringe due to how many incidents come up. Testing environment sucks. We're dealing with tons of bad and outdated code. A project I planned fell apart at 90% completion due to is being unable to work around some outdated libraries. The system is too vast to really know what causes an issue until you look into it. It kind of feels like our team has been left behind to handle the legacy stuff whereas other teams are working on newer projects and tech. The team collab has also declined due to addition of some members. It was already tough due to WFH but now its worseI've never been too interested in work and always just took it as a means for an income. But now I feel myself really dreading waking up on workdays. I'm really starting to resent the whole thing.

I've got 15 years of experience, I'm 40, and I've been out of work for a bit after a terrible injury (an assault that left me unable to walk and suffering from PTSD) and total burnout. I've had a really tough time finding a good job. I'm frankly exhausted and not totally sure if it's just time to pivot to management, or what.I've got an offer from a solid startup - (70 employees, obfuscated because I really don't want them to see this) with good for a good salary (220-250k?) and equity, in-office. It's not a bad commute, and I could probably do good work, but it's a JavaScript shop, even on the data platform side. The code is messy as hell. The deadlines are yesterday, according to glassdoor. Not at all my forte or favorite. They need someone to work on their data platform to make it scalable and performant. It touches AI/ML, but it's scrappy and there's lots of fires to put out.I've got another offer that's contract with **possibility** of conversion at D1sney building an observability for their streaming platform, and it's more like 170K. It's got a lot of visibility, and I'd be somewhat insulated because it's a big fucking company. I'd get to work in Scala, which is a joy and not easy to find.I'm torn. I'm getting back on the horse after a pretty bad series of uncomfortable startup experiences that ended with a lot of burnout, and the idea of going into the office every day for visibility is a lot. Hell, I'm not even sure if I want to be a software engineer.D would give me more flexibility and less pressure but it does seem like a cool project. I could pretty much take it and run with it and do some cool stuff. I'm friendly and personable.I'm just trying to get back on my feet after being out of the game for about a year. I'm not sure how ready I am to hit the ground running at a startup, and I'm not sure if it's just my lack of confidence. The flexibility of in-office when I want to be is huge, but am I daft for leaning toward contract work at a big entity with the possibility of conversion for less money, considering the reality of the grind?I don't want to burn out, but I want to make sure I'm in a good place if this contract ends. Should I get the offer from the startup? I can't really use it to leverage more from D because it's through a third party, and sanity and sustainability are my big drivers.

There is also the whole data issue of asking an AI to write you code and giving it government policy not yet released to base it off. However we had a meeting and I was really surprised at how much people are using AI just in day to day work. I'm talking copy and pasting emails into chatGPT to write responses, or using chatGPT to write up a script for morning standups. These sort of things seem out of place to me, maybe it's the changing of times but if you don't know how to respond to an email or can't tell me what you did yesterday without an AI it feels like you should have failed the recruitment interview.

1kc37zb,Is it shocking that every project I was assigned to ended up being a complete disaster?,Ok_Practice_6702,cscareerquestions,"In my software engineering courses in graduate school, there were frequently topics of why projects fail, and those studies had described every one of my projects to the letter. It could be because all my employment thus far has been with consulting firms, so clients go to those when they want people they can easily unload, but I couldn't even believe that many companies could be that disorganized. My first project I was selected for, I was supposed to be a team lead, and due to my high score on the Spring Boot interview, they made me a hiring manager, but there were no questions given to me to ask or no criteria to evaluate, and there were no projections of how many people we needed staffed. Eventually, they found they were way over budget, they started to cut parts of the new platform little by little, and many got cut from the project and replaced with offshore even after they relocated. The 2nd project, even after they interviewed me and told them directly that I was still rather junior level, they were expecting me to know almost everything and I had nobody on site on my team, and to get any help, I had to wait for them to be available between meetings where they had about 2 minutes to talk. I repeated to them I never claimed to be a senior developer like they thought and eventually was released. The 3rd project, I was on a team that had been recently split into two teams, and I asked why we needed so many people for only a couple services as it didn't seem like there'd be much to do, and they told me there was definitely going to be work to do. After about 5 weeks, we had 2-3 people working on one user story that didn't take more than about an hour to do for one person. My manager told me it was kind of slow, so I could use some of the time to watch Udemy videos and learn new tools while they waited for more stories to come. Eventually, they disbanded the team because they found they didn't even need it and sent a few to other teams, and cut others including me. The manager said she was only interested in hiring contractors from vendors, and it was apparent why. So, a few years later, every time it seemed like I'd be doing a new project to get more experience, it has all been too good to be true as they ended up being only projects that were poorly projected, disorganized, and either scrapped or switched to offshore staffing.",11,0.79,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kc37zb/is_it_shocking_that_every_project_i_was_assigned/,2025-05-01 07:48:07,2025-05-07 01:40:35
1kg54fv,Where do I go from here?,ladidadi82,cscareerquestions,"Im mid 30s and until recently was making pretty good money. Nowhere near faang money but on the higher side of average and in a lcol area working remote. The writing was on the wall that layoffs were coming so I started actively interviewing. I’ve applied to maybe 20-30 positions and have gotten like 10 screens with 4 actual on sites but no offers. One with a faang company. I know why. My interview skills have never been and aren’t great but that is something that I usually get better at the more I interview. I feel pretty good about how I’m interviewing now but I’m still just not the best at it. I’m a good programmer, but not the best. I can figure out most leetcode mediums and even hards but usually not in 20-25 minutes. I’ve always been good at my job because I’m willing to take my time to understand a problem and implement a solid solution. In the past this has worked out because although I never landed a big tech job, I got to work at some pretty big companies with what I’d say is relatively good pay. It seems like I’m just not as good as the competition anymore and I can’t stand out against the competition. What’s worse is the sub field I’m in (mobile) seems to be shrinking (lower paying jobs in hcol areas and a lot of the jobs that used to exist in the US are now being outsourced). Let’s say i manage to find another job in a somewhat short time frame. What is guaranteeing this from getting worse? It seems like I’m on a sinking ship. But at this age, where do I go? With how difficult things seem to be for entry level engineers I feel like even switching to backend would be difficult and with no guarantee of job security. Do I try to switch into something tech adjacent like sales or a sales solution engineer? Do I get out of the tech industry as a whole? Do I go back to school? I’ve never had such a bleak outlook on life before in my life. I know I’m being dramatic but sometimes I have these intrusive thoughts like just giving up on life as a whole.Edit:CS Degree at a top 50 cs school but with a low gpa (3.0). I was always kind of smart but I was never one of the smartest kids in the classroom. I also spent a lot of time slacking in middle school and high school but managed to get into community college and then into my states university where I scraped by in getting my degree. I had to work part time so I had limited time to study if not I think I would have done a bit better. 11 years of experience.One of my biggest challenges is severe performance anxiety when giving presentations. That is something that I avoided in my career for a long time but have been working on for the past few years. Even with medication, it’s still hard for me but I’ve realized if it’s the difference between putting food on the table and starving I need to improve no matter what.

I've been struggling with what to do for a couple years since I wasn't able to get an internship, but obviously it's now coming to a head. That being said, this is half-rant half-looking for advice so I'd appreciate constructive feedback.I'm an upcoming new grad, but (aside from a capstone project with a startup and teaching web design), I don't have a ton of marketable SWE skills other than the fundamentals. I was not able to secure a proper internship during my school career, so my only real experience is with the startup, where I mostly helped design the database, user design, and implement some AI functionality.I picked computer science because I felt it was a good balance of security and things that I like. That being, I like tech and problem solving. I was never particularly passionate about software engineering in particular, but I do love debugging and building upon existing projects. But as I approach graduation in a few weeks and hundreds of applications (and some referrals) are now returning rejections, I'm not really sure where to do. And I have already been applying to anything vaguely tech related across the US, but not getting any callbacks, which I'm sure is an indication of my resume strength.I'm feeling lost like I'm sure a lot of other people are. I feel like I'm just losing out to the people who are far more experienced and passionate than me. The response to that would be to work on personal projects and hone my portfolio, but I'm honestly skeptical that would even work. Granted, I haven't put a ton of time into doing so yet as I've been focusing on school and work, so I don't actually know yet, but I see all these super experienced and talented people getting turned down all the time anyways so it's a bit defeating.**TL;DR:** My dilemma is this - I don't know if the best plan of action is just to bunker down and grind out personal projects while continuing to apply everywhere, or instead try to study a related field to try and break in there, which would be basically any role that appreciates a CS degree. Whether that's QA, tech support/IT, data analysis, etc., I think any of them could be engaging work for me still, but I think I would still need to specifically study one of them to get in.If anyone is interested - [here's my anonymous resume](https://imgur.com/a/AZqRh80).

Even if it isn’t, I would like to be prepared for whatever the call is about.I know the base salary as the recruiter mentioned that in the first call, also listed on the job description. So I am kinda prepared for what to ask there. For other parts of the offer, there’s not much data out there. How should I go about doing this call? This is the information I have for the company:- Base salary mentioned on the posting- No equity - There is year end annual bonus for sure- Not sure if they offer sign on bonusI don’t see a point in delaying the negotiation if I already know their base range. But how do I go about negotiating other parts? Let’s say they offer $20K sign on, can I ask for 30, 40?

1kbjvjz,Am I pigeonholing myself?,cachebags,cscareerquestions,"My last two internships as a Data and Software Engineer, respectively, have both been at a very large Fortune 250 Automotive Company. I graduate December 2026, and was curious if anyone had trouble pivoting from an adjacent field like this to something like Full-Stack Development or Software Engineering in another capacity (say Amazon or Microsoft, working on consumer products or internal service teams).I currently work as a Software Engineer Co-Op in the ePowertrain division (electric vehicles) and the work is very challenging and interesting. But it's also been really getting me by these semesters as it pays me a full-time salary, while also allowing me to finish school full-time. And despite the work being interesting, I do not want to do it for my career.I'm worried by the time I graduate though, that the only companies I'll be able to grab interest from is other Automotive companies.Any advice or help would be appreciated.

1kftac1,Would a masters degree be worth it?,Wonderful_Analyst_50,cscareerquestions,"I graduated college with a bachelors degree in computer science a while ago and ever since I’ve been living with my parents while doing delivery services like Instacart and uber eats to make money while I try to search for a job as a software engineer. As you can guess I haven’t really gotten anywhere with that. I even attended a software engineering bootcamp last year to try to bolster my resume (may not have been the smartest idea in hindsight but I enjoyed it and met some cool people so I don’t regret it) but still nothing. My family is now trying to push me to apply for a masters program focusing on something like cybersecurity or biotech (which feels a little outside my comfort zone as I wasn’t great at biology) claiming the masters is the final piece I need to make it all come together. Honestly the thought of putting so much more time and money into a field that has had fruitless returns so far gives me a ton of anxiety and I don’t want to come out the other side of it multiple years from now tens of thousands of dollars in debt and be in the same position I’m in now. I was lucky enough that I could get my bachelors degree mostly for free due to my father’s VA benefits but I’d be too old to qualify for that once I get into a masters program so I’d be paying full price this time around. I also burned out pretty hard towards the end of my bachelors (partially due to Covid) and pretty much dragged myself across the finish line so the thought of going back after a few years away is pretty daunting.Ultimately though I know I need to do something and I’m sick and tired of the position I’m in. I feel like I’ve put my life on hold for years trying to start it from the best position possible and I’m at a point where it just doesn’t feel viable anymore. Living with my parents for this long just doing deliveries and job applications every day has made me pretty depressed and I kind of just want to get a regular non-tech job, move out into an apartment with a friend, and figure out my life from there. At the same time though I feel like if a masters degree would genuinely be very useful in the long run, I’m being short sighted and years from now I’d regret not getting it. Especially considering my parents are willing to keep housing me while I go back to school so I’d probably be making my life more difficult by moving out instead, even if it would probably improve my mental health.I do genuinely enjoy coding and would consider myself pretty good at it, but I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about it or anything. I don’t really feel passionate about anything really, I kinda just want to have a good life making comfortable money and not hating my job. When I changed my major to computer science it seemed like a pretty straight shot, I enjoyed it more than my other classes, I was naturally very good at it, and there seemed to be a pretty direct path of internship (check) -> degree (check) -> high paying job (crash and burn). The market crash happened right before I graduated so I found it to be extremely unlucky timing and have pretty much been trying to play catch up ever since.Basically I’m just looking to see if anyone has any thoughts on the usefulness of a masters degree in the current market and if it would be a good use of my time and money or not. Or maybe even if there’s any CS related jobs I could get with my current degree that I may have overlooked so far (I’ve mainly been focusing on full stack development). Any advice is very appreciated.TLDR: I’m wondering if a masters degree is worth the time and money in this current tech market or if there are any other type of CS jobs I could get with my bachelors that are commonly overlooked. Or should I just cut my losses, find a non-tech job, move into an apartment with a friend, and try to figure out my life from there.",5,0.67,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kftac1/would_a_masters_degree_be_worth_it/,2025-05-06 02:00:37,2025-05-07 01:40:35
