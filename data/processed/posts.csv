1lrh9w5,2025 Open Source Tech Stack,DataCraftsman,dataengineering,"I'm a Technical Lead Engineer. Previously a Data Engineer, Data Analyst and Data Manager and Aircraft Maintenance Engineer. I am also studying Software Engineering at the moment.I've been working in isolated environments for the past 3 years which prevents me from using modern cloud platforms. Most of my time in DE has been on the platform side, not the data side. Since I joined the field, DevOps, MLOPs, LLMs, RAG and Data Lakehouse have been added to our responsibility on top of the old Modern Data Stack and Data Warehouses. This stack covers all of the use cases I have faced so far. These are my current recommendations for each of those problems in a self hosted, open source environment (with the exception of vibe coding, I haven't found any model good enough to do so yet). You don't need all of these tools, but you could use them all if you needed to. Solve the problems you have with the minimum tools you can. I have been working on guides on how to deploy the stack in docker/kubernetes on my site, [www.datacraftsman.com.au](http://www.datacraftsman.com.au), but not all of them are finished yet... I've been vibe coding data engineering tools instead as it's a fun distraction. I hope these resources help you make a better decision with your architecture.Comment below if you have any advice on improving the stack with reasons why, need any help setting up the tools or want to understand my choices and I'll try my best to help.",505,0.85,75,https://i.redd.it/0bwy1conkuaf1.png,2025-07-04 12:15:10,2025-07-08 01:45:42

Since then, I’ve had two jobs - Associate Data Engineer, and Data Engineer - but neither was actually a data engineering job. The first was more of a coding/developer role with R, and the most ETL thing I did was write code to read in text files, transform the data, create visualizations, and generate reports. The second job involved gathering business requirements and writing hundreds of SQL queries for a massive system implementation. So now, I’m trying to get an *actual* data engineering job, and in this market, I’m not having much luck. What can I do to beef up my CV?

In all I processed 178.33 GB ZIP files, which uncompressed was 3314.57 GB. I created Parquet files for each table, with the data types optimized.Here are some next steps that I want to do, and I would love anyone's comments on it:* Create a Dagster (have to learn it) pipeline that downloads and processes the data tables when they are updated (I am almost finished creating a Python Package).* Create a process that will upload the files to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (CERNs data portal) and other sites such as The Internet Archive, and Hugging Face. The data will be versioned so we will always be able to go back in time and see what code was used to create the data and how the data has changed. I also want to create a torrent file for each dataset and have it HTTP seeded from the aforementioned sites; I know this is overkill as the largest dataset is only 6.94 GB, but I want to experiment with it as I think it would be awesome for a data portal to have this feature.* Create a Python package that magically links the data tables to their geographic boundaries. This way people will be able to view it software such as QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, DeckGL, lonboard, or anything that can read Parquet.All of the code to create the data is currently in \[2\].

If there was a genuine intentional feedback loop between us, we could move much faster than what were doing. But now it's considered failure if an adjustment is needed or an additional column must be added etc after the pipeline is documented, which must be completed before they will touch the data.I actually don't mind doing data analysis on a personal level, but it's weird that a data starved data science team doesn't want more data and sooner, and do this analysis themselves?",60,0.94,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lrsrdn/what_tests_do_you_do_on_your_data_pipeline/,2025-07-04 20:36:51,2025-07-08 01:45:42

Reporting is mainly done via downloading files from the ERP and importing it into PowerBI or excel. For some projects we call the api of the ERP to get the data. Other specialized Applications sit on Top of the SQL databases.Problems: Most of the Reports get fed manually and we really want to get them to run automatically (including data cleaning), which would save a lot of time.

1ltg0pt,Why Realtime Analytics Feels Like a Myth (and What You Can Actually Expect),ivanimus,dataengineering,"Hi there :waving_hand:I’ve been diving into the concept of realtime analytics, and I’m starting to think it’s more hype than reality. Here’s why achieving true realtime analytics (sub-second latency) is so tough, especially when building data marts in a Data Warehouse or Lakehouse:1. Processing Delays: Even with CDC (Change Data Capture) for instant raw data ingestion, subsequent steps like data cleaning, quality checks, transformations, and building data marts take time. Aggregations, validations, and metric calculations can add seconds to minutes, which is far from the ""realtime"" promise (<1s).2. Complex Transformations: Data marts often require heavy operations—joins, aggregations, and metric computations. These depend on data volume, architecture, and compute power. Even with optimized engines like Spark or Trino, latency creeps in, especially with large datasets.3. Data Quality Overhead: Raw data is rarely clean. Validation, deduplication, and enrichment add more delays, making ""near-realtime"" (seconds to minutes) the best-case scenario.4. Infra Bottlenecks: Fast ingestion via CDC is great, but network bandwidth, storage performance, or processing engine limitations can slow things down.5. Hype vs. Reality: Marketing loves to sell ""realtime analytics"" as instant insights, but real-world setups often mean seconds-to-minutes latency. True realtime is only feasible for simple use cases, like basic metric monitoring with streaming systems (e.g., Kafka + Flink).TL;DR: Realtime analytics isn’t exactly a scam, but it’s overhyped. You’re more likely to get ""near-realtime"" due to unavoidable processing and transformation delays. To get close to realtime, simplify transformations, optimize infra, and use streaming tech—but sub-second latency is still a stretch for complex data marts.What’s your experience with realtime analytics?

Someone else suggested changing the CRM system and got very little upvotes.

Source -> BI ToolLonger version:Coming from being ""the excel guy"" I've recently been promoted to analytics engineer (whether or not that's justified is a discussion for another time and place).My company's reporting was entirely build upon me accessing source systems like our ERP and CRM through SQL directly and feeding that into Excel via power query.Due to growth in complexity and demand this isn't a sustainable way of doing things anymore, hence me being tasked with BI-ifying that stuff.Now, it's been a while (read ""a decade"") since the last time I've come into contact with dimensional modeling, kimball and data warehousing.But that's more or less what I know or rather I can get my head around, so naturally that's what I proposed to build.Our development team is seeing things differently saying that storing data multiple times would be unacceptable and with the amount of data we have performance wouldn't be either.They propose to build custom APIs for the various source systems and feeding those directly into whatever BI tool we choose (we are 100% on-prem so powerBI is out of the race, tableau is looking good rn).And here is where I just don't know how to argue. How valid is their point? Do we even need a data warehouse (or lakehouse and all those fancy things I don't know anything about)?One argument they had was that BI tools come with their own specialized ""database"" that is optimized and much faster in a way we could never build it manually.But do they really? I know Excel/power query has some sort of storage, same with powerBI but that's not a database, right?I'm just a bit at a loss here and was hoping you actual engineers could steer me in the right direction.Thank you!",13,0.78,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lrcx96/please_help_do_modern_bi_systems_need_an/,2025-07-04 07:43:03,2025-07-08 01:45:42
1lpxdy8,Polars/SQLAlchemy-> Upsert data to database,N1loon,dataengineering,"I'm currently learning Python, specifically the Polars API and the interaction with SQLAlchemy. There are functions to read in and write data to a database (pl.read_databaae and pl.write_database). Now, I'm wondering if it's possible to further specify the import logic and if so, how would I do it?Specifically, I wan to perform an Upsert (insert or update) and as a table operation I want to define 'Create table if not exists'. There is another function 'pl.write_delta', in which it's possible via multiple parameters to define the exact import logic to Delta Lake:```.when_matched_update_all() \.when_not_matched_insert_all() \.execute()```I assume it wasn't possible to generically include these parameters in write_database because all RDBMS handle Upsets differently? ...So, what would be the recommended/best-practice way of upserting data to SQL Server? Can I do it with SQLAlchemy taking a Polars dataframe as an input?The complete data pipeline looks like this:- read in flat file (xlsx/CSV/JSON) with Polars- perform some data wrangling operations with Polars- upsert data to SQL Server (with table operation 'Create table if not exists')What I also found in a Stackoverflow post regarding Upserts with Polars:```df1 = ( df_new .join(df_old, on = [""group"",""id""], how=""inner"") .select(df_new.columns) ) df2 = ( df_new .join(df_old, on = [""group"",""id""], how=""anti"") ) df3 = ( df_old .join(df_new, on = [""group"",""id""], how=""anti"") ) df_all = pl.concat([df1, df2, df3])```Or with `pl.update()` I could perform an Upsert inside Polars:```df.update(new_df, left_on=[""A""], right_on=[""C""], how=""full"")```With both options though, I would have to read in the respective table from the database first, perform the Upsert with Polars and then write the output to the database again.

I'm creating a hands-on coding course for upstream data quality for transactional databases and would love feedback on my plan!

For this I'm planning on having the following:- Postgres Database- pgAdmin for SQL IDE- A very simple typescript frontend app to surface data- A very simple user login workflow for CRUD data- A data catalog via DataHubWe will have a working data product as well as create data by going through the login workflow a couple times. We will then intentionally break it (update the data to be bad, change the login data collected without changing schema, and changing the DDL files to introduce errors). These errors will be hidden from the user, but they will see a bunch of errors in the logs and frontend.From there we conduct a root cause analysis to identify the issues. Examples of ways we will resolve issues is the following:- Revert back changes to the frontend- Add regex validation for login workflow- Review and fix introduced bugs in the DDL files- Implement DQ checks to run in CI/CD that compares proposed schema changes to expected schema in data catalogAnything you would add or change to this plan?

1lpp9nk,SQL vs. Pandas for Batch Data Visualization,schrodingersmilk,dataengineering,"I'm working on a project where I'm building a pipeline to organize, analyze, and visualize experimental data from different batches. The goal is to help my team more easily view and compare historical results through an interactive web app.Right now, all the experiment data is stored as CSVs in a shared data lake, which allows for access control, only authorized users can view the files. Initially, I thought it’d be better to load everything into a database like PostgreSQL, since structured querying feels cleaner and would make future analytics easier. So I tried adding a batch_id column to each dataset and uploading everything into Postgres to allow for querying and plotting via the web app. But since we don’t have a cloud SQL setup, and loading all the data into a local SQL instance for new user every time felt inefficient, I didn’t go with that approach.Then I discovered DuckDB, which seemed promising since it’s SQL-based and doesn’t require a server, and I could just keep a database file in the shared folder. But now I’m running into two issues: 1) Streamlit takes a while to connect to DuckDB every time, and 2) the upload/insert process is for some reason troublesome and need to take more time to maintain schema and structure etc.So now I’m stuck… in a case like this, is it even worth loading all the CSVs into a database at all? Should I stick with DuckDB/SQL? Or would it be simpler to just use pandas to scan the directory, match file names to the selected batch, and read in only what’s needed? If so, would there be any issues with doing analytics later on?

So I have been working as SQL Server Dba for last 2 years for a service based company and I am currently part of the dba team which caters to atleast 8-10 clients simultaneously. Most of my work is monitoring work with ocassional high level stuff, otherwise most of the time I get like L1 level tasks. Since we cater to multiple clients therefore I had the opportunity to get in touch with other databases like MySQL and Oracle. I also work in AWS cloud, mainly we work with RDS, S3 for backups and EC2 instances where DB instances are installed. We work in rotational shifts which is the least favorite part of the job me. I got DBA role as a chance to enter to corporate and specially the data field, but I really don't like the DBA role, because I have seen the kind of time this role demands from you. I have seen my manager even working weekends sometimes due to some client activity or doing some POC for potential client. Plus the rotational shift I just hate it, I have endured for 2 years but I don't think so I will be able to endure for another year or two. I have been working remotely for last 2 years Therefore I had plenty of time to upskill myself and learn technologies like SQL Server, AWS Cloud (Mainly Database related tasks), L1 administration of MySQL and Oracle. Apart from that I have also invested time in learning Python which I like a lot, I had also invested a lot time in learning SQL too. Earlier I was learning web dev along job thinking that I could transition from DBA to dev, but I realised that both are very different roles and whatever I have learnt here as a DBA won't do me that good in dev role. Therefor I have decided to further transition into DE role. I have made a plan of the things that I will have to learn for DE role and also a plan to double down on things I already know. Mostly I want to focus on Azure ecosystem for DE and for That I have decided to learn SQL, Azure Data Factory - ADF - ETL, Databricks, Python, Spark - PySpark, Azure Synapse Analytics. I am already familiar with SQL and Python as mentioned before, and just need to take care of the other things. I just want to know from you guys is this even possible? Or am I just stuck with DBA role forever? Is my plan even relevant and doable or not?

1lpld31,Why do we need the heartbeat mechanism in MySQL CDC connector?,the-fake-me,dataengineering,"I have worked with MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL Debezium CDC connectors as of now. As per my understanding, the reason MongoDB and PostgreSQL connectors need the heartbeat mechanism is that both MongoDB and PostgreSQL notify the connector of the changes in the subscribed collections/tables (using MongoDB change streams and PostgreSQL publications) and if no changes happen in the collections/tables for a long time, the connector might not receive any activity corresponding to the subscribed collections/tables. In case of MongoDB, that might lead to losing the token and in case of PostgreSQL, it might lead to the replication slot getting bigger (if there are changes happening to other non-subscribed tables/databases in the cluster). Now, as far as I understand, MySQL Debezium connector (or any CDC connector) reads the binlog files, filters for the records pertaining to the subscribed table and writes those records to, say, Kafka. MySQL doesn't notify the client (in this case the connector) of changes to the subscribed tables. So the connector shouldn't need a heartbeat. Even if there's no activity in the table, the connector should still read the binlog files, find that there's no activity, write nothing to Kafka and commit till when it has read. Why is the heartbeat mechanism required for MySQL CDC connectors? I am sure there is a gap in my understanding of how MySQL CDC connectors work. It would be great if someone could point out what I am missing.

And then a RM command to remove the files from table stage.order of execution :- PUT to table\_1 stage >> copy to table\_1 >> RM to remove table\_1 stage file.All the above mentioned steps are handled by kafka of course :)And as expected this runs fine, no rows missed during the process.

But below is the over all process via our custom application.Put file to snowflake named stage >> copy command to unload the file to table\_1.Note :- in our scenario we want to load batch data into the same table where the kafka stream is running. This batch load process only works fine when the kafka stream is turned off on the table. All the rows from the files gets loaded fine.But here is the catch, once the kafka stream is turned on the table, if we try to load the batch file it doesnt just load at all.I have checked the query history and copy history.And found out another weird behaviour. It says the copy command has been run successfully and loaded around 1800 records into the table. But the file that we had uploaded had 57k. Even though it says it had loaded 1800 rows, those rows are nowhere to be found in the table. Has anyone encountered this issue? I know the stream and batch load process are not ideal.

1los4xa,High School Intern - Advice please,OverallActuator9350,dataengineering,"Hey,I’m a high school student who recently landed a summer internship at a company that does data science work for hedge funds. I basically got it through nepotism, and while I know that it isn't the most respectable way of getting it I still want to take advantage of the opportunityI’m super excited, but also kinda nervous because the other couple of interns are *super* cracked college students.He told me my role will likely involve infrastructure/devops support (Linux, shell scripting, AWS) and possibly(?) data science tasks (Python, Pandas, maybe some Streamlit or Plotly)? He wasn't too specific when describing it to me.I’m comfortable with basic Python, but still learning most of the other tools. This past week I’ve been self-studying Bash, but haven't really touched on the rest of the technologies he said I might use.

1ltsbjn,Star schema - flatten dimensional hierarchy?,paulrpg,dataengineering,"I'm doing some design work where are are generally trying to follow Kimball modelling for a star schema. I'm familiar with the theory of the data warehouse toolkit but I haven't had that much experience implementing it. For reference, we are doing this in snowflake/dbt and were talking about tables with a few million rows.I am trying to model a process which has a fixed hierarchy. We have 3 layers to this - a top level organisational plan, a plan for doing a functional test and then the individual steps taken to complete this plan. To make it a bit more complicated - whilst the process I am looking at has a fixed hierarchy but the process is a subset of a larger process which allows for arbitrary depth, I feel that the simpler business case is easier to solve first.I want to end up with 1 or several dimensional models to capture this, store descriptive text etc. The literature states that fixed hierarchies should be flattened. If we took this approach:* Our dimension table grain is 1 row for each task* Each row would contain full textual information for the functional test and the organisational plan* We have a small 'One Big Table' approach, making it easy for BI users to access the dataThe challenge I see here is around what keys to use. Our business processes map to different levels of this hierarchy, some to the top level plan, some to the functional test and some to the step.I keep going back and forth as a more normalised approach - where 1 table for each of these steps and then build a bridge table to map them all together is something that we have done for arbitrary depth and it worked really well.If we are to go with a flattened model then:* Should I include the surrogate keys for each level in the hierarchy (preferred) or model the relationship in a secondary table?* Business analysts are going to use this - is this their preferred approach - they will have fewer joins to do but will need to do more aggregation/deduplication if they are only interested in top level informationIf we go for a more normalised model:* Should we be offering a pre-joined view of the data - effectively making a 'one big table' available at the cost of performance?",7,0.82,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ltsbjn/star_schema_flatten_dimensional_hierarchy/,2025-07-07 12:01:22,2025-07-08 01:45:42

1ltymyl,Best filetype for loading onto pytorch,Affectionate_Use9936,dataengineering,"Hi, so I was on a lot of data engineering forums trying to figure out how to optimize large scientific datasets for pytorch training. Asking this question, I think the go-to answer was to use parquet. The other options my lab had been looking at was .zarr, .hdf5However, running some benchmarks, it seems like pickle is by far the fastest. Which I guess makes sense. But I'm trying to figure out if this is just because I didn't optimize my file handling for parquet or HDF5. So for loading parquet, I read it in with pandas, then convert to torch. I realized with pyarrow there's no option of converting to torch. For hdf5, I just read it in with pytablesBasically how I load in data is that my torch dataloader has list of paths, or key\_value pairs (for hdf5), then I just run it with large batches through 1 iteration. I used batch size of 8. (I also did 1 batch and 32, but the results pretty much scale the same). Here are the results comparing load speed with parquet, pickle, and hdf5.

1lt6qlc,How do you actually code??,Godevil4716,learnprogramming,"I'm currently in my third year of engineering, and to be honest, I haven’t done much in the past two years besides watching countless roadmap videos and trying to understand what's trending in the tech market. Now that I’ve entered my third year, I’ve decided to aim for a Java Full Stack Developer role. I know it’s a heavy-duty role, but I want to keep it as my goal even if I don't fully achieve it, at least I’ll be moving in a clear direction.Here’s the issue I’ve been facing: whenever I watch a YouTube video of someone building an end-to-end project, I expect to learn something valuable. But then I see that the actual learning requires following a long playlist. Theoretically, the concepts make sense I understand the data flow and architecture. But when I get to the implementation, especially the backend, everything becomes overwhelming.There are all these annotations, unfamiliar syntax, and configurations that feel like they just magically work and I have no clue why or how. I end up copying the code just to make it work, but in the end, I realize I’ve understood very little. It feels more like rote copying than actual learning.Truthfully, I feel lost during this process. The complexity of the syntax and the lack of clarity around what’s happening behind the scenes demotivates me.So, here’s what I really want to understand: how do people actually “learn” a tech stack or anything new in tech?Do they just copy someone else's project (like I’m doing) and somehow that’s enough to add it to their resume? I’ve watched so many roadmaps that I know the general advice—pick a language, choose a framework, build projects—but when it comes to actual implementation, I feel like without that tutorial in front of me, I wouldn’t be able to write a single line of meaningful logic on my own.Is this really how someone LEARNS in a IT Tech Industry?Just by watching playlist and rote copying?",155,0.9,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lt6qlc/how_do_you_actually_code/,2025-07-06 17:23:55,2025-07-08 01:45:44

So many properties, methods, constructors, inheritance, mixins, parameters, and I’m like:""Wait… what do I actually need to look at right now?""I often just search for what I need in the moment, but then I get this weird FOMO (fear of missing out), like maybe I’m ignoring something really useful that I’ll need later.At the same time, reading everything seems impossible and draining.So I wanted to ask:How do you personally approach big documentation pages?Do you just read what’s relevant now?Do you take time to explore what else a class can do, even if you don’t need it yet?And if yes, how do you remember or organize what you saw for later?I guess I just feel like I should ""know everything"" and that pressure gets overwhelming.

1ls1kp8,Friendly advice to beginners: Stop obsessing over languages and start viewing them as tools.,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"I was also guilty of this when I started 3 years ago. I wanted to learn everything, because everything seemed so cool. My main goal was Backend development but I ended up starting courses on Kotlin, Go, Rust, Java, Python and Lua. I didn't see these languages as tools but as personalities, and that's a big mistake I made aswell as a lot of other beginners. Very often I'd find myself asking questions like ""How many languages should I learn?"", ""Is Java, JavaScript and Python a good stack for backend development?"", but I'd still be learning JS arrays in codecademy with only 3 projects in my directory.The answer to all those questions, in my opinion is, it does not matter. Programming != coding, so it doesn't matter how many languages you learn, the thing you should be mainly focused is learning how to solve problems using the syntax. Learn to solve problems with what you have, THAT is the important piece in my opinion.Why I think it's important that many beginners grow out of this phase ASAP: 1. When you start to view languages as what they are, you start to appreciate more what you use. In my case, I don't find JavaScript to be the most charming language, but I love it's rich ecosystem and the fact that I can use it for pretty much anything I want to do. 2. You risk burning yourself out. This was me three years ago. I had 5 courses on different languages and it polluted my mind with information that I KNEW deep down was completely useless to me in the long run. You could argue that I was getting to see new paradigms and techniques to solving problems, but that wasn't even true. I never made it far enough into ANY course to learn anything that I hadn't seen in JavaScript. It was a waste of time and it lead to me burning out and losing interest, until recently that I finally got back into programming. 3. You stop thinking and you start doing. When I finally got back into coding recently with better learning habits I started learning and creating projects faster than ever before. Because I wasn't focused on ""Hmmm, maybe I should try out Scala!"", no I was focused on ""What other Data Structures should I learn to implement?"", ""How do I solve this bug?"", ""What should be my next project?"". When you start seeing languages as tools, you'll want to use those tools.In conclusion, this is not to say that you shouldn't be curious and you shouldn't ask questions and you shouldn't experiment and you should just stick to one thing and never explore. What I'm trying to say is that, a lot of the time, beginners are so excited to learn that they forget WHY they're learning. Which is to get a job, to be successful, to create something meaningful, to be good at a hobby, etc.. And I feel like if you don't focus on creating and learning and solving, and you're always thinking about what's the future and not the present, then you'll just risk burning yourself out. There are tons of roadmaps out there for whatever you want to build, stick with it or tweak it a little along the way. But don't start a course on Python today and then tomorrow it's SQL and then the next day is HTML and CSS, no. Stick to what you want to do, once you understand the core concepts and programming as a whole, everything else will follow and everything after that will be easier to learn.",129,0.96,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ls1kp8/friendly_advice_to_beginners_stop_obsessing_over/,2025-07-05 04:35:27,2025-07-08 01:45:44

I've hit many moments, where feeling completely stumped on a lesson, that the core solve for it came from an understanding that was not reviewed in the previous ""internal"" materials, but existed as something that would have been ""understood"" if the user had some comp sci / programming background. It's just very frustrating at times to feel as though you've been paying attention to the materials and following along, only to suddenly hit a wall of knowledge and discover, \[ no its designed to not be informed, so you have an urge to go out and find what you dont know \]. Personally, if I'm paying for a service, I want the knowledge to be provided for learning, not that I have to go out externally elsewhere and hopefully discover it. >**THE WARNING**Content will become SIGNIFICANTLY harder as you progress. The Discord is there and does help a lot in answer basic questions, and some more advanced ones; but it does genuinely feel as though the course materials are being written more for people who are already have familiarity with Comp Sci / Programming, **ie the core basics**, and then the later courses are meant to build on top of that wider external schooling and knowledge. Those that are there to assist, again all well meaning and wanting to be helpful, advise on how to solve for it as if they were speaking to other programmers who also are familiar with the code youre having trouble with. Like hearing 2 experts talk to each other trying to solve a problem, if youre not on the same level knowledge wise, it becomes more difficult to follow along on what theyre trying to advise on how to correct for. >**FINAL THOUGHTS**The service provided is INCREDIBLY well worth the cost... to a point depending on where you're starting from. If you have some code formal training / teaching, it probably is easier to follow along, but its openly stated that there is a teaching approach of not providing all the resources / guideposts for you to follow, and that you should go beyond the platform to find some answers.**For me, I have issue with that approach as a service I'm paying for to learn a subject matter on** *but again, thats uniquely to me*I just want to share this to both promote the service, as I have been able to write functional python blurbs for solving my own small scale ideas and puzzles; but also as a warning that its VERY unlikely you can go into this, completely cold fresh and blind, and come out within 1 year as a trained backend dev with the full experience. I'll most likely renew my yearly membership for the platform, but there are hurdles that I now have to figure out the best way to learn-around instead of just beating my face into the wall as I have been for some problems.",20,0.86,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lpd83d/bootdev_learning_fall_off_warning_from_a_paid/,2025-07-01 20:56:43,2025-07-08 01:45:44

1lrih6t,Getting back into programming after 15 years,thinkfast37,learnprogramming,"I was a Java programmer with a solid knowledge of SQL from 2000 till about 2010 before I moved into management roles. I also wrote two books on SQL back around Y2K. When I joined my current company I was actually hoping to get to be more hands on again, but the reality was my role didn't call for it... until now. Our new CTO wants dev managers to be more ""player coaches"". So I am actually pretty keen about learning my stack which is primarily node.js, react and postgres based and API standards are important.So my question is how best to efficiently learn the stack in 2025. I will need to learn syntax, and I will need to learn mechanisms that I have not worked with before, eg: promises - as asynchronous programming was not prevalent when I was a programmer. Back in the day, I learned very well reading good books - I remember a book about Java by Ivor Horton from WROX that I read back to front in a matter of days. But I wouldn't say all books were of that level. I even read all the IBM books on DB2 to learn the product and become strong on databases.Over the years I have dabbled with Udemy courses, but I find them far too inefficient to consume in video format in comparison to reading. I did learn some concepts in React and Typescript syntax, but I never completed the courses because frankly they wouldn't have benefited my role at the time and I haven't really coded for fun in some time.I also tried an ACM membership where I got access to some Safari books as well as well as Pluralsight courses which were better I found than Udemy - but lacked much one the node.js front (perhaps limited by the ACM offering). The Safari books were ok, but not necessarily that well written.I'm looking for what is likely to be the best path forward for me.

1lsmji6,Made an even/odd checker as my first 'project.' Can the code be improved or made more efficient?,AxelsOG,learnprogramming,"So I started up on learning Python again and have made more progress than previous attempts and I'm starting to enjoy it a bit more now. But I've started by using Grok simply as a baseline starting point because I've always had trouble ""just learning"" and if I have no structure it tends to be difficult. I understand its probably not great long term, but I'm just simply using it to guide, but I'm also relying on other documentation and other sources online beyond a baseline ""Try and do this, maybe try and implement this and go in this general direction""But anyway, the suggestion it gave me was a program that checks whether a number is odd or even. My first iteration was made because I didn't read what it was supposed to be and ended up making a program that had a list of preset numbers, picked a random number from that list and checked if it was even or odd.Since I realized that wasn't what I was 'supposed' to do, I actually realized what I should have done and made this.What it's intended to do is request a valid positive integer, and check if its even or odd. It ignores any negative integers, any numbers 'too larger' (which I added simply to continue learning new stuff), and anything that isn't a number.It also gives you 3 tries to input a valid integer before closing after too many tries. I also made it so the ""attempts remaining"" will either say ""attempts"" or ""attempt"" based on whether you have multiple attempts left, or only 1 attempt remaining.And this works exactly as intended on the user side. I may be overthinking this, but I was wondering if there was a way to optimize it or make it more 'efficient' when checking if the number is less than 0 or if the number is too large. Even though it works exactly as intended, I was wondering if this code was 'bad' even though it works. I don't want to develop any bad coding habits or make things longer/harder than they need to be. from time import sleep max_attempts = 3 #Total attempts allowed. attempts = 0 #Attempt starting value. number = None print('This program checks if a number is even or odd.') #Welcomes the user. while attempts < max_attempts:     try:         number = int(input('Enter a valid non-negative integer: '))         if number < 0:             attempts += 1             remaining = max_attempts-attempts ##Defines remaining as maximum attempts minus wrong attempts             if attempts < max_attempts:                 print(f""Invalid input!

1ltf54g,Recommendation for newbies (from a newbie),flrslva,learnprogramming,"Write your own labs (or whatever you want from scratch) It's helped me a ton. A lot of my coding assignments are pre written with #include's, main(), return0; and are extremely guided. It feels more like I'm drawing on a tracing table or bowling with bumpers than actually learning to code.The labs will tell you you need x ,y, and z. Then you type x, y, and z. Then you run it. Wow it works. But I don't always really know why it works. Why? That's more important.What I started doing was writing the assignment down and figuring out for myself what I need to write the program. If things don't run I'll check my notes, search geeksforgeeks, stack overflow etc, DONT READ THE AI OVERVIEW! That code was even more confusing. Get in the habit of reading things. Im in a C++ class so cppreference is a good source too.You'll make mistakes. You need that. Thats how you become a better programmer. I finally understood the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value parameters in functions because I had to fix my bad code. Then I could really understand what the books where saying.Side note. Grow your simple programs into something complex. I wrote a small inventory program when we were learning about loops and then I forgot about it. I picked it up again and I moved the code into a function. Then the next version I separated the function into two. A reading function and printing function. The next version will use a class and objects. Your program gets an upgrade. And leave yourself notes on what you want to add or change to your program. Another thing that helps too. It's on my GitHub if anyone wants to see. Nothing amazing but I'm proud.You do all the thinking. Thats a real test.

Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.There's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice. I want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself.

1lu2ygi,I accidentally deleted Levels.fyi's entire backend server stack last week,ZiggyMo99,cscareerquestions,"Co-founder of [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi/) here. I deleted our backend stack on accident last week that led to a brief outage. I figure this might be an interesting discussion on how to remediate, etc.Brief summary: We're in the process of getting SOC compliance done and to simplify compliance I thought it best to clean up any old resources we have lying around. It's pretty common at companies to have unused resources. Some are simple like old logs, others are more complex like server machines / infrastructure.We use AWS pretty much for everything. We had a unused API Gateway api. I checked the response / request metrics and confirmed there were no requests. I realized this was created by a CloudFormation stack so I naturally went to CF and hit delete. Turns out, this stack was actually what we had used to create our production backend servers, networking, cloudformation, etc.As soon as I hit delete, I refreshed and saw all the stuff it started deleted. That's when I knew I f'd up. :grinning_face_with_sweat: There's no way to 'stop' a CloudFormation stack to continue deleting. In crisis mode, it's always better to have multiple heads in the room. I called up one of my friends that used to work at AWS and helped me setup up the original stack.Instead of trying to recreate the original configuration (multi-az, redundancy, etc) we opted for the fastest approach to get things setup. We spun up one of the beefiest fargate machine configurations, a new cloudfront cdn, load balancer, etc - the basics to go from server > internet. This process took a few hours because we had to wire everything up, set permissions, etc.I was very very glad that we had our dev stage completely separate. It helped to be able to reference that quickly while pulling everything back together. In the end we were able to get the site back up in \~6ish hours. Luckily no data, or any stateful stuff was deleted.Happy to answer any questions and go in more detail below.

1lt3xf6,"Are engineers at Meta/Amazon/Apple/Google/Netflix ACTUALLY better engineers, or is it all just hype?",Easy_Aioli9376,cscareerquestions,"Something I’ve been thinking about lately and wanted to get some honest perspectives.In general, society seems to treat FAANG engineers as the pinnacle of the software world. Not just within the tech industry, but even outside it. Say you work at Google or Meta, and people automatically assume you’re smart, accomplished, probably making great money, and overall just... impressive.Even socially, there’s a noticeable difference. Whether it’s friends, family, or even on hook-up apps, having ""Software Engineer at Amazon"" in your profile seems to carry a different weight.It’s like there’s a kind of crazy prestige that comes with being in FAANG. Like you’re in a different league, not just professionally but socially too.And obviously recruiters and managers seem to be obsessed with hiring ex-FAANG engineers. It's like a guaranteed callback.The title also seems to stick with you forever. Work at Google for a year, and you are suddenly an ex-google engineer for your entire career.No doubt working at FAANG is perceived as something that is prestigious, both technically and socially. It's life changing.But is that perception actually earned?Are FAANG engineers genuinely more skilled than the average developer? Do they consistently write better code, design more complex systems, think more rigorously? Or is it just a really effective combination of brand power, selective hiring, and market perception?I’m not denying that great engineers exist outside FAANG, but it seems like people expect the best to be there. Is that just a societal illusion, or is there some truth to it?Would love to hear from folks who’ve worked both in and out of FAANG. Are the engineers really on another level, or are we just buying into the name?",684,0.89,400,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lt3xf6/are_engineers_at_metaamazonapplegooglenetflix/,2025-07-06 15:27:19,2025-07-08 01:45:45
1lor23t,"Another team took my work to corporate leadership and now they're ""leading"" a global rollout while I'm cast to the shadows. I had zero knowledge of this until they failed to reverse-engineer and contacted me.",NigoDuppy,cscareerquestions,"Let me start by saying I’m (early career) a year into this corporate job at a ""billion-dollar"" multinational company. I fully understand that any work I do while employed is legally the company's intellectual property. That said, this post is more about how I can take advantage of my contributions for my career rather than being brushed aside.A couple of weeks ago, I made an earlier post about a similar situation, but at a smaller scale. Since then, things have escalated quickly, and I feel the new developments warrant a separate post.Long story short, I modernized an outdated system with great success for our region. It gained a lot of traction so much so that a team from another region requested I build the same system for them, tailored to their needs.Now here’s where the new developments start. Apparently, while all this was happening, someone higher up at the global level got access to my project and showed it to their boss who is just one level below the CEO. I still have no idea who this person is or how they even gained access to my work. Anyways, this corporate leader was so impressed that they decided the system should be rolled out globally as soon as possible. The person who shared my project then took it upon themselves to assign a team dedicated to replicating it for all regions.Now this assigned team somehow managed to access my project (I genuinely suspect a security breach or admin-level involvement) and tried to reverse-engineer everything I built.. but failed. They then began trying to identify who was behind the project and eventually contacted my manager (the ""official"" project manager) by pulling him into a meeting without prior notice. Odd.So my manager then decided to setup a proper call with this team with me involved this time. In this call, they basically came forward and requested us to provide all the code, tools, and infrastructure so they can simply copy and paste it for all regions, as well as requesting several technical sessions. To make matters worse, they want me to handle all the IT bureaucratic processes for every region to get things set up. I can already see myself being roped into supporting all regions and not just my own at this point. Not only that, but I believe this ""replication"" approach will be destined to fail as each region has different user requirements and processes not quite comparable to ours. And I also strongly believe they will struggle to get anything running, due to their limited technical and business knowledge of the processes, and the type of technical questions I was being asked. Nevertheless, if this team rolls out my solution globally for each region, they’ll receive all the visibility and credit (they'll be hosting demo sessions with region leaders which for sure I wont be invited to), while I'll be essentially cast into the shadows. What’s frustrating is that I have full knowledge of the system and am responsible for it so why isn't my manager at least being the one leading this global rollout and not some random team?I’ve been trying to indirectly nudge my manager to take ownership of the global initiative, instead of letting this new team take over. But I’m not sure how this will play out. The person who assigned this team is closer to the corporate leader, while my manager is a few steps lower in the hierarchy. So far, all he’s done is try to keep our regional manager informed of the situation playing out. Realistically, only the regional manager can mention this to the corporate leader, but I’m not confident that will happen.My manager often says ""how will this benefit the team?"" But in this case, it’s clear he’s struggling to see any benefit in simply handing over our work to another team that will walk away with all the credit.We’re still in the early stages, and I haven’t handed anything over yet. But I’m deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. From a career perspective, it looks like I'm gaining nothing from this besides telling myself I did the work. Being so early in my career, a project like this would really benefit me tenfold. I really don't want to waste this chance to turn this into something beneficial.&nbsp;EDIT: Thank you to everyone who shared their perspective. I recognize that my tone reflected more negativity than I aim to carry as a person. I allowed ego to slip in due to the project's success. Moving forward, I’ll focus on assuming positive intent and professionally advocating for myself when possible as that is the only thing I truly have control over.",532,0.95,118,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lor23t/another_team_took_my_work_to_corporate_leadership/,2025-07-01 03:04:22,2025-07-08 01:45:45

1lpza2y,Quit after two weeks at new job. How much did I overreact and how stupid was it?,cherryplusplus,cscareerquestions,"~4 YOE. Took up a new job for a new change of pace. I did screw myself because this new role wasn't paying that much more than my previous role and the commute was significantly worse, but I was already sort of burned out by my old place so I thought anything would be a nice change of pace.Fast forward one and half weeks in. A few things struck to me as red flags -* Lack of process (No testing, extremely badly defined scopes and tickets, a non-existent onboarding experience, rubber-stamping PR's and sending it almost straight to production.)* Every employee aside from the founders/management had been working here for around a year or less despite the company having been around for the past 7 years or so.* Talks about overtime as if it was something to be expected.* Their estimations were in my opinion, kind of whack. A lot of the work that would've obviously taken far more effort were given 2 points (in their own parlance, should take up a quarter of a day). For example, I was given a task that was a 2 point (So expected to be completed within a quarter of a day.) that involved rewriting a few components from scratch and new endpoints and it wasn't until halfway that I started working on this ticket that I was informed by my manager that it was actually linked to another set of UI changes (Involving overhauling a page and several other elements) that were completely outside the scope of the ticket. This was considered an additional 4 points (One day in their parlance) and I was expected to complete all of those within a quarter of a day.There might've been some disorganization but I was ready to understand, but what broke the straw on the camel's back was this following interaction that I had.After spending three hours glued to my screen working, I took a minute or two break just to check on my phone. It was lunch time and there were already co-workers actively having lunch and discussing about their lunch. I typically don't take a lunch break, so I tend to prefer to use this time just to check up on things on my phone.I was given a warning for using my phone for ""non-productive reasons"" and that I needed to give all of my attention and focus onto productivity during work hours. This was followed by another warning from another member of management. Essentially two people. (With heavy irony that the person giving me the warning was also on his phone in between waiting for things to load.)Followed by a e-mail where the entire team was CC'ed, singling me out that I did not fall into their expectations for focus and productivity with possible escalation to the CEO.Consider this a vent or a plead for affirmation, but was it just me or did this behaviour come across as total overreach? Either way, I've decided that my way of working is clearly not aligned with the company's expectations and I immediately resigned on the spot.

1lqinft,"After 7 months of searching, I got a job! (lots of details below)",Any-Platypus-3570,cscareerquestions,"**Intro.**I wanted to share my experience job searching and then finally getting a job. I worked at my first full-time software engineering job for 3 years and then got laid off in late 2024. I thought it would be fairly easy to find my next job since I had 3 years of experience and even a master's degree. But it was much more difficult than I expected.**Story time.**At first I only applied to big tech. I even got to a final round big tech interview but the system design round went poorly and I did not receive an offer. After that I gradually ramped up the number of applications and widened my search. I'm mid-level but I was applying to junior as well as senior roles that fit my background.Over the first three months (Q1 2025) I got very few positive responses. In March I started applying more consistently, about 8 applications per day, and in mid April I ramped it up to about 25 per day. In May and June I started to get many more recruiter calls and interviews. At this point, every week I would have about four of them.After five months in I got close to the end with two different companies. But both ended up turning me down. Then finally, on a Tuesday I got an offer but it was with an early stage startup that couldn't offer much compensation. Like it wasn't just low for a software engineer, it was low for anybody. I happened to be interviewing with another company that same week, so I told them about my pending offer. They quickly scheduled my remaining interviews, which happened to all go well, and by Friday I received a much better offer from them. I took it.I feel incredibly fortunate because after seven months of searching I would have reluctantly taken a far worse offer, but the offer I got was very good.**Where I applied.**About 50% of my applications were on LinkedIn. The rest were company websites, Indeed, Built In, ZipRecruiter, and Handshake. Handshake is where I found my next job.**The numbers.**Now for the numbers... oh boy. In total I applied to 1892 jobs. I had 15 recruiter calls and 24 technical interviews, and approximately 12 online or take-home assessments. I made some charts: [applications](https://ibb.co/Q43YDS5), [interviews](https://ibb.co/pj79D3rY), [sankey\_diagram](https://ibb.co/Z61yDj5m).**Advice.**Over the months, I improved my resume but I wish I had done that sooner. I didn't used to have a ""Skills"" section but I added one and I think this helped. Recruiters are often just looking for key words.Don't give up. It was agonizing to search for seven months. And I know many of you have been searching for much longer. Something will come around. It's not you, it's the job market. You can get a thousand rejections but one offer, and that one offer is all that matters.I spent my free time working on a couple side projects and improving some skills, which I'm glad I did. I also spent more time with my friends and got more involved with my community through volunteering, which I'm also glad I did. Best of luck out there, and be happy that I'm no longer competing with you!",161,0.97,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lqinft/after_7_months_of_searching_i_got_a_job_lots_of/,2025-07-03 06:35:43,2025-07-08 01:45:45
1lqcjbe,"Got a software engineering job, but don't want to program anymore",baboy4444,cscareerquestions,"**Overview**About 7 months ago, I got a job as a software engineer at a great company straight out of college. For the most part, I like my job. I really can't complain, but I just wanted to get other people's perspective. **Context**I went to school for programming because I loved it. My passion was mainly in embedded systems. During college, I was lucky enough to get a position as a research engineer on a research program, and got to write the firmware for a very small satellite. I truly loved it. During this period, I submitted hundreds of job applications that went nowhere. I ended up getting my current job from a connection I made during college.Don't get me wrong, I like my current job. I am not complaining in the slightest, I fully understand how lucky and privileged I am to be in my current position, and I don't take that for granted. I went through the job struggle like many others have. I even followed this sub, and almost lost hope because of it :( **Question**In my current position, I write Python microservices for a very large company. It can be interesting. Most importantly though, I couldn't be happier with my coworkers. They have taught me so much, and I genuinely like working with them. However, I've found that my passion for programming has started to fade away. My day job is very far away from embedded systems, which as I mentioned before, is what I am passionate about. But when I get home, and even on the weekends, I just don't have it in me anymore to bust out the Arduino or STM32 board and do a side project. I used to love doing that stuff. It was my hobby, and I was good at it. That being said, I realize that it is in part what got me my current job. But, I can't help but be a little sad that I no longer have the energy, or passion, to start side projects like I used to. It is especially frustrating because I finally have the skills to do truly *cool* projects, but I just don't feel like it anymore. **Conclusion**Again, this is just to get other software engineers' perspective. Have any of you experienced anything similar? How do you get around this? I really *want* to keep doing side projects, but just don't have the motivation anymore now that I write code 40+ hours a week. **TLDR**Got a full time programming job. Don't have motivation to do side projects anymore. Makes me sad.

I got a job some months after graduating and worked as a full-stack software engineer for 3 years at a small company (50-100 employees).

After my last programming job, my original plan was to somehow transition from development into design, because that's what I'm naturally better at.I feel like the longer I spend outside of CS, the harder it will be to get back in.

1loqrxx,"Got the job but I feel like I'm very behind, how can I improve fast?",wont-share-food,cscareerquestions,"Long story short, I started a new job at a FAANG company as a full stack engineer. Idk how I got it, but I got it. Before this, I was working as a Full Stack Developer for the last 4 years at a very small company. The typical task at my last job was very simple CRUD work with business logic sprinkled in and our whole system ran fine on a medium EC2 instance. Everything I learned for that job came from a Full Stack Udemy course.While I did go to a good university, my major was in Statistics, meaning that I don't have a computer science background and have been self taught. Other than the Udemy course, I took MIT's OCW class in data structures & algorithms ages ago which has helped when it comes to leetcode and the like. I also have a pretty decent understanding of high level system design from watching a ton of videos in preparation for interviews. This gave me enough knowledge to pass the interview.We have a few backend developers on the team and they talk about things like concurrency, race conditions, etc, and are all very smart coming from working at Google and a Quant firm. I get the gist of what they're saying, especially after googling the terms and realizing that I knew the concept but not the word, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like I know absolutely nothing and it's starting to worry me (tbf it's only been 2 weeks but still).What sort of courses should I take so I can also slowly start understanding what's happening and not feel out of place? I do prefer video lectures rather than a book. It can also be paid. Additionally, is there any advice you guys can give me to succeed in this role and successfully keep it?

I was going to start work on a raytracer/3D graphics engine (for CGI) today which would be my first latgescale project but it really hit me that maybe this is all for nothing. I mean don’t get me wrong all code is good code but I’ve been exacerbating a large amount of time to barely learn graphics because of how hard it is. I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface, and yet I’m also falling behind on other big topics like AI, embedded systems, applications, back end dev, stuff like that. And with how bad the job market is, I can imagine getting a graphics job entry level is a pain in the ass and most of it prob requires masters or PhD. So am I wasting time and should I figure out another more practical project or thing to learn?

I'm a front-end developer, ux-designer and startup founder who wants to become a product manager. I'm struggling to decide how I want to sell myself during interviews and on my CV. These are the points I'm struggling with:* I'm introverted, love to listen and ask a lot of questions. I have the feeling PMs are expected to be extroverted and spew out energy - especially during an interview. Should I fake it? * If I don't know something I say it. I feel like these days everybody is looking for the perfect candidate. “You don't know x or y? Next!” At least this is how it goes for dev roles. Should I pretend to know everything and wing it? (this question applies to resumes, too) * I am humble and quite frankly I should be because neither have I founded a million dollar company nor worked in big tech yet. To me it seems like during the interview phase you have to present yourself like you are the big shit and exaggerate everything you have done. Because this is exactly what everybody else does. At least for dev roles there are programming tests that show real skills. Should I exaggerate my past successes?* I don't like to throw around buzzwords. To me they hide too much meaning and If you truly understand something you can say it in a way everybody understands. But I have had experiences working with PMs who used buzzwords constantly and half the time what they said made no sense to us developers. But I get the feeling that they passed the interview and got the job at my company because they used them. How do recruiters tell if a PM “knows his stuff”? Should I use buzzwords to sound competent in an interview? * I have taken a bit of a detour in my life and focused on art/writing for 2 years. This is a gap between my first developer jobs and my last developer jobsTo me this seems like a no go to recruiters. (please tell me if I'm wrong). Companies would rather hire somebody with the perfect CV than a person who seems “real”. Should I cut that part out of my CV or own it? I hope this kind of question is acceptable in this sub.

I'm in meetings 6 hours a day, have to achieve increasingly difficult timelines, need to plan ahead for upcoming sprints and further on the roadmap, make sure capacity is being fully utilized, parallelize as much of the work as possible, help the developers grow, unblock them, provide technical leadership, accelerate them to meet deadlines, provide feedback to their managers, etc.Run on sentence is intended, but the main idea is that I'm overwhelmed with all that I'm responsible for.

They've started using ChatGPT to initially populate the details and we later review each of the stories when it's closer to the time someone needs to pickup the work. I have trouble gauging when my engineers are underperforming, or if I haven't provided enough support.

I know our tech stack, but when I find myself in conversations about new system design, or just more technical concepts in general, I'm quickly in over my head compared to colleagues that have CS degrees, where software conversations seem to evolve into higher-order maths concepts that I've simply got no familiarity with, or understanding of. I've made it this far in life without obtaining even an associates degree, and I really have no interest in starting from the beginning on the path to a comp sci degree, but I feel like I would really benefit from a ""computer science crash course"" geared towards devs that could build a foundational knowledge base for system design.

We didn't interview for a specific team and were basically placed semi-randomly onto teams that asked for SWEs.I ended up on a team that is primarily a support team. The team is mostly non-SWEs and at no point has there been any SWE on the team that didn't have the position as their first job out of college. About 60-70% of the team's day to day work consists of data remediation and other manual fixes (e.g. directly modifying data in databases) for errors caused by bugs in the systems we support. These bugs have existed the entire 2 years I've been here, and apparently longer, from what I've heard. The remainder of the work might be other random tasks geared towards facilitating the first function (e.g. writing up documentation on how to do a certain kind of fix, setting up alerting based off of logs).The only ""dev"" work that I end up doing is writing basic CRUD applications used only by our team that are hosted on on-premise servers (our team has no cloud budget so I have no experience building applications in the cloud). There's no opportunity to work on any large-scale, high traffic systems. I essentially haven't worked on anything more complex than my college work.Other people that were part of my cohort were placed on teams where they are on actual engineering teams and the work is a lot more interesting, so this is primarily a team placement issue, not necessarily a company issue.

I applied to openings in other cities, but the the number of openings were so little compared to the number of applicants so the competition was crazy, I couldn't get a job for about a year.Afterwards, I found a role as a teacher, so, I started teaching programming fundamentals and web development, I kept this job for 2 years, during which I tried applying to as much software development jobs as possible on LinkedIn and everywhere else, mainly looking for fully remote roles in the US or elsewhere.Then, I found a role at a startup as a paid intern, gotten through the interview and started work as a contractor.My initial contract was for 6 months, after that was over I signed a different contract for another 6 months, this time as a Jr. Software Developer. After this contract ended, they renewed it again as a Jr. Software Developer, but this time for 4 months, because the startup was failing. So, in total I worked as fully remote contractor for 1 year and 4 months.Then, I was jobless, I started looking for jobs again for about 6 months, then out of nowhere, the same employer from before got in touch with me and recommended me to a different startup looking for contractors. I happily accepted the offer and started work, the problem is, I wasn't even assigned a title in this new startup, I was a software developer, but I didn't know whether Jr, Mid? However, based on my own evaluation I still considered myself Jr.I was the only developer on the frontend team for this new startup, I was responsible of taking a full Figma design from scratch and implement it with React, I have to be honest I had to use a component library to get the job done, because the deadline was very close and everything was fast paced, there was no room for code refactoring, code quality, TBF I didn't even write tests! But, I ended up delivering in time, and after a couple of rounds of bug fixing, the client was happy.However, after about 8 months, I lost this job because the startup failed to secure funding again.Now, I feel a bit lost on where to move on from here. Getting a job for a US-based employer is very difficult, especially once they learn that I am based in Iraq.I have a couple of questions:1. Am I a dead cause? Is there still hope?

For the next 3 years, I grew it to a team of 40 people and was in active negotiations with Nvidia to introduce RTX into our game (it was 2019 when Nvidia just published it). I was studying just enough to keep the scholarship, but nothing more.After we ran out of funding, and closing it, I joined an American based startup as VP of Product & engineering, but after 6 months got promoted to CIO, where I was responsible for our product portfolio and managing our engineering and R&D departments.During this time, I got headhunted by one of the largest corporations in Europe and wanted me to work as Senior Project Manager (had to wear Product Manager hat too often). They made it clear, they wanted me no mater what, doubled my salary and put me in big projects to work for. And after 2.5 years, it was one of the most amazing working experiences as had to deal with hundreds of engineers and millions of dollars in projects.After some internal things, I decided to go in business on my own, and start a digital agency. it was one of the roughest experiences even though within 1 year I had 3 other employees and 15 clients. And decided to close this in beginning of June.\-- now July --I had an interview today, and one of the HR said that my CV seems like I'm lying. I just turned 29, so it is impossible for me to have done all of this. (I have recommendation letters, experience, posts and everything to prove my work...). I asked some of my friends about this and they said the same thing too, and even suggested I lower the tittle for example from CIO to just Head of Product Management Office.I'm looking to join startups where I can bring best of my experience and knowledge, but I am seriously getting worried what my friends are suggesting.from 50 tailored applications I have done, I've had only 1 interview, so I'm really wondering if ATS is screwing me up, or HR see's it and thinks ""just bloated stuff"" and ignores it.What do you think?im seriously stuck thinking for this.PS: made this post on EU version but got automatically removed.",5,0.56,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lpcq3x/should_i_lower_my_accomplishments_to_seem_more/,2025-07-01 20:37:01,2025-07-08 01:45:45

1lru5il,Circuitous career path through academia to CS,simplysalamander,cscareerquestions,"Career started in academia doing data science/data analysis projects, that evolved into developing full-stack albeit locally-deployed mono-language applications (Python) during a PhD. These applications had users beyond just me, but all in the same academic environment and not like they were users paying for a SaaS app. After finishing the PhD, I've started working on ""real"" full-stack apps (i.e., JS front end, Python back end, database calls, etc.) for paying customers in a scientific niche, but doing so without much mentorship on developing ""professional"" software beyond what can be self-taught from the internet. Software is extensible and scalable, but I have no reference of whether this is how it's developed at a major tech company.Is it attractive to teams hiring for CS careers at bigger tech companies to see this kind of experience? On one hand, it's a lot more than junior work like building specific features and testing them - it involves interviewing stakeholders, learning their needs, and figuring out how to translate that into features and how to design the software to be able to grow sustainably without having a team of other developers to lean on. On the other hand, for all I know it could be riddled with bad habits and blind spots.Most job postings with PhD qualifications are mid- to advanced-stage roles, but having not ""grown up"" in a ""professional"" team environment, I'm not sure I have the relevant experience to be able to head a team in a conventional, expected way. At the same time, while I personally don't have hang-ups about starting lower on the totem pole, I'm not sure if my experience and degree path would make me appear over-qualified for a more entry position?

But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.There's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice. I want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.In 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.Or maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until things start to click - just like it was for the first time:) What's your view/advice?

1lpd2rr,How do/did you learn how to *do* stuff?,piggypaltry,cscareerquestions,"Sorry if this is the wrong place for this questionWas recently laid off from my first-ever SWE job at a Fortune 500 company after working there for 2.5 years. Having a difficult time finding a new job -- I think part of it is that only 2.5 years puts me at an uncomfortable position where I'm not a new grad but also not exactly an experienced dev, but the other problem is that I just feel like I... can't *do* anything. At my company I spent the majority of the time on our bug-fixing team. Idk if this is how things usually are at big companies but our codebase was largely undocumented and no one ever explained to me how anything really worked -- everything I learned I learned because I asked about it directly. Most of the bugs I fixed were either very clear-cut, where I could just look at the code and identify the problem, or for more abstract ones I did it with a lot of guidance from a senior dev. I spent a bit of time on other teams ""helping"" implement new features but I was largely in over my head and being held by the hand by my seniors while just trying to absorb whatever I could. So I know how to code I guess. I can pick up new languages and I can look at simple things and sort of understand what they're doing and I understand principles like data structures, algorithms, encapsulation, inheritance, etc, all stuff you would find in a college course. I've also done 100+ puzzles on AdventOfCode, which I usually find to be not super difficult but have also learned about stuff I wasn't super knowledgeable about like dynamic programming and sorting algos while doing them. I feel like I'm a good employee. I'm not afraid to ask questions and I'm well-spoken and I'm proactive about my work rather than sitting in silence when I get stuck. I love to learn new stuff and always take opportunities that are presented to me. But I don't feel like any of my knowledge transfers to an actual workplace environment. I can't build apps or deploy microservices or optimize software or develop new features. I subscribe to /r/programming and read stuff there but I usually understand like 5% of it. I thought I would learn once I got my first job but I spent most of that time fixing bugs and trying to understand how our product even worked. I was discussing moving to a different team to start gaining more skills with my supervisor but then I was laid off. I know lots of programmers build stuff in their free time but I have no idea what to even make. I don't even know if I *can* make anything. So what do I do? How do I learn? Hope I get a better job?

1lttg8h,What are effective ways to transfer PhD and post industry research to industry?,emaxwell14141414,cscareerquestions,"When it comes to transferring from PhD and post PhD research in academic based institutions to industry based science, there's major discussion in terms of how everything from the pace of work to the lack of ability to ensure the best methods are being used and so on. So when it comes to adapting the skills obtained during a PhD and in me cases research assistantships past the PhD, and convincing others that you can transfer your skills, what works best?With some companies, particularly in this economic climate, they'll be looking for industry experience and that's it. It won't matter about published papers and successful projects. It won't matter if much of your research is in an applicable field such as data science. Side projects you've done independently may not even matter. It has to be experience in industry or it doesn't count. And often, it needs to be with the exact software tools, models and packages they use in addition.That said, I was wondering about what works when adapting your skills and also making the case to others about how you can do so. A primary option, I imagine, is being able to relate to them, for example how a paper and project you finished has implications that could assist them with their data handling, product development and so on. Or perhaps reaching out and explaining concisely how the skills you developed, even though they weren't directly in industry, could be applied to solve a problem they have.Are there methods and techniques similar to this that work?",4,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lttg8h/what_are_effective_ways_to_transfer_phd_and_post/,2025-07-07 12:55:47,2025-07-08 01:45:45

We own no property or assets in America whatsoever, the only connection we have to the US is my citizenship. I've already been admitted to an American university and plan to attend there in pursuit of the CS major and perhaps a Business/Finance minor. My university does allow double majoring at no additional costs though. I realize that I'm a bit of an exceptional case here and more privileged in the sense that I don't have to deal with F1, H1B visa rat race at all. That said, on hearing the situation of the world, in particular the US, the job market seems extremely bad. My family lives on an Indian income and while the aid we got from my university was quite generous, we've still taken a federal loans from both the US and education loans from SBI, leasing one of the property homes that we have. This honestly puts a lot of pressure on me, like any other international student because India is all I've known and frankly I've never exceeded very well academically at all.I realize that my questions are a bit immature maybe, but I think I'd still like the opinions and discussions of people who are more knowledgeable about this than I am:* How hard do you think it'll be for people like me to find jobs/placements 4 years later when I graduate? * I've been hearing that the best way to succeed is to have connections, network and stuff. I've had very bad social skills my whole life, are there any tips or perhaps personal experiences that you think I might find helpful for someone starting from scratch?* If the job situation in the US is worse than it is in India, or well let's say I can't find a job in the US how likely it is that if I come back to family and start job hunting in India as an OCI Card Holder would give me difficulties? What should I expect? Is it recommended that I come back to India at all?* What are some contingency plans I should have? I'm not particularly passionate about anything, I chose CS because my entire family works there and so having their help would be nice, plus hearing them talk about their job and interest for it made me interested as well.

1ls65ow,Junior Developer Paradox: Finding Niche and Doing so in Wrong Time,TemporaryBaseball915,cscareerquestions,"Hello guys, I'm writing this because I recently (with full awareness) threw myself into what seems to be still waters, the junior developer job hunt. Now, this is not just another generic web dev (not my words, the vim/arch lovers' words) crying for help. No, no, and no! This is someone who found their ""niche"" but at the wrong time. Let me tell you what I mean.So, I recently graduated from a university in the U.S. During the time I was there, I fell in love with Machine Learning (and no, it's not because it's the trend). I found myself devoting my time to research, machine learning projects, doing competitions within the lab with other PhD or Masters students, etc. I was involved in the research for 2+ years for three different labs, I had the official title of ""Research Assistant"" as an undergrad for one of the labs where I was the sole engineer to develop end-to-end solution for running experiments on our university's super computer. I have published a paper in CVPR, and got the best paper award within the workshop that we've published.Now, my life had a solid plan, but due to everything changed in the states (I'm not gonna say why because I don't wanna take a one-way trip to Central America) I was forced to derail from that path. And now I am looking for a job. And man, doesn't it fucking suck. And this is where the paradox begins:**Paradox 1: ""X+ years of experience"" for recent graduate position**Let's start with the most common paradox. Now, the definition of ""experience"" differs from company to company, but what seems to be the common thing though, is that research doesn't count toward ""experience"". I know some of the undergrads who have somewhere around 1 year of experience due to things like internships or co-op (it's like internship in Canada but better), but for a lot of other students, this is going to be their first experience. Especially for someone like me who has experience but within the University, this sucks. What sucks even more, is that for a lot of international students, getting internship is very hard due to company having to justify as to why they're hiring an international student over a citizen with the same skill set. I was one of the victims of ""logistical rejection"" and that's kind of why I devoted more time within the University system because in it, it's an equal fight. Whoever has skills wins.**Paradox 2: Master's degree or PhD is required**This is especially true for machine learning engineer jobs, but the same thing can be applied to other jobs as well. Now, in my opinion, the difference between a bachelor's and master's is that if you're getting a bachelor's, what it says is you are someone who is capable of starting something small, and finish it. Maybe you have little bit of side project here and there, but nothing crazy. If you have a master's, what it says is that you can start and finish medium-sized projects, and you can also sometimes be a leader within the project as well. PhD is just matter of scaling up from master's. Now, this is what a degree ""generally"" says about you, because if you're an undergrad, companies don't expect you to develop a niche. But here's the thing, I did. I have a lot of experience in machine learning just like I said at the beginning, but company doesn't care about that because I am not a master's student. You have publications? Doesn't matter, you're an undergrad. You developed a deep learning model by yourself? Doesn't matter, you don't have a master's.Now, for those who just thought to yourself ""just get a master's bro"", here's paradox 3. **Paradox 3: I ain't got no money like that** This might be surprising for some of you but there are people who genuinely don't have money. And surprise, surprise, I don't have money. I want to work in industry to save money to go back to a master's program, but if I want to look for a job paradox 1 and paradox 2 appear, but if I want to get a master's, I need money first to even go there in the first place. And yes scholarship is a thing and definitely helps, but I need full-ride scholarship if I want to go, but those opportunities don't easily come around.**Paradox 4: Connection matters**Now, I'm not saying this statement is the paradox, but what I hear from people who are already in the system is a paradox. When I talk about these things to people who have already established themselves, they oftentimes say ""It's not about degree"" or ""If you can show that you have the skill, that's all we care about"". Now, as an engineer, they are right. It is not about degree, as long as you have the skills. But, at the same time they are not the one who is looking at my resume, it's the HR or sometime LLMs. Now I don't have the ""experience"" so I don't know how companies work, but should engineers hire another engineer? Or I guess they don't have the time so HR exists? I don't know.**Paradox 5: It's a tough time right now**For like 4 years it has been a tough time, bro. Damn.**Paradox 6: Just find a generic soft dev job**This is usually what I get from people when I talk about these paradoxes. ""You know, the hardest part is to get your foot in the system. I think you should apply for a software engineering job first and go from there."" So I said ""bet"" and applied to a bunch (I mean a bunch) of software engineering jobs. But they all say no because I am too specialized in machine learning. Welp, wtf.These are the paradoxes that I can think of right now. And I know that I used the term ""paradox"" very loosely here, but I hope you can see my point of view. And with all the seriousness, this is why I say I found the niche at the wrong time. Because I slowly began to realize that I was going nowhere with my ML skills, because the world is not obligated to take time to see what each person is capable of. I get it, people just generally don't have time.And here comes the million dollar question: What do I do now then? I am stuck between these paradoxes and the walls around me are getting tighter and tighter. I really need help.Thanks guys for reading this far, and I really appreciate it.",4,0.6,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ls65ow/junior_developer_paradox_finding_niche_and_doing/,2025-07-05 09:42:59,2025-07-08 01:45:45

1lpwqmh,Feeling hopeless and need advice?,SpinachOk3162,cscareerquestions,"Sorry, I’m sure this kind of post is beaten to death here but I just don’t know where to turn and feel like I need to get this out. I’m 30 and have my associate’s in Computer Science, finished in 2023. Currently I feel I’m at a crossroads with what I should do in the future, I (foolishly) thought that I could get an entry level dev job, or lower level job at a company and work my way up internally to a dev position eventually or something. No internships, but I do have a couple projects and active linkedin/github. After applying for a few months I’ve basically got nothing to show for the last two years. I’ve had some personal stuff happen and an injury which partially explains the gap since finishing my associates.I’ve been wondering if I should go back and finish my bachelors, if its even worth it, reading this sub is making me kind of depressed and that maybe I’ve wasted my time in this field. Im back living with my parents for the last 3 months after a break up (9 year relationship), and the idea of pursuing my bachelors would probably mean I’d be still living at home for another 2 years minimum, which kind of depresses me in and of itself - being here the whole time and not having a real bachelors until I’m (at least) 32, I mean, Im a grown man. I feel embarrassed and that I shouldn’t have to rely on my mom and step-dad still.I’m getting quite overwhelmed with these feelings of hopelessness in this field or if I should just pivot to something else, maybe get some IT certs and start at a help-desk position or do school part time or something, I really just don’t know.
