1opz0ve,"Unpopular Opinion: Data Quality is a product management problem, not an engineering one.",NewLog4967,dataengineering,"Hear me out. We spend countless hours building data quality frameworks, setting up Great Expectations, and writing custom DBT tests. But 90% of the data quality issues we get paged for are because the business logic changed and no one told us.A product manager wouldn't launch a new feature in an app without defining what quality means for the user. Why do we accept this for data products?We're treated like janitors cleaning up other people's messes instead of engineers building a product. The root cause is a lack of ownership and clear requirements *before* data is produced.Discussion Points:* Am I just jaded, or is this a universal experience?* How have you successfully pushed data quality ownership *upstream* to the product teams that generate the data?* Should Data Engineers start refusing to build pipelines until acceptance criteria for data quality are signed off?Let's vent and share solutions.",197,0.92,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1opz0ve/unpopular_opinion_data_quality_is_a_product/,2025-11-06 13:33:10,2025-11-10 01:44:56
1oos473,When the pipeline stops being “a pipeline” and becomes “the system”,stephen8212438,dataengineering,"There’s a funny moment in most companies where the thing that was supposed to be a temporary ETL job slowly turns into the backbone of everything. It starts as a single script, then a scheduled job, then a workflow, then a whole chain of dependencies, dashboards, alerts, retries, lineage, access control, and “don’t ever let this break or the business stops functioning.”Nobody calls it out when it happens.

1op7yd0,Is work life balance in data engineering is non-existent?,shanksfk,dataengineering,"I’ve been a data engineer for a few years now and honestly, I’m starting to think work life balance in this field just doesn’t exist.Every company I’ve joined so far has been the same story. Sprints are packed with too many tickets, story points that make no sense, and tasks that are way more complex than they look on paper. You start a sprint already behind.Even if you finish your work, there’s always something else. A pipeline fails, a deployment breaks, or someone suddenly needs “a quick fix” for production. It feels like you can never really log off because something is always running somewhere.In my current team, the seniors are still online until midnight almost every night. Nobody officially says we have to work that late, but when that’s what everyone else is doing, it’s hard not to feel pressured. You feel bad for signing off at 7 PM even when you’ve done everything assigned to you.I actually like data engineering itself. Building data pipelines, tuning Spark jobs, learning new tools, all of that is fun. But the constant grind and unrealistic pace make it hard to enjoy any of it. It feels like you have to keep pushing non-stop just to survive.Is this just how data engineering is everywhere, or are there actually teams out there with a healthy workload and real work life balance?",157,0.92,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1op7yd0/is_work_life_balance_in_data_engineering_is/,2025-11-05 16:44:47,2025-11-10 01:44:56

Feels like a new issue comes out of nowhere,thro0away12,dataengineering,"I work as an analytics engineer at a Fortune 500 team and I feel honestly stressed out everyday especially over the last few months.I develop datasets for the end user in mind. The end datasets combine data from different sources we normalize in our database. The issue I’m facing is that stuff that seems to have been ok-ed a few months ago is suddenly not ok - I get grilled for requirements I was told to put, if something is inconsistent I have a colleague who gets on my case and acts like I don’t take accountability for mistakes, even though the end result follows the requirements I was literally told are the correct processes to evaluate whatever the end user wants. I’ve improved all channels of communication and document things extensively now, so thankfully that helps point to why I did things the way I did months ago but it’s frustrating the way colleagues react and behave to unexpected failures while im finishing time sensitive current tasks. Our pipelines upstream of me have some new failure or the other everyday that’s not in my purview. When data goes missing in my datasets because of that, I have to dig and investigate what happened that can take forever, sometimes it’s a failure because of the vendor sending an unexpectedly changed format or some failure in the pipeline that software engineering team takes care of. When things fail, I have to manually do the steps in the pipeline to temporarily fix the issue which is a series of download, upload, download and “eyeball validate” and upload to the folder that eventually feeds our database for multiple datasets. This eats up my entire day that I have to dedicate for other time sensitive tasks and I feel there are serious unrealistic expectations. I log into work first day out of a day off with a bulk of messages about a failed data issue and have back to back meetings in the AM. I was asked just 1.5 hours of logging in with meetings if I looked into and resolved a data issue that realistically takes a few hours….um no I was in meetings lol. There was a time in the past at 10PM or so I was asked to manually load data because it failed in our pipeline and I was tired and uploaded the wrong dataset. My manager freaked out the next day,they couldn’t reverse the effects of the new dataset till the next day, so they found me incapable of the task but while yes, it was my mistake of not checking it was 10PM, I don’t get paid for after hours work and I was checked out. I get bombarded with messages after hours & on the weekend. Everything here is CONSTANTLY changing without warning. I’ve been added to two new different teams and I can’t keep up with why I am there. I’ve tried to ask but everything is unclear and murky. Is this normal part of DE work or am I in the wrong place?

It is a hybrid role with 2 days per week in the office in London.The positives of the role are as follows:- Quite good WLB (Only about 10 hrs per week actual work)- Good non-toxic culture with friendly technical and non technical colleagues who are always happy to help- I have been able to upskill in the role, and now have skills in Python, SQL, Java, DevOps, machine learning, ETL pipelines, GCP, business analysis, basic architecture design and SRE for maintaining data products.The negatives are as follows:- Low TC (only £60k TC) in London- Unclear how I might get a promotion in my organisation.Due to the good WLB mentioned above, I have used time to learn new skills and learn value investing and because I live with my parents I have been able to build a fairly good portfolio for my age.I am soon going to buy a flat however so I will not be able to invest as much in the near future.What should I be focusing on? Because although I partially think I should look for another highest TC role, the grass isn’t always greener, so I might be better off milking this good WLB role for all its worth then pursuing some kind of entrepreneurial venture alongside it, because that could have potentially unlimited upside with low downside if my corporate role provides a margin of safety, and if that takes off I could become a full time entrepreneur.What thoughts/advice do people have?

1op9z6x,Is it worth staying in an internship where I’m not really learning anything?,Express_Ad_6732,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I’m currently doing a Data Engineering internship (been around 3 months), and I’m honestly starting to question whether it’s worth continuing anymore.When I joined, I was super excited to learn real-world stuff — build data pipelines, understand architecture, and get proper mentorship from seniors. But the reality has been quite different.Most of my seniors mainly work with Spark and SQL, while I’ve been assigned tasks involving Airflow and Airbyte. The issue is — no one really knows these tools well enough to guide me.For example, yesterday I faced an Airflow 209 error. Due to some changes, I ended up installing and uninstalling Airflow multiple times, which eventually caused my GitHub repo limit to exceed. After a lot of debugging, I finally figured out the issue myself — but my manager and team had no idea what was going on.Same with Airbyte 505 errors — and everyone’s just as confused as I am. Even my manager wasn’t sure why they happen. I end up spending hours debugging and searching online, with zero feedback or learning support.I totally get that self-learning is a big part of this field, but lately it feels like I’m not really learning, just surviving through errors. There’s no code review, no structured explanation, and no one to discuss better approaches with.Now I’m wondering:Should I stay another month and try to make the best of it,or resign and look for an opportunity where I can actually grow under proper guidance?Would leaving after 3 months look bad if I can still talk about the things I’ve learned — like building small workflows, debugging orchestrations, and understanding data flow?Has anyone else gone through a similar “no mentorship, just errors” internship?I’d really appreciate advice from senior data engineers, because I genuinely want to become a strong data engineer and learn the right way.EditAfter going through everyone’s advice here, I’ve decided not to quit the internship for now. Instead, I’ll focus more on self-learning and building consistency until I find a better opportunity.Honestly, this experience has been a rollercoaster — frustrating at times, but it’s also pushing me to think like a real data engineer. I’ve started enjoying those moments when, after hours of debugging and trial-and-error, I finally fix an issue without any senior’s help.

1ooyobk,Samara: A 100% Config-Driven ETL Framework [FOSS],ThqXbs8,dataengineering,"# SamaraI've been working on Samara, a framework that lets you build complete ETL pipelines using just YAML or JSON configuration files. No boilerplate, no repetitive code—just define what you want and let the framework handle the execution with telemetry, error handling and alerting.The idea hit me after writing the same data pipeline patterns over and over. Why are we writing hundreds of lines of code to read a CSV, join it with another dataset, filter some rows, and write the output? Engineering is about solving problems, the problem here is repetiviely doing the same over and over.## What My Project DoesYou write a config file that describes your pipeline:- Where your data lives (files, databases, APIs)- What transformations to apply (joins, filters, aggregations, type casting)- Where the results should go- What to do when things succeed or failSamara reads that config and executes the entire pipeline. Same configuration should work whether you're running on Spark or Polars (TODO) or ... Switch engines by changing a single parameter.## Target Audience**For engineers**: Stop writing the same extract-transform-load code. Focus on the complex stuff that actually needs custom logic.**For teams**: Everyone uses the same patterns. Pipeline definitions are readable by analysts who don't code. Changes are visible in version control as clean configuration diffs.**For maintainability**: When requirements change, you update YAML or JSON instead of refactoring code across multiple files.## Current State- 100% test coverage (unit + e2e)- Full type safety throughout- Comprehensive alerts (email, webhooks, files)- Event hooks for custom actions at pipeline stages- Solid documentation with architecture diagrams- Spark implementation mostly done, Polars implementation in progress## Looking for ContributorsThe foundation is solid, but there's exciting work ahead:- Extend Polars engine support- Build out transformation library- Add more data source connectors like Kafka and DatabasesCheck out the repo: [github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara)Star it if the approach resonates with you. Open an issue if you want to contribute or have ideas.---Example: Here's what a pipeline looks like—read two CSVs, join them, select columns, write output:```yamlworkflow: id: product-cleanup-pipeline description: ETL pipeline for cleaning and standardizing product catalog data enabled: true jobs: - id: clean-products description: Remove duplicates, cast types, and select relevant columns from product data enabled: true engine_type: spark # Extract product data from CSV file extracts: - id: extract-products extract_type: file data_format: csv location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products/ method: batch options: delimiter: "","" header: true inferSchema: false schema: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products_schema.json # Transform the data: remove duplicates, cast types, and select columns transforms: - id: transform-clean-products upstream_id: extract-products options: {} functions: # Step 1: Remove duplicate rows based on all columns - function_type: dropDuplicates arguments: columns: [] # Empty array means check all columns for duplicates # Step 2: Cast columns to appropriate data types - function_type: cast arguments: columns: - column_name: price cast_type: double - column_name: stock_quantity cast_type: integer - column_name: is_available cast_type: boolean - column_name: last_updated cast_type: date # Step 3: Select only the columns we need for the output - function_type: select arguments: columns: - product_id - product_name - category - price - stock_quantity - is_available # Load the cleaned data to output loads: - id: load-clean-products upstream_id: transform-clean-products load_type: file data_format: csv location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/output method: batch mode: overwrite options: header: true schema_export: """" # Event hooks for pipeline lifecycle hooks: onStart: [] onFailure: [] onSuccess: [] onFinally: []```",11,0.79,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ooyobk/samara_a_100_configdriven_etl_framework_foss/,2025-11-05 09:46:48,2025-11-10 01:44:56

1oroinc,How would you build a multi-tenant data lakehouse platform with a data ontology or catalog as a startup?,fabkosta,dataengineering,"Assume you're a startup with limited funds, and you need to build some sort of multi-tenant data lakehouse, where each tenant is one of your clients with potentially (business-) sensitive data. So, ideally you want to segregate each client from each other client cleanly. Let's assume data per tenant initially is moderate, but will grow over time. Let's also assume there are only relatively few people working with the data platform per client, but those who do work with it have needs for performing advanced analytics (like ML model training). One crucial piece is that we need some sort of data catalogue or ontology to describe the clients data. That's a key component of the entire startup idea, without this it will not work.How would you architect this given given the limited funds? (I know, I know, it all depends on the context and situation etc., but I'm still sorting my thoughts here, and don't have all the details and requirements ready at this stage. I'm trying to get an overview on the different options and their fundamental pros and cons to decide where to dive in deeper with the research and what questions even to ask later.)**Option 1:** My first instinct was to think about cloud-native solutions like Azure Fabric, Azure object storage, and other Azure services - or some comparable setup in AWS/GCP. The cool thing is that you get something up and running relatively quickly with e.g. Terraform scripts, and by using a CI/CD pipeline you can ramp up entirely, neatly segregated client/tenant environments in an Azure resource group. I like the cleanliness of this solution. But when I looked into the pricing of Azure Fabric, boy, even the smallest possible single service instance already costs you a small fortune. If you ramp up an Azure Fabric instance for each client, you will have to charge them hefty fees right from the start. That's not entirely optimal for an early-stage startup that still needs to convince the first customers to even consider you.I looked briefly into BigQuery and Snowflake, and those seem to have similarly hefty prices due to 24/7 running compute costs particularly. All of this just eats up your budget.**Option 2:** I then started looking into open source alternatives like Dremio - and realized that the juicy bits (like data catalog) are not included in the free version, but in the enterprise version only. I could not find any figures on the license costs, but the few hints point to a five figure license cost, if I got that right. Or, alternatively, you fall back again to consuming them as a manages SaaS from them, any end up paying a continuous fee like with Azure Fabric. I haven't looked into Delta Lake yet, but I would assume pros and cons are similar here.**Option 3:** We could go even lower level and do things more or less from scratch (see e.g. [this blog post](https://medium.com/@harits.muhammad.only/how-to-build-free-modern-data-lakehouse-using-dockerized-dbt-airflow-minio-and-dremio-933294de5ac5)). However, the trade-off is of course you end up paying less money to providers and spend much more time fiddling around with low-level engineering yourself. On the positive side, you'll have full control over everything.And that's how far I got. Not sure what's the best direction now to dig deeper.

1on8j79,Polyglot Persistence or not Polyglot Persintence?,Sweaty-Act-2532,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I’m currently doing an academic–industry internship where I’m researching polyglot persistence, the idea that instead of forcing all data into one system, you use multiple specialized databases, each for what it does best.For example, in my setup:PostgreSQL → structured, relational geospatial dataMongoDB → unstructured, media-rich documents (images, JSON metadata, etc.)DuckDB → local analytics and fast querying on combined or exported datasetsFrom what I’ve read in literature reviews and technical articles, polyglot persistence is seen as a best practice for scalable and specialized architectures. Many papers argue that hybrid systems allow you to leverage the strengths of each database without constantly migrating or overloading one system.However, when I read Reddit threads, GitHub discussions, and YouTube comments, most developers and data engineers seem to say the opposite, they prefer sticking to one single database (usually PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of maintaining several.So my question is:**Why is there such a big gap between the theoretical or architectural support for polyglot persistence and the real-world preference for a single database system?**Is it mostly about:Maintenance and operational overhead (backups, replication, updates, etc.)?, Developer team size and skill sets?, Tooling and integration complexity?, Query performance or data consistency concerns?, Or simply because “good enough” is more practical than “perfectly optimized”?**Would love to hear from those who’ve tried polyglot setups or decided against them, especially in projects that mix structured, unstructured, and analytical data.

All on the starter subscription.Then, we sign up and pay, but who would know, EU support is now removed from the entry monthly plan. So EU data residency is now a paid extra feature.We are told that EU data residency is for annual plans only, bit annoyed, but fair enough, so i head over to their pricing page to see the entry subscription in an annual plan. I contact them to proceed with this, and guess what, it is gone, just like that! And it is gone, despite (at this point) still being listed on their pricing page!Ok, so after much back & forth, we are allowed to get the entry plan in annual (for an extra premium of course, gotta pay up). So now we finally have EU data residency, but now, all of a sudden the one important feature we were presented by their sales team is gone.We already signed up now to the annual plan to get EU, so bit in the shit you can say, but I contact them, and 20 emails later we can get the dynamic configuration of destinations, if we upgrade to a new and more expensive plan.And to put it into context, starter annual is 11'800 USD for 7m events a month, so it is not like it is cheap in any way.

1ooxica,CDC and schema changes,Emanolac,dataengineering,"How do you handle schema changes on a cdc tracked table? I tested some scenarios with CDC enabled and I’m a bit confused what is going to work or not. To give you an overview, I want to enable CDC on my tables and consume all the data from a third party(Microsoft Fabric). Because of that, I don’t want to lose any data tracked by the _CT tables and I discovered that changing the schema structure of the tables, may potentially end up with some data loss if no proper solution is found. I’ll give you an example to follow.I have the User table with Id, Name,Age, RowVersion. The CDC is enabled at db and at this table level, and I set it to track every row of this table. Now some changes may appear in this operational table1. I add a new column, let’s say Salary as DECIMAL. I want to track this column as well. But I don’t want to disable and enable again the CDC for this table, because I will lose the data in the old capture instance2. After a while, I want to ALTER the column Salary from DECIMAL to INT (this is just for the sake of the example). Here, what I observed, is that after the ALTER state is run, the Salary column in CT table is automatically changed to INT which is weird that may lead to potentially some data loss from the previous data3. I will Delete the Salary column. The statement will not break but I need to update somehow the tracking for this table without the column. 4. I will rename the Name column to FirstName. The rename statement will break because it will see that the column is linked to CDC5. I will rename the table from User to Users. This statement is not failing but I still need to update the cdc tracking to not let misleading naming conventions that may be confusing Did you encounter similar issues in your development?

1ookgz2,Stuck integrating Hive Metastore for PySpark + Trino + MinIO setup,poogast,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I'm building a real-time data pipeline using Docker Compose and I've hit a wall with the Hive Metastore. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction or suggest a better architecture.My Goal:I want a containerized setup where:1. A PySpark container processes data (in real-time/streaming) and writes it as a table to a Delta Lake format.2. The data is stored in a MinIO bucket (S3-compatible).3. Trino can read these Delta tables from MinIO.4. Grafana connects to Trino to visualize the data.My Current Architecture & Problem:I have the following containers working mostly independently:· pyspark-app: Writes Delta tables successfully to s3a://my-bucket/ (pointing to MinIO).· minio: Storage is working. I can see the _delta_log and data files from Spark.· trino: Running and can connect to MinIO.· grafana: Connected to Trino.The missing link is schema discovery. For Trino to understand the schema of the Delta tables created by Spark, I know it needs a metastore. My approach was to add a hive-metastore container (with a PostgreSQL backend for the metastore DB).This is the step that's failing. I'm having a hard time configuring the Hive Metastore to correctly talk to both the Spark-generated Delta tables on MinIO and then making Trino use that same metastore. The configurations are becoming a tangled mess.What I've Tried/Researched:· Used jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base for Spark.· Set Spark configs like spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog, and the necessary S3A settings for MinIO.· For Trino, I've looked at the hive and delta-lake connectors.· My Hive Metastore setup involves setting S3A endpoints and access keys in hive-site.xml, but I suspect the issue is with the service discovery and the thrift URI.My Specific Question:Is the ""Hive Metastore in a container"" approach the best and most modern way to solve this? It feels brittle.1. Is there a better, more container-native alternative to the Hive Metastore for this use case? I've heard of things like AWS Glue Data Catalog, but I'm on-prem with MinIO.2. If Hive Metastore is the right way, what's the critical configuration I'm likely missing to glue it all together? Specifically, how do I ensure Spark registers tables there and Trino reads from it?3. Should I be using the Trino Delta Lake connector instead of the Hive connector? Does it still require a metastore?Any advice, a working docker-compose.yml snippet, or a pointer to a reference architecture would be immensely helpful!Thanks in advance.",2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ookgz2/stuck_integrating_hive_metastore_for_pyspark/,2025-11-04 21:51:09,2025-11-10 01:44:56

1or3sxw,The collapse of Data and AI Infrastructure into one,Traditional_Rip_5915,dataengineering,"Lately, I feel data infrastructure is changing to serve AI use cases. There's a sort of merger between the traditional data stack and the new AI stack. I see this most in two places: 1) the semantic layer and 2) the control plane.On the first point, if AI writes SQL and its answers aren't correct for whatever reason - different names for data elements across the data stack, different definitions for the same metric - this is where a semantic model comes in. It's basically giving the LLM the context to create the right results. On the second point, it seems data infrastructure and AI infrastructure are collapsing into one control plane. For example, analytics are now agent-facing, not just customer-facing. This changes the requirements for data processing. Quality and lineage checks need to be available to agents. Systems need to meet latency requirements that are designed around agents doing analytic work and retrieving data effectively. How are y'all seeing this show up? What steps are y'all taking when implementing these semantic data models? Which metrics, context, and ontology are you providing to the LLMs to make sure results are good?",2,0.58,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1or3sxw/the_collapse_of_data_and_ai_infrastructure_into/,2025-11-07 19:29:30,2025-11-10 01:44:56
1oqutfg,Built pandas-smartcols: painless pandas column manipulation helper,RedHulk05,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I’ve been working on a small helper library called **pandas-smartcols** to make pandas column handling less awkward. The idea actually came after watching my brother reorder a DataFrame with more than a thousand columns and realizing the only solution he could find was to write a script to generate the new column list and paste it back in. That felt like something pandas should make easier.The library helps with swapping columns, moving multiple columns before or after others, pushing blocks to the front or end, sorting columns by variance, standard deviation or correlation, and grouping them by dtype or NaN ratio. All helpers are typed, validate column names and work with `inplace=True` or `df.pipe(...)`.Repo: [https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols](https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols)I’d love to know:• Does this overlap with utilities you already use or does it fill a gap? • Are the APIs intuitive (`move_after(df, [""A"",""B""], ""C"")`, `sort_columns(df, by=""variance"")`)? • Are there features, tests or docs you’d expect before using it?

1oosu69,Transformation layer from Qlik to Snowflake,No_Candle_2534,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I'm trying to modernize the stack in my company. I want to move the data transformation layer from qlik to snowflake. Have to convince my boss. If anyone had this battle before, please advice.For context, my team is me (frustrated DE), team manager (really supportive but with no technical background), 2 internal analyst focusing on gathering technical requirements and 2 external bi developer focusing on qlik.I use Snowflake + dbt but the models built in here are just a handful, because I was not allowed to connect to the ERP system (I am internal by the way) but only to other sources. It looks like soon I will have access to ERP data though.Currently the external consultants connects with Qlik directly to our ERP system, downloads a bunch of data from there + snowflake + a few random excels and create a massive transformation layer in Qlik.There is no version control, and the internal analysts do not even know how to use qlik - so they just ask the consultants to develop dashboards and have no idea of the data modelling built. Development is slow, dashboards look imho basic and as a DE I want to have at least proper development and governance standards for the data modelling.My idea: Step 1 - have ERP data in snowflake. Build facts and dim in there.Step 2 - let the analysts use SQL and learn DBT to have the ""reporting"" models in snowflake as well. Upskill the analyst so they can use github to communicate bugs, enhancements etc. Use qlik for visualization onlyMy manager is sold on step 1, not yet 2. The external consultants are saying that qlik workd best with facts and dims, instead of one normalized table. So that they can handle the downloads faster and do transformations in qlik.My points to go for step 2:- qlik has no version control (yet - noy sure if it is an optiom)- internally no visibility on the code, it is just a black box the consultants manage. Move would mean better knowledge sharing and data governance- the aim is not to create huge tables/views for the dashboards but rather optimal models with just the fields needed- possibility of internal upskill (analysts using sql/dbt + git)- better visbility on costs, both on the computation layer as well as storage costs decreased Anything else I can say to convince my manager to make this move?",1,0.6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oosu69/transformation_layer_from_qlik_to_snowflake/,2025-11-05 03:55:28,2025-11-10 01:44:56

I read a blog suggesting using storage transfer service, while I know the storage paths of these managed tables in Azure, I don't think copying the delta files will allow recreating them, I tested in my workspace doing that and you can't create an external table on top of a managed table location, even when I copied the table folder. Don't know why though, I'd love to understand (especially when I duplicated that folder). PS, both workspaces are under unity catalog. Ps2: I'm not Databricks expert, so any help is welcome. We need to migrate years of historical data, and also might need to remigrate when new data is added. So incremental unloading is needed as well... I don't know if delta sharing is an option or would be too expensive, since we need just to copy all that history, I read there's cloning too but don't know if that's cross metastore/cloud possible...too much info, if someone migrated or you have ideas, thank you!",1,0.6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ooo2ub/databricks_migration_cross_cloud/,2025-11-05 00:15:52,2025-11-10 01:44:56

But I recently noticed that one of our standard processes for monitoring crew assignments during shifts is wildly inefficient, and I want to build a proof of concept dashboard so that management can OK the project to our IT dept. Right now, when a train is delayed, dispatchers have to manually piece together information from multiple systems to judge if a crew will still make their next run. They look at real-time train delay data in one feed, crew assignments somewhere else, and scheduled arrival and departure times in a third place, cross-referencing train numbers and crew IDs by hand. Then they compile it all into a list and relay that list to our crew assignment office by phone. It’s wildly inefficient and time consuming, and it’s baffling to me that no one has ever linked them before, given how straightforward the logic should be.I guess my question is- is this as simple as I’m assuming it should be?

1ooiekb,Data Vault - Subset from Prod to Pre Prod,Salt_Anteater3307,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I am working at a large insurance company where we are building a new data platform (dwh) in Azure, and I have been asked to figure out a way to move a subset of production data (around 10%) into pre prod, while making sure referential integrity is preserved across our new Data Vault model. There is dev and test with synthetic data (for development) but pre prod has to have a subset of prod data. So 4 different env.Here’s the rough idea I have been working on, and I would really appreciate feedback, challenges, or even “don’t do it” warnings.The process would start with an input manifest – basically just a list of thousand of business UUIDs (like contract_uuid = 1234, etc.) that serve as entry points. From there, the idea is to treat the Vault like a graph and traverse it:I would use metadatacatalog (link tables, key columns, etc.) to figure out which link tables to scan, and each time I find a new key (e.g. a customer_uuid in a link table), that key gets added to the traversal. The engine keeps running as long as new keys are discovered. Every Iteration would start from the first entry point again (e.g contact_uuid) but with new keys discovered from the previous iteration added. Duplicates key in the iterations will be ignored.I would build this in PySpark to keep it scalable and flexible. The goal is not to pull raw tables, but rather end up with a list of UUIDs per Hub or Sat that I can use to extract just the data I need from prod into pre prod via a „data exchange layer“. If someone later triggers an new extract for a different business domain, we would only grab new keys no redundant data, no duplicates.I tried to challenge this approach internally but i felt like it did not lead to a discussion or even „what could go wrong“ scenario.In theory, this all makes sense. But I am aware that theory and practice do notalways match , especially when there are thousand of keys, hundreds of tables, and performance becomes an issue.So here what I am wondering:Has anyone built something similar?Does this approach scale?Are there proven practice for this that I might be missing?So yeah…am i on the right path or run away from this?",1,0.6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ooiekb/data_vault_subset_from_prod_to_pre_prod/,2025-11-04 20:30:27,2025-11-10 01:44:56
1oof1kt,Optimizing filtered vector queries from tens of seconds to single-digit milliseconds in PostgreSQL,m1r0k3,dataengineering,"We actively use pgvector in a production setting for maintaining and querying HNSW vector indexes used to power our recommendation algorithms. A couple of weeks ago, however, as we were adding many more candidates into our database, we suddenly noticed our query times increasing linearly with the number of profiles, which turned out to be a result of incorrectly structured and overly complicated SQL queries. Turns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed. I searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation. Now, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance \- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector \- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy \- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them \- Directions for even further optimizations and learningHopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search!

1oo5u6o,Is it really that hard to enter into Data Governance as a career path in the EU?,UnusualRuin7916,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I wanted to get some community perspective on something I’ve been exploring lately.I’m currently pursuing my master’s in Information Systems, with a focus on data-related fields — things like data engineering, data visualization, data mining, processing and AI, ML as well. Initially, I was quite interested in Data Governance, especially given how important compliance and data quality are becoming across the EU with GDPR, AI Act, and other regulations.I thought this could be a great niche — combining governance, compliance, and maybe even AI/ML-based policy automation in the future.However, after talking to a few professionals in the data engineering field (each with 10+ years of experience), I got a bit of a reality check. They said:It’s not easy to break into data governance early in your career.Smaller companies often don’t take governance seriously or have formal frameworks.Larger companies do care, but the field is considered too fragile or risky to hand over to someone without deep experience.Their suggestion was to gain strong hands-on experience in core data roles first — like data engineering or data management — and then transition into data governance once I’ve built a solid foundation and credibility.That makes sense logically, but I’m curious what others think.Has anyone here transitioned into Data Governance later in their career?How did you position yourself for it?Are there any specific skills, certifications, or experiences that helped you make that move?And lastly, do you think the EU’s regulatory environment might create more entry-level or mid-level governance roles in the near future?Would love to hear your experiences or advice.Thanks in advance!",1,0.57,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oo5u6o/is_it_really_that_hard_to_enter_into_data/,2025-11-04 12:23:16,2025-11-10 01:44:56

1or153t,Could modern data platforms evolve into full-blown custom ERP systems?,TheOnlinePolak,dataengineering,"I work in a Databricks environment, so that’s my main frame of reference. Between Databricks Apps (especially the new Node.js support), the addition of transactional databases, and the already huge set of analytical and ML tools, it really feels like Databricks is becoming a full-on data powerhouse.A lot of companies already move and transform their ERP data in Databricks, but most people I talk to complain about every ERP under the sun (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, etc.). Even just extracting data from these systems is painful, and companies end up shaping their processes around whatever the ERP allows. Then you get all the exceptions: Access databases, spreadsheets, random 3rd-party systems, etc.I can see those exception processes gradually being rebuilt as Databricks Apps. Over time, more and more of those edge processes could move onto the Databricks platform (or something similar like Snowflake). Eventually, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Databricks or partners offer 3rd-party templates or starter kits for common business processes that expand over time. These could be as custom as a business needs while still being managed in-house.The reason I think this could actually happen is that while AI code generation isn’t the miracle tool execs make it out to be, it *will* make it easier to cross skill boundaries. You might start seeing hybrid roles. For example a data scientist/data engineer/analyst combo, or a data engineer/full-stack dev hybrid. And if those hybrid roles don't happen, I still believe simpler corporate roles will probably get replaced by folks who can code a bit. Even my little brother has a programming class in fifth grade. That shift could drive demand for more technical roles that bridge data, apps, and automation. What do you think?

And we've received some new requirements which our system doesn't support, such as time travel.So we need a system that can better manage schema, support time travel.I've looked at Apache Iceberg with Spark Dataframes, which comes really close to a perfect solution, but it seems to only work around the newest schema, unless querying snapshots which don't bring new data. We may have new data that follows an older schema come in, and we'd want to be able to query new data with an old schema.I've seen suggestions that Iceberg supports those cases, as it handles the schema with metadata, but I couldn't find a concrete implementation of the solution. I can provide some code snippets for what I've tried, if it helps.So does Iceberg already support this case, and I'm just missing something?

Okay so maybe some clarification is needed: I know the computer doesn't \_know\_ (in the sense humans know things) that grey is grey and not chartreuse. I was kind of assuming the values exist on some sort of cartesian plane with XYZ coordinates and from there some sort of maths is done on the inputs to get the output colour, but I'm going to go on a limb here from the responses that is not really whats happening and its more just light/voltage manipulation done by the GPU/image processing part of whatever computer.",65,0.83,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1onarm2/how_is_rgb_calculated_under_the_hood/,2025-11-03 12:45:22,2025-11-10 01:44:57

1oqpvsx,I'm having difficulty finding all kinds of fancy tools and technologies,ZealousidealKale2042,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone!Throughout my years of studying programming and work, I have always had the same question. I don't know how to properly find various tools and libraries.While developing projects or doing my work, I tend to use the simplest and most straightforward approaches, relying on old and time-tested techniques that are hard to ignore when learning programming.When faced with a problem or task, I turn to Google for a solution. I usually find one, but it's often not the most efficient or optimal solution. Later, I find a better, more concise, and secure way to solve the issue that I somehow missed when searching.Each time I publish a repository on GitHub, it only contains the bare essentials for the project and nothing more.But also, every time I open other people's repositories or developers' chats, I see people communicating in Elvish, casting unknown secret spells consisting of made-up words and names of tools and libraries, some of which I have never heard of, such as: just, dependabot, pre-commit, uv, unicornus-pam-pam, umdbpegasus, fizzbuzzenterprisemegacooltool, and so on (some of the names are made up, but I think such tools will appear and become a must-have in the next few days).Many of these pieces of technology can only be discovered by searching for their direct name. However, how can one stumble upon them if they are only searched by name? Furthermore, often, the descriptions of such projects' repositories are as strange as possible and do not reflect their essence. For example, ""FizzBuzzEnterpriseMegaCoolTool is your ambassador to the world of great programming achievements. A framework for delegating fractal powers to transcendent purple entities in the paradigm of the great actor's shift."" What??? Is this some kind of secret agent's code or is it really Elvish?And this framework itself, for example, is just a tool for generating HTTP clients based on a config. Of course, this example is made up, but I believe you understand what I am trying to say. Most project descriptions are a quiet horror. However, the most interesting thing is that it creates the feeling that everyone around you understands what they are and why they are needed.. And in general, everyone except me, of course, has been using this thing since it first appeared on the internet.When I first started studying, I looked at different roadmaps and study plans. There were lots of popular and useful tools and technologies, like git, Linux, VSCode, and more. Now, nothing has really changed - the basic stuff is still the same.I find similar roadmaps and look for these magic technologies, but I don't find them. The most you can find them in all sorts of awesome lists, but even then, not all and not always.Often, these projects have thousands of stars on GitHub, but neither Google nor GitHub search gives me this useful thing - just all the outdated nonsense and users' personal projects.And it happens even more often that such projects have fewer than 500 stars on GitHub, but people still use these things if you look at recent applications or in programmers' chats. How they discovered these things is not clear.There is also a common problem that I can't guess up to a certain concept in principle, and because of that, I can't create a search result, because that idea doesn't occur to me. For example, yesterday, I found out about such a thing as harper. I had never even thought of finding tools to check grammar, especially to automate this check in repositories. Or, for instance, hexagonal architecture, which has become popular in recent years (although the concept and original article have been around for many years). I stumbled upon this by accident. If you search for architecture on Google, there will only be MVC, MVP, MVVM and others, not this one. I don't understand how this spreads and why Google's search doesn't reflect actual trends.I understand that people often learn about concepts and tools through communication and job, rather than searching, but I would still like to know how people initially learn about these things and how they transfer their knowledge. Perhaps I just answered my own question - people simply communicate and interact with each other, sharing information and experiences. Someone may discover something interesting and share it with others, who tell others, and so on. But perhaps I need to hear confirmation of this understanding from you.In my attempts to ask these fundamental and interesting questions in chat rooms, but everyone there was toxic about it or ignored it, although, as for me, finding information and learning new things is the most important part of programming. I sometimes feel as if I have been banned from Google and Github search :D. It feels as if my searches are being filtered to exclude useful information and instead provide irrelevant or nonsensical results.TLDR: I am struggling to find useful new tools, libraries, and concepts in the development community when they are not well indexed by search engines and are mainly distributed through community channels. What important detail of the search for all this am I missing?I am sorry for the messy and unstructured nature of my text. I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do.

I’ve also passed a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).I’m having a hard time recognizing where exactly my lack of skill is and how I should structure my practice. For example, with the LeetCode problem “121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock"", my initial thought was: “Okay, there’s a profit to be maximized — this seems like a decision problem. When to buy? When to sell? Could it be a greedy problem?” I came up with a “greedy” approach, but it failed on a counterexample. After looking up the solution, I found it could be solved with two pointers and a sliding window — a simple and straightforward method.When I tried to find a dynamic programming solution, I couldn’t locate one (at least on YouTube) that started with a recursive approach and then introduced memoization. From what I remember in my DSA course, we first derived the recursive function as a mathematical definition (not code) and then built a table of values for the dynamic programming implementation. I think my problem is that I understand the general ideas of these concepts:\* Backtracking\* Dynamic Programming\* MemoizationI can also identify the problem category:\* Enumeration (find all possible paths or ways)\* Optimization (find the maximum or minimum)\* Decision (e.g., fractional knapsack problem)I’m not getting too emotional about it. If I make mistakes, I study other people’s solutions, then move to the next problem with a fresh mind — avoiding overthinking. I walk through examples, see if I can relate them to other problems, patterns, or topics, and try my best.

Keep in mind that preferably we would want a method that isn't blocked behind a paywall, and that we want good habits in terms of organization to form early since we are still teenagers. Also, I'd appreciate it if the UI for the method is easy to understand and intuitive :) Currently, we have a system on Notion (For reference \`notion.com/templates/notion-projects-and-tasks\` ) in which we can a list of tasks and each bunch is separated by a ""project"" which is basically a topic like frontend, backend, note taking, etc. This method is cool, as in it's simple to use and we can very easily add on to each section in their own right. However, this method doesn't have much structure, meaning there's just a bunch of task without any organization of what to do in which order, or any ""branching off"" with tasks in the project that are related to each other. Essentially, it's just a pile of tasks. What we want is a roadmap-based system which we branch out into separate categories (UI, Authentication, Communication, etc.) and in each category, we have a linear roadmap which shows each tasks to do in sequence, each task with it's own note or page where we can either add extra mini ""sub-tasks"" to do and comments about our progress and so on and so forth. In such a way where it like creates a pathway of tasks, each task being it's own branch on the tree that connects to others so it gives us a nice flow on what should be done. You know just like standard roadmap but still with great organization, task management and all. At least that's what we invision as being good Having said that, this is what we are sort of thinking of. But we are young and do not know as much as you other smarter people. So I implore honestly, what would be best? Notion, \*\*Clickup, Jira, Asana\*\* system and software?

I’m practicing backend + data modeling by building a portfolio analytics system as a learning project. This is NOT a product showcase and I’m not linking anything, just trying to understand if my design choices make sense and where I’m going wrong. Please critique the approach and suggest better ways. I’ll keep it specific and technical.Goal (short): capture meaningful interactions on a portfolio page (like which section was opened, which outbound link clicked) in a privacy-respecting way, then summarize safely for the owner. No fingerprinting, minimal PII, exportable data.What I’ve tried so far (very condensed):• Events I log: view, section\_open, image\_open, link\_click, contact\_submit• Session model: rotating session\_id per visitor (cookie), expires fast; don’t store IP, only map to coarse country code server-side• Storage: Postgres. events table is append-only; I run daily rollups to “page\_day” and “section\_day”• Exports: CSV, JSON, XML (aiming for portability, kinda unsure if overkill)• Access modes: public / password / lead-gate. For private links still record legit engagements, but never show analytics to visitors• Webhooks (optional): page.viewed, section.engaged, contact.captured• Frontend sending: batch beacons (debounced), retry w/ backoff; drop if offline too long• No 3rd-party beacons, no cross-site tracking, no advertising stuffAbbreviated schema idea (pseudo):event\_id UUIDoccurred\_at UTCpage\_id TEXTsection\_id TEXT NULLsession\_id TEXT (rotating)country CHAR(2) NULLevent\_type ENUM(view, section\_open, image\_open, link\_click, contact\_submit)metadata JSONB (e.g. {href, asset\_id, ua\_class})Questions I’m stuck on (where I could use guidance):1) Session design: is a short-lived rotating session\_id ok for beginners? Or should I avoid any session at all and just do per-request stateless tagging. I don’t want to overcollect but also need dedupe. What’s a simple pattern you’ve learned that isn’t fragile?2) Table design: would you partition events by month or just single table + indexes first? I worry I’m prematurely optimizing, but also events can grow alot.3) Rollups: is a daily materialized view better than cron-based INSERT INTO rollup tables? I’m confused about refresh windows vs. late arriving events.4) Exports: do beginners really need XML too or is CSV/JSON enough? Any strong reasons to add NDJSON or Parquet later, or is that just yak shaving for now.5) Webhooks versioning: how do you version webhook payloads cleanly so you don’t break consumers? Prefix with v1 in the topic, or version in the JSON body?6) Frontend batching: any simple advice to avoid spamming requests on slow mobile? I’m batching but sometimes it still feels jittery and I’m not sure about the best debounce intervals.7) Privacy: is “country only” geo too coarse to be useful? For learning, I want to keep it respectful, but still give owners high-level summaries. Any traps you learned here (like accidental PII in metadata)?8) Testing: for this kind of logging pipeline, is it better to unit-test the rollup SQL heavily, or focus on property tests around the event validator? I feel my tests are too shallow, honestly.I’m happy to change parts if they’re just wrong. I’m trying to learn better patterns rather than show anything off. If this still reads like a “showcase”, I’ll gladly adjust or take it down, just want to stay within the rules here. Thank you for your time and any detailed pointers you can share.

I’ve had two internships so far, but neither really gave me a clear sense of direction.The first was mostly software front-end work at an insurance company they didn’t ask me back, which honestly hurt. The second was a marketing role at a really small company where I ended up doing something completely different: editing videos, tracking KPIs, and even leading a marketing campaign. It was fun, but definitely not in the CPEN (Computer Engineering) space.I’ve realized I’m more drawn to the electrical engineering side of things than the CS side, but I still haven’t been able to land a technical internship in that area. I’ve been thinking about transitioning into Product Management (maybe as an APM or DPM), but those roles seem super business-heavy and I’m not sure if that’s the right fit either. also with how competitive it is and I’m not the best at networking but I am a master of soft skills and I think I have a salesman look.To make things more confusing, I have a project that actually won a hackathon, but it was focused on UI/UX design — which kind of adds to my “jack of all trades, master of none” feeling CPEN gives.I don’t really have a passion for deep CPEN stuff (like research or machine learning). I just want to build a thriving, meaningful life, but right now it feels like I’ve dug myself into a hole where I’m not technical enough for engineering and not business-oriented enough for PM.I graduate soon, and I’m genuinely nervous about not being able to find a job.

1oske7j,Feelings that the U.S. economy will never recover?,mylogicoveryourlogic,cscareerquestions,"Since about 2020 I have heard seniors in the industry mention how they have noticed waves of jobs that were once for American workers, usually entry-mid level, being offshored to easter europe, latam, the Philippines, and worst of all, india. I'm a dual citizen. Having looked at the job postings in my other country (small country in the Balkans) I've noticed that there are tons of positions for senior software engineers. These are jobs from American companies. I have heard even seniors mentioning that it's harder to get a job. Well no shit that's the case if even senior roles are being outsourced. Not only that, every story I've heard so far of a senior switching jobs ended up with many downsides. Going back to office, pay cut, even shittier work conditions. I'm trying to think about the end goal here. No manufacturing jobs. No IT jobs. Where the hell is the legislation to save the U.S. from collapsing because I don't see any way that it can continue in this trajectory without mass upheaval. Not everybody can be a doctor. Not everybody can be a plumber, especially with how fragile most human bodies are. Not everyone can open a restaurant (which you see tons of them failing and closing down). Not everyone can sell crap. In fact if everyone is selling crap.Is it normal to feel this disgruntled and worried?

1or3gyj,My experience interviewing in 2025 with 5 YOE,queenoyster,cscareerquestions,"https://imgur.com/a/iRI5FRTI wanted to share my experience interviewing for the past two months in this market. I have a Bachelors of Science in a field unrelated to computer science and graduated in 2020, straight into COVID-world. I'd taken a few computer science courses, so I spent my last semester of university looking for software engineer roles knowing we were probably going to be remote for a while.I've been working for five years, with most of that time at Amazon. I've been a mid-level engineer for roughly 1.5 years, but feel that I should've been promoted sooner. Despite what people say about working at Amazon, I've enjoyed my four years here. I lucked out with finding a good team and manager.My main reasons for leaving are:- Amazon comp philosophy is bad. You are assigned stock to meet a target compensation number, with the assumption that the stock will increase 15% YoY. The stock has actually gained 10% YoY since I've started, which means I'm paid less than my target. The solution to this is Amazon assigns more stock that vests the following years to make up for the gap. This means you'd have to stay longer to meet your target compensation. The reverse is also true. If your actual compensation surpasses your target because of stock gains, then you are assigned fewer/no additional stock vests for the next few years. The employee loses when the stock does well and when the stock does poorly.- Layoffs were coming. The volume of posts about layoffs occurring later this year dramatically increased across Blind, internal Slack, r/amazonemployees, various Discords, etc. Morale was already bad since we did two layoffs prior to 2025.- My work was getting stale.- I felt there was no path to senior for me in the next four years.- I distrust my org's leadership.- I'm in Seattle for Amazon and I've accepted it's not my city. I'd like to move to New York City or San Francisco.Most of the jobs I applied to came from LinkedIn, but I applied manually through the employer's website. I targeted midlevel engineering roles if they were available, otherwise, I applied for senior. Towards the tail end of my job search, I used a browser extension called Simplify to autofill applications. I highly recommend this since you can also use it to keep track of your applications, scrum board style. I spread out my applications so that I would have interviews for the two following weeks.To prepare for my interviews, I bought a year of Leetcode premium and a lifetime subscription to HelloInterview premium. I also joined a Slack server targeted towards engineering leadership career development and participated in mock interviews there. My friends generously offered their time to mock interview me as well. These were great because they gave me very candid feedback. I also searched through Glassdoor for other peoples' interview experiences to get an idea of what to expect for companies I was highly interested in. My weakest round is probably the coding round; I completed 160 Leetcode during this interview cycle and felt that was sufficient. I should note that I would've practiced more Leetcode if I were interviewing with large tech companies like Google or Microsoft, but I didn't hear back from them. I also had never done a system design interview before this job application cycle, so I studied that hard. I read every HelloInterview system design article and felt I overprepared.Managing emotions around rejection was pretty difficult, I'm thankful I have good friends I could talk to. I got rejected from my top 3 target companies and I bedrotted for weeks beating myself up over it. If I were to have done anything different, I would've front-loaded my interviews with companies I cared less about. I felt much more comfortable in my later interviews. I also would've spaced out my interviews more. It was difficult balancing them and a full-time job. I tried to do early morning interviews (I even had two 2AM ones!), but found that my performance really suffered in the morning. I'd block out time in the afternoon instead to do interviews and pray no one at work wanted to schedule over them. I'd often work after hours to catch up on work I'd neglected during the day.I ended this interview cycle with 5 offers: 2 senior and 3 mid-level. Two of these offers were at late stage SF-based AI startups (not any of the big names). I accepted one of these. I don't want to reveal exact numbers, but I'll say that my base comp exceeds my total comp at Amazon, and I am extremely happy with it.",314,0.91,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1or3gyj/my_experience_interviewing_in_2025_with_5_yoe/,2025-11-07 19:16:38,2025-11-10 01:44:58

1orkbhk,Approaching 1 year of unemployment,petiteautomaton,cscareerquestions,"I normally don’t post about my personal issues online but I genuinely feel lost on what to do right now. I was laid off in the last week of 2024 and have been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for the past 10 months.

Now it’s November and I just got the ‘no offer’ emails after final rounds with two more companies (I think I have failed 12 final loops now). What do I do now? I am lucky to be financially secure but I feel as if my career is dead. While I know my situation can’t be unique I have not found any information about what do here. Things I have tried/am considering:- I’ve worked on personal projects to fill out my resume. They fill the page out well but are always ignored in actual interviews- I’ve applied to smaller companies and startups, but in my experience it is both harder to find job listings for smaller companies and I am ghosted more often by startups than mid-large companies - I’ve considered going back to school to pursue a masters or change fields, but hesitated when seeing grad schools require recommendations from employers. It could be an option but I’d need to hope my managers that I haven’t kept in touch with would recommend me- I could seek underemployment. Not ideal but better than not accomplishing anything - I can keep applying. Obvious but I dread when the gap on my resume has grown so much I stop getting interviewsAny advice or stories about similar situations appreciatedEdit: I appreciate the honest replies. It seems the general recommendation is to improve my interviewing skills and keep applying. I don’t normally post on social media but getting to discuss this anonymously with others has been very helpful.

I still don’t fully understand what’s being discussed in stand-up sometimes — people talk about complex systems and dependencies like it’s second nature, and I just nod along feeling lost.I also find myself relying on AI to generate a lot of my code. It’s something that’s actually encouraged here, but part of me worries it’s making me dependent. I do try to read and understand what it’s doing afterward, but I still feel like I’m just barely keeping up. Without it, though, I honestly think I’d be completely lost and wouldn’t finish half of what I need to do.For example, right now I’m doing some performance testing — running network tests, analyzing latency, and comparing different protocols — and it’s been going on for a while. I just keep feeling like I’m missing something or not doing it the “right” way. Part of me wonders if someone else had this task instead of me, it would’ve been done by now.I also feel like I’m getting things done, but not really understanding them. I can complete the tasks, but idk if i’m even doing them well and I wish I truly understood how and why everything works the way it does — the underlying architecture, the reasoning, the “why” behind each step. It makes me feel like I’m just going through the motions rather than growing as an engineer.Lately I’ve also been feeling kind of dumb — not in a self-deprecating way, but genuinely wondering if maybe my brain just doesn’t think the way a CS brain should. Like, maybe I’m not smart enough for this kind of work. I see how effortlessly some people grasp things like system architecture or debugging complex issues, and I feel like I’m missing whatever “clicks” for them.What really gets to me is hearing how confidently everyone else speaks — about QE, testing flows, deployment, architecture, tokens, etc etc — and I just… don’t feel like I understand the bigger picture. I can get individual tasks done, but I don’t yet “get” how all the pieces fit together in a large-scale system.Has anyone else gone through this? How do you actually learn to think like a real engineer and not just a task-doer? How do I become that person who genuinely knows what they’re doing and speaks knowledgeably and doesn’t just pray to somehow make it through the day without being confused out of my mind?

1opdfhk,How are you guys getting AI to write working code?,Thiccolas18,cscareerquestions,"So for some context, I would not consider myself old school by any means. I started learning to code with Java back in 2017, so I learned to code ""the old-fashioned way"" by looking at documentation and/or stack overflow before AI came into the mainstream.I now work in test automation primarily using C#, but I also have quite a bit of experience with Python as well. I now use Copilot in my daily workflow, but I genuinely do not understand how you guys are saying things like ""My workflow is 95% prompting then copy and pasting and I barely ever touch code manually now."" My experience with copilot is that it will make up functions left and right that do not exist in the codebase, and it's actually faster for me to just write the code manually and then use AI as sort of a glorified stack overflow. I.e. I can rubber duck with it, and it won't call me stupid for asking a question. I'm genuinely confused how people are vibe coding entire applications.When you guys do this is the code actually robust and work well? Or do you end up spending a lot of time refactoring? Do you spend a lot of time coming up with instructions for the AI? What are the strategies you guys use to make it effective for you? In my experience it seems to be good at things like leetcode, but bad in large codebases with dependencies and structure.Edit: From these responses it seems like most of you use AI basically the same way I do, with the exception of the cursor comments. Unfortunately I’m in a corporation so switching to cursor and trying it out isn’t really feasible for me in this context.

1orvs8h,I suddenly got callback from big tech company after giving up hope of any employment - how do I get in shape in time,BOKUtoiuOnna,cscareerquestions,"Note: Do not tell me to not try and I'm doomed - even if its impossible its better that I make an effort and learn something than notI have been unemployed for 7 months as a an ex-bootcamper (non-stem bachelors) with 3 yoe. My last job was in a big household name company but not one known for tech (more publishing) in Java. I never felt I was more than mediocre, and then I got sick with nebulous undiagnosable long covid, which made my performance worse, and I became an easy budget cut. After a few months of inactive burnout (where I lost a lot of muscle memory), and a few months of sending out CVs, I had pretty much given up on getting any significant interviews any time soon and was pretty much just messing around with ones I didn't care about and building my portfolio as much as possible, with an aim of just learning out loud and then leveraging that in my next round of applying. I was making a language learning app with some NLP elements in python for the last couple months. I haven't written much Java since April, and even then, my last position was fullstack and they had me on a lot of frontend in the final year. I haven't done any leetcode since June (and most DSA I haven't revisited since I got hired at my last place >2 years ago). Studying up on the systems design I'm starting to be expected to understand better as a now potential mid was in my backlog.Suddenly, two days ago I got an email from a big tech company (not FAANG but close, and in an adjacent field to my last company) I had applied to a month or more ago. I remember filling in the application form thinking ""I don't know why I am doing this, I should definitely wait until I have improved myself and have an actual chance. They're going to think this application is pathetic"". I expected no response and honestly forgot entirely about the job position or what I even wrote in that form. They want to interview me for a Java position.I can only assume they saw how my last company is actually vaguely relevant to their product and clicked on my github and saw how active I am rn and actually wanted to give me a chance.I have accepted, have HR on Tuesday, I'm just trying to work out how to get myself in gear in time for the next stage if it happens.

On top of this, I need to help ppl with their coding, like PR review, daily discussions, and so on. And then I also get into Production calls, reviewing production outcomes, why our code isn't performing well or whatever, etc. I fucking hate all of this. It might sound easy due to not coding, but i need to stretch my brain in a way that just gets me very overwhelmed, while also being incredibly BORED.I just never imagined that, I would be coding less, while being 5x more stressed than ever. A lot of the requirement documents I review are poorly written, so I have to keep scheduling meetings / following up with ppl to ask questions.. my day sometimes is just meetings ALL day, with almost no time to eat a damn meal. And then I need time to do code review so my team members' aren't blocked! So oftentimes, I do the code review at like 7pm after dinner or early in the morning the next day. Shit's fucked. Anyway, just a dumb rant I guess. It just makes me sad that, this is ultimately where a SWE goes.

1on819f,Advice on not being allowed to take PTO?,Dovageris,cscareerquestions,"I'm an ML Engineer with 6 YoE and a PhD for ML in Applied Math, based in the US. I started a new job in January at a large company with 18 days of PTO, which I thought was nice considering I'm used to ""unlimited"" which left me constantly worried about what was ok to take.For the first few months, I didn't request any time as I know it can be considered unprofessional when you're new. I took a single day because I had to move for the job, which my manager didn't seem happy about, but it was a big move from a place I had lived in for a long time and I made it clear I was going to need to before I was even offered the job.Just for some background, over the year my manager's feedback has been very negative. Whenever I get this negative feedback I put in extra effort to address it, and at first I figured he was just a bit more demanding than most. But as I'm now grinding over the weekends and occasionally pulling all-nighters, I see that my manager is just looking for anything to critique and ignoring everything else. It's not like I'm just not doing the work or half-assing it, in fact I've gone above and beyond to meet every critique, no matter how minor, and I've tried to pull out all the stops on clever solutions and building out important features. I've even had other coworkers remark at the amount I've accomplished and the quality of the results, so I don't think it's just in my head. My team is also sort of ""R&D"" for a large company, so our results are important, but we don't have rush times or fast-paced deadlines.But whenever I've put in PTO requests, he has denied them, saying I'm too behind to be taking extra time off. I put in the requests at least 2 months in advance, and I'm not requesting much -- when I had ""unlimited"" PTO I never took more than 5 days total in a year so I'm not looking to take off an entire week or anything. Honestly I just want to use the time since it goes away at the end of the year and doesn't pay out or roll over. He and other members of my team seem to take long vacations all the time though, so I'm not sure why it's just me that can't take any days of PTO.Everyone I've talked to so far has basically said that it's ultimately my manager's discretion, which surprised me as I thought dedicated PTO totals meant there was some sort of legal requirement that you be allowed to use them. I guess lesson learned now.Any advice though? Simply leaving for another job is difficult considering it's not even been a year, and my previous roles have been 1-2 years as well so I was looking to have a long stint at one place to make it not look so bad.

1oqflk2,"My devs struggle to work independently, and it's partly my fault. As their manager and fellow dev, how can I start to fix this in a way that gives them time to ramp up but also applies the necessary pressure to get on it?",PentaSector,cscareerquestions,"Hey all. Apologies for the long post. Mainly want to be thorough to emphasize the efforts I've made and the scope of the problem.So, I manage a small squad of devs on a larger project team and maintain a full-time dev workload alongside them. (I know what you're thinking, and you're right, but I've accepted the challenge for the sake of my trajectory.)This is my first managerial role; I was deliberately given less advanced devs, partly to mentor them and help boost their professional development, partly to shield them from aggressive technical leadership. I was fine with that assignment; it plays to my strengths as a mentor and safe space steward. I do what I can to foster collaboration and self-organization - we have* a chat channel just for my reports and me (i.e., a space to screen ""stupid"" questions before asking the wider team, etc.)* regular meetings to check up on work status and collaborate on blockers in real time* 1:1 and 1:few meetings to get people comfortable and talking through obstacles* me frequently working to communicate thought process to the team through detailed code reviews, driving on pair/group programming sessions, and brainstorming out loud during aforementioned meetingsBasically, I'm doing everything I can to not only get people working together, but also to make sure they see the work through my eyes as much as I can verbalize my process.I'm confident in asserting that I'm putting forth disproportionate effort in getting them somewhere closer to my level. My efficiency suffers for it, but leadership is generally happy with my velocity, and I'm still significantly more efficient than the rest of the team. Some of them are legitimately junior and gradually ramping up, but a few have more YoE than I do and frequently submit incomplete, incorrect, or arguably badly engineered solutions (acknowledging that the latter is somewhat subject to my opinions, but it's also the least of my worries). This manifests in incredibly frustrating ways, like having to talk through the same technical guidance or arguments repeatedly as people continue to make the exact same mistakes, and having to frequently repeat what strikes me as obvious advice to solve refactoring or bugfixing problems (e.g., if you're trying to correlate a code path to a navigation path within a web app, start with a known related unit of code and follow the references). Tl;dr: lack of curiosity seems to be a major factor.These are the kinds of problems that resulted in me being stepped up to manage these devs, and the lack of improvement is felt across the wider team. This manifests pretty clearly in the fact that we estimate our own roadmap and have decent leeway to do so, and the devs aren't even meeting their own numbers when they get the padding they argue for. We're essentially not at liberty to stretch our roadmap much further, just given the dependencies on our output, so when we fall behind on our own estimates, it's a problem, and people come under scrutiny.I was recently asked to pull the tech lead into one of our regular meetings - one where mob coding is a frequent engagement - to help gauge the situation. After sitting in on a few rounds, his assessment was that I'm doing enough of the work that they ultimately have no need to be curious when I drive, and he's right. Anytime the devs pull me aside, it turns into me taking the cockpit and talking through how I work; I always let them start, but I usually take over *because* they essentially hit a point where they're just lost or out of ideas, including in the context of obstacles we've specifically worked through before.His proposed solution was to start letting them fail immediately. There's a version of this that I can get on with, but this work environment is not particularly tolerant of the kind of ""failure"" it would entail, and I don't want to put anybody's job at risk.So my question is essentially this:**What's a graduated approach I can take to get people working more independently that gives willing devs a chance and respects my time?**I don't foresee something like purposely tracking my collab hours and tuning them down each week; that'll never hold up. I *have* contemplated cutting all collab hours and letting code review be our only touchpoint. The problem here is that several devs don't seem to internalize review feedback, and PR churn sometimes results in exponential loss of time. E.g., they may submit a PR after one day but take two more to fix relatively simple issues. I'm essentially looking for a way to provide detailed, immediate feedback that they *will* internalize, while keeping my time burden for that sort of effort stable and eventually decreasing.Moreover, **what's a way to do this that doesn't leave people feeling demoralized or traumatized?** I'm clearly frustrated, but these are still people, and I don't want to make their lives hard. I just want to see them perform to their potential.Open to any insights regarding successful approaches that folks have taken here to empower and motivate their teams, especially if starting from a place of subpar performance.Also feel free to ask clarifying questions or hurl clarifying insults; there's surely a lot of context I'm leaving out here, probably in part just because I'm fixating on solving the problem more than thinking broadly around it.**EDIT:** remove a rogue instance of the word ""I'm.""",31,0.89,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oqflk2/my_devs_struggle_to_work_independently_and_its/,2025-11-07 00:13:45,2025-11-10 01:44:58

Looking for advice",jajinpop91,cscareerquestions,"I’m 32, originally from Eastern Europe, and moved to the U.S. about ten years ago. I taught myself front-end development in 2017 while living off savings, and during that time I started using weed heavily to cope with stress. It turned into a long-term dependency. I’m not functional when high. My focus and code quality drop and that has definitely slowed my growth. I’ve also struggled with anxiety and burnout cycles along the way.My first job was rough: I was the only front-end dev, no mentorship, no code reviews, just figuring things out alone. Since then, I’ve mostly worked in digital agencies doing CMS-heavy work. I’ve stayed employed and I can ship features, but I feel like my foundational skills never solidified. **My code works, but the quality often isn’t good** it feels like I’m assembling things rather than understanding them at a deeper level (architecture, state management, patterns, testing, etc.).On top of that, **my career progression has been slow and has gaps field with very questionable freelance work.** Some people move from junior to senior/tech lead in 3–4 years. In my case, after \~7–8 years, I’ve only just reached mid-level. I know why — lack of mentorship, inconsistent learning habits, mental health struggles, and the weed dependency but it still leaves me with the fear of becoming *stuck* or even **unemployable** if I don’t level up soon.I’m trying to cut down on weed, rebuild discipline, and take my growth seriously. But I’m overwhelmed and unsure how to structure the path.**I’d really appreciate advice on:**1. **How to improve code quality** when you didn’t develop good habits early on?2. **How to rebuild fundamentals mid-career** — patterns, architecture, testing — in a structured way?3. **How to break out of the “just making things work” mindset** and develop more intention in coding?4. **For anyone who has dealt with weed dependence / burnout:** what helped you actually regain clarity and momentum?5. **How to focus** when everything feels important and the learning path feels endless?Not looking for pity, just experiences from people who’ve been through similar and found a way to turn things around.Thanks to anyone who takes the time to reply.",15,0.9,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oskmf5/midcareer_frontend_dev_dealing_with_skill_gaps/,2025-11-09 14:23:19,2025-11-10 01:44:58

Tried docs, AI tools, trial-and-error… nothing. Finally got help from a SnapLogic dev in another team and he solved it in 15 minutes.On top of that, this feels like a career-direction issue too.

I’ve read advice online suggesting it’s okay to “fake it till you make it,” which I interpreted as exaggerating my impact or responsibilities. My assumption was that as long as I know the details well enough to answer follow-up questions, I could frame my contributions more strongly.Overall, I’d love tips on how to frame stories and strategies to present myself effectively to the hiring manager.

1on0h5r,Is consulting companies a really bad option when hiring people.,jack1563tw,cscareerquestions,"I am not sure why we seems to be only getting the candidates from the consulting companies in the first place. Prob a company thing. Some worked for ""famous"" companies, even got some with titles shouldn't apply to our job.My team has been trying to hire people since a few months ago. We first were looking for candidates who know the tech stack. We got bunch of resumes from the consulting companies that mentioned they have worked on the tech stack, and they all have at least 7+ years of experience ( in general), but literally none of them passed our two round interview. The first one is questions about some basic knowledge ( basic if you've worked on the tech stack, in my opinion ), and questions about how the candidates would solve a problem.The second round is a coding challenge while sharing the screen (like pair programming where we might give some hints) that only takes about 90 mins. The features we asked them to do are really basic if they have worked on the tech stack before, and we also allowed them to google and check the documentation if they want, it really is an open book exam, but just no AI stuff. 90 mins is really more than enough to complete.None of them passed. We decided to look for candidates who know a different tech stack that I think is more well known compared to the first one, but also to focus on how they solve problems, like the approach they take, how they are solving it, and etc. Guess what, literally only 2 of them passed and they aren't really the devs we are looking for, we only hired them because we realized they know a tech stack well enough and seems to be alright when it comes to learning new things.We have interviewed more than 40 people already.

I didn’t want to pick Java or JS, so I started learning Go last week. So far it doesn’t seem too hard, but I’ve heard that goroutines and Gin get tricky later on.So, my question is: Should I focus on Python (faster prototyping, slower execution), or Go (backend-focused, is fast and unique, but harder to master as a developer language)?

For reference, I am a data engineer in the semi-conductor industry, and the number of times that I have worked on a project only to:1. Get held up by permissions and access constantly, and have to submit an IT ticket that gets put on the back burner for weeks.2. Find out that I need to use the approved by IT tools/resources which are often completely ass and hold no real world value, and hinder progress, because people making these decisions are looking at safety and budget, not actual function. Looking at you Power Automate flow, the worst platform I have ever had the displeasure of using in my entire life… all because my company won’t allow anyone not directly on the software team to create an actual web application outside of Power App and Power automate flow.3. Deal with management misunderstanding priorities and getting caught up on their grandiose visions of ML/AI which is just literally a buzz word at this point and they have no understanding of what is actually meant by these words. I had a boss that wanted me, by myself, to implement a way to monitor FSE’s , with AI, who are working on the tool to ensure they’re installing the parts outlined in procedures… sir… what?! He pressed us to do this for months despite telling him it isn’t attainable, and he just kept saying, “figure it out.” Until finally he left the he company.4. Management or stakeholders who want a detailed, image based, representation of every single change you accidentally mention instead of just making discretely. I had a manager for a while who, for example, in one meeting I mentioned I have to change the data type of a column on my not even proof of concept project yet, and he had me spend 6 days making DAGs, picture based PowerPoints, and tons of other documentation, because he wanted to understand better… this was a guy who bragged about lying on his resume to get a tech job management position and was previously just monitoring processes and creating tickets when processes failed for wafer runs in the fab…. Needless to say, he was shortly thereafter demoted lol.And so many other things.The point is, exercise, go for walks, meditate, or some thing else to build resilience and clear your mind, and learn patience, because the biggest thing I have learned in the last 3-4 years in this industry is that you will run into so many absurd issues or requests that are in no way based in logic, and are purely emotional, and if you let it eat at you, it’s going to destroy your mental health, work relationships, etc.Godspeed y’all. Edit: I also want to emphasize, I am so grateful to have a job, I love my company, I love the management that I have most of the time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have worked here for 10 years now. I understand things could be significantly worse and I could be on tour in the infantry or something.

I've already released a few production applications entirely by myself, and the clients seem to be very happy with the outcome. I am enjoying my job and learning a lot.Recently, a recruiter reached out to me for a job as an Analyst Programmer at a large company using a stack I'm familiar with. The pay is \~20% higher at this new job, but I could ask for a raise at my current job.I'm just wondering if anyone has transitioned to a larger company and what their outcome was, or what else I should take into account, career progression etc...",4,0.83,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1on0gf3/jump_ship_or_no/,2025-11-03 02:41:55,2025-11-10 01:44:58
