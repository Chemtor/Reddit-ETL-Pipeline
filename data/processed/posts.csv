What Would You Do?,skysetter,dataengineering,"**Background:** I have 10 YOE, I have been at my current company working at the IC level for 8 years and for the past 3 I have been trying hard to make the jump to manager with no real progress on promotion.

It’s that kind of position where I’m not really adding much value, but I’m also not bothering anyone.After 4 months of grinding leetcode and modern system design to get my technical skills back up to candidate standards, I now have some options to consider.Scenario A (Current Job):- TC: ~$260K- Company: A non-tech company with an older tech stack and lower growth potential (Salesforce, Databricks, Mulesoft)- Role: Overseeing mostly outsourced engineering work- Perks: On-site child care, on-site gym, and a shorter commute- Drawbacks: Less exciting technical work, limited upward mobility in the near term, and no title bump (remains an individual contributor)Scenario B:- TC: ~$210K base not including the fun money equity. - Company: A tech startup with a modern tech stack and real technical challenges (Kafka, Dbt, Snowflake, Flink, Docker, Kubernetes) - Role: Title bump to manager, includes people management responsibilities and a pathway to future leadership roles- Perks: Startup equity and more stimulating work- Drawbacks: Longer commute, no on-site child care or gym, and significantly lower cash compensationWould love to hear what you’d pick and why.",65,0.75,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m4pzmt/dead_end_260k_ic_vs_210k_manager_at_a_startup/,2025-07-20 14:15:32,2025-07-21 01:56:35
1m0hxav,Analytics Engineer for 2 years and I am feeling stuck,Nothing-Wide,dataengineering,"Hello,I started working as a Data Engineer, albeit mostly on the analytics side of things. I handle communications with business stakeholders, build DBT models, sometimes manage ingestions etc. I am currently feeling very stuck. The data setup was probably built in a hurry and the team has had no time in fixing the issues. There is no organisation in the data we maintain, and everything is just running on hot fixes. There isn't even incremental processing of the facts, or anything for that matter. There is no SCD implementation. The only thing I have built a knack for is handling business logic. I feel like I am only picking up bad practices at this job and want to move on. I would appreciate some help in getting some direction on what skills or certifications I could pick up to move forward in my career. While there are lots of resources available on some concepts like Dimensional modelling on the internet, I am having a little trouble piecing it all together. Like - how are the layers organised? What is a Semantic Model? Does semantic modelling layer sit on top of a dimensional model?

1m4u3de,Soccer ETL Pipeline and Dashboard,deathstroke3718,dataengineering,"Hey guys. I recently completed an ETL project that I've been longing to complete and I finally have something presentable. It's an ETL pipeline and dashboard to pull, process and push the data into my dimensionally modeled Postgres database and I've used Streamlit to visualize the data. The steps: 1. Data Extraction: I used the Fotmob API to extract all the match ids and details in the English Premier League in nested json format using the ip-rotator library to bypass any API rate limits.2. Data Storage: I dumped all the json files from the API into a GCP bucket. (around 5k json files)3. Data Processing: I used DataProc to run the spark jobs (used 2 spark workers) of reading the data and inserting the data into the staging tables in postgres. (all staging tables are truncate and load)4. Data Modeling: This was the most fun part about the project as I understood each aspect of the data, what I have, what I do not and at what level of granularity I need to have to avoid duplicates in the future. Have dim tables (match, player, league, date) and fact tables (3 of them for different metric data for match and player, but contemplating if I need a lineup fact). Used generate\_series for the date dimension. Added insert, update date columns and also added sequences to the targer dim/fact tables.5. Data Loading: After dumping all the data into the stg tables, I used a merge query to insert/update if the key id exists or not. I created SQL views on top of these tables to extract the relevant information I need for my visualizations. The database is Supabase PostgreSQL.6. Data Visualization: I used Streamlit to showcase the matplotlib, plotly and mplsoccer (soccer-specific visualization) plots. There are many more visualizations I can create using the data I have.I used Airflow for orchestrating the ETL pipelines (from extracting data, creating tables, sequences if they don't exist, submitting pyspark scripts to the gcp bucket to run on dataproc, and merging the data to the final tables), Terraform to manage the GCP services (terraform apply and destroy, plan and fmt are cool) and Docker for containerization. The Streamlit dashboard is [live here](https://pldashboard.streamlit.app/) and [Github ](https://github.com/karthikgarimella37/EPL_Fotmob)as well. I am open to any feedback, advice and tips on what I can improve in the pipeline and visualizations. My future work is to include more visualizations, add all the leagues available in the API and learn and use dbt for testing and sql work. Currently, I'm looking for any entry-level data engineering/data analytics roles as I'm a recent MS data science graduate and have 2 years of data engineering experience. If there's more I can do to showcase my abilities, I would love to learn and implement them. If you have any advice on how to navigate such a market, I would love to hear your thoughts.

1m1ihb6,Stories about open source vs in-house,koldblade,dataengineering,"This is mostly a question for experienced engineers / leads: was there a time when you've regretted going open source instead of building something in-house, or vica versa?For context, at work we're mostly reading different databases, and some web apis, and load them to SQL server. So we decided on writing some lightweight wrappers for extract and load, and use those for SQL server. During my last EL task I've decided to use DLT for exploration, and maybe use our in-house solution for production.Here's the kicker: DLT took around 5 minutes for a 140k row table, which was processed in 10s with our wrappers (still way too long, working on optimizing it). So as much as initially I've hated implementijg our in-house solution, with all the weird edge cases, in the end I couldn't be happier. Not to mention no breaking changes, that could break our pipelines.Looking at the code for both implementations, it's obvious that DLT simply can't perform the same optimizations as we can, because it has less information about our environments. But these results are quite weird: DLT is the fastest ingestion tool we tested, and it can be easily beat in our specific use case, by an average-at-best set of programmers.But I still feel unease, what if a new programmer comes to our team, and they can't be productive for extra 2 months? Was the fact that we can do big table ingestions in 2 minutes vs 1 hour worth the cost of extra 2-3 hours of work when inevitably a new type of source / sink comes in? What are some war stories? Some choices that you regret / greatly appreciate in hindsight? Especially a question for open source proponents: When do you decide that the cost of integrating between different open source solutions is greater than writing your own system, which is integrated by default - as you control everything.",19,0.96,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m1ihb6/stories_about_open_source_vs_inhouse/,2025-07-16 17:14:49,2025-07-21 01:56:35

1m2j3st,Is there a need for a local-first data lake platform?,SnooDogs4383,dataengineering,"Hey folks, I recently joined a consultancy where we manage data solutions for clients. My team primarily works on Databricks, and I was really impressed at first with Delta Live Tables (now called Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline) and Photon. It felt super intuitive, until I saw the $200 bill just from me testing it out. That was kinda absurd.Around the same time, I was optimizing a server for another team and stumbled onto DuckDB. I got pulled into a DuckDB rabbit hole. I loved how portable it is, and the idea of single-node compute vs. distributed jobs like Spark made a lot of sense. From what the DuckDB team claims, it can outperform Spark for datasets under \~5TB, which covers most of what we do.That got me thinking: Why not build a data platform where DuckDB is the compute engine, with the option to later switch to Spark (or something else) via an adaptor?Here’s the rough idea:1. Everything should work locally—compute and storage.2. Add adaptors to connect to any external data source or platform.3. Include tools that help design and stress-test data models (seriously, why do most platforms not have this built-in?). I also saw that DuckDB Foundation released a new data lake standard that seems like a cleaner way to structure metadata compared to loose files on S3.Meanwhile:* Databricks just announced **Lakeflow Connect** to integrate with lots of SaaS platforms. * MotherDuck is about to announce **Estuary**, which sounds like it’ll offer similar functionality. * DuckLake (MotherDuck’s implementation of the lake standard) looks promising too. So here’s my actual question: **Is there room or real need for a local-first data lake platform?** One that starts local for speed, cost, and simplicity—but can scale to the cloud later?I know it sounds like a niche idea. But a lot of small businesses generate a fair amount of data and don’t have the tools or people to set up a proper warehouse. Maybe starting local-first makes it easier for developers to play around without worrying about getting billed every time they test something?Curious to hear your thoughts. Is this just me dev dreaming, or something worth building?",16,0.92,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m2j3st/is_there_a_need_for_a_localfirst_data_lake/,2025-07-17 20:55:55,2025-07-21 01:56:35

Implementation and configuration is so hacky. It cannot even connect to our Schema registry and requires to have a copy of the schema in Glue (wtf?)* Trino's Kafka Connector works surprisingly good, but has the same issue with decimals.For you Kafka users out there, do you have the same issues? I was a bit surprised having these kinds of issues with a technology that is that mature and widely adopted. Any tool suggestions? Is everyone using Json as a topic format?

We’re only dealing with batch data for now so no streaming requirements.For CI/CD, we’re planning to use either Azure DevOps or GitHub, using the Snowflake repository stage and we currently have three separate Snowflake accounts, so zero-copy cloning won’t be an option.The files in ADLS will contain all columns from the source systems, but in Snowflake we’ll only keep the ones we actually need for reporting. Finally, for slowly changing dimensions, we're planning to use integer surrogate keys instead of hash keys.Do you think this setup is sufficient?

Since lineage is already available in Snowflake and we’re handling CI/CD externally, I'm wondering if there are still strong reasons to bring dbt into the stack.

Company works with high sensitivity data and is very slow to adopt new technology due to hesitance to change. Company has a bespoke software suite and doesn’t hold user data. All data handled is internal and mostly comprised of gathering data from our applications (metrics, logs etc). I am looking to progress to DE as my skill set (I would say) is more suited to DE and I see this as a suitable next step. The issues I face is the modern data stack feels very hard to gain experience in unless you are already in a role that gives exposure to these skills. As I work in a company who is reluctant to adopt new practices, and resistant to suggestions I feel a bit stuck on how to pivot. I am mid thirties with a mortgage and outgoings so an internship is not an option I can take. My current role requires me gather data (mostly) from sources that may not already exist, mostly through scripting, storing the data in our on premise SQL servers and then provide dashboards or applications (usually excel vba). I would say that my experience in these areas is expert level, although they do not lever any of the modern skills I see required in most job specs. I work with extremely messy data and in most cases it is a challenge to create clean analysis from this, which is why I find myself spending more time gathering the data than actually providing the end user with analysis.Can anybody provide suggestions on some specific things I can focus on portfolio wise that would help me move into DE. The issue I find is that I can state that I have done this or that in my portfolio although I am unable to quantify how I’ve done this or that with this tool at work to achieve this or that result. I have spent a lot of my own time upskilling (DE zoom camp, some other udemy courses like dbt, aws courses) and doing projects of my own, although I’m struggling to convert this into actual work experience with modern tools.

1m1qxws,Lakehouse vs. Warehouse in AWS,fabuloussir,dataengineering,"I apologize in advance for my lack of expertise. I'm the sole data analyst at a small company. We explore most of our data via our source systems, and do not have a database. My ingestion experience consists of exporting CSVs from our source systems to SharePoint, then connecting to Power BI and transforming there. I got buy-in from management for a centralized data solution in AWS. We reached out to a couple of engineering teams and received two proposals. The first one proceeds with our original intent of building a warehouse in Redshift, while the second one aims for lakehouse architecture using S3/Athena/Iceberg/Glue. I had not even heard of a lakehouse before starting this project. We record our work across multiple cloud software and need to merge them into a single source of truth. We also need to store historical snapshots of our data, which we are not able to do currently. While structured, this internal data is not large. We do not generate even 1GB of data annually. I understand that such a data size is laughable for considering a managed warehouse. However, we plan on ingesting JSON files spanning hundreds of gigs every month. While I am sure that we will not need most of the data in those files, I still want to keep them in their original format just in case. Since I have been unable to peek inside these files, I will be exploring this data for the first time. I feel that the production data will only be a few gigs. We are also reconfiguring our Jira projects, so I worry that field deletions and schema changes would convolute a warehouse implementation. While I would like to build this myself, I have no coding experience and we work with healthcare data so we would need security expertise as well. Thousands of dollars per month is out of the question at the moment, so I am looking for a cost-effective and scalable solution. I just wonder if Redshift or S3 + Athena is that solution. Oh, and we would hire an engineer to manage this solution.

Seeking a sanity check on a Kyuubi-based architecture.,jaehyeon-kim,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I've been doing some personal research that started with the limitations of the Flink SQL Gateway. I was looking for a way to overcome its single-session-cluster model, which isn't great for production multi-tenancy. Knowing that the official fix (FLIP-316) is a ways off, I started researching more mature, scalable alternatives.That research led me to **Apache Kyuubi**, and I've designed a full platform architecture around it that I'd love to get a sanity check on.**Here are the key principles of the design:*** **A Single Point of Access:** Users connect to one JDBC/ODBC endpoint, regardless of the backend engine.* **Dynamic, Isolated Compute:** The gateway provisions isolated Spark, Flink, or Trino engines on-demand for each user, preventing resource contention.* **Centralized Governance:** The architecture integrates Apache Ranger for fine-grained authorization (leveraging native Spark/Trino plugins) and uses OpenLineage for fully automated data lineage collection.I've detailed the whole thing in a blog post.https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2025-07-17-self-service-data-platform-via-sql-gateway/**My Ask:** Does this seem like a solid way to solve the Flink gateway problem while enabling a broader, multi-engine platform?

1m44d5t,Adding to on premise SQL Server process,Specific_Mirror_4808,dataengineering,"I have started a job at a public sector organisation that has a well established on-premise SQL Server data flow.Data comes from on-premise operational DBs, Cloud based operation DBs, APIs, files delivered via email, files on SharePoint and probably more I've yet to see. They use SSIS - with some additional third-party connectors - to ingest the data to SQL Server in an ETL approach. The primary customer are BI analysts using a phenomenally busy on-premise Tableau Server.From what I have seen it's functioning well and people have made good use of the data. For a public sector organisation I am impressed by what they've achieved!The limitations are no distinction between dev and prod, no CI/CD setup or version control, no clarity on dependencies, no lineage visibility outside of the handful of developers, and data models that only exist within Tableau.Their budget for new licensing is the square root of zero. They have explored cloud (Azure) but their data sources are so broad and their usage is so high that the costs would be beyond their budget. They started looking at dbt Core but have cold feet due to the growing divide between Core and Cloud.I have read some very good things about SQL Mesh and I think it would tackle a lot of their current limitations. My thinking is to retain SSIS but as EL and implement SQL Mesh as the T.Has anyone tackled anything similar before or have any thoughts beyond my limited thinking?

1m3up2i,Need help figuring out best practices for a pipeline solution,sumant28,dataengineering,"This seems like it should be a really basic pattern but I have been struggling to figure out what is ideal rather than just what will work. To my surprise I do not really see an existing solution that entirely answers this post but from ChatGPT I have a strong hunch what I need to do but I have further issues to clarify.If there is a daily ingest of about 1MB of data in JSON is it best to partition that data in the raw or bronze folder from the date as a string or instead to partition by year, month and day. All this time I was doing the latter approach thinking that was optimal but I have since found out that only is best for huge data systems which often further partition into hours and minutes and deal with petabytes or terabytes of data.The issue I have learned is that partition trees grow too large with calendar partitions rather than the simple flat structure of date strings. However my issue is that in terms of queries I have nothing ad hoc. The only thing the data is used for is to create dashboards filtering at different levels of time granularity. For example some dashboards would be by week, some by fortnight, some by month, some by year.For these queries that power these dashboards I do not know if the earlier partition even allows any benefits of partitions at all. I read that the partition still helps but I was not able to understand why. My most important dashboard is by week and I do not see how a partition by date string allows the query engine to speed up filtering by the current week or the previous week.I have some other questions specific to AWS. For the etl job that transforms the bronze layer to parquet I learned that bookmarks also need to be used. I read that it is best practice to have as a source the crawled data catalog table rather than the JSON files. Is this still true? That means for job bookmarking in order to process only incremental data you have to rely on a key which is a column of data or field rather than the easier to understand bookmarking by file. If you are bookmarking by key that points to using date string rather than using a trio of date partitions like year, month and day which are all also nested. For reducing complexity is that the right assumption?",7,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m3up2i/need_help_figuring_out_best_practices_for_a/,2025-07-19 12:10:39,2025-07-21 01:56:35
1m3seuq,Need help building a chatbot for scanned documents,AdLivid1589,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I'm working on a project where I'm building a chatbot that can answer questions from scanned infrastructure project documents (think government-issued construction certificates, with financial tables, scope of work, and quantities executed). I have around 100 PDFs, each corresponding to a different project.I want to build a chatbot which lets users ask questions like:* “Where have we built toll plazas?”* “Have we built a service road spanning X m?”* “How much earthwork was done in 2023?”These documents are scanned PDFs with non-standard table formats, which makes this harder than a typical document QA setup.# Current Pipeline (working for one doc):1. **OCR**: I’m using Amazon Textract to extract raw text (structured as best as possible from scanned PDFs). I’ve tried Google Vision also but Textract gave the most accurate results for multi-column layouts and tables.2. **Parsing**: Since table formats vary a lot across documents (headers might differ, row counts vary, etc.), regex didn’t scale well. Instead, I’m using ChatGPT (GPT-4) with a prompt to parse the raw OCR text into a structured JSON format (split into sections like salient\_feature, scope of work, financial burification table, quantities executed table, etc.)3. **QA**: Once I have the structured JSON, I pass it back into ChatGPT and ask questions like:The chatbot processes the JSON and returns accurate answers.“Where did I construct a toll plaza?” “What quantities were executed for Bituminous Concrete in 2023?”# Challenges I'm facing:1. **Scaling to multiple documents**: What’s the best architecture to support 100+ documents? * Should I store all PDFs in S3 (or similar) and use a trigger (like S3 event or Lambda) to run Textract + JSON pipeline as soon as a new PDF is uploaded? * Should I store all final JSONs in a directory and load them as knowledge for the chatbot (e.g., via LangChain + vector DB)? * What’s a clean, production-grade pipeline for this?2. **Inconsistent table structures** Even though all documents describe similar information (project cost, execution status, quantities), the tables vary significantly in headers, table length, column allignment, multi-line rows, blank rows etc. Textract does an okay job, but still makes mistakes — and ChatGPT sometimes hallucinates or misses values when prompted to structure it into JSON. Is there a better way to handle this step?3. **JSON parsing via LLM: how to improve reliability?** Right now I give ChatGPT a single prompt like: “Convert this raw OCR text into a JSON object with specific fields: \[project\_name, financial\_bifurcation\_table, etc.\]”. But this isn't 100% reliable when formats vary across documents. Sometimes certain sections get skipped or misclassified. * Should I chain multiple calls (e.g., one per section)? * Should I fine-tune a model or use function calling instead?# Looking for advice on:* Has anyone built something similar for scanned docs with LLMs?* Any recommended open-source tools or pipelines for structured table extraction from OCR text?* How would you architect a robust pipeline that can take in a new scanned document → extract structured JSON → allow semantic querying over all projects?Thanks in advance — this is my first real-world AI project and I would really really appreciate any advice yall have as I am quite stuck lol :)",5,0.78,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m3seuq/need_help_building_a_chatbot_for_scanned_documents/,2025-07-19 09:53:39,2025-07-21 01:56:35

1lztpb4,Is this ELT or ETL?,ihatebeinganonymous,dataengineering,"Hi. This is purely a pedantic question, with no practical impact on what is being developed. But still curiosity may lead to some fruitful discussion.We have a typical data pipeline, where some data are going to go daily through a series of transformations, and finally written into a unified database schema. Now, for most cases, the source and destination/sink of that data is on the same database instance. Therefore, what we can do, is to just run everything a sequence of SQL statements (`INSERT INTO T(n+1).... SELECT ... FROM Tn` etc), without actually ""loading"" any data into our server. So all data stays in teh database server and transformed there. It has the huge benefit that we don't have to deal with partitioning, distribution etc. So, it's quite clear to me that it's not ETL since we don't extract data into our data processing server and then transform it (or not?). But is it ELT indeed, given that we do not leave the transformation for after loading the data, and we do not store raw data (well we do, but only as T0 to feed our pipeline).

1m41o5i,What do modern programming languages manipulate?,wackycats354,learnprogramming,"So I understand that computers run on bits that are either 0s or 1s. And programming is the manipulation of these 1s and 0s via a programming language. If I understand correctly, original programming languages like COBOL would manipulate these bits directly. I was wondering, how do modern programming languages work? Are they directly affecting bits? Or does something like Kotlin actually have C as the underlying language, so Kotlin manipulates C++ which manipulates the bits? Or like with Swift, is it manipulating objective-C or C under the hood, which then manipulates the bits?Or do all languages directly affect bits? Are there restrictions based on platform or whatever?Would love to read an explanation or be linked to a video that explains things.

1m22xja,"Tip: Remember that ""programming"" is writing in a language!",peterlinddk,learnprogramming,"I don't know if this will reach those who need it the most, but I've seen a lot of posts from people being confused as to which programming language to choose, asking how long it will take to learn something, asking when you'll have learned enough to learn more or get a job. But unfortunately those questions can't really be answered - but fortunately it doesn't really matter!Remember that a programming language is *a language* \- and just like other languages created by humans, they are used to convey ideas to other humans. The computer doesn't care about the language you program it in, it only understands machine code, so the moment your program compiles you are basically free to throw away the source code. Except you don't do that, because you might want to change things later, or have someone else look at the code, another human, or a large language model, that also (tries to) understand language.So learning a programming language is a lot like learning any other language - there are syntax rules, grammar, different classes of words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and there are all the words in the language. A lot of them added by other humans, and in most cases still being added.If you managed to learn English (or whatever other secondary language you learnt) by reading the definition of the grammar and syntax, committing all the special cases to memory, and memorizing every single word, well, then maybe that will also work for you when learning programming! - But most of us didn't learn it that way, we picked up a few words, understood the sentence-structure, partly, tried to use the language, spoke and wrote, and made a lot of mistakes. And gradually we got better and better, learned more ""rules"" and even more exceptions to those rules, and picked up a lot of new words as we went along.Nobody has ever ""completed"" learning English - for one the language always changes, and always has, and also there are simply to many words, to many dialects even, to ever learn everything.Same goes for programming - you will probably never complete any language, there will always be something new to learn, or something that *you* use so rarely that you forget about it, and have to look it up on the rare occasions that you *do* need it.But that shouldn't discourage you from learning other languages - if you have to travel to France or Spain, you'll probably need to learn some French or Spanish, and you might even like it so much that you decide to stay and learn more - while still keeping your English, maybe forgetting a bit more than before, but never mind, you still know how to look it up!There are some grammar rules that you'll never understand, but somehow manage to use anyways. A lot of languages have gendered words, with very unspecific rules about why a specific word is one gender, but you'll get used to it ""sounding wrong"" when you use the wrong one. Same in programming, you might not be able to fully comprehend async or lambdas or closure, but just use it to write code where it ""sounds right"". A number of books and blogposts will try to invent rules to remember, but often they are even more difficult to understand, and also quite often simply wrong. So you'll get by and just ""do programming"" always feeling that you don't fully understand everything.Like you don't fully understand everything in the languages you write or speak - like you haven't meticulously memorized every single word, but somehow still use them. And some people find it easy to adapt to new languages, while others keep talking the dialect of their hometown even after having lived everywhere else their entire life. Sometimes you hear or read a word, and immediately understand it, other times you'll struggle your entire career with the spelling or pronouncination of some. The experience is different for everyone, and there is no set speed for how anything takes anyone else to learn.I hope that those of you fixating on languages will read and understand this - and maybe stop worrying so much, and get going using the languages - the programming languages - to actually build something. Not important original masterpieces, just small stories where you use the language as you are learning.",65,0.79,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m22xja/tip_remember_that_programming_is_writing_in_a/,2025-07-17 09:22:22,2025-07-21 01:56:36

1m3zlqu,A simple idea that must be understood before you learn to program.,Glass_Cobbler_4855,learnprogramming,"If you're a complete beginner who's just started programming or are about to begin your journey, please go through this first (This really helped me put things into perspective):What is programming?- I know you kinda know what it is but I bet most don't. We all know the bookish definition. But have you actually ever thought about it a bit deeper?A computer is a really dumb machine when it comes to doing things human can do and understand. If you say to a human - Go fetch me that pen :pen: that's over there on the table! They will gladly go and bring it to you. But to a computer (machine) you'd need to break that instruction into steps. Steps that may look like the following:Step 1: Hey computer! Get up, if you're sitting.Step 2: Now locate the table.Step 3: Identify something that looks like a pen :pen: Step 4: Head over to the tableStep 5: Pick up the penStep 6: Locate the personStep 7: Head over to the person with the penStep 8: Give the pen to the personStep 9: Wait for further instructions.Step 10: If no instructions given go back to where you were earlier. I may have missed a few steps here but you get the idea. Right?To a computer you would need to tell it the exact steps it would have to perform to complete the task.And that right there is programming. The instruction I have written use English language which a computer doesn't understand so humans built programming languages like C, Python etc.So every time you sit down to write a program just remember that you're telling a computer what it needs to do to complete a task. That's it. Hence, learning programming is more about developing your ability to break a problem into steps & convert those steps into code. Note: I know this is super basic stuff but strangely none of my teachers back in college explained it to me this way.

Looking for advice on the best next step in my programming journey.**Background:** 37 y/o attorney with a Bachelors from Duke but in a non-STEM field. Spent the last 3 years doing MIT's undergrad Computer Science curriculum as well as the Odin Project. I would say I have an intermediate-level understanding of a lot of the concepts you would typically learn in an undergrad CS curriculum like OOP, DSA (basic concepts like DFS, BFS, linked lists, etc. as well as some slightly more advanced concepts like skip lists, VEB trees, linear programming, etc.), basic hardness proofs, discrete math, basic computer architecture, etc. Unfortunately because I went the entirely self-taught route, aside from portfolio projects I don't have any sort of credential to demonstrate this knowledge (for this reason, I'd recommend people avoid going that route if they can help it).**Goals:** At a minimum, I'd like to be able to sit for the patent bar and potentially leverage that to work more with clients in the tech industry. The dream scenario would be to make a career switch to software engineering but given my age and the state of the market I know that is extremely unlikely, so more focused on how I could leverage this for my law practice.**Path I'm Considering:** Am I crazy for thinking that Western Governors University is a logical next step for me? It's inexpensive, it seems like I might be able to grind through the curriculum pretty quick, and then I would at least have the Bachelors in CS box checked. The downside is that some of the stuff I read elsewhere on Reddit makes it sound like a diploma mill. But other online bachelors are much more expensive and might take me over 2 years to finish, and at the end of the day they are still online degrees so not sure they would even carry that much more weight anyway. I'm also really intrigued by Georgia Tech's OMSCS, but surprisingly it sounds like it would *not* be enough for me to sit for the patent bar because it's a Masters not a Bachelors. However, if I could knock out WGU in the next 6-9 months I could apply to GT in the Spring if I decide I want to go that route, so that's maybe another benefit of taking the WGU path.For those who have gone to WGU or who are knowledgeable about the various options for an online bachelors in CS, is WGU really so much worse than other online programs that it is worth the extra time and money to do another program?

1m36jwa,Which programming language should I learn in order to create a specialized dictionary?,Puzzleheaded-Mix5149,learnprogramming,"Hello all, I hope this is ok to post here. I am a complete beginner to programming and my second language is Cree. I am posting here to ask how I should tackle this large project I have envisioned. My goal is to create a desktop-based application that is a dictionary for my Indigenous language. However I would like this to be more than just a dictionary, for example I would like to include all the conjugation tables for all verbs, which we have quite a lot in Cree. (In fact, around 85% of “words” in Cree are verbs). This would literally require tens of thousands of entries.Now every word can have quite a number of connections to other concepts. For example I envision this dictionary to include a section for synonyms and antonyms for each entry, each entry having a section for “semantic field” for related entries, a section for each entry showing all other entries from the root of that word. As well as relationships between words that mean the same, for example the same verb, just simply having a different gender for the object.I will just give some examples below:ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓐ (aahkwaatin) means “it is fierce, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓰᐤ (aahkwaatisiiu) means “s/he is fierce, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᔅᑲᑎᓐ (aahkwaaskatin) means “it is frozen very solid”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᔕᒻ (aahkwaatisham) means “s/he cuts it badly, seriously”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑲᒥᑌᐤ (aahkwaakamiteu) means “it is painfully hot liquid”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑌᔨᒣᐤ (aahkwaateyimeu) means “s/he thinks s/he is harmful, dangerous”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᓯᓈᑯᓐ (aahkwaasinaakun) means “it looks dangerous, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑖᐦᑲᓴᒻ (aahkwaataahkasam) means “s/he burns it badly”You can see the pattern. Certain parts of the word mean certain things and this can be applied to all other words, this complex connectedness is what I would like to show and be able to interact with in my dictionary. To be able to categorize, display and filter through such related roots and terms.My question is which programming language should I learn to attempt such a project? As well as any tips or references that you all may have on how I should approach such a complex project.Thank you very much for taking the time to read through this and helping me keep my language alive and flourishing.Also, if this language interests you, feel free to PM me to learn more about it!

I am learning it by building a super simple 2D game with the Raylib library.I noticed today that if you free(ptr), and forget to set it to NULL, then you have no way to know later, when trying to access or modify it, that it was actually freed! It will keep pointing to the same address in memory, but that address may now be of other, unrelated variables. This may not even cause the program to crash, right? The program might keep running and have an unexpected bug/crash deep down the road unexpectedly. I have asked some LLMs and they recommended this macro: #define SAFE_FREE(ptr) do { free(ptr); ptr = NULL; } while(0)This seems safer *to me* compared to calling free directly, because I already forgot to set pointers to NULL after freeing them. I like this idea, but I'm not immediately using it because I'm a noob and am suspicious.I came here to ask this: Is there a catch here?

Most of these were about the US market - not the EU - so I was wondering:Is there a big difference between the two in terms of how hard it is to land a job and what kind of skills are expected?I get that a lot of these comments probably come from people who gave up before actually breaking into the industry - but they still made me very anxious.I’m not chasing amazing benefits or a six-figure salary - I just want a stable job doing what I enjoy, with room to grow and improve.Not gonna lie, doomscrolling through programming subs has left me feeling genuinely depressed this past week, I don't know what to believe anymore.At one point, I even started questioning whether I should switch fields entirely, just because it felt like I might end up stuck in the job-hunting loop forever.Is it really that bad these days, even if you've got the time and space to grind and stay consistent?",8,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m28epr/really_anxious_about_getting_my_first_job_please/,2025-07-17 14:04:05,2025-07-21 01:56:36

1m0llzn,Imposter syndrome after 5 years of C++,C_Sorcerer,learnprogramming,"As the title states, I would call myself a C++ programmer because it’s the main language I use. Of course, there are others I use, like C, Java, TS, python, etc. but I have stuck to C++ for so long because after graduating (I’m in my final year of CS bachelors), I want to work in systems programming/high performance systems programming (particularly computer graphics). As such, I’ve spent the most time with C++, especially with graphics because that is so far my favorite area of CS and C++ is built for such high performance yet complex applications like game engines and has very good support for OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, GLFW, GLM, etc. But, even after 5 years of time spent, every time I start up a big project I get super bummed out because my code looks nothing like other folks code bases. Or I’ll end up watching some CPP con talk where the speaker essentially says everything I’m doing is wrong. Even going through the r/CPP subreddit (a great subreddit, no hate), it just seems like my code is way too archaic and I just don’t get it. No matter how much I try to modularize and use professional OOP principles in my programs, it just doesn’t ever look right and leads to essentially a more procedural approach which seems to be looked down upon by most C++ programmers.Of course, this imposter syndrome leads me to quit projects and rage delete everything that I’m working on. My GitHub went from 20 projects to about 2 because of how much I hated all my stuff. I just don’t have this issue with other languages either; for the most part with C, Java, Rust, etc. there is an intuitive way of doing things but with C++ it drives me insane because I have no idea the right way to do things when there’s so much stuff. But there’s not much other choice when it comes to computer graphics because it seems that C++ is the primary language for that kind of stuff so I just have to deal with itSo is this a normal feeling? Should I continue with C++ or should I maybe get better at using another language and then applying what i learn from other languages to C++?

Here are some examples I just found:Go unsafe package Alignof function:“Alignof takes an expression x of any type and returns the required alignment of a hypothetical variable v as if v was declared via var v = x. It is the largest value m such that the address of v is always zero mod m. It is the same as the value returned by…” okay? No idea how could I use this? Why would I need an alignment of a hypothetical variable?Kea DHCP:“Designed to Integrate with Your Existing Systems. Kea allows you to separate the data from the execution environment, enabling new deployment options.” This is so broad, what data can I separate? What is the execution environment? What this has to do with dhcp?I could search for more, but I hope this two kinda illustrates my point. And JUST TO BE CLEAR, I’m not blaming the people who write the documentations, in fact I envy them, and I want to learn how to understand them better (if it’s possible, maybe I’m just dumb), because now basically the only way I can learn something is through video tutorials, as they explain it in a very friendly way usually, or if the documentation is very well and easily understandably written.",3,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m2jf07/how_can_i_get_better_at_understanding/,2025-07-17 21:07:59,2025-07-21 01:56:36

I watched an AI agent, part of an internally built tool our company is piloting, take in a small Jira ticket. It was the kind of task that would usually take me or a teammate about an hour. Mostly writing a SQL query and making a small change to some backend code.The AI read through our codebase, figured out the context, wrote the query, updated the code, created a PR with a clear diff and a well-written description, and pushed it for review. All in just a few minutes.This wasn’t boilerplate. It followed our naming conventions, made logical decisions, and even updated a test. One of our senior engineers reviewed the PR and said it looked solid and accurate. They would have done it the same way.What really hit me is that this isn’t some future concept. This AI tool is being gradually rolled out across teams in our org as part of a pilot program. And it’s already producing results like this.I’ve been following AI developments, but watching it do my job in my codebase made everything feel real in a way headlines never could. It was a ticket I would have knocked out before lunch, and now it’s being done faster and with less effort by a machine.I’m not saying engineers will be out of jobs tomorrow. But if an AI can already handle these kinds of everyday tickets, we’re looking at serious changes in the near future. Maybe not in years, but in months.Has anyone else experienced something similar?

If you’re a talented and hardworking person who loves CS, stay hopeful. At big tech it is well understood that AI is a tool and the true magic comes from person + machine. Remember that software is written for people using a human readable language. It will forever serve humans and will require human operators. AI will never fully replace you.Experienced folks also tend to lose motivation and become bitter over time. New grads will always deliver a wave of fresh energy and competition. With a good blend of naïveté and starry eyed optimism, you’re a hot commodity. Like a vampire, company needs annual new blood to keep innovating. FANG will always have new grad hiring programs. Lastly, this is still a golden age for software. The responsibility for a software engineer would evolve to take on more breadth.

1m2nz4j,I quit my job. In this economy.,YonghaeCho,cscareerquestions,"Long story short, I just couldn't take it anymore.I worked at a small startup, so things had to be fast-paced. I worked hard. Really hard. Always put up with long nights, long code reviews, etc. The whole nine yards. But, in the real world, working hard doesn't mean jack shit if it doesn't produce good results. Or, at least, the results your boss wants in the timely manner that they please. So I was always on the disappointing end of my boss. There was never a time when I was good enough for him. I always felt... mediocre. And this isn't to pin anything on my boss or whatever. I'm just saying that I wasn't able to live up to his expectations.I lost a lot of sleep over the fact that I was just never good enough; I was never off of work mode, due to the anxiety and the constant self-deprecation. There were even nights when I'd run to the toilet for a quick vomit session due to the stress.There was always something to complain about. Something to say about my not being good at this or that. ""Why did you do it like this?"" and ""You definitely had AI write up this code, didn't you?"" (no, I didn't). Despite it all, I still tried. I tried my darnedest. I grit my teeth and took everything as feedback and always thanked him. I always tried applying what I was told. I always admitted when I fell short, never pushing back or disrespecting my boss due to my feelings or ego being hurt. I always took everything on the chin. But it always ate at me. So, of course, I snapped. I told my boss that I was quitting cold turkey. Why? It was the only way out of the intense burnout that I could see.To my surprise, he didn't want me to quit. But of course. It costs money to find, hire, and train a new engineer, and it's risky when you don't really know what that new engineer could be capable of (or not), as opposed to the engineer that you already have and are familiar with. So I'm not surprised. But I've known my boss for a while now. Me revoking my quitting was not going to solve anything for *me*. Maybe it would've in the short-term at my job, but I know that things would've just gone back to how they always were. That's how life rolls. So I doubled down and told him that I was not open to changing my mind.I'm going to be moving back in with my parents as soon as possible. Don't know when that is yet. I'm still... going through the motions. But, for now, I'm jobless. I'm in a weird place right now, emotionally, where I feel very relaxed and liberated in that I no longer have to put up with the stress that I did at work. But, at the same time, I'm afraid of whether or not I'll get work at all anytime soon. I'm afraid of whether or not this was a good call.But, the way things were, I knew the one answer that I needed at the time: A break from work. A long break. A few months would be nice.Regardless, this is where I'm at right now.How's *your* work life? lol---Update: Hey! This post was originally meant for me to just relieve myself of some negative energy.

1m2dbq7,"Differences I see from my experience in Defense, MAANG and Big tech industries.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,cscareerquestions,"Hey all,Im 7 YOE. I have worked in the defense industry my first few years (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc), then during the hiring height of 2020-2022 I went to FAANG-level company and spent a few years there in their cloud based system. THis year I got laid off and after a few months I was able to get a job in a big tech cloud based system. I wouldnt consider my current company FAANG level but id say most people would know it. I will pre-face this that it is my experience. Im not saying every project in each industry is like this, I've known people in AWS who claim to not have to do anything past 5 pm and get great reviews and bonuses. I know people in defense who say they work a shitload of hours to get things done.Here are some of the differences I've seen from all three jobs:# Onboarding:Defense - didnt really have an onboarding. It was just kind of, build and run the system. I remember they gave me a task to change the headers of a few files just as an excuse to get me to build.FAANG - they bascially gave me an onboarding doc, that didnt even seem official. It was just a doc that got passed around with steps. I was surpriused nobody had ever took time to put it in a version control style doc system. It was just in the middle of some doc sharing system online.Current: to my surprise their onboarding was the best and most chill. They gave me clear indiciation of where they expect me to be. The first week was just 3 hour courses each day of onboarding for my company. The second week was a self paced class for onboarding for my team. The videos were very instructive, and easy to follow along and my favorite part was they basically gave us guidelines for how to get promoted.# work life balance:Defense - probably had the best work life balance of the bunch. I never had to think about work after 5pm. By 6 the building was a ghost town with a few stragglers. They worked on a 9/80 schedule so I had 3 day weekends 2-3 times a month (26 times a year). I could also work for extra PTO, where if I worked extra hours one week I could save it in a ""extra time"" bank and use it as future PTO.FAANG - definetely the worse of the 3 so far. It was expected ot be available practically 24/7. I went to that FAANG company because I had heard it was one of the few that you coould have a life, but I never realized that cloud was the exception to that rule. People were respodning to emails late at night, getting on calls late, responding on vacation, etc. THey were cool about taking time off but it felt like if you weren't drinking the kool aid and doing 10x more like verybody else was doing, it wouldnt go well for you.Current - still early to tell but it seems that there isnt as much of a ""work late"" culture here. People set their own times, some work a bit later but Ive never seen any crazy discussions happen at 11 pm like I did in my last job. A few principal engineers have gone on vacation and not yet have I seen any of them get on a call or message thread to answer any type of question.# Expectiations:Defense - really didnt have much expectations. I practically worked 20 hours, coasted the rest, was my team's scrum master, etc and over excelled in their eyes. There was no real due date on things because contracts in defense last multiple years. I remember when I got there the expectation was to complete the project within my first year. It took 3 years to finish and nobody batted an eye.FAANG - expectations were very high. If you were finishin up with a major task, theyd throw another one at you before you were even done with the first. Seemed even as aJr/mid-level I was expected to lead meetings, always be available, etc. I worked way more at this job than I did at defense and felt like i was underperforming because if I did 8-10 hours, most others did 10-12 hour days. In reviews it seemed like I was compared to my teammates, not so much compared to what the expectation of the job was.Current - again still early. But seems like their expectations are pretty fair. A quote from the first day I like was ""if you want to be the person that does 40 hour weeks and gets your job done, you can have a long career here. If you want to be the person that does 50+ hour weeks here for that quicker promotion, you can do that but just respect your work-life balance"".# Time and meetings:Defense - hardly had any meetings. We did standup evertday (except fridays) for 30 minutes but it mostly lasted 15 minutes. We hardly went over. I never learned the concept of parking lot until I got to FAANG lol. It was in office so just walking to someone's desk was really just the norm.FAANG - seemed like if your day didnt have 4 hours of meetings, you were underperforming. Everything was a discussion. Parking lot would take an extra hour and most of it was discussing things that I felt didnt really have to take that long. At times some of my tasks were pushed back due to someone wanting to discuss about one simple change. If you had to talk to someone, it was hard to get them on a call and when you did they didnt appreciate their time being wasted. In meetings it seemed everyone was stressed to have the meeting finish.Current - seems nobody is really stressed about meetings. Parking lot items get resolved pretty quickly. Everybody doesn't mind hopping on a call and lasting an hour with you.Edit: someone asked for interview styles. I wont give exact details but ill say more or less how it was.# Interview:Defense: I was a college grad so I got invited to an all day hriing event by the company. It seemed like the interviews didnt ask anything technical, they jsut wanted to get ot know me. At the end of the day they had me list my favorite teams and told me theyd let me know. I've interviewed for other defense companies, tbh there were no leetcode questions or anything like that. Technical questions were more like ""what is OOP?"" or how I would design a simple code.FAANG - first was a pre-round codesignal style question to see if I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that I went through 2-3 rounds of interviews asking leetcode style questions and then a manager meet.Big tech - similar to faang. Pre-interview exam to make sure I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that it was 2-3 rounds of code/system questions.Edit 2: people asked about TC# TC\- Defense: as a college grad in a HCOL state I started at about 78k wiht a 5k bonus. Within 4 years and 1 promotion I was making 90k and yearly bonuses that was around 5k-8k. No stock. I know people who jumped to other defense company and they are around 120k. Promotion seemed like it happened every 2-3 years.\- FAANG - I never got promoted in my few years though I doubt I deserved it in their eyes. I never really saw anybody get promoted really. Like one mid level SWE had been working more than most seniors and she didnt get promoted. AS for TC it was about 220k between base stocks and signing bonus. I moved to a low COL state shortly after joining and my base pay dropped by 20k so it ended up being around 200k\- Current company - TC is about 200k with just basepay and stock (no signing bonus) but according to them, im promised up to 10% bonus that would bring my total pay to around 215k.# Benefits\- Defense: 3 weeks of accrued PTO. But since there was timsheet we technically were not allowed to do overtime. A work around was if I worked 90 hours in a 2 week period, I could use 10 hours and save it in a special bank that I could use later on. So If in a 4 week period I worked 200 hours, I could set 40 hours to that special bank. And if I had a 2week vacation I could use the special bank for the first week and my regular PTO for the second week. It was good benefits outside of that, tuition reimbursement which I used to get my master's degree without taking on more debt. Discounts on personal travel (it wasnt amazing but good enough) etc.\- FAANG - Unlimited PTO. Some of the best benefits i've ever seen will probably will ever have. There were multiple different types of reimbursement programs for almost anything. Discount codes on almost any store that were actually pretty good discounts. Similar benefits when it comes to tuition reimbursement, etc.\- Big tech - unlimited PTO. Again good benefits, just not as good as FAANG. Company will give random 3 day weekends to employees that they announce pretty early so people have it prepared.",224,0.94,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m2dbq7/differences_i_see_from_my_experience_in_defense/,2025-07-17 17:13:44,2025-07-21 01:56:37

1m1rmts,Why AI is not replacing you anytime soon,therealslimshady1234,cscareerquestions,"If you think AI will be replacing you as an engineer, you are probably wildly overestimating the AI, or underestimating yourself. Let me explain.The best AI cannot even do 10% of my job as a senior software engineer I estimate. And there are hard problems which prevent them from doing any better, not in the least of which is that they already ran out of training data. They are also burning through billions with no profitability in sight, almost as quickly as they are burning through natural resources such as water, electricity and chips. Not even to mention the hardest problem which is that it is a machine (or rather, routine), not a sentient being with creativity. It will always think ""inside the box"" even if that box appears to be very large. While they are at it, they hallucinate quite a good percentage of their answers as well, making them critically flawed for even the more mundane tasks without tight supervision. None of these problems have a solution in the LLM paradigm. LLMs for coding is a square peg for a round hole. People tend to think that due to AI being a program that it naturally must be good at programming, but it really doesn't work that way. It is the engineers that make the program, not the other way around. They are far better at stuff like writing and marketing, but even there it is still a tool at best and not replacing any human directly. Yes, it can replace humans indirectly through efficiency gains but only up till a point. In the long term, the added productivity gained from using the tool should merit hiring more people, so this would lead to more jobs, not less.The reason we are seeing so many layoffs right now is simply due to the post-pandemic slump. Companies hired like crazy, had all kinds of fiscal incentives and the demand was at an all time high. Now all these factors have been reversed and the market is correcting. Also, the psychopathic tendency to value investors over people has increased warranting even more cost cutting measures disguised as AI efficiency gains. That's why it is so loved by investors, it's a carte blanche to fire people and ""trim the fat"" as they put it. For the same reason, Microsoft's CEO is spouting nonsense that XX% of the code is already written by AI. It's not true, but it raises the stock price like clockwork, and that’s the primary mission of a CEO of a large public company.tl;dr AI is mostly a grift artificially kept afloat by investor billions which are quickly running out",132,0.77,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m1rmts/why_ai_is_not_replacing_you_anytime_soon/,2025-07-16 23:11:54,2025-07-21 01:56:37

However I don't live and breathe code. I do what I need to, to do an excellent job at work, but I do not spend my free time looking forward to exploring more tech stacks and debugging.I’ve heard a lot of advice, from people who are successful, saying those who really succeed in tech — or land the best internships and long-term roles — tend to be the ones who are deeply passionate and treat coding as a hobby. I've seen them first hand. These were the people who are multi times top hackathon winners throughout school, continuously drilled hard into building an amazing portfolio, and some even started their own company before grad. All this sets them up for getting the best internships and raises the bar skyhigh for the rest of us.I've received the literal following words of advice from a staff engineer (self-taught since little, loves it like his hobby) at Shopify: ""If you are not passionate about the knowledge and craft, get out of here you will burn out too easily""I would like to ask for everyone's honest opinion, for example :* You are the very passionate and driven, and have seen how others who just ""work to live"" tends to do (will they get pushed out?)* Or you are not in the ""live and breathe code"" camp, and are willing to share how you find it and how you find balance",121,0.88,174,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m1bwxf/is_cs_and_software_engineering_truly_not_for_you/,2025-07-16 12:57:50,2025-07-21 01:56:37

I’m earning my B.A. in CS next at a T5 CS school with a 3.8 GPA next month and my career development has been… an all-around flop. I was never able to get any internship, never developed a robust networked, and never saw any benefit from majoring in CS besides stress and a piece of paper.My strengths are I had a lot of success in university research. I was able to get a pretty prestigious publication and had a great time actually contributing to undergrad research. However, I *really* don’t want to work in SWE. I’m very money-driven and don’t see eye-to-eye with the general academic mission (I also despised teaching and kind of hated school, I also found no lecturers I really connected with). At this point, I’m about 90% sure I want to abandon any SWE dreams I once had an unshelf my high school aspirations to become an attorney. I have taken the LSAT and got a recent enough score to go to a T30 law school. What do you guys think? Is it time to “abandon all hope, ye who enter here?”**Edit: I guess should be more clear with my questions: is all hope lost for me?

I’m the most recent dev to join the team.At the beginning, I noticed people didn’t offer opinions when the lead dev spoke, and I assumed it was fear. This guy curses during dev meetings when he sees weird stuff (usually some weird requirement from product), so I thought everyone was just intimidated.But as time went on, I realized the lead dev isn’t an ogre, he just lacks social skills. And honestly, I think there’s a lack of trust in the contractors. These guys, they do the bare minimum. Clean code practices is like an alien concept. Magic numbers in conditionals, functions scattered all over the place, no deletion of unused code, functions names not describing what they do. It’s a mess. Something that should take a day takes three, just because you have to go through the messy code or refactor first, which I think it’s only me who does it anyways.I’ve mentioned my concerns like the usage of magic numbers and only the lead dev reacts. The rest stay silent. They rarely answer questions unless I tag them in the message. It feels like they’re just taking advantage of the fact that the lead dev is a workaholic who works weekends and oversees everything. I get just doing your job and collecting paychecks, but I can’t understand this level of laziness. It’s crazy.I want to push more for clean code practices, but I don’t want to create an uncomfortable situation for anybody, specially if things seem to be working out they way things are now.

If I’m going to start reviewing PRs and putting more time into raising the quality bar, I want to make sure management sees it.On one hand, I’d love to just keep things chill and cash my check.

I have been at my very small(less than 20 employees) non-tech company 19 years, and for the last 15 of those years I have been solely responsible for both developing our customer facing applications and managing the infrastructure they run on. I shifted the entire company's tech from a closet in the office to AWS in 2017, and in since then our downtime can be measured in minutes. While our company is tiny, we have several very large clients and the applications I have written(mostly in .NET) have scaled well to their often heavy demands. And I painstakingly migrated a few huge, monolithic [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms apps to Razor Pages and Blazor. I am also the sole manager of Active Directory, virtual desktops, etc. The good: I am fully remote and make $140,000 a year. Because I have the company's tech basically on auto-pilot I might work ten hours in a busy week. I have no deadlines, no one looking over my shoulder, one pointless meeting a week, and if I need to buy something for the company tech-wise no one even notices. I nominally have a boss, but he's in his late 60's and checked out years ago.The bad: I made $135,000 before COVID and I don't see that changing any time soon. No raise this year. I receive no benefits, no bonus, no retirement funding beyond my own contributions. I am fortunate that my wife has a good job and great health insurance so that is not a concern. And even though I don't work a ton of hours, I always need to be available because there is no one else but me to answer customer questions or deal with even the most minor of glitches in the system. I haven't had a full work day off in over an year, even on vacation I always have to do something and be available. There is no budget to hire anyone else. Because neither our employees or clients are technically adept all my interactions with them are on the level of helping my Mom print an email. I am concerned about the long term viability of this company and bored out of my mind, but who would hire me? I've never worked on a team. I've never managed anyone. I have no idea how ""real"" companies develop production code. I code in Visual Studio, push to Github which kicks off an AWS Codepipeline, done. Nobody checks my work. We don't have budgets. I don't know what a pull request is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.I plan to retire by 62 so I know the easy answer is to just ride this out until then but like I said, I don't know that the company will be around that long.

Also, it is not a tech company. A lot of the work I've done both in this job and in my internships is not impressive or exciting. In reality, most of it has been work done on internal tooling or your everyday basic crud app. I haven't worked on complex problems, I haven't ever come across a project that I felt would take a stroke of genius to solve.

I'm working on side projects but the things I'm passionate about wouldn't get me hired or paid well. I've done so much Leetcode but I still flop interviews. Hell, I don't even get interviews.

If all hands presentations are any indicator, my company is really drinking the ""Pivot to AI as a business model"" Kool Aid. And so I feel like I can’t turn down AI projects or even discuss my concerns without it seeming like insubordination, or putting a target on my back as not aligned with the company’s vision, or seeming like a luddite uninterested in learning new skills.I realize “AI” is a lot more than just ChatGPT-generated slop, and so I want to at least be open-minded to the ways it can be a useful tool without the ethical concerns. But I’m unsure to what extent those applications \*do\* exist, and if they do, how to initiate a conversation about finding projects that would be less soul-crushing.

For the past 1.5 years, my old manager asked me to work with another team which is more Data science/Data engineering related. It's more backend and data science-oriented. I didn't have any prior data science experience, but the codebase was manageable, and most of my tasks involved fixing bugs or building straightforward features without deep DS knowledge.Recently, my manager asked me if I wanted to change my job title to reflect my current role, I agreed. But to officially ""transfer"", I had to pass a Python coding test. I was surprised since by this point I'd already shipped multiple features, fixed a shit ton of bugs, but went ahead anyway.The first test went super badly lol, questions about two-sum, basic string manipulation, pandas, and numpy threw me off. I felt terrible and asked for a retake. I studied pandas thoroughly as that was the one thing I had no experience in, but the second test didn't even have pandas questions, it had a simple fizzbuzz-type problem, some question regarding numpys again (which I got right, but I hadn't converted the original array to np.array, which got me a zero lol), For the fizz buzz type question, I messed up badly by using `if` instead of `elif`.I asked for one last try. The third test (10) questions were incredilby easy, I thought they felt pity for me lol, then came question 11 and 12, 11 had pass some argument or something to a parser, I honestly didn't even understand the question and 12 had me converting a sentence to numbers, like tokenization. I got the logic right, but couldn't remember the syntax for removing punctuation. Unfortunately, CoderPad doesn't give partial credit, so I failed again. Now I'm seriously doubting my abilities. In my mind, its like I can just look up this information ( syntax about removing punctuation) is it really fair for me to get a zero on this?Even though my manager has had no complaints and my performance reviews have been good, I'm suddenly experiencing major imposter syndrome. Missing these simple questions is making me spiral. I'm worried that without the title change, I won't get promoted, or worse, might lose my job.Maybe I'm just venting, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. The self-doubt is really impacting my productivity and emotional stateEDIT: My day to day doesn't really involve lot of coding nowadays, its mostly shipping features from existing codebase and just migrating it with some minor adjustments. Fixing bugs and talking with the stakeholders to see what kind of results are they expecting.

1m45sq9,Stay at stable senior role or join high-risk AI startup (Mistral)?,palinure,cscareerquestions,"I’m a senior engineer in France at a large and stable tech company. I’ve been approached by Mistral (context: an AI startup making a lot of noise in Europe as an alternative to OpenAI).The offer seems serious but comes with obvious trade offs:Current role = stability, strong benefits, clear growth path.Mistral = exciting mission, early-stage energy, but chaotic sounding culture, and apparently high risk. Liquid comp would be slightly lower, but there’s big upside in equity… if they succeed it would be better than the current job, if they corner the European market it could be life-changing. I'm afraid of overvaluing the equity or minimizing the stress of working at a start up in my late 30s, and I don't want to burn bridges and then burn out to later be forced to take a worse job than I have now. Also while I am personally confident they are positioned to do well and believe them when they say they have no plans on getting acquired, there's no guarantee of the equity becoming liquid or ultimately being worth much.Personal considerations:I have a mortgage, some debt, and family plans, so stability matters. At the same time, I feel a bit stuck where I am and like the idea of working on something bold. Also the idea of getting a huge payoff is obviously attractive.Any advice or different points of view would be appreciated!",6,0.75,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m45sq9/stay_at_stable_senior_role_or_join_highrisk_ai/,2025-07-19 20:11:26,2025-07-21 01:56:37

Honestly, I don't fucking know, nor was there much time or encouragement to go around measuring things. We were trying hard to get stuff out the door. I did make a web app from the ground up, so is that an infinity increase in the capabilities of it? It didn't exist before. I was not there when it launched, but I left it in good shape with documentation.The individual engineer also did not do it alone. The engineer did their work along with the other engineers, PMs, designers... and only if the initiative was well designed and filled a need in the market would there be success in the end.Where do these metrics come from, honestly?
