1k2e68y,Some of you aren't writing tests. Start writing tests.,ratczar,dataengineering,"[This came to my attention in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1pl3y/a_databricks_project_a_tight_deadline_and_a_pip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) One of \*the big things\* that separates a data analyst from a data engineer, imo, is whether or not you're capable of testing your code. There's a lot of learners around here right now so I'm going to write this for your benefit. I hope it helps!# CaveatI am not a data engineer. I am a PM for data systems, was a data analyst in my previous life, and have worked with some very good senior contributors and architects. I've learned a lot from them and owe a lot of my career success to their lessons.I am going to try to pass on the little that I know. If you know better than I do, pop into the comments below and feel free to yell at me.Also, testing is a wide, varied field, this is a brief synopsis, definitely do more reading on your own.# When do I need to test my code?Data transformations happen in a lot of different ways. When you work with small data, you might write an excel macro, or a quick little script for manipulation. Not writing tests for these is largely fine, especially when it's something **you** do just for **your** work. Coding in isolation can benefit from tests, but it's not the primary concern.You really need to start thinking about writing tests when two things happen:1. People that are not you start touching your code2. The code you write becomes part of a complex systemThe exception to these two rules is when you're creating portfolio projects. You should write tests for these, because they make you look smart to your interviewers.# Why do I need to test my code?Tests take **implicit** knowledge & context about the purpose of your code / what it does and makes that knowledge **explicit**.This is required to help other people start using the code that you write - if they're new to it, the tests help them understand the purpose of each function and give them guard rails as they make changes.When your code becomes incorporated into a larger system, this is particularly true - it's more likely you'll have multiple folks working with you, and other things that are happening elsewhere in the system might necessitate making changes to your code.# What types of tests are there?I can name at least 4 different types of tests off the dome. There are more but I'm typing extemporaneously and not for clout, so you get what's in my memory:* Unit tests - these test small, discrete parts of your code. * Example: in your pipeline, you write a small function that lowercases names and strips certain characters. You need this to work in a predictable manner, so you write a unit test for it.* Integration tests - these test the boundaries between different functions to make sure the output of one feeds the input of the other correctly. * Example: in your pipeline, one function extracts the data from an API, and another takes that extracted data and does a transform. An integration test would examine whether the output of the first function results is correct for the second.* End-to-end tests - these test whether, given a correct input, the whole of your code produces the correct output. These are hard, but the more of these you can do, the better off you'll be. * Example: you have a pipeline that reads data from an API and inserts it into your database. You mock out a fake input and run your whole pipeline against it, then verify that the expected output is in the database.* Data validation tests - these test whether the data you're being passed, or the data that's landing in a given system, are of the expected shape and type. * Example: your pipeline expects a json blob that has strings in it. Data validation tests would ensure that, once extracted or placed in a holding area, the data is both a json blob with the correct keys and the data types for those keys are all strings# How do I write tests?This is already getting longer than I have patience for, it's Friday at 4pm, so again, you're going to get some crib notes.Whatever language you're using should have some kind of built-in testing capability. SQL does not, unfortunately - it's why you tend to wrap SQL in a different programming language like Python. If you only have SQL, some of what I write below won't apply - you're most likely only doing end-to-end or data validation testing.Start by writing functional tests. For each function in your code, write at least one positive case (where it gets the correct input) and one negative case (where it's given a bad input that might break it).Try to anticipate ways in which your functions might fail. Encode those into your test cases. If you encounter new and exciting ways in which your code breaks as you work, write more tests for those cases.Your development process should become an endless litany of writing code, then writing tests, then testing, then breaking, then writing more tests, then writing more code, and so on in an endless loop.Once you've got a whole pipeline running, write integration tests for the handoffs between your functions. Same thing applies as above. You might need to do some mocking - look that up. End-to-end tests - you might need more complex testing techniques for this, or frameworks. If you have a webapp over your data, you can try something like Selenium. Otherwise, not my forte, consult your seniors. You might also need to set up a test environment with some test data. It's expensive time-wise, but this is why we write infrastructure as code (learn that also, if you can).Data validation tests - if you're writing in SQL, use DBT. If you're writing in Python, use Great Expectations. If you're writing in something else, I can't help you, not my forte, consult your seniors.Happy Friday folks, hope this helped!Tagging u/Recent-Luck-6238, u/FloLeicester, and u/givnv since you all asked!",113,0.87,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k2e68y/some_of_you_arent_writing_tests_start_writing/,2025-04-18 20:01:52,2025-04-19 01:25:06

1jxtxqo,How do my fellow on-prem DEs keep their sanity...,Nightwyrm,dataengineering,"...the joys of memory and compute resources seems to be a neverending suck :loudly_crying_face:We're building ETL pipelines, using Airflow in one K8s namespace and Spark in another (the latter having dedicated hardware). Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy). I could bite the bullet and just say to go with Spark, but then our pipelines will be using Spark for QA and not for ETL which will be fun to keep clarifying.

1jysxtk,Why Data Warehouses Were Created?,LinasData,dataengineering,"The original data chaos actually started *before* spreadsheets were common. In the pre-ERP days, most business systems were siloed—HR, finance, sales, you name it—all running on their own. To report on anything meaningful, you had to extract data from each system, often manually. These extracts were pulled at different times, using different rules, and then stitched togethe. The result? Data quality issues. And to make matters worse, people were running these reports directly against transactional databases—systems that were supposed to be optimized for speed and reliability, not analytics. The reporting load bogged them down.The problem was so painful for the businesses, so around the late 1980s, a few forward-thinking folks—most famously Bill Inmon—proposed a better way: a data warehouse.To make matter even worse, in the late ’00s every department had its own spreadsheet empire. Finance had one version of “the truth,” Sales had another, and Marketing were inventing their own metrics. People would walk into meetings with totally different numbers for the same KPI.The spreadsheet party had turned into a data chaos rave. There was no lineage, no source of truth—just lots of tab-switching and passive-aggressive email threads. It wasn’t just annoying—it was a risk. Businesses were making big calls on bad data. So data warehousing became common practice!More about it: [https://www.corgineering.com/blog/How-Data-Warehouses-Were-Created](https://www.corgineering.com/blog/How-Data-Warehouses-Were-Created) P.S.

1k21gd3,"Diskless Kafka: 80% Cheaper, 100% Open",Affectionate_Pool116,dataengineering,"# The Problem **Let’s cut to the chase:** running Kafka in the cloud is expensive. The **inter-AZ replication** is the biggest culprit. There are excellent write-ups on the topic and we don’t want to bore you with yet-another-cost-analysis of Apache Kafka - let’s just agree it costs **A LOT**![1 GiB\/s, with Tiered Storage, 3x fanout Kafka deployment on AWS costs \>3.4 million\/year!](https://preview.redd.it/930a20t0ckve1.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=8971b9c98d984bc34dc2b7e20dc5ef580716d01c)Through elegant cloud-native architectures, proprietary Kafka vendors have found ways to vastly reduce these costs, albeit at higher latency.**We want to democratise this feature and merge it into the open source.**# Enter KIP-1150 [KIP-1150](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1150%3A+Diskless+Topics) proposes a new class of topics in Apache Kafka that delegates replication to object storage. This completely eliminates cross-zone network fees and pricey disks. You may have seen similar features in proprietary products like Confluent Freight and WarpStream - **but now the community is working to getting it into the open source**. With disks out of the hot path, the usual pains—cluster rebalancing, hot partitions and IOPS limits—are also gone. Because data now lives in elastic object storage, users could reduce costs by up to 80%, spin brokers serving diskless traffic in or out in seconds, and inherit low‑cost geo‑replication. Because it’s simply a new type of topic - you still get to keep your familiar sub‑100ms topics for latency‑critical pipelines, and opt-in ultra‑cheap diskless streams for logs, telemetry, or batch data—all in the same cluster.Getting started with diskless is one line: kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --config topic.type=disklessThis can be achieved *without* changing any client APIs and, interestingly enough, modifying just a tiny amount of the Kafka codebase (1.7%).# Kafka’s Evolution**Why did Kafka win?** For a long time, it stood at the very top of the streaming taxonomy pyramid—the most general-purpose streaming engine, versatile enough to support nearly any data pipeline. Kafka didn’t just win because it is versatile—it won precisely because it **used disks**. Unlike memory-based systems, Kafka uniquely delivered high throughput and low latency without sacrificing reliability. It handled backpressure elegantly by decoupling producers from consumers, storing data safely on disk until consumers caught up. Most competing systems held messages in memory and would crash as soon as consumers lagged, running out of memory and bringing entire pipelines down.**But why is Kafka so expensive in the cloud?** Ironically, the same disk-based design that initially made Kafka unstoppable have now become its Achilles’ heel in the cloud. Unfortunately replicating data through local disks just so also happens to be heavily taxed by the cloud providers. The real culprit is the **cloud pricing model itself** \- not the original design of Kafka - but we must address this reality. With Diskless Topics, Kafka’s story comes full circle. Rather than eliminating disks altogether, Diskless abstracts them away—leveraging object storage (like S3) to keep costs low and flexibility high. Kafka can now offer the best of both worlds, combining its original strengths with the economics and agility of the cloud.# Open SourceWhen I say **“we”,** I’m speaking for Aiven — I’m the Head of Streaming there, and we’ve poured months into this change. We decided to open source it because even though our business’ leads come from open source Kafka users, our incentives are strongly aligned with the community. If Kafka does well, Aiven does well. Thus, if our Kafka managed service is reliable and the cost is attractive, many businesses would prefer us to run Kafka for them. We charge a management fee on top - but it is always worthwhile as it saves customers more by eliminating the need for dedicated Kafka expertise. **Whatever we save in infrastructure costs, the customer does too!** Put simply, **KIP-1150** is a win for Aiven and a win for the community.# Other GainsDiskless topics can do a lot more than reduce costs by >80%. Removing state from the Kafka brokers results in significantly less operational overhead, as well as the possibility of new features, including:* **Autoscale in seconds:** without persistent data pinned to brokers, you can spin up and tear down resources on the fly, matching surges or drops in traffic without hours (or days) of data shuffling. * **Unlock multi-region DR out of the box**: by offloading replication logic to object storage—already designed for multi-region resiliency—you get cross-regional failover at a fraction of the overhead. * **No More IOPS Bottlenecks**: Since object storage handles the heavy lifting, you don’t have to constantly monitor disk utilisation or upgrade SSDs to avoid I/O contention. In Diskless mode, your capacity effectively scales with the cloud—not with the broker. * **Use multiple Storage Classes** (e.g., [S3 Express](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/up-to-85-price-reductions-for-amazon-s3-express-one-zone/))**:** Alternative storage classes keep the same agility while letting you fine‑tune cost versus performance—choose near‑real‑time tiers like S3 Express when speed matters, or drop to cheaper archival layers when latency can relax.Our hope is that by lowering the cost for streaming we expand the horizon of what is streamable and make Kafka economically viable for a whole new range of applications.

These insights are based on real-world experiences and are aimed at providing you with actionable strategies to handle similar issues.# Challenge: Handling page structure changes# OverviewOne of the most significant challenges in web scraping is handling changes in the structure of web pages. Websites often update their layouts, either for aesthetic reasons or to improve user experience. These changes can break scrapers that rely on specific HTML structures to extract data.# ImpactWhen a website changes its structure, scrapers can fail to find the data they need, leading to incomplete or incorrect data collection. This can severely impact the quality of the data and the insights derived from it, rendering the analysis ineffective.# Recommendation 1: Leverage API EndpointsTo handle the challenge of frequent page structure changes, we shifted from scraping **HTML** to leveraging the underlying **API** endpoints used by web applications (*yes, it’s not always possible*). By inspecting network traffic, identifying, and testing API endpoints, we achieved more stable and consistent data extraction. For example, finding the right API endpoint and parameters can take anywhere from an **hour** to a **week**. In some cases, we logically deduced endpoint paths, while in the best scenarios, we discovered GraphQL documentation by appending `/docs` to the base URL. If you're interested in an in-depth guide on how to find and use these APIs, let me know, and I'll provide a detailed description in following parts.# Recommendation 2: Utilize Embedded Data StructuresSome modern web applications embed structured data within their **HTML** using data structures like **\_NEXTDATA**. This approach can also be leveraged to handle page structure changes effectively.# Recommendation 3: Define Required PropertiesTo control **data quality**, define the **required properties** that **must** **be** **fetched** to **save** and use the **data** for further **analytics**. Attributes from different sources can vary, so it’s critical to define **what is required** based on your **domain model** and future usage. Utilize the **Template Method Pattern** to dictate how and what attributes should be collected during parsing, ensuring **consistency** across all **sources** and all types (HTML, Json) of **parsers.** namespace Example { public abstract class CarParserBase { protected ParseContext ParseContext; protected virtual int PinnedAdsCount => 0; protected abstract string GetDescription(TElement element); protected abstract IEnumerable GetCarsAds(TSource document); protected abstract string GetFullName(TElement element); protected abstract string GetAdId(TElement element); protected abstract string GetMakeName(TElement element); protected abstract string GetModelName(TElement element); protected abstract decimal GetPrice(TElement element); protected abstract string GetRegion(TElement element); protected abstract string GetCity(TElement element); protected abstract string GetSourceUrl(TElement element); // more attributes here private protected List ParseInternal(TSource document, ExecutionContext executionContext) { try { var cars = GetCarsAds(document) .Skip(PinnedAdsCount) .Select(element => { ParseContext = new ParseContext(); ParseContext.City = GetCity(element); ParseContext.Description = GetDescription(element); ParseContext.FullName = GetFullName(element); ParseContext.Make = GetMakeName(element); ParseContext.Model = GetModelName(element); ParseContext.YearOfIssue = GetYearOfIssue(element); ParseContext.FirstRegistration = GetFirstRegistration(element); ParseContext.Price = GetPrice(element); ParseContext.Region = GetRegion(element); ParseContext.SourceUrl = GetSourceUrl(element); return new ParsedCar( fullName: ParseContext.FullName, makeName: ParseContext.Make, modelName: ParseContext.Model, yearOfIssue: ParseContext.YearOfIssue, firstRegistration: ParseContext.FirstRegistration, price: ParseContext.Price, region: ParseContext.Region, city: ParseContext.City, sourceUrl: ParseContext.SourceUrl ); }) .ToList(); return cars; } catch (Exception e) { Log.Error(e, ""Unexpected parsering error...""); throw; } } } }# Recommendation 4: Dual Parsers ApproachIf possible, cover the **parsed** **source** with two types of parsers — **HTML** and **JSON** (via direct access to API). Place them **in priority order** and implement something like **chain-of-responsibility pattern** to have a fallback mechanism if the HTML or JSON structure changes due to updates. This provides a window to update the parsers but requires double effort to maintain both. Additionally, implement rotating priority and the ability to **dynamically** remove or change the priority of parsers in the chain via metadata in storage. This allows for dynamic adjustments without redeploying the entire system.# Recommendation 5: Integration TestsIntegration tests are crucial, even just for local debugging and quick issue identification and resolution. Especially if something breaks in the live environment and logs are not enough to understand the issue, these tests will be invaluable for debugging. Ideally, these tests can be placed inside the CI/CD pipeline, but if the source requires a proxy or advanced techniques to fetch data, maintaining and supporting these tests inside CI/CD can become overly complicated.# Challenge: Avoiding IP bans# OverviewAvoiding IP bans is a critical challenge in web scraping, especially when scraping large volumes of data from multiple sources. Websites implement various anti-scraping measures to detect and block IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior, such as making too many requests in a short period.# ImpactWhen an IP address is banned, the scraper cannot access the target website, resulting in incomplete data collection. Frequent IP bans can significantly disrupt the scraping process, leading to data gaps and potentially causing the entire scraping operation to halt. This can affect the quality and reliability of the data being collected, which is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making.# Common Causes of IP Bans1. **High Request Frequency:** Sending too many requests in a short period.2. **Identical Request Patterns:** Making repetitive or identical requests that deviate from normal user behavior.3. **Suspicious User-Agent Strings:** Using outdated or uncommon user-agent strings that raise suspicion.4. **Lack of Session Management:** Failing to manage cookies and sessions appropriately.5. **Geographic Restrictions:** Accessing the website from regions that are restricted or flagged by the target website.# Recommendation 1: Utilize Cloud Services for DistributionUtilizing cloud services like **AWS Lambda**, **Azure Functions**, or **Google Cloud Functions** can help avoid IP bans. These services have **native** **time** **triggers**, can **scale out well**, run on a **range of IP addresses**, and can be **located** in **different** **regions** close to the real users of the source. This approach distributes the load and mimics genuine user behavior, reducing the likelihood of IP bans.# Recommendation 2: Leverage Different Types of ProxiesEmploying a variety of proxies can help distribute requests and reduce the risk of IP bans. There are three main types of proxies to consider**Datacenter Proxies*** **Pros:** Fast, affordable, and widely available.* **Cons:** Easily detected and blocked by websites due to their non-residential nature.**Residential Proxies*** **Pros:** Use IP addresses from real residential users, making them harder to detect and block.* **Cons:** More expensive and slower than datacenter proxies.**Mobile Proxies*** **Pros:** Use IP addresses from mobile carriers, offering high anonymity and low detection rates.* **Cons:** The most expensive type of proxy and potentially slower due to mobile network speeds.By leveraging a mix of these proxy types, you can better distribute your requests and reduce the likelihood of detection and banning.# Recommendation 3: Use Scraping ServicesServices like [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/), [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/), [Brightdata](https://brightdata.com/) and similar platforms handle much of the heavy lifting regarding scraping and avoiding IP bans. They provide built-in solutions for rotating IP addresses, managing user agents, and avoiding detection. However, these services can be quite expensive. In our experience, we often exhausted a whole month’s plan in a single day due to high data demands. Therefore, these services are best used if budget allows and the data requirements are manageable within the service limits. Additionally, we found that the most complex sources with advanced anti-scraping mechanisms often did not work well with such services.# Recommendation 4: Combine approachesIt makes sense to utilize all the mechanisms mentioned above in a sequential manner, starting from **the lowest** to the **highest** **cost** solutions, using something like **chain-of-responsibility** pattern like was mentioned for different type of parsers above. This approach, similar to the one used for JSON and HTML parsers, allows for a flexible and dynamic combination of strategies. All these strategies can be **stored** and **updated** **dynamically** as metadata in storage, enabling efficient and adaptive scraping operations[Something like this ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hUD-2QxzISBZkjFNSkDcWA.jpeg)# Recommendation 5: Mimic User Traffic PatternsScrapers should be hidden within typical user traffic patterns based on time zones. This means making more requests during the day and almost zero traffic during the night, mimicking genuine user behavior. The idea is to split the parsing schedule frequency into 4–5 parts:* **Peak Load*** **High Load*** **Medium Load*** **Low Load*** **No Load**This approach reduces the chances of detection and banning. Here’s an example parsing frequency pattern for a typical day:https://preview.redd.it/5jc2iwglbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4083d72458642f13688d9ccdb9c6c43e2caf181# Challenge: Overcoming anti-spam measures# OverviewAnti-spam measures are employed by websites to prevent automated systems, like scrapers, from overwhelming their servers or collecting data without permission. These measures can be quite sophisticated, including techniques like user-agent analysis, cookie management, and fingerprinting.# ImpactAnti-spam measures can block or slow down scraping activities, resulting in incomplete data collection and increased time to acquire data. This affects the efficiency and effectiveness of the scraping process.# Common Anti-Spam Measures* **User-Agent Strings**: Websites inspect user-agent strings to determine if a request is coming from a legitimate browser or a known scraping tool. Repeated requests with the same user-agent string can be flagged as suspicious.* **Cookies and Session Management**: Websites use cookies to track user sessions and behavior. If a session appears to be automated, it can be terminated or flagged for further scrutiny.* **TLS Fingerprinting**: This involves capturing details from the **SSL**/**TLS** handshake to create a unique **fingerprint**. Differences in these fingerprints can indicate automated tools.* **TLS Version Detection**: Automated tools might use outdated or less common TLS versions, which can be used to identify and block them.# Complex Real-World Reactions* **Misleading IP Ban Messages**: One challenge we faced was receiving messages indicating that our **IP was banned** (too many requests from your IP). However, the **actual** **issue** was related to **missing** **cookies** for **fingerprinting**. We spent considerable time troubleshooting proxies, only to realize the problem wasn’t with the IP addresses.* **Fake Data Return**: Some websites counter scrapers by returning **slightly** ***altered*** ***data***. For instance, the mileage of a car might be listed **as 40,000 km** when the **actual value is 80,000 km**. This type of defense makes it difficult to determine if the scraper is functioning correctly.* **Incorrect Error Message Reasons**: Servers sometimes return **incorrect** **error** messages, which can **mislead** the scraper about the **actual** **issue**, making troubleshooting more challenging.# Recommendation 1: Rotate User-Agent StringsTo overcome detection based on user-agent strings, **rotate** **user-agent** **strings** regularly. Use a variety of legitimate user-agent strings to **simulate** requests from **different** **browsers** and **devices**. This makes it harder for the target website to detect and block scraping activities based on user-agent patterns.# Recommendation 2: Manage Cookies and SessionsProperly manage cookies and sessions to maintain continuous browsing sessions. Implement techniques to handle cookies as a real browser would, ensuring that your scraper maintains session continuity. This includes storing and reusing cookies across requests and managing session expiration appropriately.**Real-world solution**In one of the **sources** we encountered, **fingerprint** information was embedded within the **cookies**. Without this specific cookie, it was **impossible** to **make** **more** than **5** requests in a **short** **period** without being banned. We discovered that these cookies **could** **only** be **generated** by **visiting** the **main** **page** of the website with a **real/headless** **browser** and waiting **8–10** seconds for the page to fully load. Due to the **complexity**, **performance** concerns, and **high** **volume** of **requests**, using **Selenium** and **headless** browsers for every request was impractical. Therefore, we implemented the following solution:We ran multiple Docker **instances** with **Selenium** installed. These instances **continuously** **visited** the **main** **page**, **mimicking** **user** **authentication**, and **collected** fingerprint cookies. These **cookies** were then **used** in subsequent **high-volume** **scraping** **activities via http request to web server API**, **rotating** them with other **headers** and **proxies** to avoid detection. Thus, we were able to make up to **500,000 requests per day** bypassing the protection.# Recommendation 3: Implement TLS Fingerprinting EvasionTo avoid detection via **TLS** **fingerprinting**, mimic the **SSL**/**TLS** **handshake** of a legitimate **browser**. This involves configuring your scraping tool to use common **cipher suites**, **TLS extensions** and **versions** that match those of **real** **browsers**. Tools and libraries that offer configurable SSL/TLS settings can help in achieving this. [This is](https://scrapfly.io/blog/how-to-avoid-web-scraping-blocking-tls/) **great article** on this topic.**Real-world solution:**One of the sources we scraped started returning **fake** **data** due to issues related to **TLS** **fingerprinting**. To resolve this, we had to create a custom proxy in **Go** to modify parameters such as **cipher suites** and **TLS** **versions**, making our scraper appear as a legitimate browser. This approach required deep customization to handle the SSL/TLS handshake properly and avoid detection. [This is](https://github.com/Skyuzii/SpoofingTlsFingerprint) good example in **Go**.# Recommendation 4: Rotate TLS VersionsEnsure that your scraper supports multiple TLS versions and rotates between them to avoid detection. Using the latest TLS versions commonly used by modern browsers can help in blending in with legitimate traffic.# Challenge: Maximizing Data Coverage# OverviewMaximizing data coverage is essential for ensuring that the scraped data represents the most current and comprehensive information available. One common approach is to fetch listing pages **ordered by** the **creation** **date** from the source system. However, during peak times, new data offers can be created so quickly that **not** **all** offers/ads **can** **be** **parsed** from these pages, leading to gaps in the dataset.# ImpactFailing to capture all new offers can result in incomplete datasets, which affect the accuracy and reliability of subsequent data analysis. This can lead to missed opportunities for insights and reduced effectiveness of the application relying on this data.# Problem Details* **High Volume of New Offers:** During peak times, the number of new offers created can exceed the capacity of the scraper to parse all of them in real-time.* **Pagination Limitations:** Listing pages often have pagination limits, making it difficult to retrieve all new offers if the volume is high.* **Time Sensitivity:** New offers need to be captured as soon as they are created to ensure data freshness and relevance.# Recommendation: Utilize Additional FiltersUse additional filters to split data by **categories**, **locations**, or **parameters** such as **engine types**, **transmission types**, etc. By segmenting the data, you can increase the frequency of parsing for each filter category. This targeted approach allows for more efficient scraping and ensures comprehensive data coverage.# Challenge: Mapping reference data across sources# OverviewMapping reference data is crucial for ensuring consistency and accuracy when integrating data from multiple sources. This challenge is common in various domains, such as **automotive** and **e-commerce**, where different sources may use varying nomenclature for similar entities.# ImpactWithout proper mapping, the data collected from different sources can be fragmented and inconsistent. This affects the quality and reliability of the analytics derived from this data, leading to potential misinterpretations and inaccuracies in insights.# Automotive Domain**Inconsistent Naming Conventions:** Different sources might use different names for the same make, model, or generation. For example, one source might refer to a car model as “**Mercedes-benz v-class**,” while another might call it “**Mercedes v classe**”**Variations in Attribute Definitions:** Attributes such as **engine types**, **transmission types**, and **trim levels** may also have varying names and descriptions across sources.# E-commerce Domain**Inconsistent Category Names:** Different e-commerce platforms might categorize products differently. For instance, one platform might use “**Electronics** \> **Mobile Phones**,” while another might use “**Electronics** \> **Smartphones**.”**Variations in Product Attributes:** Attributes such as brand names, product specifications, and tags can differ across sources, leading to challenges in data integration and analysis.# Recommendation 1: Create a Reference Data DictionaryDevelop a comprehensive **reference data dictionary** that includes all possible **names** and **variations**. This dictionary will serve as the central repository for mapping different names to a **standardized** set of terms. Use **fuzzy** **matching** **techniques** during the data collection stage to ensure that similar terms from **different** **sources** are accurately matched to the standardized terms.# Recommendation 2: Use Image Detection and Classification TechniquesIn cases where **certain** **critical** **attributes**, such as the **generation** of a car model, are not always available from the sources, **image** **detection** and **classification** **techniques** can be employed to identify these characteristics. For instance, using **machine learning** models trained to **recognize** different car **makes**, **models**, and **generations** from **images** can help fill in the gaps when textual data is incomplete or inconsistent. This approach can dramatically **reduce** the amount of **manual** **work** and the need for constant updates to mappings, but it introduces complexity in the **architecture**, **increases** infrastructure **costs**, and can **decrease** **throughput**, **impacting** the **real-time** nature of the data.# Challenge: Implementing Monitoring and Alerting Systems# OverviewImplementing effective **monitoring** and **alerting** systems is **crucial** for maintaining the health and performance of a **web** **scraping** **system**. These systems help detect **issues** **early**, **reduce** **downtime**, and ensure that the data collection process runs smoothly. In the context of web scraping, monitoring and alerting systems need to address specific challenges such as **detecting** **changes** in **source** **websites**, **handling** **anti**\-**scraping** **measures**, and **maintaining** **data** **quality**.# ImpactWithout proper monitoring and alerting, issues can go unnoticed, leading to incomplete data collection, increased downtime, and potentially significant impacts on data-dependent applications. Effective monitoring ensures timely detection and resolution of problems, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the scraping system.# Recommendation: Real-Time Monitoring of Scraping ActivitiesImplement real-time monitoring to track the performance and status of your scraping system. Use tools and dashboards to visualize key metrics such as the number of successful requests, error rates, and data volume. This helps in quickly identifying issues as they occur.https://preview.redd.it/5nwszripbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afb2b969b74185d2fea25cbf3a3035a1e09910b6https://preview.redd.it/pfxjyvtsbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e07abd91acfc6aee485a9926207a032b135b97c# Funny Stories at the EndOur system scraped data continuously from different sources, making it highly sensitive to any downtime or changes in website accessibility. There were numerous instances where our scraping system detected that a website was down or not accessible from certain regions. Several times, our team contacted the support teams of these websites, informing them that “User X from Country Y” couldn’t access their site.In one memorable case, our automated alerts picked up an issue at 6 AM. The website of a popular car listing service was inaccessible from several European countries. We reached out to their support team, providing details of the downtime. The next morning, they thanked us for the heads-up and informed us that they had resolved the issue. It turned out we had notified them before any of their users did!# Final ThoughtsBuilding and maintaining a **web** **scraping** **system** is **not an easy task**. It requires dealing with **dynamic** **content**, **overcoming** sophisticated **anti**\-**scraping** **measures**, and **ensuring** high **data** **quality**. While it may seem naive to think that parsing data from various sources is straightforward, the reality involves constant vigilance and adaptation. Additionally, maintaining such a system can be costly, both in terms of infrastructure and the continuous effort needed to address the ever-evolving challenges.

1k05837,How do you handle datetime dimentions ?,mrkatatau,dataengineering,"I had a small “argument” at the office today. I am building a fact table to aggregate session metrics from our Google Analytics environment. One of the columns is the of course the session’s datetime. There are multiple reports and dashboards that do analysis at hour granularity. Ex : “What hour are visitors from this source more likely to buy hour product?”To address this, I creates a date and time dimention. Today, the Data Specialist had an argument with me and said this is suboptimal and a single timestamp dimention should have been created. I though this makes no sense since it would result in extreme redudancy : you would have multiple minute rows for a single day for example. Now I am questioning my skills as he is a specialist and teorically knows better.

1k0t6ua,Switching batch jobs to streaming,SnooAdvice7613,dataengineering,"Hi folks. My company is trying to switch some batch jobs to streaming. The current method is that the data are streaming data through Kafka, then there's a Spark streaming job that consumes the data and appends them to a raw table (with schema defined, so not 100% raw). Then we have some scheduled batch jobs (also Spark) that read data from the raw table, transform the data, load them into destination tables, and show them in the dashboards. We use Databricks for storage (Unity catalog) and compute (Spark), but use something else for dashboards.Now we are trying to switch these scheduled batch jobs into streaming, since the incoming data are already streaming anyway, why not make use of it and turn our dashboards into realtime. It makes sense from business perspective too.However, we've been facing some difficulty in rewriting the transformation jobs from batch to streaming. Turns out, Spark streaming doesn't support some imporant operations in batch. Here are a few that I've found so far:1. Spark streaming doesn't support window function (e.g. : ROW\_NUMBER() OVER (...)). Our batch transformations have a lot of these.2. Joining streaming dataframes is more complicated, as you have to deal with windows and watermarks (I guess this is important for dealing with unbounded data). So it breaks many joining logic in the batch jobs.3. Aggregations are also more complicated. For example you can't do this: raw\_df -> get aggregated df from raw\_df -> join aggregated\_df with raw\_dfSo far I have been working around these limitations by using Foreachbatch and using intermediary tables (Databricks delta table). However, I'm starting to question this approach, as the pipelines get more complicated.

1jzyxdw,How would you handle the ingestion of thousands of files ?,Heiwashika,dataengineering,"Hello,I’m facing a philosophical question at work and I can’t find an answer that would put my brain at ease. Basically we work with Databricks and Pyspark for ingestion and transformation.We have a new data provider that sends crypted and zipped files to an s3 bucket. There are a couple of thousands of files (2 years of historic).We wanted to use dataloader from databricks. It’s basically a spark stream that scans folders, finds the files that you never ingested (it keeps track in a table) and reads the new files only and write them.The problem is that dataloader doesn’t handle encrypted and zipped files (json files inside).We can’t unzip files permanently. My coworker proposed that we use the autoloader to find the files (that it can do) and in that spark stream use the for each batch method to apply a lambda that does:- get the file name (current row)-decrypt and unzip-hash the files (to avoid duplicates in case of failure)-open the unzipped file using spark-save in the final table using spark I argued that it’s not the right place to do all that and since it’s not the use case of autoloader it’s not a good practice, he argues that spark is distributed and that’s the only thing we care since it allows us to do what we need quickly even though it’s hard to debug (and we need to pass the s3 credentials to each executor using the lambda…)I proposed a homemade solution which isn’t the most optimal, but it seems better and easier to maintain which is:- use boto paginator to find files- decrypt and unzip each file - write then json in the team bucket/folder-create a monitoring table in which we save the file name, hash, status (ok/ko) and exceptions if there are anyHe argues that this is not efficient since it’ll only use one single node cluster and not parallelised. I never encountered such use case before and I’m kind of stuck, I read a lot of literature but everything seems very generic. Edit: we only receive 2 to 3 files daily per data feed (150mo per file on average) but we have 2 years of historical data which amounts to around 1000 files. So we need 1 run for all the historic then a daily run. Every feed ingested is a class instantiation (a job on a cluster with a config) so it doesn’t matter if we have 10 feeds. Edit2: 1000 files roughly summed to 130go after unzipping. Not sure of average zip/json file though. What do you people think of this?

1k1pl3y,"A databricks project, a tight deadline, and a PIP.",MyBossIsOnReddit,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering, I need your help to find a solution to my dumpster fire and potentially save a soul (or two)).I'm working together with an older dev who has been put on a project and it's a mess left behind by contractors. I noticed he's on some kind of PIP thing, and the project has a set deadline which is not realistic. It could be both of us are set up to fail. The code is the worst I have seen in my ten years in the field. No tests, no docs, a mix of prod and test, infra mixed with application code, a misunderstanding of how classes and scope work, etc.The project itself is a ""library"" that syncing databricks with data from an external source. We query the external source and insert data into databricks, and every once in a while query the source again for changes (for sake of discussion, lets assume these are page reads per user) which need to be done incrementally. We also frequently submit new jobs to the external source with the same project. what we ingest from the source is not a lot of data, usually under 1 million rows and rarely over 100k a day. Roughly 75% of the code is doing computation in python for databricks, where they first pull out the dataframe and then filter it down with python and spark. The remaining 25% is code to wrap the API on the external source. All code lives in databricks and is mostly vanilla python. It is called from a notebook. (...)My only idea is that the ""library"" should be split instead of having to do everything. The ingestion part of the source can be handled by dbt and we can make that work first. The part that holds the logic to manipulate the dataframes and submit new jobs to the external api is buggy and I feel it needs to be gradually rewritten, but we need to double the features to this part of the code base if we are to make the deadline. I'm already pushing back on the deadline and I'm pulling in another DE to work on this, but I am wondering what my technical approach should be.",20,0.86,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1pl3y/a_databricks_project_a_tight_deadline_and_a_pip/,2025-04-17 22:28:41,2025-04-19 01:25:06

Like I don’t see throughput write benchmark anywhere but I figure that rewriting the metadata files must be a big overhead if there’s a very large amount of files so inserting every times there’s a new one must not be the ideal solution.I’ve read some medium post saying that there was a snapshot feature which track new files so you don’t have to do some fancy things to load them incrementally.

1jyxdlb,ETL for Ingesting S3 files and converting to Iceberg,morpheas788,dataengineering,"So, I'm currently working on a project (my first) to create a scalable data platform for a company. The whole thing structured around AWS, initially using DMS to migrate PostgreSQL data to S3 in parquet format (this is our raw datalake). Then using Glue jobs to read this data and create Iceberg tables which would be used in Athena queries and Quicksight. I've got a working Glue script for reading this data and perform upsert operations. Okay so now that I've given a bit of context of what I'm trying to do, let me tell you my problem. The client wants me to schedule this job to run every 15min or so for staging and most probably every hour for production. The data in the raw datalake is partitioned by date (for example: s3bucket/table\_name/2025/04/10/file.parquet). Now that I have to run this job every 15 min or so I'm not sure how to keep track of the files that have been processed and which haven't. Currently my script finds the current time and modifies the read command to use just the folder for the current date. But still, this means that I'll be reading all the files in the folder (processed already or not) every time the job runs during the day. I've looked around and found that using DynamoDB for keeping track of the files would be my best option but also found something related to Iceberg metadata files that could help me with this. I'm leaning towards the Iceberg option as I wanna make use of all its features but have too little information regarding this to implement. would absolutely appreciate it if someone could help me out with this.

1jyve41,Event Sourcing as a creative tool for developers,No-Exam2934,dataengineering,"Hey, I think there are better use cases for event sourcing. Event sourcing is an architecture where you capture every change in your system as an immutable event, rather than just storing the latest state. Instead of only knowing what your data looks like now, you keep a full history of how it got there. In a simple crud app that would mean that every deleted, updated, and created entry is stored in your event source, that way when you replay your events you can recreate the state that the application was in at any given time.Most developers see event sourcing as a kind of technical safety net: - Recovering from failures - Rebuilding corrupted read models - AuditabilitySurviving schema changes without too much painAnd fair enough, replaying your event stream often feels like a stressful situation. Something broke, you need to fix it, and you’re crossing your fingers hoping everything rebuilds cleanly.What if replaying your event history wasn’t just for emergencies? What if it was a normal, everyday part of building your system?Instead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool — something you use to evolve your data models, improve your logic, and shape new views of your data over time. More excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.Your database stops being the single source of truth and instead becomes what it was always meant to be: a fast, convenient cache for your data, not the place where all your logic and assumptions are locked in.With a full event history, you’re free to experiment with new read models, adapt your data structures without fear, and shape your data exactly to fit new purposes — like enriching fields, backfilling values, or building dedicated models for AI consumption. Replay becomes not about fixing what broke, but about continuously improving what you’ve built.And this has big implications — especially when it comes to AI and MCP Servers.Most application databases aren’t built for natural language querying or AI-powered insights. Their schemas are designed for transactions, not for understanding. Data is spread across normalized tables, with relationships and assumptions baked deeply into the structure.But when you treat your event history as the source of truth, you can replay your events into purpose-built read models, specifically structured for AI consumption.Need flat, denormalized tables for efficient semantic search? Done. Want to create a user-centric view with pre-joined context for better prompts? Easy. You’re no longer limited by your application’s schema — you shape your data to fit exactly how your AI needs to consume it.And here’s where it gets really interesting: AI itself can help you explore your data history and discover what’s valuable.Instead of guessing which fields to include, you can use AI to interrogate your raw events, spot gaps, surface patterns, and guide you in designing smarter read models. It’s a feedback loop: your AI doesn’t just query your data — it helps you shape it.So instead of forcing your AI to wrestle with your transactional tables, you give it clean, dedicated models optimized for discovery, reasoning, and insight.And the best part? You can keep iterating. As your AI use cases evolve, you simply adjust your flows and replay your events to reshape your models — no migrations, no backfills, no re-engineering.",13,0.85,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jyve41/event_sourcing_as_a_creative_tool_for_developers/,2025-04-14 10:15:58,2025-04-19 01:25:06

Second, surrogate keys, they have to be globally unique across all the table because they will serve as primary keys, do you generate them in Spark (risk collisions across job runs) or use Redshift IDENTITY for example? Third, SCD Type 2: implement change detection in Spark (comparing new vs old records) or handle it in Redshift (with MERGE/triggers)? Would love to hear real-world experiences on what actually scales, especially for large dimensions (10M+ rows) - how do you balance the Spark vs Redshift work while keeping everything consistent?Last but not least I want to know how to ensure fact tables are properly pointing to dimension tables, do we fill the foreign key column in spark before loading to redshift?

I have a couple of concerns and would appreciate your thoughts:1. **Is using AI/LLMs a suitable approach for this problem?**2. **Can LLMs be fully reliable in these mappings, or is there a risk of incorrect matches?**3.

I wanted to share my proposed architecture and get your insights.1. The core components are: **Kafka:** Serving as the central nervous system for ingesting a massive amount of data reliably.2. **Go Processor:** A consumer application written in Go, placed directly after Kafka, to perform initial, low-latency processing and filtering of the incoming data.3. **Intermediate Queue (Redis Streams/NATS JetStream):** To decouple the low-latency processing from the potentially slower analytics and to provide buffering for data that needs further analysis.4. **Analytics Consumer:** Responsible for the more intensive analytical tasks on the filtered data from the queue.5. **WebSockets:** For pushing the processed insights to a frontend in real-time.The idea is to leverage Kafka's throughput capabilities while using Go for quick initial processing. The queue acts as a buffer and allows us to be selective about the data sent for deeper analytics. Finally, WebSockets provide the real-time link to the user.I built this keeping in mind these three principles* **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a specific responsibility.* **Scalability:** Kafka handles ingestion, and individual consumers can be scaled independently.* **Resilience:** The queue helps decouple processing stages.Has anyone implemented a similar architecture?

I don’t have any idea on such storage as they are not very mainstream. Any other suggestions here for storage ?

1k0rxxi,Criticism at work because my lack of understanding business requirements is coinciding with quick turnaround times,thro0away12,dataengineering,"Hi,I'm looking for sincere advice.I'm basically a data/analytics engineer. My tasks generally are like this1. put configurations so that the source dataset can ingest and preprocess into aws s3 in correct file format. I've noticed sometimes filepath names randomly change without warning which would cause configs to change so I would have to be cognizant of that. 2. the s3 output is then put into a mapping tool (which in my experience is super slow and frequently annoying to use) we have to map source -> our schema3. once you update things in the mapping tool, it SHOULD export automatically to S3 and show in production environment after refresh, which is usually. However, keyword should. There are times where my data didn't show up and it turned out I have to 'manually export' a file to S3 without being made aware beforehand which files require manual export and which ones occur automatically through our pipeline4. I then usually have to develop a SQL view that combines data from various sources for different purposesThe issues I'm facing lately....A colleague left end of last year and I've noticed that my workload has dramatically changed. I've been given tasks that I can only assume were once hers from another colleague. The thing is the tasks I'm given:1. Have zero documentation. I have no clue what the task is meant to accomplish2. I have very vague understanding of the source data 3. Just go off of an either previously completed script, which sometimes suffers from major issues (too many subqueries, thousands of lines of code). Try to realistically manage how/if to refactor vs. using same code and 'coming back to it later' if I have time constraints. After using similar code, randomly realize the requirements of old script changed b/c my data doesn't populate in which I have to ask my boss what the issue 4. Me and my boss have to navigate various excel sheets and communication to play 'guess work' as to what the requirements are so we can get something out 5. Review them with the colleague who assigned it to me who points out things are wrong OR randomly changes the requirements that causes me to make more changes and then expresses frustration 'this is unacceptable', 'this is getting delayed', 'I am getting frustrated' continuously that is making me uncomfortable in asking questions.I do not directly interact with the stakeholders. The colleague I just mentioned is the person who does and translates requirements back. I really, honestly have no clue what is going through the stakeholders mind or how they intend to use the product. All I frequently hear is that 'they are not happy', 'I am frustrated', 'this is too slow'. I am expected to get things out within few hours to 1-2 business days. This doesn't give me enough time to ensure if I made many mistakes in the process. I will take accountability that I have made some mistakes in this process by fixing things then not checking and ensuring things are as expected that caused further delays. Overall, I am under constant pressure to churn things out ASAP and I'm struggling to keep up and feel like many mistakes are a result of the pressure to do things fast.I have told my boss and colleague in detail (even wrote it up) that it would be helpful for me to: 1. just have 1-2 sentences as to what this project is trying to accomplish 2. better documentation. People have agreed with me but they have not really done much b/c everybody is too busy to document since once one project is done, I'm pulled into the next. I personally am observing a technical debt problem here, but I am new to my job and new to data engineering (was previously in a different analytics role) so I am trying to figure out if this is a me issue and where I can take accountability or this speaks to broader issues with my team and I should consider another job. I am honestly thinking about starting the job search again in a few months, but I am quite discouraged with my current experience and starting to notice signs of burnout.",5,0.78,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k0rxxi/criticism_at_work_because_my_lack_of/,2025-04-16 18:40:02,2025-04-19 01:25:06

1k0n177,migrating from No-Code middleware platform to another more fundamental tech stack,Comfortable_Onion318,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, we are a company that relies heavy on a so called no-code middleware that combines many different aspects of typical data engineering stuff into one big platform. However we have found ourselves (finally) in the situation that we need to migrate to a lets say more fundamental tech stack that relies more on knowledge about programming, databases and sql. I wanted to ask if someone has been in the same situation and what their experiences have been. Our only option right now is to migrate for business reasons and it will happen, the only question is what we are going to use and how we will use it. **Background:** We use this platform as our main ""engine"" or tool to map various business proccess. The platform includes creation and management of various kinds of ""connectors"" including Http, as2, mail, x400 and whatnot. You can then create profiles that can get fetch and transform data based on what comes in by one of the connectors and load the data directly into your database, create files or do whatever the business logic requires. The platform provides a comprehensive amount of logging and administration. In my honest opinion, that is quite a lot that this tool can offer. Does anyone know any kind of other tool that can do the same? I heard about Apache Airflow or Apache Nifi but only on the surface. The same platform we are using right now has another software solution for building database entities on top of its own database structure to create ""input masks"" for users to create, change or read data and also apply business logic. We use this tool to provide whole platforms and even ""build"" basic websites. What would be the best tech stack to migrate to if your goal was to cover all of the above? I mean there probably is not an all in one solution but that is not what we are looking for right now. If you said to me that for example apache nifi in combination with python would be enough to cover everything our middleware provided would be more than enough for me. What is essential for us is also a good logging capability. We need to make sure that whatever data flows are happening or have happended is comprehensible in case of errors or questions. For input masks and simple web platforms we are currently using C# Blazor and have multiple projects that are working very well, which we could also migrate to.",6,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k0n177/migrating_from_nocode_middleware_platform_to/,2025-04-16 15:20:42,2025-04-19 01:25:06

1k1p04c,Practical Implementation of Data Warehouses with Spark (and Redshift),Icy-Professor-1091,dataengineering,"Serious question to those who have done some data warehousing where Spark/Glue is the transformation engine, bonus if the data warehouse is Redshift.This is my first time putting a data warehouse in place, and , I am doing so with AWS Glue and Redshift. The data load is incremental.While in theory dimensional modeling ( star schemas to be exact ) is not hard, I am finding a hard time implementing the actual model.I want to know how are these dimensional modeling concepts are actually implemented, the following is my thoughts about how I understand some theoretical concepts and the way I find gaps between them and the actual practice.**Avoiding duplicates in both fact and dimension tables** –does this happen in the Spark job or Redshift itself? I feel like for transactional fact tables it is not a problem, but for dimensions, it is not straight forward: you need to insure uniqueness of entries for all the table not just the chunk you loaded during this run and this raises the above question, whether it is done in Spark, and in this case we will need to somehow load the dimension table in dataframes so that we can filter new data loads, or in redshidt, and in this case we just load everything new to Redshift and delegate upserts and duplication checks to Redshift. And speaking of uniqueness of entries in dimension tables ( I know it is getting long, bear with me, we are almost there xD) , we have to also allow exceptions, because when dealing with **SCD type 2,** we must allow duplicate entries and update the old ones to be depricated, so again how is this exception implemented practically? **Surrogate keys** – Generate in Spark (eg. UUIDs/hashes?) or rely on Redshift `IDENTITY` for example?Surrogate keys are going to serve as primary keys for both our fact and dimension tables, so they have to be unique, again do we generate them in Spark then load to, Redshift or do we just make Redshift handle these for us and not worry about uniqueness? **Fact-dim integrity** – Resolve FKs in Spark or after loading to Redshift?Another concern arises when talking about surrogate keys, each fact table has to point to its dimensions with FKs, which in reality will be the surrogate keys of the dimensions, so these columns need to be filled with the right values, I am wondering whether this is done in Spark, and in this case we will have to again load the dimensions from Redshift in Spark dataframes and extract the right values of FKs, or can this be done in Reshift????If you have any thoughts or insights please feel free to share them, litterally anything can help at this point xD",4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1p04c/practical_implementation_of_data_warehouses_with/,2025-04-17 22:02:05,2025-04-19 01:25:06

1jxtnkl,Having A Baby Helped Me Learn To Code,zakkmylde2000,learnprogramming,"Okay, so the title is probably the reason you clicked, and you’re probably thinking that I’m gonna say, “Having a kid motivated me to buckle down and study harder”, and while there’s probably some truth to that statement it’s not what I mean. Now, you don’t necessarily have to have a baby to do this. You could technically do it with anyone or anything, but for me it’s been my now 3 month old daughter.So, obviously children require a lot of attention, so she’s pretty much right by me anytime I’m not at work. She really enjoys just listening to me and her mother talk, and that gave me an idea to help keep her calm while I code. That idea was to just explain everything I’m working on as I do it to her. Building a database schema? I explain every step out loud to her. An API endpoint? Same thing. What I’ve realized in doing this is that I’m retaining information exponentially better than I was. There’s something about saying it all out loud, and pretending that I’m legitimately teaching her how to do what I’m working on, that has made learning and retaining information so much easier. So the moral is talk out loud about what you’re doing. Explain it to your dog, your significant other (if they’re willing to listen), your cat, goldfish, child, or whatever/whoever you have that will listen.

1k1my17,"Why are API keys shown only once, just when generated?",sir_kokabi,learnprogramming,"Many platforms only display API keys once, forcing the user to regenerate if lost. This is often justified vaguely as a ""security measure."" But what is the *actual security threat* being mitigated by hiding the key from the legitimate, authenticated owner?If an attacker gains access to the dashboard, they can revoke or generate new keys anyway—so not showing the old key doesn't protect you from a compromised account. And if the account isn’t compromised, why can’t the rightful owner see the key again?Moreover, some major platforms like Google still allow users to view and copy API keys multiple times. So clearly, it's *not* an industry-wide best practice.Is this practice really about security, or is it just risk management and legal liability mitigation? If hiding the key is purely to protect from insiders or accidental leaks, isn't that a weak argument—especially considering that most providers let you revoke/regenerate keys at will?So what *real* security benefit does hiding an API key from its owner provide—if any? Or is this just theater?Edit 1 -----------------**Please also address this point in your responses:**If this is truly a security issue, then why does a company like **Google** — certainly not a small or inexperienced player — allow the **API key for its Gemini product** (used by millions of people) to be displayed openly and copied multiple times in **Google AI Studio**?This is not some niche tool with a limited user base, nor is Google unfamiliar with security best practices. It's hard to believe that a company of Google's scale and expertise would make such a fundamental mistake — especially on a product as widely used and high-profile as Gemini.If showing the API key multiple times were truly a critical security flaw, it’s reasonable to assume Google would have addressed it.

Listen, I’m not exactly over here worrying about what other people are thinking when I’m busy with my own stuff, but I have always taken an interest in psychology and I’m curious about this.Isn’t the goal of a lot of programming to be able to accomplish complex things more easily? If what I’m making has no requirement for being extremely fast, why should I choose to use C++ just because it’s “real programming”? Isn’t that sort of self defeating? A hatchet isn’t a REAL axe, but sometimes you only need a hatchet, and a real axe is overkill.Shouldn’t we welcome something that allows us to more quickly get our ideas out into the screen? It isn’t like any sort of coding is truly uncomplicated; people who don’t know how to code look at what I make as though I’m a wizard. So it’s just this weird value on complication that’s only found among people that do the very most complicated types of coding.But then also, the more I talk to the rockstar senior devs, the more I realize that they all have my view; the more they know, the more they value just using the best tool for the job, not the most complex one.",151,0.86,190,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jxjt0v/does_is_actually_matter_that_python_is_a_simple/,2025-04-12 15:26:39,2025-04-19 01:25:07

Most of the time, I'm looking through tutorials and StackOverflow forums to get by some programs, but I feel like a fraud who hasn't learned anything and is wasting his money.Any tips or tricks? I'm failing my exams left and right because of my lack of knowledge and understanding (or memory, I guess?). Even on work like LeetCode, I still need tutorials to understand things. Am I not working hard enough to remember or deal with programming? I look at my colleagues, and they're all doing solo programming without any googling or anything, and it makes me feel dumb. Just a bit worried, cause I feel as though I've wasted my entire life trying to go into this expensive university and to study the degree I've always wanted to study, just for me to feel incredibly held back.

1k0jgqs,"Tip: Read the comments in StackOverflow, seriously",CodeAndChaos,learnprogramming,"(TLDR at the end) I think this is often seriously overlooked and not discussed enough as a learning resource, but the StackOverflow comments are usually a great resource for learning. They are used as a place for the users to address and discuss more about the question, since the answers have to be used more to directly answer the question.When you see a StackOverflow question, instead of simply going for the top-rated answer and closing the page, also take a look at the comments, people generally discuss more intrinsically about the proposed solution, like more why it works, the possible drawbacks, etc. The comments may even have a better solution for cases where, for example, the answer is out of date. These discussions generally lead to you having a better understanding of the technology, concepts, language or whatever it is you are looking for.And you can also make questions in the comments! IMO, the comments are the place for the ""simpler"" questions people generally say are pushed back in StackOverflow, as there is generally no pressure to make good and structured questions.Also, a bit out of the topic here, but please also take a look at the answers other than the accepted or top-rated ones, they could bring solutions that are more up to date or fit better your scenario.TLDR: StackOverflow comments provides many insights about the questions and answers, being a great place to look for discussions and learn more about the resource, also for asking ""simpler"" questions (also look at answers other than the accepted or top-rated ones).",39,0.8,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k0jgqs/tip_read_the_comments_in_stackoverflow_seriously/,2025-04-16 12:42:33,2025-04-19 01:25:07

In that regard, I'm having trouble discerning if it's ethical to have the password be encrypted server-side (and saving all its hashing parameters in the server, given that in theory nobody but the admins should ever see the data) or have it hashed client-side, preventing the server to ever touch the sensitive data but rendering the data absolutely obscured even to the people moderating the servers. The idea is that the administrators of each server node get access to all the data regarding a user when the user gets suspended for infringing the TOS so that they may investigate the user's activity to sus out if they actually broke any rules.

When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree. Getting into such a well-known company so early on felt like a huge win, and in a way, it was. It’s the kind of name that looks amazing on a resume. The salary is really good for an intern, especially considering my financial background, and if I’m lucky enough to stay as a full-time employee, it would make a huge difference in my life financially.But the reality inside hasn’t been as exciting as it looked from the outside. From the beginning, I felt completely out of place. I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. My team has been very distant, and over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. It’s like I’m invisible. It makes me feel like all my efforts to grow or connect just don’t matter.On top of that, the pressure is intense. Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience. There’s little to no feedback or support, just the expectation to perform. And honestly? It’s draining. I get home with no motivation to study, no energy to try, and I’ve even caught myself wondering if I should just cheat on exams to get through. I hate that it’s come to this.Lately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe. But then I feel guilty for even thinking that. The money I make now matters. Staying at this company would open doors. And walking away kind of hurts my ego too—it feels like I’d be “downgrading,” like I couldn’t handle it. But at the same time… what’s the cost of staying? I already feel the early signs of burnout. I’m constantly stressed, anxious, and losing the passion I once had for this field. What if staying just ruins my mental health long-term?I don’t know. I want to give IT a fair chance because I’ve already changed areas once and I don’t want to give up again.

Currently a few weeks into a software engineering program and find myself going through so many emotions every day; however, what a fun task it is to create something.As a career salesman and ops manager, I was never afforded the opportunity to create and was always just pushing others products. For the first time in my life, I am having to exercise a part of my brain to utilize creativity to not only build the model of what I want to create but also to problem solve as that is what great engineers do. It is fascinating to me to see how people are viewing AI as either a godsend or a hinderance to their progress. I guess I see it from both sides and also realized that which one it was ultimately came down to how I used the technology. Whether we are talking about ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, cursor ide, etc. these AI's are doing exactly what we are asking it to do. If you do not like the technology; are you giving it limitations like ""only provide me a hint or clue"" to the method or function that isn't working or do you let it return fixed code.

I used to be an electronic engineer, an innovation consultant, a startup founder, and so on. (A successful loser, indeed, but whatever). Now, in my 50's, I need to start again with another career. It happens when you live in Italy, and you are blocked outside of metropolitan zone, but well it is shit you don't really interested...

Some past experience in some languages, but i never put myself into a correct routine to become able to produce something useful. In the last months I've decided to invest some time to make a step over on my developing learning. Idea was to be able enough to make some MVPs for my startup projects. Now the question: I'm start with Ruby/Rails, for convenience: basic knowledge of language, monolith structure that is useful when you are building prototypes, some magic for a quick write and go. But Ruby is not an used language. If i look on Linkedin, there are near to zero opportunities for rubyists and less than zero network potentiality. I suppose that I will never find another developer in 200Km range around me, for some collaboration if I need.

Another thought is that reading SICP first might give me a conceptual overview, helping me appreciate the details in CS:APP when I encounter them later.This feels like the same kind of dilemma as:* Should I learn C or Python first?* Should I learn assembly or C first?Sometimes, starting with the lower level is better — like in the case of ""C vs. Python."" But other times, starting with the higher level is better — like in the case of ""Assembly vs. C."" Only those who are already familiar know which approach is better.

The function checks to see if the value is within a certain range, and returns a value based on the range the input value falls within: int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) { if (x >= 0 && x < 32) return 0; else if (x >= 32 && x < 64) return 1; else if (x >= 64 && x < 96) return 2; else if (x >= 96 && x < 128) return 3; else if (x >= 128 && x < 160) return 4; else if (x >= 160 && x < 192) return 5; else if (x >= 192 && x < 224) return 6; else if (x >= 224 && x < 256) return 7; else return -1; // Out of range }You see, theoretically there's an equal chance for an arbitrary number to fall within any of these ranges.Now the challenging part. I want to be able to control the values within the parentheses using a single parameter (for the sake of illustration, imagine a physical knob), where the knob in the center evenly distributes the chance, as above. Then, turning it all the way to the left results in the first statement having a 100% chance in returning 0, like: int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) { if (x >= 0 && x < 256) return 0; else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 1; else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 2; else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 3; else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 4; else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 5; else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 6; else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 7; else return -1; // Out of range }And turning it all the way to the right results in a 100% chance of returning 7, like: int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) { if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 0; else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 1; else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 2; else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 3; else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 4; else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 5; else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 6; else if (x >= 0 && x < 256) return 7; else return -1; // Out of range }But I want to also be able to have our hypothetical 'knob' to values between the center and extremes shown above, and have the value be 'weighted' accordingly. I have no idea how to implement this and though to ask here.Thanks in advance for any advice. Appreciated.

Turns out this is **way harder** than it should be.I went through it all:* `pyautogui`? Moves the mouse — nope.* `SendInput`? Requires the window to be focused — nope.* `PostMessage`? Doesn’t register for most real applications — nope.* `SendMessage`? **Surprisingly works**, *if* you do it right.After lots of trial and error, here’s what finally did it — this will send a click to a background window, silently, with no interruption: import win32api, win32con, win32gui import logging def click(x, y): try: hwnd = win32gui.FindWindow(None, ""Name of Your Window Here"") if not hwnd: logging.error(""Target window not found!"") return lParam = win32api.MAKELONG(x, y) # This line is super important — many windows only respond to clicks on child controls hWnd1 = win32gui.FindWindowEx(hwnd, None, None, None) win32gui.SendMessage(hWnd1, win32con.WM_LBUTTONDOWN, win32con.MK_LBUTTON, lParam) win32gui.SendMessage(hWnd1, win32con.WM_LBUTTONUP, None, lParam) except Exception as e: logging.error(f""Click failed: {e}""):light_bulb: **Key takeaway**: `FindWindowEx` makes a huge difference. Lots of applications won't respond to `SendMessage` unless you're targeting a child control. If you just send to the top-level window, nothing happens.# Why this mattersThere are **dozens** of threads asking this same thing going back years, and almost none of them have a clear solution. Most suggestions either don’t work or only work in very specific conditions. This one works reliably for background windows that accept `SendMessage` events.# Search terms & tags for folks looking later:* python click background window without focus* send mouse input without moving mouse* python click off-screen window* send click to window while minimized or unfocused* background automation win32gui SendMessage* click in background window win32 python* control window in background without focusHope this saves you hours of suffering.**""Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably.

1jzfi5j,Tech was supposed to be the dream. Now it feels like a trap,immortalghost92,cscareerquestions,"Before I got into tech, I was one of those people who thought, “Oh, you work with computers? And you can do it remote? Sign me up.” It sounded like the ideal setup,, good money, flexible lifestyle, interesting work. But the reality? A whole different beast.First, just learning my job was a battle. Senior folks gatekeeping knowledge, no clear training, just figuring things out on my own through trial, error, and stress. It took way longer than it should’ve and left me constantly feeling like I was behind.Then I climbed the ladder. On paper, that sounds like a win,,, but every role I left was on the verge of collapsing. I’d move up, get more money, but also inherit more chaos. Now I make decent money, but it comes with a nonstop stream of incidents, rollbacks, escalations, and worst of all: on-call. There’s no break. No peace. I’m always on edge, waiting for the next fire.Meanwhile, my friends outside of tech? They seem so much lighter. Sure, they’ve got problems like everyone else,,, but they’re not mentally trapped in their jobs 24/7. Me? This job has consumed my life. Even when I’m off, I’m not really off. I’m checking alerts, dreading pings, and thinking about what might break next.And to make things worse, every company wants people with 10+ years of experience, and offshore teams are replacing roles left and right. It’s harder than ever to pivot or even find a quieter tech job.Honestly? I’m at the point where I just want a normal job. One where I show up, do what I’m supposed to do, and then go live my damn life.Btw I worked have real jobs before i don’t understand why folks just quick to assume it’s just been tech. I worked construction for years so I know what it’s like I’m just saying I wish I had a role to mentally clock out of like normal roles. Sorry for the rant but damn I’m just burnt out.

1jy901d,Wow y'all were right... (Referrals),Tiny_Succotash_5276,cscareerquestions,"As many of you know the summer 25 internship is coming to an end. The vast majority of ppl who have an internship lined up have probably had it secured for a while now and the closer we approach the summer, the harder it is for ppl without an internship to land one. Anyway here's where I enter. Im a Junior cs major at a t50 school, with an average/slightly below average gpa, and no past internship experience apart from personal projects on my resume(nothing to write home about). I started seriously applying on jan 1st applying to maybe 5-10 places as daily as I could. a variety of roles too (frontend,backend, fullstack, ML, and data science) for the most part id get ghosted, receive an automated follow up email 3 weeks later saying they went with another candidate, or if I was lucky get a aysnchronous hackerank coding assessment in which id get ghosted after. I try tweaking my resume a bit, test out different formats and even fluffing up a bit of my projects in an attempt to get any response. Obviously this is a common experience for many ppl here but I keep at it all the way from then till now with maybe only getting 3 actual 1:1 interviews. At this point summer Is approaching and I have no idea what I can really do on my end. I hear on reddit,tiktok and pretty much everywhere that one of the best ways to get your foot in the door is through a referral however, I had none. I tried reaching out to recruiters, but I barely got a response this late in the cycle. Anyway I happen to stumble on one of my childhood friends linkdin page and see that he got a recommendation from the chief officer of the company he intered at the summer before so I hit him up and ask him about it. He encourages me to send him an email. So I find his company email and send him a connect request pretty much stating that I was a good friend of the person he gave the recommendation to and asking if their company was still accepting interns attaching my resume and if we could schedule a time to call. Within 2 days he replies saying that ""any friend of (friends-name) is a friend of mine"", that I had a solid mix of skills on my resume, and that he was going to check if there are any project/internship openings for me to do. Fast forward to the call, I did some quick prep on reviewing my resume and the company. He was a super nice guy, asked me some questions about my resume, what the job entails, and just overall a chill conversation abt who I was and my skills. i didn't have to do any leetcode style technical interview and I essentially bypassed the whole ""traditional process in a sense"". So yeah I knew connections were important within the work force and adult life but holy shit this was one of those eye opener moments cause I didn't realize how powerful it could be.TLDR: average cs student struggles to land an internship let alone even hear back from companies but uses an unrealized connection to bypass the ""traditional"" interview process and land the job",632,0.95,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jy901d/wow_yall_were_right_referrals/,2025-04-13 14:32:55,2025-04-19 01:25:08

1jxv1dg,"Formal written HR warning by manager after 2 ""failed"" sprints, been at this startup for 1.5 months",Neurprise,cscareerquestions,"I recently joined this startup near the middle/end of February for a new backend team they were building for a new product. At the same time as me joined a manager, older guy who's worked in startups for 20 years, as well as a coworker who worked at a big tech company.After two ""failed"" sprints, I had a 1:1 yesterday, as we usually do weekly on Fridays, and he basically told me that he had performance concerns about me and that I need to improve for the next sprint or two or ""things will get messy (implying termination)."" Soon after the conversation, he and HR send me a letter I had to sign essentially saying what he said in the call. Some details on the situation:- He said that in all his 20 years of working for startups, not once has he failed a sprint (and he defined failing one as not having any tickets roll over to the next sprint), yet since we started, he has failed every single one (when we first started, there was one ticket that blocked us and it rolled over, and he considered that a failure and wrote a big email about how he's sorry he failed). - Manager comes from a culture that emphasizes working long hours. Now I come from the same culture (I'm sure you can guess what it is) but I was born here instead so I don't have the same sort of expectations as he does.- Coworker is an overachiever who has spent considerable time at a big tech and brought a super convoluted [microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ) architecture that is very difficult to grasp. The way it's set up, you essentially can't even fully run it locally as it uses dev containers and there's some issue with the ports overlapping when you try to work on multiple services at once, and you also essentially need one IDE window open for each service as they're all in different repos of course. He has so many PRs, it's even hard to follow for me to be productive, so, to be fair, I'm not as productive as I could be, but it's more me not being able to deal with this overcomplicated codebase. Since joining only 1.5 months ago, there was essentially no ramp up period for me to learn the new codebase and architecture that the overachieving coworker built in a week.- Together they essentially work at all hours of the day, most recently they were working at 10 pm working on some issue and I saw the Slack conversation only once I opened my laptop the next day. The manager during one of the standup calls said he was up around 5 or 6 am from the night before trying to debug some build issue.- I was dealing with a longer running illness and took 2 sick days a few weeks ago and then 2 earlier this week. The coworker took over my tickets that I had in progress and just finished them himself.- Manager said they are dealing with deadlines imposed on them from above, wanting to get a full backend and frontend MVP out by the end of next month, so it seems some of this stuff is him trying to deflect issues onto performance concerns on me, but funnily enough we have a separate frontend team and they seem a lot more chill, they essentially haven't done much as the designs themselves have not been finalized.The multi-page letter itself essentially mentioned some of these points and implied that I didn't work on enough tickets last sprint and none this sprint (due to coworker finishing them) and said that while they understood I had an illness, I essentially should have completed them by the end of the sprint anyway. The letter literally had a *day-by-day* account of every day of the sprints that I had failed to finish a ticket and that I should have communicated what I was doing that day. Never in my professional life had I seen such minute detail and I honestly don't know how the manager spent so much of their own time to draft this up. At the end of this section, he essentially implied that I lied about what I was doing every day and it said ""dishonesty is not tolerated at this company.""I brought up all of these sorts of concerns (overachieving coworker, hard to grasp codebase, illness) multiple times to my manager previously in 1:1s and he kinda acted like he sympathized but essentially said tough shit you gotta finish your work (like he acted nice in the video call and said it diplomatically but then on the letter it was harshly worded).At the end, the manager said that I should think about all this over the weekend and give it a ""fresh start"" on Monday, implying improving massively over the next few weeks. Is this essentially a PIP? Should I actually try working on this or start looking for new roles? Problem is this role pays quite well, at least 15% higher than other roles I've been seeing in the market so wondering if that's worth it or not (or maybe they'll just fire me anyway after a month).",528,0.96,301,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxv1dg/formal_written_hr_warning_by_manager_after_2/,2025-04-13 00:05:31,2025-04-19 01:25:08

Probably 15-20 minutes to even understand the requirements in their entirety. Tons of test cases and 10+ files.Q5: Angular problem with a whole page of requirements that would take 15-20 minutes to even fully grasp what is being asked. Also tons of requirements.I knocked out the LC and SQL pretty fast. Got most of the Node problem done but it kept failing test cases and I was triyng to debug but there were SOOO many requirements. It was hard to even understand it in it's entirety. Then it just reset my entire Node code for some reason and I just closed the assessment out of pure frustration at that point.

The tech job market’s brutal right now—rejections are constant, ghosting is common, and it’s easy to feel like you're just another resume in a pile.A few weeks ago, I was contacted by a recruiter for a senior level role. They submitted me, and two days later I had the interview. I came in straightforward—no fluff, no buzzwords—just real experience and direct answers.A couple days later, the recruiter reached out to give me the feedback call. They said:>**Bad news?** I didn’t get the job. **Good news?** I made such a strong impression that the manager wanted to bring me on anyway—**in a completely new position that didn’t exist.**They literally created a new **role**, adjacent to the original one I applied for, just to bring me in.

1jxczax,Is stack overflow headed for extinction?,wbcm,cscareerquestions,"I used to be active on SO around 10 years ago and it was generally great, mostly helpful and insightful but only a little rough around the edges. Fast forward to the last month and I started being active there again and... using it over the last month has been a dumpster fire. It really feels like the point of the site has gone from providing answers/solutions to being more of a game of clout and academic trivialities. After really reviewing the current rules of the site and the culture that has formed on it, it seems like SO is trying to extinct itself. There are two big problems I see.1: The culture is designed and empowered to be horribleComing back to answering questions after so many years I was really surprised to see the same one or two dozen people across nearly everything I was answering. The small group of power users or moderators have an uncanny ability to be posting or editing things on there all day. They also seem to be the ones who are more eager to downvote answers or close questions with little regard for the community, or even following the conversations. The way the points system works basically means that you cannot interact with anything in the community until amassing a lot of points, which is normally gate-kept by these power users. Other people can also upvote your posts, but in order to get the ability to upvote it seems like newer users have to endure a lot of bullying to get there, if they get there at all. If you are new and get a couple downvotes on your posts you are not allowed to post anything again until your existing posts get more upvotes, but there is no robust way for that to organically happen in most of the site that only sees under a 100 views per question. This has created a weird vacuum where the power users kind of have the ability to knight newer users or essentially permanently disable newer user's accounts. On top of this, the culture seems to really prize putting people (and their questions and answers) down. The first couple of times someone would leave a single sentence comment on my answer basically saying ""you're wrong"", I was more eager to engage with it to see what I was missing. Over time the majority of such engagements turned out to be someone who would continue to say ""you're wrong"" but not want to elaborate, or missing understanding on the question/answer that was relevant. Over time, I realized that this was just the culture that is there. Unsurprisingly, I have began to recognize certain power users usernames and saw them bullying newer people in the questions and answers. This is alienating a huge group of people who are either new to programming and SO, or are experienced programmers that are new to SO. AKA, not many new people want to stay on the site. This massively reflects in the lowering number of questions coming in and the speed in which they are answered. This is only worsened by the expanding prevalence of LLMs. It is hard to see the next generation of programmers preferring the high likelihood of waiting a long time to be bullied on SO, vs an LLM who can instantly offer any type of information for your question and will not be toxic. 2: [duplicate] It is good to not let a question get asked for the millionth time in a row, but I saw so many questions that were immediately closed as duplicates and the provided duplicates were either many years out of date or only partially related. At a certain point all the programming questions that people can ask, will have been asked... unless new programming languages or software versions allow for substantively new questions to be asked. There was no good globally centralized place to ask programming questions before SO, and so there was at least 30 years of programming questions that needed to be satiated. As time goes on, more and more questions will either legitimately be duplicates or, more likely, a mod is gonna mark it as duplicate since one part of the question overlaps with one part of another that was asked since the inception of SO. At this point, SO reads more like an encyclopedia than a lively place of discourse. Take somewhere like reddit, quora, or even the comment section of a youtube video where you are learning something, these all feel like they are much more engaging and are great places to connect and ask questions. SO on the other had feels like a good place to get your question turned away. Talking to some newer programmers I know, they have a shared sentiment that SO is a bad place to ask questions and prefer reddit and LLMs instead. There seemed to be a shared experience between all of them that any time they google a question that SO is often towards the top, which exposed them to it often, but when they made accounts and started trying to be active there they were met with bad experiences. This kind of reinforces the feeling like SO is heading towards being an encyclopedia/ghost town rather than a community. In any case, these are just my loose thoughts around being active on SO after having not been after almost a decade. I used to remember it as being a great place and have just generally been surprised about how dumb and toxic it feels to be on there now. Do other people feel this way? Or did I somehow just jump back into the wrong parts of it?",183,0.91,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxczax/is_stack_overflow_headed_for_extinction/,2025-04-12 08:52:59,2025-04-19 01:25:08

1k2dn78,"Engineer started my coding challenge timer 5 mins early, abruptly ended call for going THREE min over.",ThrowRADisgruntledF,cscareerquestions,"This is more of a vent but I had an absolutely ridiculous candidate screening experience. The funny thing is, it started off really well! I have 8 YOE and this was for a senior level position. The screener and I were vibing, I was nailing the technical questions. Then it was time for the coding challenge: screener emailed instructions, said I’d have 20 mins, and promised to give me a 10 min warning and a warning before time was up. This was literally the easiest coding challenge I've ever seen in a candidate screening. I shared my screen, clarified instructions before starting, and was ready to go.Right then, the screener's mic died. We spent about 5 mins troubleshooting, he left/rejoined, I left/rejoined, he even got new AirPods. Finally, audio fixed, I started the challenge.I created a folder and three files via command line, pasted some boilerplate HTML/CSS, did a quick google search (allowed per instructions) and found my answer immediately, right then I'm told there's 10 mins left. I briefly thought ""there is no way that took 10 mins"" but moved on. I finished the minimum requirements shortly after, confirmed out loud it met the spec and that I was effectively done. He hadn't indicated time running out, so I asked if I should adjust CSS to make the output more visible, he said ""sure,"" so I did. Still hadn’t announced time, so I ask “do you want me to keep going?” he shrugs lol. Eventually, I asked explicitly if there were edge cases or another part to the coding challenge bc he was making no verbal indications of anything, he said no and asked me to email my code.I'm super stoked because I know I just nailed that challenge, until he abruptly says he's ending the screening early because I went THREE MINUTES OVER and asks if I have any questions. So I asked if I’d missed a requirement, how long candidates are expected to take (the full 20 mins), if I missed an edge case, etc. Nothing was amiss. So why? Because I went ***three*** minutes over and he didn’t think I would be able to complete the virtual onsite (the next round) in time lmao.After the call (feeling completely demoralized by the cold ending), I checked the timestamps of when he sent the instructions and when I emailed my code. Only 21 mins in between each email, meaning I didn't actually go over, he likely started the timer early due to HIS mic issues. So I sent a polite, non accusatory follow up email letting him know this because he may have not realized and cc’ed the recruiter. No response, I was ghosted.I get that companies owe candidates nothing, but asking for 40+ hours upfront for a take home project (I did not spend 40 hours on mine, and I also will never do one again bc of this experience) then rejecting over something so trivial is absurd. Even if I had gone over, I aced that screening. I double checked my work after, sent it to ChatGPT, it was solid. Also, again, literally the easiest challenge I’ve ever done and pretty insulting to be told I failed it.I probably dodged a bullet, but still needed to vent. Has anyone else experienced a completely bullshit screening like this?",151,0.91,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k2dn78/engineer_started_my_coding_challenge_timer_5_mins/,2025-04-18 19:39:15,2025-04-19 01:25:08

1k09ncr,The hierarchy of employment and how AI affects your job,The-_Captain,cscareerquestions,"**tldr;** my 2¢ on how to think about AI with respect to job security - own projects, not tasks**Background:** I'm a senior software engineer with 7 years of experience, including fintech, big tech, and early-stage startups. I'm currently bootstrapping a lifestyle-sized small software product for SMBs. **Point of this post:** I'm giving my two cents about how to think of your career in software and whether it is at risk from AI.**Part 1: the hierarchy of employment**I think of all jobs, including in software, as falling into three categories:1. Task-oriented: your day-to-day revolves around completing tasks assigned to you. If you're working at a cafe, that might mean ""clean the tables"" or ""make coffee."" If you're a SWE, that might mean ""change the button color palette from blues to purples according to the design system."" Being good at this means you're known for clearing Jira queues quickly and nobody has to clean up after you or redo work you said you did.2. Project-oriented: you're given projects to complete but the details and methods are up to you. If you're working at a cafe, it could be ""make sure the pastries are refreshed every two hours."" If you're a software engineer, it could be ""implement the new design system."" Being good at this means you can be trusted to deliver a feature that may have multiple ways of completing it while balancing trade-offs, on time. This often requires delegation. I'm at this level right now.3. Outcome-oriented: you own an outcome. That's often quantified in terms of money or a money-adjacent metric. If you're at a cafe, it can be increasing the number of baked goods sold with coffee orders. If you're in software (you may not be actively coding at this level), it may be ""increase conversions from large enterprise clients on the landing page."" Being good at this means being known as someone who can make products grow revenue and/or profit. I'm upgrading to this level by bootstrapping a business - even if I fail, I will have owned an outcome.In both coffee and software examples, notice that these are different roles on the same project. Notice also that I focus on ""being known as,"" which is the most important thing in career stability and progression.Almost everyone typically starts on level 1. It's unusual and incredibly risky to stay at level 1, and you have to be constantly adapting and learning new technologies to pull it off. You want to graduate to level 2 as soon as possible**,** ideally within 2 years. Few people make it to level 3, it's normally OK to stay at level 2. Level 2 makes more than level 1 within the same company/skillset (of course a PM at Walmart might make less than an AI engineer at OpenAI). Level 3 has unbounded pay. **How to move levels**I am by no means a great authority on getting promoted, I tend to get distracted and chase my own goals. But from talking to people who are good at it, there are two things you need to do:1. Be really good at your current job band: if you're level 1, your manager knows that when they give you a task, it will be done when you say it will be done, it will be done to the highest reasonable standards, and nobody is going to have to clean up after you.2. Know your manager's goals and align your work to them. Find ways to make them look better and achieve their goals. Show you care.Of course, there are more cynical factors, like being liked and having a good attitude. Finally, your self-conception is important. If you think of yourself as ""a guy who makes Spring Boot apps"" you'll be stuck in level 1 longer than if you think of yourself as ""a guy who delivers backend services."" PG has a great essay about keeping your self-characterization loose but I can't find it right now. **Part 2: What AI means for you**AI is decently good at doing a lot of level 1 work. If you counted on being the gatekeeper of button colors as the reason for why you can't be fired, that's not going to work anymore. In fact, if you counted on being the gatekeeper of anything, that's unlikely to keep working. That being said, level 1 is always risky. If you were a really good JQuery developer who could complete any task in that language, the rise of frameworks like React threatened your job. Not right away as your company might need you for their existing code, but the reduced demand for JQuery devs would lessen your bargaining power and the increased support and flood of React developers would make switching stacks increasingly attractive to your employer. Any major technology shift is a threat to level 1 operators.The difference with AI, however, is that it's happening across all technologies at once. The goal is what's being automated, not just the method. AI can write basic software in any language. You can't switch from owning button colors in JQuery to owning button colors in React or whatever the next tech is, you have to upgrade what you can deliver.There are tasks that AI can't do because it's not smart enough. If you're a staff engineer working on very complex problems you might be fine, but if you're part of the 90% that do various versions of the same thing that everyone else does, your job is at risk once the Devins of the world nail their product and user experience.The good news is that it's also a resource that you can use:1. If you're currently task-oriented, use AI to be really good at completing tasks fast and well. Do this by focusing on the ""well."" AI is already really fast compared to you, so don't try to go faster. Plan first, think what kind of testing you need, both automated and manual, and what the deployment story will look like2. Now that you know the hierarchy of employment, focus on graduating to the next band by understanding the context in which you're given tasks, talking to your lead, and making their project happen faster and better**Why AI is not a threat to bands 2 and 3**Owning a project requires taste. AI doesn't have taste yet, and I doubt it will develop it. The main difference between owning tasks and owning a project is thinking through tradeoffs, understanding how this project fits and what its goals are, and making a plan that aligns the tradeoffs with the goals. AI can be very helpful as an assistant in doing this, but it requires the person doing it to already know what the options are and what the goals are. This is not the case for basic feature development.Level 3 is safe first because it's the decision makers who aren't going to fire themselves, and second because it requires even more intuition and experience than AI has access to. More importantly, it requires accountability, which is one of the main barriers to using AI.",53,0.85,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k09ncr/the_hierarchy_of_employment_and_how_ai_affects/,2025-04-16 02:20:30,2025-04-19 01:25:08

1jxldo8,"Got offer recently, here what you can expect at a Senior level",Idiot_Pianist,cscareerquestions,"I've been interviewing for a while now, mostly out of curiosity. I rarely send direct applications so it's all outreach. The out-reaches for which I was unqualified ended quickly, the others ended up to 2 position or offer. I am not decided to accept or not at this time.I am doing this post because I see all of you focusing on coding, and mainly on coding aspects that are irrelevant to the job. A job is the software industry is much more than that.Here is some feedback for those who are curious:* I had no Leetcode at any point. I had a few home assignments which could be considered Leetcode Easy. Do not underestimate them. An assignment should be treated as a full scale project that will go into production. They could ask you to design a function that adds two numbers, the point is not here. Focus on: * Write your requirements and assumptions in a document * Make sure the project is usable out of the box. If setup is required describe it: if they ask you to develop in Python, make sure to package it using Poetry/Uv or whatever you want but simply shipping the function is not acceptable * Write clear code, respect conventions, take care of the architecture, think about the user * Be consistent in all aspects: in documentation, and in coding. Example: Don't separate somes lines by a ',', some others by a '.' and others by nothing. Chose one and stick to it * Document your code: do not comment it, code should be self explanatory, if its not rework it, write actual Doxygen/XML documentation or whatever is the standard for the targeted langage * Provide a unit test suite * If you have time, showcase your project by integrating it into Github CI or Equivalent * OA are an occasion to showcase your work practices and general knowledge, the problem itself is irrelevant, don't focus on it too much* SD interview: had my first and only SD interview and passed. Your design is not important at all, providing you are not proposing absurd solutions. Focus on: * Communicating. Explore all possibilities, even the obviously dumb ones, but CRITICIZE them. What's expected from an engineer is not someone who has an answer to everything but someone who can think, is creative, and is then capable of weeding out their ideas * Always clarify functional and non-functional requirements. You are in control, make sure to select a sub-set of functional requirements that works good for you and is easy to design. Mention the more complex requirements and just state you won't take them into account. For instance, if they ask you do design a messaging app, focus on 1:1 conversations, emojis, read recipes and files exchange. You may want to discuss group messaging to show-off. Don't. Mention it, don't design it * QPS values are not important. Once again it's all about thought process. The number themselves are irrelevant. Make sure to target realistic order of magnitude. You do not design YT for 10 users, but maybe assuming 10M a day is enough even though we all know the real number are hundred of times higher * Ask for closed-feedback regularly. Once again an engineer is not someone who has all answer by themselves but someone who can communicate, listen to others, and find team approved solutions * Keep things simple* Technical questions: * It is ok you do not know. Do NOT invent an answer and assert it like its true. Simply states: ""Well I do not know that, but I guess we COULD do something like this, what do you think about it ? How would you approach this"" * You should never have absolute answer to anything, unless its an academic question. The objective of those questions is to understand how you think and how you are going to interact with the team. You are already in a team, you + the interviewers form a work team. Keep it in mind. * An interview is a discussion, not an exam, even if its on the question/answer format* Behavioral: * Do not invent/memorize dumb stories, be them generated by ChatGPT or else. * Those questions are to understand how you behave on a human an in a team, your answer should be clearly constructed, show the value of your work, and how you make impact/drive a team direction * Don't trust the examples shown on Rainforest LP/STAR video, this is pure BS. **No one ever** walked into a project that was in shambles, sit and drafted a plan, and magically the plan solved all the roadblocks and the company earned 200M$ just thanks to this man \\o/. This is pure BS and as an interviewer someone who answers to me in this way will not pass to the next round. * Always place value in the team. There's no self made man, when you were ""faced with a challenge"" it's not just you but the entire team. While you had individual actions that are important to highlight during those questions, as an interviewer this is when we see if someone appropriates the success or if they understand the value the entire team brought. You probably had project you lead alone, use them in those rounds, but always give credit to the team in other example, use that to illustrate how you can drive team decisions * It is OK to take examples where you failed. Failing is part of the game. Use that to show how you reflect, what you learned, and what you are now doing differently * Be yourself, aka **do not invent stories**, there's no point in not being a good cultural fit, it will only lead to regret on your end: I was once told in an interview they already had someone internally but that person was too introvert for the role they were interviewing me, and that my first decision would probably be to fire or not this person. I answered to them that my values are more about finding the strengths of a person and empowering them, rather than trying to have them fit in boxes they don't want to belong to. That person was a good employee who simply wanted to be directed in their work instead of leading change by themselves. They did not pass me to the next round and that was the right decision for all of us.I know that some companies are trying to transform the interview process in a theatrics show, but it's not what it is about. It's about connecting and showing that you can interact with multiple people on multiple teams, reflect on your ideas, and understand the ones coming from others.",41,0.64,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxldo8/got_offer_recently_here_what_you_can_expect_at_a/,2025-04-12 16:36:32,2025-04-19 01:25:08

I really think that I like coding, I loved all my CS classes, when working on labs and couldn't figure things out I'd take a break from the lab and would literally have the code running in the back of my mind until I figured out the solution. And getting the programs to run correctly was always so satisfying. In school we used Python and C so I am pretty proficient in those, and then recently ive taken a React.js course but not too into that yet, but I loved the whole concept of seeing my code work in real-time. I am currently in a DevOps like role, working with Microsoft Azure supporting some products for a pretty huge company (but not a tech company). I really do not do much at my job, just like cloud optimization and monitoring, fixing some pipeline errors, etc. This is not interesting at all to me, I also feel like I will be getting let go soon because of lack of work and layoffs that have happened and probably will continue to happen. I use Python to automate some things at my job, using the Azure clients to access info and pull it out, and thats enjoyable, I work with ChatGPT for those because its really easy to bang out programs like that. I've expressed an interest in switching to SWE to my managers but it doesn't seem like there's much opportunity to because of offshoring and layoffs, and we are potentially moving away from building products in house. I've been applying to SWE roles, Product Manager, Solution Architect/Engineer, and other roles, have applied to over 60 jobs now (all entry-level as I've only been at my job for 6-7 months) and I have not gotten a single interview. Not even a coding test, nothing. Everyday I wake up to a new rejection email.

1jxl1gz,Is this common for tech startups and I'm just not good enough?,Undesirable_11,cscareerquestions,"So I took this job offer with a startup company. I was doing this type of _trial period_ in which I was supposed to implement a feature in the new application they were working on. While I was able to make it work the first time, my code made some violations to the architecture. That's fine and it was my mistake, but my boss (who's also the owner of the startup) was beyond mean in his review on my PR, asking me if I even read the code and very harsh stuff, which I really found unnecessary since it was my first time working with that app. From that point I just felt pressured to stop feeling like I was embarrassing myself as opposed to trying to deeply learn the app, so I made a couple more of fixes and again, same feedback, which wasn't constructive at all. The closest thing to constructive criticism I received was when he told me to look at how one of the files did the job, which I wonder, why not do that from the beginning? At the end he said he didn't want to continue as my work was _completely unacceptable_, and what's funny about that is that he made a comment in my very first PR about a technique I used and he labeled it as _something you should never be doing in the industry_, and yet, I actually had taken that logic from the already existing code that he himself had either written or reviewed before, since it was on the master branch.I guess the question is, do all startups expect you to get everything right from the start and basically offer no mentorship, even when the job description listed 2 years of experience?

My current role is a mid-level SWE with 5-6years of experience. I am fully remote, work maybe 15hours a week, our tech stack is incredibly outdated and code standards are non existent. My base/TC is $105k/$115k. I live a very comfortable life. I go surfing in the afternoons, have sleep overs with my girlfriend and work together the next day, can take trips whenever I want, have moved temporarily to a bunch of different cities etc.For the last year or so i've craved a new role, challenge and life experience because frankly being alone most of my week and not having stimulating work has gotten to me. I wanted to move away from SWE and go into a PM role. Well lucky me, I finally got everything I was asking for but now i'm unsure.

The TC includes options that vest over 6 years with a cliff at 3 so realistically I will be locked in for three years if I took the offer. I will obviously be working more hours than I am used too and i'd have to move away from my gf, friends and beach.

1jyd4zg,Feeling stuck with 5YOE as a mobile dev. Unsure what to do given current market. In need of advice.,IPwnFools,cscareerquestions,"Context--In 2019, I made the decision to join a bootcamp and learn to code as I graduated from my university as a pre-med student who didn't get into any programs, with no career path in mind. It was very tough, but I got my first job at a 4 person dev shop (was horrible) making $55k a year. I was fired from here because of a an approved vacation I took, and a few months later I got another job at another very small software company where I worked as the only web developer and mobile developer. My skills at this time were react and react native.My next job was during the COVID boom, 2021, where I finally doubled my salary and started making $115k as a react native mobile dev working for a startup. I felt like I had finally made it in life. I thought I would be promoted to senior, then maybe manager or director, or something like that. I was learning a ton and working with very intelligent people.After a year, the market hit the first mass wave of layoffs, in which I was cut. I got lucky and immediately was picked up as a full time contractor for a retail company that you have all heard of, which is where I remain today. I knew this would be a shitty job- its filled with contractors and H1B workers. No one knows a single thing, everything is handed off to someone else, no one wants to collaborate. There is immense pressure from above to find a solution to a problem at all costs, design comes second always. I feel super trapped here. I now work on a team where I maintain 10+ small react native and native android applications, but the code is all 5+ years old and written as spaghetti. I have recently realized that I am not progressing at all in my career and scared im going to be stuck here forever. I have gained some skills in kotlin, jetpack compose, but I can't seem to get a job interview anywhere with 5 YOE as a react native dev. My question to you guys is what am I supposed to be doing right now.Present--My job is giving me extreme career anxiety. I am basically working at an H1B visa mill whereas I want to be back at a company like my last job where everything flowed better. I am thankful to have a job in this economy but its really starting to affect my mental health working here.

I am doing more and more non SWE related work as upper management continues to squeeze us from all sides. Am I doomed or is there a way out for me? I don't want to leave tech, but I don't know how to escape this god awful company. What skills do I need to be developing? What do I need to be doing? Is mobile dev a bad choice?

1jy6yhm,How to show projects containing sensitive code to potential employers?,fustercluck6000,cscareerquestions,"I got my degree last year in economics and I’ve spent the last three years learning the ins and outs of deep learning on my own time. In my last semester, I started working on an idea for a DL application, and since then I’ve probably put over 3500 hours into building it all out—including developing a foundation model up for this specific use case and the application infrastructure. I’d say it’s about 90% of the way there.Right now though, I need to find work and I know that including the repo for this project would definitely help. The problem is that a lot of the code is sensitive, specifically the model architecture (by far the hardest part to develop) and certain parts of the data pipeline. Because other people are also involved, it’s not my decision to share anything sensitive, even if I’m the one who wrote it.

The positive ones are generally quite short and boil down to ""great company, smart & nice coworkers"" with the only potential con being the fast pace.

1jxr1iu,Burnout or wrong career?,UrIdiotNeighbor,cscareerquestions,"I'm still at my first job, with about 3 yoe. I have what many would consider a ""great job"": Good pay, WFH, very few meetings, a supportive and cool team, no sprints or storyboards, normal hours. I'm basically left alone to write and review code.Despite this, I am struggling to care at all about my job. I sit down every morning and the last thing I want to do is write more code. I've removed all distractions from my desk (no phone, no internet scrolling) yet my mind wanders for many hours per day, increasingly all 8 of them.I worry that the abstract problem solving needed to program is just too taxing for me. It's not that I'm not intelligent enough to solve the problems, but the process of solving them is exhausting, if that makes sense.When I started this job I found it tiring but rewarding. I was surprised how good it felt to accomplish work, even if the business use for the software was not overly interesting. Now I just find it tiring, but given the idealness of the arrangement I have little faith changing companies would help long-term. I could try a new career, but I have near-term plans to take advantage of my flexibility and salary to move to a bigger city. And more generally, the pay and benefits of this industry are strong incentives for me to make this work, at least for another 5-10 years. Time off helps somewhat, but I always seem to regress back into this state.This is a bit of a vent, but to ask some specific questions: Does this experience resonate with anyone? Does this sound like a patch of burnout, or am I trying to fit myself into a career I simply don't have the temperament for? And if it is burnout, how do I get the spark back?Thanks",10,0.92,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxr1iu/burnout_or_wrong_career/,2025-04-12 20:49:03,2025-04-19 01:25:08
1jxf5cu,Boston vs London vs Zurich for Software Engineering,sylar99994444,cscareerquestions,"Im a PhD level educated Software Engineer with EU and british nationality living in the UK. I’ve travelled to most of Europe and US and the cities I like the most are Boston, Zurich and London, in this order.Which of them do you think would be best for finding a balance between work, salary, life, good weather, and family (with 2 children) as a Software Engineer? Note that my partner works in IT support.Moving to Zurich is not that difficult with my EU nationality. In Zurich, except Google, and very few others, pay is quite low compared to the cost of living. Moving here is risky, as I dont want to bet my entire life on Google. Also, in Zurich healthcare is private, and can cost a lot for an entire family. Children are also expensive in Zurich. The chances of buying a flat in Zurich (around 1 milion CHF) are slim. I’d rather have a smaller salary and own my home, as my net worth would be effectively higher. Also, I’d have to learn swiss german, and my children would have to go to school and speak swiss german. They would probably not integrate properly in swiss society with parents that barely speak swiss german.In London, there are so many options. There are more jobs than in Boston, Zurich, actually its the city with almost the most CS jobs in the world. Lots of companies offer 150k salaries. The problem in London is the tax system, as between 100k and 125k we are effectively taxed at ~61% and after 125k we are taxed at 45%. Buying a house in London is not as difficult as in Zurich, and there are many options of nice homes. London is a bit unsafe tho, and raising a family comes with additional challenges. Also the weather is too overcast, as Id rather live somewhere colder but sunnier, instead of somewhere with mild weather but cloudy and overcast.Moving to Boston would be the most difficult. It is feasible as I have a PhD and many first author research papers at reputable venues, so I could get an EB2 NIW green card visa. Buying a flat in Boston would be the easiest compared to London and Zurich. Boston is safer than London. Boston has the most high paying jobs compared to London and Zurich. It also has the most sunshine compared to London and Zurich. However, healthcare is private and I assume it would be expensive for an entire family. Also, I would have very little annual leave in Boston, as in Europe there are about 5 weeks of annual leave each year",8,0.84,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxf5cu/boston_vs_london_vs_zurich_for_software/,2025-04-12 11:27:14,2025-04-19 01:25:08

1jzdfgq,How do I relearn CS fundamentals efficiently?,imaboss90,cscareerquestions,"I recently interviewed for a software engineering internship and totally bombed it — couldn’t answer basic cs concept questions. No clue what happened to me. It made me realize that for the past two years of college, I’ve been in autopilot mode. I completed assignments and passed classes, but I feel like I never deeply learned or retained the fundamentals of programming and cs theory.Despite that, the company surprisingly invited me to do a 90-minute follow-up whiteboarding session. I really want to redeem myself and prep properly. The task involves working on a Java project live, identifying bad coding practices, improving the code, and explaining my reasoning — kind of like a debugging/design/code-improvement challenge. I want to take this chance but I'm also nervous about embarrassing myself lol.My issue is I feel like I’ve forgotten everything: syntax, core concepts, how to think like an engineer. I also struggle with memory/brain fog, so I tend to Google even basic things — but obviously that doesn’t work well in a live coding setting. Maybe I need a different approach to how I study code? When I do leetcode problems and such I do them but I don't know if they fully stick with me.Any advice or methods for how to quickly relearn and reinforce the fundamentals? Are there any structured courses or certs that helped you rebuild your CS foundation? Leetcode is helpful, but I feel like I need more than just solving problems — I need to understand why and how again.I know I might get some ""you're cooked"" comments, but I am really trying to get back into rhythm again.

Not positive I want to move yet, otherwise this would be the deciding factorStartup pros:- Higher potential payout- More exciting- Feel more valued by the company, more upward mobility - Great office vibeIf the startup hits series C, comp would pull slightly ahead of CB. Any further growth would expand that lead. I’ve done my research and feel good about the growth potential, but there’s always the risk it doesn’t pan out, especially with the current economic situation.One reason I decided to look at other jobs was my company returning to office 5 days a week. The commute sucks and I’m not a fan of the office. So remote sounds nice. That said, the startup is walkable, and I actually loved the vibe during my visits for interviews.I do have to be honest, I don’t push myself as hard working remote, and I think working in an office would boost my output/career growthInitially, I was leaning heavily toward CB, but the startup has been persistent, and I feel very valued by them. I’ve had direct calls from both the CTO and CEO telling me what a great fit they thought I was for the position and how much they’d love to have me join. Fairly personal each time so it’s felt authentic. Guess I’m not immune to flattery, because feeling so appreciated has me doubting my decision.I’d expect crazy hours from the startup, they’ve been transparent about expectations and it seems working late nights and weekends is not uncommon. I don’t prefer that, but if I really enjoy the work I think I’d be ok with it.I’m not sure how much I’m romanticizing the “fulfilling work/make more of an impact” aspect of the startup.

1k2b6yd,Salary band confusion,ineedajobasap00,cscareerquestions,I recently got a promotion which came with a raise. I was hoping for more but wasn’t surprised with the lackluster numbers due to the economy not being in a good spot etc. I was curious where I stood with my new salary so asked the director for the current salary band. They got back to me saying that HR came back with numbers but that it didn’t seem right so had to circle back with them. My question is how did they determine my new promotional salary without even having an official salary band to reference off of? Is it possible they made a mistake?,4,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k2b6yd/salary_band_confusion/,2025-04-18 17:55:24,2025-04-19 01:25:08

1k2ac17,Where To Go From Here,OffTheBlooper,cscareerquestions,"Derived from a previous post...About a year ago, I ""left"" (unfairly PIPed) a particular company after a decade of service, the last 6 of which being software engineering related. Despite the experience I accumulated, I am having trouble like many of you getting callbacks for SE roles. It has left me quite defeated. Moreover, though, it has me rethinking my whole career. Although I enjoyed aspects of my prior roles, the sheer amount of bureaucracy and networking one had to play is certainly one I have not missed. (Granted, what role DOESN'T have this?!?). I just don't seem to have the tenacity to do this anymore, and with the oncoming of AI to shake things up, I'm not sure I ever will.In any case, does anyone have any suggestions for career alternatives? May or or may not related to computer science. In my down time, I have been serving as a part-time rural carrier. To be honest, it has been rather appealing due to its isolation and it's system based on seniority. However, using this as a branch to transfer into USPS software careers does not appear to be working, as it seems many others had the same idea.The ultimate question is where to go from here. With experience, a BS in EE, and soon-to-be Master's in CS, one would think I should have easy time getting a job, but to no avail. I did debate the electrician path, but that could be another conversation in itself. I really am just looking at others' ideas.Hopefully this provides enough context to get the ball rolling.

The pay is good, there is not a lot of work and I spend most of my time doing open source contributions and making personal projects in the hopes of being hired at a foreign company so I can live in a developed country.I recently got an offer from a small startup of 15 people (5 of which were hired last month including a friend who referred me) with a 33% pay bump and chance to work on more enterprise project. I don't care about the money, I already make a good amount and 33% would not essentially make me happier.The question is considering my goals of getting hired abroad, preferably at FAANG, should I take this offer and start working on actual projects or keep doing my personal projects and learning small new things everyday.I would have probably jumped if they also offered remote work, seems like I'm addicted and quite happy with remote work. I can go to the gym, sleep as much as I want and spend a lot more time with my family. But I think if this is a short term situation and whether or not I need to be working more in order to achieve my goals.PS. This is going to be a React + Python full-stack position.
