1n7fu2f,Confirm my suspicion about data modeling,DryRelationship1330,dataengineering,"As a consultant, I see a lot of mid-market and enterprise DWs in varying states of (mis)management.When I ask DW/BI/Data Leaders about Inmon/Kimball, Linstedt/Data Vault, constraints as enforcement of rules, rigorous fact-dim modeling, SCD2, or even domain-specific models like OPC-UA or OMOP… the quality of answers has dropped off a cliff. 10 years ago, these prompts would kick off lively debates on formal practices and techniques (ie. the good ole fact-qualifier matrix).Now? More often I see a mess of staging and store tables dumped into Snowflake, plus some catalog layers bolted on later to help make sense of it....usually driven by “the business asked for report\_x.”I hear less argument about the integration of data to comport with the Subjects of the Firm and more about ETL jobs breaking and devs not using the right formatting for PySpark tasks.I’ve come to a conclusion: the era of Data Modeling might be gone.

1n46piw,I open-sourced a text2SQL RAG for all your databases,Durovilla,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering  :waving_hand:I’ve spent most of my career working with databases, and one thing that’s always bugged me is how hard it is for AI agents to work with them. Whenever I ask Claude or GPT about my data, it either invents schemas or hallucinates details. To fix that, I built [ToolFront](https://docs.toolfront.ai/). It's a free and open-source Python library for creating lightweight but powerful retrieval agents, giving them a safe, smart way to actually understand and query your database schemas.# So, how does it work?ToolFront equips your agents with 2 read-only database tools that help them explore your data and quickly find answers to your questions. You can either use the built-in MCP server, or create your own custom retrieval tools.# Connects to everything* 15+ databases and warehouses, including: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL & more!* Data files like CSVs, Parquets, JSONs, and even Excel files.* Any API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Discord, and even internal APIs)# Why you'll love it* **Zero configuration:** Skip config files and infrastructure setup. ToolFront works out of the box with all your data and models.* **Predictable results**: Data is messy. ToolFront returns structured, type-safe responses that match exactly what you want e.g. * `answer: list[int] = db.ask(...)`* **Use it anywhere**: Avoid migrations. Run ToolFront directly, as an MCP server, or build custom tools for your favorite AI framework.If you’re building AI agents for databases (or APIs!), I really think ToolFront could make your life easier. Your feedback last time was incredibly helpful for improving the project. Please keep it coming!**Docs:** [https://docs.toolfront.ai/](https://docs.toolfront.ai/)**GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)A :star: on GitHub really helps with visibility!",266,0.95,65,https://i.redd.it/ckq9rgaot6mf1.png,2025-08-30 17:00:13,2025-09-05 01:26:08

1n6lf8r,Microsoft Fabric vs. Open Source Alternatives for a Data Platform,SurroundFun9276,dataengineering,"Hi, at my company we’re currently building a data platform using Microsoft Fabric. The goal is to provide a central place for analysts and other stakeholders to access and work with reports and data.Fabric looks promising as an all-in-one solution, but we’ve run into a challenge: many of the features are still marked as Preview, and in some cases they don’t work as reliably as we’d like.That got us thinking: should we fully commit to Fabric, or consider switching parts of the stack to open source projects? With open source, we’d likely have to combine multiple tools to reach a similar level of functionality. On the plus side, that would give us:⁠- flexible server scaling based on demand- potentially lower costs- more flexibility in how we handle different workloadsOn the other hand, Fabric provides a more integrated ecosystem, less overhead in managing different tools, and tight integration with the Microsoft stack.Any insights would be super helpful as we’re evaluating the best long-term direction. :)",73,0.97,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n6lf8r/microsoft_fabric_vs_open_source_alternatives_for/,2025-09-02 14:44:25,2025-09-05 01:26:08

1n400k9,Is self learning enough anymore?,throwawaygrad001,dataengineering,"I currently work as a mid level data analyst. I work with healthcare/health insurance data and mainly use SQL and Tableau. I am one of those people who transitioned to DA from science. The majority of what I know was self taught. In my previous job I worked as a researcher but I taught myself python and wrote a lot of pandas code in that role. The size of the data my old lab worked with was small but with the small amount of data I had access to I was able to build some simple python dashboards and automate processes for the lab. I also spent a lot of time in that job learning SQL on the side. The python and SQL experience from my previous job allowed me to transition to my current job. I have been in my current job for two years. I am starting to think about the next step. The problem I am having is when I search for DA jobs in my area that fit my experience, I don't see a lot of jobs that offer salaries better than what I currently make. I do see analyst jobs with better salaries that want a lot of ML or DE experience. If I stay at my current job, the next jobs up the ladder are less technical roles. They are more like management/project management type roles. Who knows when those positions will ever open up. I feel like the next step might be to specialize in DE but that will require a lot of self learning on my part. And *unlike* my previous job where I was able to teach myself python and implement it on the job, therefore having experience I could put on job applications, there aren't the same opportunities here. Or at least, I don't see how I can make those opportunities. Our data isn't in the cloud. We have a contracting company who handles the backend of our DB. We don't have a DE like team in house. I don't have access to a lot of modern DE tools at work. I can't even install them on my work PC.

1n81kxy,I built a Python tool to create a semantic layer over SQL for LLMs using a Knowledge Graph. Is this a useful approach?,Key_Salamander234,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,So I've been diving into AI for the past few months (this is actually my first real project) and got a bit frustrated with how ""dumb"" LLMs can be when it comes to navigating complex SQL databases. Standard text-to-SQL is cool, but it often misses the business context buried in weirdly named columns or implicit relationships.My idea was to build a semantic layer on top of a SQL database (PostgreSQL in my case) using a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j. The goal is to give an LLM a ""map"" of the database it can actually understand.\*\*Here's the core concept:\*\*Instead of just tables and columns, the Python framework builds a graph with rich nodes and relationships:\* \*\*Node Types:\*\* We have \`Database\`, \`Schema\`, \`Table\`, and \`Column\` nodes. Pretty standard stuff.\* \*\*Properties are Key:\*\* This is where it gets interesting. Each \`Column\` node isn't just a name. I use GPT-4 to synthesize properties like:\* \`business\_description\`: ""Stores the final approval date for a sales order.""\* \`stereotype\`: \`TIMESTAMP\`, \`PRIMARY\_KEY\`, \`STATUS\_FLAG\`, etc.\* \`confidence\_score\`: How sure the LLM is about its analysis.\* \*\*Rich Relationships:\*\* This is the core of the semantic layer. The graph doesn't just have \`HAS\_COLUMN\` relationships. It also creates:\* \`EXPLICIT\_FK\_TO\`: For actual foreign keys, a direct, machine-readable link.\* \*\*\`IMPLICIT\_RELATION\_TO\`\*\*: This is the fun part. It finds columns that are logically related but have no FK constraint. For example, it can figure out that \`users.email\_address\` is semantically equivalent to \`employees.contact\_email\`. It does this by embedding the descriptions and doing a vector similarity search in Neo4j to find candidates, then uses the LLM to verify.The final KG is basically a ""human-readable"" version of the database schema that an LLM agent could query to understand context before trying to write a complex SQL query. For instance, before joining tables, the agent could ask the graph: ""What columns are semantically related to \`customer\_id\`?""Since I'm new to this, my main question for you all is: \*\*is this actually a useful approach in the real world?\*\* Does something like this already exist and I just reinvented the wheel?I'm trying to figure out if this idea has legs or if I'm over-engineering a problem that's already been solved.

You can send success and error status to this API endpoint. Also, you can setup the monitoring on the web app and enter email(s) and/or slack web hooks for notifications. If the api receives a failure status or job doesn't run in the intended duration, notification would be send to email(s) and/or slack.

1n3v5p5,How do you schedule dependent data models and ensure that the data models run after their upstream tables have run?,the-fake-me,dataengineering,"Let's assume we have a set of interdependent data models. As of today, we offer the analysts at our company to specify the schedule at which their data models should run. So if a data model and its upstream table (tables on which the data model is dependent) is scheduled to run at the same time or the upstream table is scheduled to run before a data model, there is no problem (in case the schedule is the same, the upstream table runs first). In the above case, 1. The responsibility of making sure that the models run in the correct order falls on the analysts (i.e. they need to specify the schedule of the data models and the corresponding upstream tables correctly).2. If they specify an incorrect order (i.e. the upstream table's scheduled time is after the corresponding data model), the data model will be refreshed followed by the refresh of the upstream table at the specified schedule.I want to validate if this system is fine or should we make any changes to the system. I have the following thoughts: -1. We can specify the schedule for a data model and when a data model is scheduled to run, run the corresponding upstream tables first and then run the data model. This would mean that scheduling will only be done for the leaf data models. This in my opinion sounds a bit complicated and lacks flexibility (What if a non-leaf data model needs to be refreshed at a particular time due to a business use case?).2. We can let the analysts still specify the schedules for the tables but validate whether the schedule of all the data models is correct (e.g., within a day, the upstream tables' scheduled refresh time(s) should be before that of the data model).I would love to know how you guys approach scheduling of data models in your organizations. As an added question, it would be great to know how you orchestrate the execution of the data models at the specified schedule. Right now, we use Airflow to do that (we bring up an Airflow DAG every half an hour which checks whether there are any data models to be run in the next half an hour and run them).

1n31ztv,Apache Pulsar experiment: solving PostgreSQL multi-tenant pain but...,ephemeral404,dataengineering,"**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).Now that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.### What I liked about Pulsar:* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).### What's painful about Pulsar:* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debugWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. P.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost). I hope this dialogue helps others in the community as a learning opportunity to evaluate technologies, feel free to ask me anything.",9,0.81,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n31ztv/apache_pulsar_experiment_solving_postgresql/,2025-08-29 08:40:32,2025-09-05 01:26:08

I'm working on replicating the native “Total Sales by Referrer” report inside Shopify using the Fivetran Shopify connector.Goal: match Shopify’s Sales reports 1:1, so stakeholders don’t need to log in to Shopify to see the numbers.What I've tried so far:* Built a BigQuery query joining across order, balance\_transaction, and customer\_visit.* Used order.total\_line\_items\_price, total\_discounts, current\_total\_tax, total\_shipping\_price\_set, current\_total\_duties\_set for Shopify’s Gross/Discounts/Tax/Shipping/Duties definitions.* Parsed \*\_set JSON for presentment money vs shop money.* Pulled refunds from balance\_transaction (type='refund') and applied them on the refund date (to match Shopify’s Sales report behavior).* Attribution: pulled utm\_source/utm\_medium/referrer\_url from customer\_visit for last-touch referrer, falling back to order.referring\_site.* Tried to bucket traffic into direct / search / social / referral / email, and recently added a paid-vs-organic distinction (using UTM mediums and click IDs like gclid/fbclid).* For shipping country, we discovered Fivetran Shopify schema doesn’t always expose it consistently (sometimes as shipping\_address\_country, sometimes shipping\_country), so we started parsing from the JSON row as a fallback.But nothing seems to match up, and I can't find the fields I need directly either.

1n5xurr,"Data Lake on AWS: Need advice on ""sanitizing"" DMS replication data",Specific-Signal4256,dataengineering,"Hello everyone, I'm new to data lakes and I'm facing a challenge with data replication.I've set up a data lake on AWS using S3 for storage, AWS Glue for ETL, and Athena for queries. I'm using AWS DMS to replicate data from an on-premises Oracle database to S3.The problem is with **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. DMS pulls all events from the archived redo logs, including inserts, updates, and deletes. This means my Parquet files in S3 have an `op` column that indicates the type of operation (`I`, `U`, `D`).For example, if I query my Oracle database for a specific order with ID `123`, I get a single record. But in Athena, I might get up to 30 records for that same order ID because it was updated many times. Worse, if a record is deleted in Oracle, it still exists in my Athena table, maybe with multiple update records and a final delete record.Essentially, my Athena table is a log of **events**, not the current **state** of the data.I've found a temporary fix by adding timestamp and SCN (System Change Number) columns, which lets me write complex queries to find the most recent state. But these queries are huge and cumbersome compared to simple queries in Oracle.I need a better solution for ""sanitizing"" the data. Parquet files are not designed for easy record deletion. I'm trying to figure out the best practice for this.How do you guys handle this?* Do you just accept the complex queries and leave the old records in S3?* Do you run a separate process, maybe an AWS Lambda function, to act as a ""garbage collector"" and delete the older records directly from S3?* Do you handle this directly in your ETL jobs (e.g., in AWS Glue)? I'm worried about the cost of this since Glue charges by the minute, and this seems like it would be a very expensive operation.I'm looking for tips and common strategies for deleting or handling these duplicate/event-based records.Thanks!",2,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n5xurr/data_lake_on_aws_need_advice_on_sanitizing_dms/,2025-09-01 19:13:37,2025-09-05 01:26:08

1n4kgxz,AI made me stupid in coding.,r2cyp,learnprogramming,"Two years ago I had an internship where I had to create a plugin for an existing WordPress website using PHP. I was the only programmer on the team. My supervisor only knew about WordPress styling and the others were working in a completely different sector. I had applied too late for internships and didn’t want to delay my studies, so this was my only option.The supervisor told me to build a custom plugin for the checkout page and I was completely lost. I knew PHP but had no knowledge of the WordPress framework. I tried reading the documentation but it was hard to understand and other sources were often outdated. The only real resource I had was a small YouTube tutorial playlist with fewer than a thousand views per video. That became my lifeline. I followed along, learned the concepts, and eventually managed to complete the task. That experience helped me understand the WordPress core and I finally started to make sense of the official documentation. In the end I built a plugin for both the admin side and the user side of the website all by myself. My skills in programming tripled in size, but of course I gained no experience in testing, reviewing and stuff. When I checked recently I saw that my old supervisor is still using the plugin today.Now I’m studying a higher level degree in the same field. It’s something like a master, though not exactly the same in my country. The big change is that I discovered AI. Whenever I get stuck I use it, but over time I have become too dependent on it. My skills became worse than ever. I still pass my exams, where AI is not allowed, but I can feel my knowledge fading. It feels like I have lost years of experience and become a beginner again.There is a guy in my class who never uses AI and I am jealous. Around 90% of the students here rely on AI for assignments, and many fail the exams for this reason, which also feels like a sad reality, yet that guy still scores the highest.AI can be good sometimes, but it's a virus on you. If you use it too much, you can't stop. I wish I had never discovered AI, that would be a time when I could at least show my skills and knowledge, but today I feel like a dumb ass who is no different from those who use AI in my class and suck at coding without it.Long story, but it happened to me sadly. I decided to build some projects without AI and it’s been doing good. It’s like a memory refreshment. I plan to build a simple PHP framework soon, as my final internship is coming up to graduate fully. Don't rely on AI too much guys. The love of programming is building yourself.

One argument I keep seeing repeated as one of the cardinal sins of OOP is that its structure encourages statefulness somehow. I understand the difference between stateful and stateless programs, but I struggle to think of a practical reason for reducing states.A lot of the applications of programming I can think of depend on state in some way or another (Saving and loading a game, text editors, email clients, image converters, etc.), and it feels like there is little to no point in having stateless programs as they would lack the ability to do anything because they would not be able to interact with other parts of the project.Essentially, my questions boil down to:1. Why is statefulness considered bad?2. How does OOP encourage statefulness?3.

1n4slw6,Programming feels like my weakest point — beginner-friendly advice?,twi_marafel,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I feel pretty lost right now and could use some advice.I study bioinformatics, and to graduate I need to pass C++ and Python (Data Structures) classes. The issue is… programming has always been the hardest part of my degree.My very first programming course happened only after I got into a new university (previously I was a medical student). It was super intense, and I kept getting stuck — partly because of the new concepts, partly because of the language barrier. Whenever I open the course lectures, I keep thinking: “I failed this once, I’ll fail it again.” Most of my progress is based on the other (more friendly) courses and repeating for a year what I failed. Not so good strategy for the future.I actually like courses focused on specific applications (like Data Visualization or Command Line). But when it comes to the core syntax and basics of a language, I freeze. It feels like all my preparation goes to waste, because instead of practicing I spend my energy being afraid of the subject itself.I’ve seen the advice “pick a project idea and use it to learn,” but I’ve gotten too comfortable with Python, and switching to C++ feels overwhelming. And I guess it’s useless to jump into projects if you’re still struggling with how C++ works at the most basic level.So I’m not really looking for project ideas right now — more like beginner-friendly routine: small daily/weekly practices, habits, or study approaches that helped you when you were learning a new language. I guess what I’m really trying to do is get rid of the feeling that I’m “too much of a bio/med” to ever be good at programming.If you’ve ever been stuck in a similar way, I’d also love to hear your stories — what helped you break through and maybe even find joy in programming on a more consistent basis.It feels kind of embarrassing to admit this to professors — after two years in an informatics program, I feel like I should already be past this point. But right now, I’m just stuck and don’t want to waste another year circling the same fear.",13,0.93,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1n4slw6/programming_feels_like_my_weakest_point/,2025-08-31 11:46:36,2025-09-05 01:26:09

And that worries me",DVerdux20,learnprogramming,"This is kind of a complex one, so context: I'm in my 13th semester in software engineering, about to graduate if everything goes well. I thought I always was good at this, but since last semester, I feel everyone around me talk about things I don't understand, yet my classmates act like I should understand them now. The protect for that semester was to build an online app of our choosing in teams of 5. At the start with the theory and project planning, I was really contributing to the work, but the instant we had to actually start coding, I became nearly useless. They wanted to mount a git repository, which they shared to me so we all had it locally with our own branches. But I straight up told them I had never done that and ask for help. They just told me to check the readme.I spent almost 2 weeks trying to follow the instructions, but it was useless, and at that point, my teammates didn't even understand what I was struggling with. I had to ask the teacher directly for help, and he had to guide me step by step to actually set it up.With that guidance, I noticed the amount of things I missed. I didn't have it clear what a repository even was (and I still don't tbh), I thought things like node.js and java script were programs that I had to install, I never used cli in my life, dependencies still confuse me, I have never use docker, and many, many more. My experience programming was reduced to using Eclipse IDE and occasionally Visual Studio Community. Everything else that my classmates were talking about and using were completely alien to me. I talked with some classmates at the time that weren't my teammates, and all their advice and instructions were falling deaf to me. To the point that one of them straight up asked me: ""What the hell are you even doing here, and how the fuck did you even get this far?""They even asked me what does anybody need to program in java, and I said confidently ""Eclipse IDE"". Their faces were filled with both worry and contained laughter. All this time, the only things that I worked with were theory, and coding the instructions in a java file. I don't seem to have learned anything else that I should've by now. There's such a gap where I can't ask for help in ways they understand, and they can't comprehend what could I be having troubles with. I'm doing my residencies now, continuing the work on a project with a teacher as my guide that apparently thinks I can do a good job, and I feel I'm hitting the same roadblock.

However this requires a lot of joins, and im worried its inefficient.If it is helpful, i have attached a json style structure of my current setup: [https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18](https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18)Apart from finding a users next lesson, i also need to figure out which lessons have been passed and which are locked.

1n6tdld,help me out! I am a total beginner ( ish),idonttiemylaces,learnprogramming,"Hey guys! So, I am going to be entirely honest over here. I studied basic Data Structures and Algos in the 9th grade back in school in India in Java. I had a lot of visual learning because we had a really good teacher who animated algorithms, and explained it really well. I understood the basics so well back then, and I was able to write a lot of basic code and felt like I had a lot of interest toward the subject. So I went ahead and enrolled to study a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Our college had a really outdated syllabus, and would make us write code on paper, and had horrible teachers. The only thing I really kept up with was math. Right after I graduated, I felt shitty about just barely passing what I thought I had interest in. I moved to the US, and enrolled in a UX UI Bootcamp at UC Berkeley and liked what I studied. Learnt some front end development and got a job at a startup, just to get laid off a few months later. After that, I really fell off the bandwagon and never studied. I feel rusty. It's been 2 years since I got laid off, but I am gaining an interest again to learn. I dont know how much the market has progressed, I dont know how much the field has progressed, I dont know where to start, or what to learn. I learn things best visually. I want to have a step into the door to learn development, and ML, and backend dev. I want to bag a job soon too. How realistic does this really sound? IS there any resources you all recommend?

1n30ku6,What do you think??,No0bC0d3R,learnprogramming,"In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?This is a surprisingly controversial question in the programming world because different people value different aspects of coding when it comes to a beginner’s first step. Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it’s simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.There are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.Beyond that, there’s the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they’ll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?The answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.So, the debate is not just “Which language is best?” but also “What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”",5,0.86,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1n30ku6/what_do_you_think/,2025-08-29 07:07:29,2025-09-05 01:26:09

1n463z4,This field is 80% politics.,No-External3221,cscareerquestions,"Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.This is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.When it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.There's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.So many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work. Hence, the differentiator ends up being presentation/ politics or the gaming of performance metrics.",650,0.91,200,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n463z4/this_field_is_80_politics/,2025-08-30 16:35:44,2025-09-05 01:26:10

Really want to name and shame but tbh i can’t afford being sued rn lol- Got laid off due to performance reasons as they said, but the performance review is a bunch of lies made up by management. Sort of things that didn’t matter then suddenly became so significantly important all of a sudden- Signed a separation agreement, in which it says they’ll pay me 8-week of severance on the next payroll 5 days after my termination date. Last Friday is that date - severance no where to be found- During the final call with HR, they said they’ll reach out to me with instructions to return laptop and access my paystubs. I’m still waiting for that email. Tried to emailed HR multiple times with no answers whatsoever, it’s like sending email into the void- Asked HR to reimburse business expense before payroll started, no replies eitherSo now I couldn’t contact their HR, still holding onto their laptop, no severance, lost access to paystubs.

What should I do?",The_Protagonist_0502,cscareerquestions,"I am in software engineering and recently there’s a new hire on our team. By our team I really just meant me. We are not a tech company and only need a few developers to work on our internal software.Before this new hire there was only me. I’ve done a very good job and have very good working relationship with my manager who isn’t a developer but oversees everything I do. As the company scales, there’s more work. So we hired someone new.This new guy is clearly REALLY into programming. It’s like his hobby. Therefore, obviously compared to a guy like me who only likes software development but wouldn’t actively be writing codes for fun, especially after work, he’s more knowledgeable on a lot of things and due to his passion, he’s willing to work 12 hours days when my manager has clearly stated that it’s not at all expected.I’ve had conversations with my manager regarding him and voiced my concerns. Because he’s treating the software almost like a passion project and is going so above and beyond which is taking a lot more time and not necessary for what we want to achieve. And I’m also having a hard time keeping up with him on what he is doing and why he’s doing it. I was told not to worry but it still has me wondering. What is my move next? Is this an environment that I should try to thrive in? I know that I can never out compete this guy because I just don’t have that level of passion and willingness to give it all to a job when I have many other things in life that I want to peruse when not working, though with my experience, knowledge and work ethic, I have done a very good job according to my manager and he loves me on the team.

1n8il9w,How come no one is talking seriously about replacing management with AI?,throwaway09234023322,cscareerquestions,"Every time I see people mention it, it always seems like a joke. However, when you think about it, it makes more sense than replacing ICs. Think about it, why do we have so many layers of management in an organization? It's because one person realistically can't keep track of so many people reporting information to them, so instead they have managers report to them all the way up the chain...This is where AI comes in. Instead of ICs reporting to managers, they just all report to the AI. Hell, the AI doesn't even need to be reported to because it already knows what everyone has been doing due to monitoring everyone's computers. All the CEO or board of directors needs to do is ask for updates from the AI. They can get very detailed information or high level overviews. No more time wasted on useless 1 on 1s, you just ask the AI how you could do better or the AI will automatically give you feedback or put you on PIP if needed based on a standard set of criteria, so no bias.That solves one problem that is faced by large organizations, but how about another one? Think about all the time spent in meetings between managers to only come up with stupid decisions because normally the loudest voice will just win out and it isn't always the smartest. Instead, the AI can interact directly with the SMEs to assess all the information available and make the most informed decisions. Think of the time savings!In conclusion, I think we are headed for a time where mid management will no longer exist. A near flat org mostly run by AI will be the most efficient corporate structure and will out compete all of the competition. Boards of directors will be forced to implement this type of structure because otherwise they will be failing their shareholders.Thoughts?",98,0.85,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n8il9w/how_come_no_one_is_talking_seriously_about/,2025-09-04 18:46:36,2025-09-05 01:26:10

Hiring managers are looking for passion and self learners. Show evidence, not just say it.3. Build am ATS friendly resume. Keywords are important.4. Take contract work to build experience5. Follow up an inteview with additional information that supports that you are a good fit.6. The university internship program is the main way new devs get hired because the organization used that to assess you.7. Referrals are important. Some orgs review all referrals8. Networking is an important way to get in front of the line. Meetups can make connections. Contribute to open source for recognition purposes.9. Take an un-related job in an org and lobby for yourself into the job you want.10. Expect to provide references to back up stated experience11. Business environment uncertainty means that orgs are not hiring jr positions because risk is lower with sr devs. Nice way of saying, jr positions are very scarce.12.

1n7ghxu,"Got an offer, a welcome meeting with the manager and then an email saying they were wrong",BananaBerryPi,cscareerquestions,"I got a message on LinkedIn from my former boss saying that there was a position in his team and that he'd like me to apply. He said the work is good and the company pays well, and I really liked working with him so I decided to apply because I'd like to work with him again and I've been looking for something with better pay anyway.I started the process with a interview with HR, than interview with the director of the company in my country, then technical interview with one of the people in the team, another interview with one of the main managers but now from the US. A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer. I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a ""welcome to team"" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. I waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were ""waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer"", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes ""Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you"". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying ""hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?"". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). So... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a ""misstep"" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. Now... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like ""oh actually, forget that"" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already... I know they're a real company because I've checked several places and I know two people who work there (my former boss, and another person from a previous company I worked at), but doesn't this feel kinda scammy and all over the place? What would you do?Honestly, this trying to find something better has been so exhausting... It's either no answers at all, a lot of scams (got offered a ""job"" to pose as another developer while said developer would be working on something else which is basically, well, fraud) or a complete mess like this case.TL:DR: went through the whole process of interviews, got an offer from the company, a welcome meeting asking me what laptop I'd prefer to then getting an email three weeks later saying there was ""misstep"" in the process and the offer was not valid and that I need another round with live coding on Hackerrank and interviews again.",60,0.94,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n7ghxu/got_an_offer_a_welcome_meeting_with_the_manager/,2025-09-03 14:35:13,2025-09-05 01:26:10

I mostly worked part time (20h/week). During my 2 years of work. I moved to a team for half a year... and I did not fit. It was a really stressful period during work. Up to that point I felt I was good. After that I felt I had a lot of flaws and was not good. Now I am in a better team working full time as I finished university this year.And right now I have heightened imposter syndrome. I ask my tech lead every week if my performance is good, do I ask stupid questions, if I do not waste his time with these questions. He always answers all is fine and no time is wasted (He is also great tech lead, I have insane respect for him and my team).So I feel bad I keep asking the same question but I also not sure what to do. The stress really stirms me up...I am also panicking on my performance... I feel I do 50-70% of what my colleagues with similar experience do. I try to improve my focus, ask my roommates to not interrupt but I still I can not get into a flow state. I will have 2-5h of this semi-focused time to get some work done. Other time is at best done on 0 brain power needed tasks or just other things to recharge brain (walk, youtube, etc.). I feel quite bad I can not clock in my time and get work done properly.Lately I asked very basic questions. Like should the HTTP response be 200 (OK) or 201 (Created) for a Create. Why? Because I wanted to know if we have any specific conventions I did spent time investigating if YES, 201 is needed there.I was doing a PR review and had a call with another dev to discuss of the code is good (It was written by a fresh intern). It looked like should not work. I wanted to discuss with another colleague... After 10min of the call, I spent another hour to debug the code and check how it functions via tests. It worked well. Messaged the MID dev and I felt I wasted his time.These questions happened in a span of a 7 days... And might not look anything that bad... but it really messed with my mental... I am not sure how I can escape this imposter syndrome and get better...I just feel I do not get enough work done, I feel somewhat unmotivated and I feel I waste people's time... Now sure how to systematically fix it.",30,0.78,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n54ald/3_yoe_finished_university_big_mental_issues_lately/,2025-08-31 19:53:07,2025-09-05 01:26:10

1n4yxgo,What even is a good project and how do I even make it?,shade_blade,cscareerquestions,"It's been a few months since I graduated and it feels like my job prospects are sharply going down over time. Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic ""good project"" is that I could make. It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better. But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.The projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't ""impressive"" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are ""expected"" to have they just don't measure up at all. Make a meal planner web app with a group for a class project? Well probably someone out there made something better solo and made actual money with that. Make a networked board game with a different group for another class? Well someone out there probably did that exact game idea but better and also made a profit. Make a substantial mod for an old video game that required me to use assembly and reverse engineer game code? Well there are other mods out there that look far more impressive technically even in the time period I made it. (And that reverse engineering sounds like small potatoes to any actual software developer probably even if it took me a long time to figure out? Oh you figured out how to print more digits in the health bar and hunted down every piece of assembly that touched the health value to make it use a bigger data type to increase the maximum? Well in any ""real"" game that process would've been a single line change so they would just think I'm stupid for making it take so long. I told one hiring person about solving a certain bug where I actually used a youtube video of someone playing the mod to help me figure out how to reproduce it but to any real developer it feels very unimpressive, because if I coded it ""right"" in the first place there would be no bug to fix, or if I was more meticulous about every little piece of code I put in I would just know how to catch the bug in the first place)I just don't know how to make anything good, like I could make some random thing and solve weird and difficult problems and use every technology under the sun but no hiring people would look at it because if it doesn't make money or have a ton of users or looks exactly like the thing they're already making then it's just a dumb toy project to them and I shouldn't even have it on my resume or GitHub in the first place. I don't know how to come up with those ideas that attract money and users or how to fill all my competency holes without spending a ton of money (how to make the perfect graphic design and art that attracts people or how to market a thing to get all those users to use the thing).I don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays. If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in. No amount of thinking ""My ideas are worth a million dollars"" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.",16,0.9,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n4yxgo/what_even_is_a_good_project_and_how_do_i_even/,2025-08-31 16:19:39,2025-09-05 01:26:10

1n4hkpl,Is a project like this one a good showcase project for my portfolio?,OOPSStudio,cscareerquestions,"tl;dr: [This](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) is the project. The wall of text below is additional background (since the subreddit wiki said it's important to include that).I've read all the posts in this subreddit's FAQ section about what projects make good additions to a portfolio and I genuinely cannot figure out if my project falls under that category or not.* I'm looking for a job in basically any tech-related field, but ideally it would be in software development (either frontend/backend/full-stack web development or desktop app development).* I have mid-level skills (probably equivalent to 1-2 YoE) in all the required areas for both of these fields, but I do not have any college education (only highschool).* I only have a single instance of professional experience and it was just freelancing for 2 months where I was paid a small amount of money to build a custom web application for someone, but that was when I was 17 and the resulting application is not showcase-worthy in my opinion (very ugly UI and not full-featured).* Since I lack both a college education and professional experience, the only thing I have to vouch for me on my resume is my extensive list of personal projects (35 of them over the span of 9 years).* Of my 35 personal projects, only about 5 are worth showing off, with the rest being small command-line tools and browser extensions that me and my friends just used to make our lives easier and aren't very impressive.* Of the 5 that are worth showing off, 3 of them are hand-coded videogames (no game engine) and 2 of them are webapps. Since I'm not looking for a job as a video game developer, only the 2 webapps are relevant to the jobs I'm seeking.So all of this to provide background for my core question: **Is** [this project](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) **appealing to an employer who's looking to hire an entry-level candidate?**A lot of people said that the best projects are ones that show you can solve real-world problems and build something that's actually useful for people (including yourself). The app I've linked is an application that helps people learn Japanese by quizzing them on 248 different verb conjugations. I think this project meets (and exceeds) those recommendations, but I still don't feel like it's appealing to employers, and especially not appealing *enough* to make up for my lack of professional experience and college education.The project features a fully-custom verb conjugation algorithm that can accept more than 95% of the verbs in all of Japanese and output 248 conjugations for each one. This is something that has been attempted by at least 6 other people and all 6 of them failed (you can find their half-baked attempts with a Google search). As far as I'm aware I'm the only person to have ever pulled this off (likely because I'm one of very few who even tried). In addition to that, this project has seen more than 10,000 users (unique IP addresses that used the site for at least few minutes) since I published it less than a year ago and I've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback on it from more than 80 different people who reached out to me personally to thank me for building it.The problem is **I don't think employers are going to care.** I feel like employers are going to look at my resume for 5 seconds and then toss it in the trash long before ever looking at my project, and the few who do look at my project won't be able to tell that it's technically impressive or that it was loved by so many people. They'll just see the ugly UI, realize that it's ""in Japanese"" (it's not, but it looks like it is), and toss my resume in the trash anyway.I am more than happy to build more projects and put them on my portfolio (I absolutely love building things), but I don't want to just endlessly waste time building things that employers don't care about. I want a job, and I want to optimize my personal projects to help me get that job as much as I can. So I'd love some input on whether projects like the one I linked are good fits for that or if I need to shift gears and go another route. I'm totally happy either way, I just really want to know so I don't waste months of my time.",9,1.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n4hkpl/is_a_project_like_this_one_a_good_showcase/,2025-08-31 00:58:55,2025-09-05 01:26:10

I’m a rising sophomore at a community college in Eastside Seattle, working toward a BS in CS. This will be my third undergrad degree (Kinesiology and Biology, one from a military academy with significant networking benefits). Due to VA and UW policies, I am ineligible to attend UW for CS, either through their undergraduate or bridge-to-master’s program, which would have allowed me to skip another bachelor’s degree. My only option is a third undergrad from another school.My concern is employment after graduation. The entry-level CS job market looks tight, and last year I struck out on internships (only Amazon’s veterans program responded, but I was too early in my degree).1. I enjoy coding and hope to stay in the field.1. I’m open to CS-adjacent paths (IT, cybersecurity, data science, computer engineering, etc) if prospects are better.1. Thanks to the VA, I’m financially stable (enough) and could go straight into a master’s after my undergrad if that’s the wiser move.Main Question: Given today’s market, what’s the most realistic and sustainable path forward for someone in my position?Bonus Question: What should I be doing right now in addition to attending classes to help my prospects?Thanks in advance for your advice.",8,0.79,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n8jsyj/midcareer_swap_cs_student_37_military_retiree/,2025-09-04 19:32:44,2025-09-05 01:26:10

1n4cemt,How to win with an anxious/ chaotic new manager?,Ok-Cartographer-5544,cscareerquestions,"I have a new manager who is prone to many habits that disrupt both myself and the team. These include:1. Random DMs out of the blue to talk about something ""urgent"" (it usually isn't).2. Assigning ad-hoc tasks out of the blue that could be prioritized in a sprint. Sometimes deeming those non-urgent tasks as urgent.3. Swapping priorities of tasks multiple times in the same week.4. Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.5. Meetings that feel more like an interrogation than a useful share of information.6. Quickly jumps from topic to topic without wrapping up the previous one.6. Makes decisions very fast without much information at all. This includes creating new meetings, cancelling meetings, creating new outings, letting people off early then asking them to stay for an adhoc meeting, etc.7. Reassigns work between different team members, also without much information or thought.8. Seems to be completely oblivious to how these constant disruptions are impacting members of the team (I and other have brought these up personally, and he denied it).9. Has a very anxious/ chaotic vibe. Generally, he is hard to communicate with, or even get a clear idea of what he wants (or correct his unrealslistic expectation) at any given moment.

Creating boring tasks every day is simply exhausting for me. I do not change jobs because in almost every software house you do the same thing, and I also don’t want to go through 10 steps of recruitment.I would gladly work on something innovative, even for less money. The problem is that such positions are only for people with 15+ years of experience, even if the work does not really require it. Either those people were smarter at convincing recruiters, or because of huge competition companies can now hire very experienced developers for the same salary as mid-level ones.I think I would probably fit well in a startup. I could even work 16 hours a day, but I would expect an interesting project and a fair salary.If not innovative projects, then at least some competition for monopolies (like Adobe, or browsers based on engines other than Chromium or Firefox). But it is also very hard to get into such projects.It looks like if I do not find a job for similar money (basically scraps, but still a bit more than McDonald’s and with home office), in another industry, then I will not have a happy career as a developer, even if I have enough skills.Of course, I could try to create my own product and become a founder. But then you need money for marketing — because even if the software is open source, without promotion nobody will hear about it, and there will be no money. This means hunger, and then going back to software houses to build CRUDs again.And this is exactly how I feel: like a chained dog that never goes for a walk, only sits tied up and howls at night.

The answer I got is ""do some (more) research"" LOL.I'm an intern, on week 2 - this week - today, I was given this absolutely questionable codebase, the BE server returns from boolean to string to array to json value, you never know what value type it will return and it's a nightmare to navigate because there is no documentation, there is nothing, the only way you gonna know is to print the result out. There is a log system, EVERYTHING is log in ONE PLACE, the tiniest thing is also logged, 1 request = a massive file containing every single log possible.Furthermore, each request goes through 2 BE, 1 is the BE server and the other is a low-code platform server BE, and ts suck nuts, because this low-code platform has a request limit and the server is running on an unstable docker image so when either of these thing crashes, you don't know which thing crashed because the person who coded this before me thought it was a good idea to return EVERY SINGLE ERRORS MESSAGE AS ONE and there is no try-catch block.Oh yeah, btw, I'm just an intern but I control the entire live production server of this project, this project doesn't have a development environment, I was tasked to research the dev environment + on top of maintaining abomination codebase + on top of developing new feature, I can literally use \`rm -rf\` this entire server.So, today I was asked to fix a core function of the BE server, this BE server was created solely for this function.

1n8ckhg,Can I negotiate a promotion raise?,OrphanDad,cscareerquestions,"Ive been at my current job for 4 years, and finally was put up for promotion. My company doesn't do in place promotions, so barely anyone has been promoted in the last 2 years. Someone on my team left because of this and my manager told me to fill that spot he pushed HR and the eng director, for a senior position, and to hire for that internally.I was the candidate he put forth, no other candidates. I had three 30 minute calls for the interview process, none of which were real interviews, no coding, etc.It took exactly 1 month for me to get an offer.I'm a tiny bit disappointed with the offer, considering a coworker told me their pay raise in 2022 was 20% with a 5% increase in bonus.My offer is 11.5% with no increase in bonus.I know I don't really have any leverage, but is it worth it to negotiate? Given the context, I don't want to upset my manager given how he says he fought for this.the company just had a spectacular Q2 (although that probably doesn't matter).

1n7ld7l,I no longer know what job title I best fit and would love some help.,Choice_Supermarket_4,cscareerquestions,"I've had a very eclectic, non-traditional career path, but now I'm at the point where I no longer know how to market myself. I've been interested in and learning how to write code since I was a teenager (currently in my mid thirties.) I've always done little dumb projects for myself, especially after reading Automate the Boring Stuff a while back. I've picked up a lot of skills in a variety of tech adjacent things along the way: python (django and flask too), javascript, react, typescript, postgres, nosql, a ton of different AWS services (and less experience but still some with both GCP and Azure), cybersecurity, devops, and more.I'm currently doing freelance full stack development in Typescript and Python, building an MVP of a web app for a client. I've been doing freelance dev work since being laid off last year, and off and on for the last decade. I like the freedom, but I'd really prefer to work at an early stage startup again (as long as their funded properly), but I don't know how to properly communicate all of my different skills. When I apply to jobs, I almost never hear back from places when I play for engineering roles, and I think it's due to not having many actual software engineer titles. Usually, If I'm applying to jobs and not hearing back, I fall back to applying to customer service roles. One of my managers will eventually realize I've got a ton of technical skills (usually because I'll build some tool or automate something), and I'll get promoted, but not usually to a dedicated tech team (with the exception of my last role, going to the data engineering team.) As an example, at my last job, I started as a technical support analyst and within a month has been given access to their github, prod db, and AWS (early stage startup that wasn't handling edge cases in customer order data, but also wasn't fixing it, so I did.) That snowballed to me building a bunch of internal tools for the customer service team that were previously only able to be handled by the backend engineers, and eventually becoming a data engineer. At another job, I was hired as a customer service rep and saw how tedious a monthly compliance report was to create, so I built an ETL pipeline in python (without knowing it at the time) that turned a 3 day ordeal into a 20 minute gut check. I'm great at root cause analysis, designing a fix, and implementing it (with consent from the appropriate teams). I've never come across a topic/skill that I can't quickly learn, but also have no issue asking questions on things I'm confused about. I'm good at seeing gaps that aren't being addressed that directly effect the QoL of individual workers and love helping make my co-workers lives easier. I also have severe ADHD, which hasn't been great for interviews. I've only ever had one live coding interview go well, the rest I start to make increasingly dumb mistakes and then go totally blank. I excel at take home tests, but even when I move along in the interviews on those, I end up losing out to someone with a more traditional background. Does anyone have any ideas on how I should market myself to stand out?",6,0.87,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n7ld7l/i_no_longer_know_what_job_title_i_best_fit_and/,2025-09-03 17:35:12,2025-09-05 01:26:10

I’m a CS graduate and a ReactJS developer, but currently unemployed. I went into dev thinking it would be a solid career, but honestly the market feels so saturated rn, the time I chose MERN stack as my career future it was so new and now I’m struggling to land a stable job. I also don’t want to end up in a field where I can lose my job so easily. That’s why I’m considering switching from pure dev to something more non-coding and stable and fun too, because at times coding feels so overwhelming But, I don’t want to completely drop ReactJS. I’d still like to keep it as a side hustle (like freelancing), but for my main career path I want to move into something stronger and more future-proof. With AI moving so fast and me not being super up to date with development trends, I feel like it makes sense to pivot. Any suggestions for non-coding career options (and resources to get started) would be amazing!Also, as I'm graduated and unemployed I need something that doesn't take years to lend a job in, something where I can make my portfolio quickly ykTIA, It would mean a lot honestly.

So anyways, I’m trying to apply for stuff this year even though I feel so behind but I have a couple of questions.Firstly, what kind of projects are resume worthy? I’ve made a book log project with c++ (functions to add, sort, delete, and edit books and with files) and a derivative calculator in python (made my own functions and with a gui) on my own, not from tutorials or anything. I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people’s resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that’s a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that’s something worth sharing or if maybe I’m just not ready yet to be applying to internships.Alright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I’ve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they’re not very relevant to cs so I don’t wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it’s worth adding? Lmk guys.Thirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me.

1n3feaw,"10 years of experience, laid off and have 2 options, did I think correctly?",lugia4k,cscareerquestions,"Hello everyone,I have 10 years of experience as an SWE (mostly .NET), and I've been through an anxiety train with some personal things and impostor syndrome.I was laid off in July and I currently have 2 offers in hand, and another 2 final interviews... so in a sense, im probably not in a that bad situation, 4 chances in 1 month is probably great.Reminder that I am based in Portugal so the salaries will just be lower. Regardless of that I feel like its a good idea to start working as soon as possible to not fill a gap.Offer 1: 70k in a USA International consulting agreement (4k net for 3 months, drops to 3k net in contract). This would be a B2B contract until the office gets setup here, which in their perspective takes 3 months. This would become a hybrid role 1x per week, but its 300km away. Besides, since its a B2B with absolutely no benefits (no insurance, no PTO, no nothing, just a monthly retainer), I would have to open tax activity and terminate my unemployment salary which I have for another 1.5 years (worth 1.3k month) and I will not get it back if they fire me (which they can for whatever reason since this is California based law with 0 rights for me). I feel this is extremely risky as they can just replace me with an offshore for cheap anytime they want, and the glassdoor reviews seem spammed with fake 5 stars, with 1 star comments actually mentioning the CEOs names.Offer 2: My ex ex company offered 2k net and its a 2x per week hybrid role, 70km away, which is better. They want me to be a tech lead and grab every backoffice and migrate to a modular monolith, with .NET and React. It is a long term contract, I have been in this company for 6 years and I needed 0 technical interviews to get an offer, just a call to my boss and he straight away gave me a contract and all his plans.I am thinking of accepting offer 2, even though its lower.

The other bonus is that my current team sold the projects as cryptography related, which although not false is hardly the main thing.

This is where the Research assistant position comes in. I did a few electives after my intro Stats course and my professor liked me a lot, so he invited me to join. It's basically 4 hours a day (which could be tough to pull off, being full time at another job), includes weekly discussions on math topics that are interesting and given that he knows I work full time, he'll be considerate.
