1nhykbt,Am I the only one who seriously hates Pandas?,yourAvgSE,dataengineering,"I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert in Python DE. It's actually something I recently started because most of my experience was in Scala.But I've had to use Pandas sporadically in the past 5 years and recently at my current company some of the engineers/DS have been selecting Pandas for some projects/quick scriptsAnd I just hate it, tbh. I'm trying to get rid of it wherever I see it/Have the chance to.Performance-wise, I don't think it is crazy. If you're dealing with BigData, you should be using other frameworks to handle the load, and if you're not, I think that regular Python (especially now that we're at 3.13 and a lot of FP features have been added to it) is already very efficient.Usage-Wise, this is where I hate it.It's needlessly complex and overengineered. Honestly, when working with Spark or Beam, the API is super easy to understand and it's also very easy to get the basic block/model of the framework and how to build upon it. Pandas DataFrame on the other hand is so ridiculously complex that I feel I'm constantly reading about it without grasping how it works. Maybe that's on me, but I just don't feel it is intuitive. The basic functionality is super barebones, so you have to configure/transform a bunch of things.Today I was working on migrating/scaling what should have been a quick app to fetch some JSON data from an API and instead of just being a simple parsing of a python dict and writing a JSON file with sanitized data, I had to do like 5 transforms to: normalize the json, get rid of invalid json values like NaN, make it so that every line actually represents one row, re-set missing columns for schema consistency, rename columns to get rid of invalid dot notation.It just felt like so much work, I ended up scraping Pandas altogether and just building a function to recursively traverse and sanitize a dict and it worked just as well.I know at the end of the day it's probably just me not being super sharp on Pandas theory, but it just feels like a bloat at this point",277,0.87,170,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nhykbt/am_i_the_only_one_who_seriously_hates_pandas/,2025-09-15 21:21:08,2025-09-22 01:40:55

I know Python well, so working in Python for my initial contribution would probably let me focus on understanding the codebase itself rather than struggling with language syntax.- Iâm attracted to many projects, but my main worry is picking one thatâs not regularly used at workâI'm concerned Iâll need to invest a lot more time outside of work to really get up to speed, both with the tool and the ecosystem around it.Project choices Iâm evaluating:- dbt-core: My first choice, since we rely on it for all data transformations at work. Itâs Python-based, which fits my skills, and would likely help me get a better grip on both the tool and large-scale engineering practices. The downside: it may soon see fewer new features or even eventual deprecation in favor of dbt-fusion (Rust). While Iâm open to learning Rust, that feels like a steep learning curve for a first contribution, and Iâm concerned Iâd struggle to ramp up.- Airflow: My second choice. Also Python, core to our workflows, likely to have strong long-term support, but not directly database-related.- Clickhouse / Polars / DuckDB: We use Clickhouse at work, but its internals (and those of Polars and DuckDB) look intimidatingâwith the added challenge of needing to learn a new (compiled) language. I suspect the learning curve here would be pretty steep.- Scikit-learn: Python-based, and interesting to me thanks to my data science background. Could greatly help reinforce algorithmic skills, which seem like a required step to understand what happens inside a database. However, I donât use it at work, so I worry the experience wouldnât translate or stick as well, and it would require a massive investment of time outside of workI would love any advice on how to choose the right open-source project, how to balance learning new tech versus maximizing work relevance, and any tips for first-time contributors.",33,0.77,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nlqp6w/considering_contributing_to_dbtcore_as_my_first/,2025-09-20 06:19:54,2025-09-22 01:40:55

1nkyd8u,Introducing Columnar MemTable: A High-Performance In-Memory KV Engine Achieving ~52 Million ops/s for single-thread write,Motor_Crew7918,dataengineering,"# Hi r/dataengineering When building high-performance storage systems, the performance bottleneck in write-intensive scenarios often lies in the in-memory data structures. Traditional MemTables based on Skip-Lists or B-Trees, while excellent at maintaining data order, can become a performance drag under high-concurrency writes due to their complex internal node operations.To break through this barrier, my colleague and I designed and open-sourced a brand new, high-performance in-memory KV storage engine: **Columnar MemTable**. It leverages a suite of modern C++17 techniques and clever concurrency designs to achieve astonishing performance. In our benchmarks, its concurrent write throughput reached **\~17 million ops/s**, 3.5 times that of a traditional Skip-List implementation. Single-threaded batch writes hit an incredible **\~52 million ops/s**, a 50x improvement over Skip-Lists. In mixed read-write scenarios, its performance soared to **\~61 million ops/s**, leading by a factor of 4.This blog post will serve as a tutorial, taking you on a deep dive into the internal world of Columnar MemTable to dissect the core design philosophy and implementation details behind its high performance.**Core Design Philosophy: Separate the Hot Path, Process Asynchronously**The foundation of Columnar MemTable's high performance can be summarized in one sentence: **Completely separate the write hot path from the background processing cold path.*** **An Extremely Optimized Write Path:** All write operations go into an ""active block"" (FlashActiveBlock) tailor-made for concurrent writes. At this stage, we don't care about global data order; we pursue the absolute maximum write speed and lowest latency.* **Asynchronous Organization and Consolidation:** Once an active block is full, it is ""sealed"" and seamlessly handed over as a whole to a dedicated background thread.* **Leisurely Background Processing:** The background thread is responsible for sorting the sealed data, converting its format, building indexes, and even performing compaction. All these time-consuming operations are completely decoupled from the foreground write path, ensuring stable and efficient write performance.# A Simple Architecture Diagram[Columnar MemTable Design](https://preview.redd.it/vzchkgjz43qf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=d74fb77e99e8e0f228c77ed1e8b48ce92e02ee96)As you can see, Columnar MemTable is essentially an in-memory LSM-Tree. However, because the MemTable itself has a limited size, it doesn't generate a huge number of sorted blocks (usually just a dozen or so). Therefore, in-memory compaction isn't strictly necessary. My implementation provides a configuration option to enable or disable compaction for in-memory sorted blocks, with it being disabled by default.Next, we'll dive into the code to break down the key components that realize this philosophy.**Deep Dive into the Write Path (The ""Hot"" Zone)**The write path is the key to performance. We minimize lock contention through sharding and a clever memory allocation mechanism.**1. Sharding**Like all high-performance concurrent components, sharding is the first line of defense. ColumnarMemTable maintains an array of Shards. By taking the hash of a key modulo the number of shards, we distribute different keys to different shards, which greatly reduces concurrency conflicts. // Locate the corresponding Shard using the key's hash size_t GetShardIdx(std::string_view key) const { return hasher_(key) & shard_mask_; } **2. FlashActiveBlock: The Core of Write Operations**All current writes within a Shard are handled by a FlashActiveBlock. It consists of two parts:* **ColumnarRecordArena**: A memory allocator designed for concurrent writes.* **ConcurrentStringHashMap**: A quasi-lock-free hash index for fast point lookups within the active block.**3. ColumnarRecordArena**Traditional memory allocators require locking under high concurrency, whereas ColumnarRecordArena almost completely eliminates contention between write threads by using Thread-Local Storage (TLS) and atomic operations.Here's how it works:* **Thread-Exclusive Data Blocks:** The first time a thread writes, it's allocated its own ThreadLocalData, which contains a series of DataChunks. A thread only writes to its own DataChunk, avoiding data races at the source.* **Lock-Free In-Block Allocation:** How do we safely allocate space within a DataChunk for multiple threads (although by design TLS is mostly accessed by a single thread, we aim for maximum robustness)? The answer is a 64-bit atomic variable, positions\_. * The **high 32 bits** store the number of allocated records. * The **low 32 bits** store the number of bytes used in the buffer.When a thread needs to allocate space, it enters a Compare-And-Swap (CAS) loop: // Simplified core logic of AllocateAndAppend uint64_t old_pos = chunk->positions_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); while (true) { // Parse old record index and buffer position uint32_t old_ridx = static_cast(old_pos >> 32); uint32_t old_bpos = static_cast(old_pos); // Check if there's enough space if (old_ridx >= kRecordCapacity || old_bpos + required_size > kBufferCapacity) { break; // Not enough space, need to switch to a new Chunk } // Calculate the new position uint64_t new_pos = (static_cast(old_ridx + 1) << 32) | (old_bpos + required_size); // Atomically update the position if (chunk->positions_.compare_exchange_weak(old_pos, new_pos, ...)) { // CAS successful, allocation complete record_idx = old_ridx; buffer_offset = old_bpos; goto allocation_success; } // CAS failed, means another thread interfered. Retry the loop. } This approach avoids heavyweight mutexes (std::mutex), achieving safe and efficient memory allocation with only lightweight atomic operations.**4. ConcurrentStringHashMap: A Fast Index for Active Data**Once data is written to ColumnarRecordArena, we need a fast way to find it. ConcurrentStringHashMap is designed for this. It's based on linear probing and uses atomic tags to handle concurrency.* **Tag Mechanism:** Each slot has an 8-bit atomic tag. EMPTY\_TAG (0xFF) means the slot is empty, and LOCKED\_TAG (0xFE) means it's being written to. When inserting, a thread first tries to CAS the tag from EMPTY\_TAG to LOCKED\_TAG. If successful, it safely writes the data and then updates the tag to its final value.* **Lock-Free Reads:** Read operations are completely lock-free. They just need to atomically read the tag and other data for comparison. This makes point lookups (Get) in the active block extremely fast.**From Hot to Cold: Sealing and Background Processing**Things get more complex when a FlashActiveBlock reaches its size threshold.1. **Seal*** A foreground thread acquires a lightweight SpinLock for the shard.* It marks the current active\_block\_ as sealed.* It creates a new, empty FlashActiveBlock to replace it.* It places the sealed block into a global background processing queue.* It releases the lock.This entire process is very fast, with minimal impact on foreground writes.**2. Background Worker Thread (BackgroundWorkerLoop):**An independent background thread continuously pulls sealed blocks from the queue.* **Data Consolidation:** It iterates through all the data in the sealed block's ColumnarRecordArena, converting it from a fragmented, multi-threaded layout into a compact, contiguous columnar block (ColumnarBlock).* **Columnar Storage (Structure-of-Arrays):** ColumnarBlock stores all keys, values, and types in separate std::vectors. This layout dramatically improves cache locality, especially for future analytical scan queries (OLAP), as it allows reading only the required columns.* **Parallel Sorting:** After consolidation, the background thread calls a Sorter (defaulting to ParallelRadixSorter) to sort all records in the ColumnarBlock by key. Radix sort is highly efficient for strings, and parallelizing it fully utilizes multi-core CPUs.* **Generate SortedColumnarBlock:** Once sorted, a final, immutable, read-only SortedColumnarBlock is generated. To accelerate future reads, we also build: * **Bloom Filter:** To quickly determine if a key might exist, effectively filtering out a large number of queries for non-existent keys. * **Sparse Index:** We sample a key every N records (e.g., 16). When querying, we first use the sparse index to quickly locate an approximate range, then perform a binary search within that small range, avoiding the overhead of a binary search over the entire dataset.As you can see, this SortedColumnarBlock is very similar to a Level 0 SSTable in an LSM-Tree.**The Complete Query Path**What is the lifecycle of a Get(key) request? It searches through data from newest to oldest to ensure it reads the latest version:1. **Check the Active Block:** First, it searches in the current shard's FlashActiveBlock using its ConcurrentStringHashMap. This is the hottest, newest data and usually results in the fastest hits.2. **Check Sealed Blocks:** If not found, it iterates in reverse through the list of sealed\_blocks in the shard that have been sealed but not yet processed by the background thread.3. **Check Sorted Blocks:** If still not found, it finally iterates in reverse through the list of SortedColumnarBlocks that have been processed. Here, it first uses the Bloom filter and sparse index for quick pruning before performing a precise lookup.If the key is not found anywhere, or if the last record found is a Delete type, it returns std::nullopt.Here, to ensure memory safety, we need to maintain a reference count while searching the Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks to prevent the MemTable from deallocating them. However, incrementing a shared\_ptr's reference count on the Get path is very expensive and prevents Get operations from scaling across multiple cores. Using raw pointers, on the other hand, introduces memory safety issues.Our solution uses a **thread-local shared\_ptr** and maintains a **global sequence number**. When the set of Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks is modified (e.g., a block is sealed), the global sequence number is incremented. When a Get operation occurs, it checks if its locally cached sequence number matches the global one.* **If they match (the common case)**, the thread-local shared\_ptrs are still valid. The query can proceed using these cached pointers, completely avoiding an expensive atomic ref-count operation.* **If the local number is outdated**, the thread must update its local shared\_ptr cache and sequence number (a much rarer event). This design allows our Get performance to scale effectively on multi-core systems.**Limitations and Future Work**Although Columnar MemTable excels at writes and point lookups, it's not a silver bullet.**Adaptation Issues with RocksDB**The current design is not well-suited to be a drop-in MemTable plugin for RocksDB. A core requirement for RocksDB is an Iterator that can traverse all data in the MemTable in sorted order. In our implementation, data in the FlashActiveBlock is unsorted. To provide a globally sorted iterator, we would have to sort the active block's data on-the-fly every time an iterator is created and merge it with the already sorted blocks. This on-the-fly sorting is extremely expensive and completely defeats our write-optimized design philosophy. Therefore, perfectly adapting to RocksDB would require further design changes, such as maintaining some degree of local order within the active block. One idea is to replace FlashActiveBlock with a skiplist, but that would essentially turn it into an in-memory RocksDB (haha).**Ideal Use Cases**The current ColumnarMemTable is specifically designed for scenarios like:* **Extremely high write throughput and concurrent point lookups:** For example, real-time metrics monitoring, user behavior logging, and other write-heavy, read-light workloads.* **In-memory buffer for OLAP engines:** Its native columnar format makes it a perfect in-memory staging area for OLAP databases (like ClickHouse). When data is flushed from memory to disk, it can be done directly in the efficient columnar format. Even while in memory, its columnar properties can be leveraged for pre-aggregation calculations.**Conclusion**ColumnarMemTable is an exploration and a breakthrough in traditional MemTable design. By separating the hot write path from background processing and designing highly optimized data structures for eachâa thread-local arena allocator, a quasi-lock-free hash index, parallel radix sort, and columnar blocks with Bloom filters and sparse indexesâwe have successfully built an in-memory KV engine with outstanding performance under write-intensive and mixed workloads.I hope this design deep dive has given you some inspiration.

1nkmlcz,Data Engineering stack outside of IT,lilde1297,dataengineering,"Hi. Iâve been doing data engineering for 3 years now and Iâm mostly self taught. I am the primary data engineer for my team, which resides outside of IT. My tech stack is currently python scripts running on cron. My IT has a seperate etl stack using SSIS. This is not an SSIS rant. This is an honest inquiry about how to proceed with the situation at my job. My team started using Python before I was hired and to my knowledge without the approval of the dba. I now mange the environment and I am looking to get a modern set up with Airflow running in azure on a couple VMs. The dba is not happy that I donât use SSIS and I feel kind of stuck since I was hired to write Python anyway. Iâm also watching more people in my organization develop Python skills so I feel like it makes sense for me to align with the skills of the org as a whole. We also just aquired Snowflake and I feel like Python works better with that kind of data warehouse.Now I do understand some of my dba point of view. My team just did their own thing and he feels that was wrong. I donât know the whole story as to why things ended up this way and Iâve heard critiques of both IT and my team. My environment wasnât setup with the best security in mind. I am working to rectify this but Iâve bumped heads with the dba on a solution because he never feels the security is enough and doesnât trust me fully. I am trying to run Airflow on azure as I said and my plan is to store anything sensitive in key vault and call the secrets at runtime. This should be secure enough to get his sign off but thatâs to be seen.Now when it comes to what tool to use(Python, ssis, airflow, etc.) I feel stuck between everyone. On one hand my dba wants to say SSIS and thatâs it. Iâve tried SSIS and I prefer Python. If needed I could use SSIS but Iâve brought up other issues such as my dba doesnât use CI/CD or version control and I think that is very important in a modern setup. Additionally the dba didnât have other people on his team who knew and a could support ssis until recently and their still new to it. On the flip side I know that the dba team doesnât have any people who know Airflow or Python so I understand when my dba says that he canât support Python. I know there are people outside of that team and IT who do know Python though.When it comes down to it I guess Iâm trying to figure out if Iâm making the right call and telling my dba that Iâm going to use Airflow and make it as secure as possible or should I give in because ssis is what he knows? Also should he even have as much say as he does in the agency data engineering stack when he is the dba and he doesnât develop the pipelines himself? Also Iâd love to hear if any of you have had similiar experiences or are in companies where there are different data engineering stacks that live outside of IT.",18,0.88,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nkmlcz/data_engineering_stack_outside_of_it/,2025-09-18 22:35:44,2025-09-22 01:40:55

Iâve only seen DuckDB-wasm and Perspective using this approach. How much is this impacting the world of analytics, and how can this method actually empower companies to avoid being locked into platforms or SaaS providers?It seems like running analytics entirely client-side could give companies full control over their data, reduce costs, and increase privacy. Columnar engines in WASM look surprisingly capable for exploratory analytics.Another interesting aspect is the client-server communication using binary formats instead of JSON. This drastically reduces data transfer overhead, improves latency, and makes real-time analytics on large datasets much more feasible. Yet we see surprisingly few solutions implementing thisâprobably because it requires a shift in mindset from traditional REST/JSON pipelines and more sophisticated serialization/deserialization logic.Curious to hear thoughts from data engineers whoâve experimented with this approach!",9,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nl623u/wasm_columnar_approach/,2025-09-19 15:05:39,2025-09-22 01:40:55

Great for developers, less so for non-tech-savvy users.* Arize Phoenix offers enterprise-grade features like statistical drift detection and model health scores.**Why did I even bother writing this?**I found a couple of other Reddit posts that have compared AI orchestration platforms, but couldnât find any list that would go over the exact things I was interested in. The company I work for (SMBish/SMEish?) is looking for something that will make it easier for us to manage multiple LLM subs, without having to build a whole system on our own. Hence, Iâve spent some time trying out the available options and put together a list.**Platforms****nexos.ai**Quick take: A single page allows me to see things like: token usage, token usage per model, total cost, cost per model, completions, completion rates, completion errors, etc. Another page lets me adjust the guardrails for specific teams and users, as well as share custom Assistants between accounts.*Pros** I can manage teams, set up available language models, fallbacks, add users to the team with role-based access, and create API keys for specific teams.* Cost alert messages, so we donât blow our budget in a week.* Built-in sharing allows us to share assistants between different teams/departments.* It has an API gateway.*Cons** They seem to be pretty fresh to the market.**Langfuse**Quick take: captures every prompt/response pair, latency, and token count. Great support for different languages, SDKs available for Python, Node, and Go.*Pros** Open-source! In theory this should reduce the cost if self-hosted.* The A/B testing feature is awesome.*Cons** Itâs open-source, so weâll see how it goes.**Portkey**Quick take: API gateway, guardrails, logs and usage metrics, plug-and-play routing. Very robust UI*Pros** Rate-limit controls, auto-retries, pretty good at handling busy hours and heavy traffic.* Robust logging features.* Dev-centric UI.*Cons** Dev-centric UI, some of our non-tech-savvy team members found it rather difficult to navigate.**Arize Phoenix**Quick take: Provides drift detection, token-level attribution, model-level health scores. Allows alerts to be integrated into Slack.*Pros** Slack alerts are super convenient.* Ability to have both on-premise and externally hosted LLMs.*Cons** Seems to have a fairly steep learning curve. Especially for less technically inclined users.**Overall**I feel like for most SMEs/SMBs the lowest entry barrier and by an extension the easiest adoption would mean going with nexos.ai.

You can even easily embed your widgets/dashboards into any other website by generating a token in the dashboard builder.My favorite node is the web source node which aims to (albeit not perfectly as of yet) scrape structured or unstructured data by visually clicking elements from a website loaded in an iframe.I just wanted to share this with the broader community because I think it could be really cool, especially if people contributed nodes/widgets/features based on their own interests or needs.

I feel like the field is slowly dying and companies are putting more emphasis on ML, and ideally ML engineers who can do some basic data engineering and modeling (whatever that means). Same for lead roles, they put more focus on ML and GenAI than the actual platform to efficiently support any data product. DE and data platform features can be built by regular SW engineers and teams now, this is what I get from various interviews with hiring managers.I have applied to a few jobs and most of them required take homes where I had to showcase my DS/ML expertise although (a) the job descriptions never mentioned anything related to ML, and (b) I clearly asked them in screening or hiring manager interviews whether they require such and claimed they didn't.And then I get rejected because I don't know my ML algorithms.

1nje168,Onyx - anyone self-hosted in production?,Advanced-Average-514,dataengineering,"[https://www.onyx.app/](https://www.onyx.app/) So our company wants a better way to search through various knowledge articles that are spread around a few different locations.

Glean however is very expensive so I searched around for an open source self-hosted alternative. Onyx seems like the closest thing that we can self host for probably 100 a month instead of thousands per month like Glean would be. Does anyone have experience with Onyx? For context we would probably be hosting it in GCP for 100-200 users with a couple gigs of documents that should be easily handleable by basic pdf processing.

1nlngm5,Advice on allowing multiple users to access an Access database via a GUI without having data loss or corruption?,IntelligentNet9593,dataengineering,"I recently joined a small research organization (like 2-8 people) that uses several Access databases for all their administrative record keeping, mainly to store demographic info for study participants. They built a GUI in Python that interacts with these databases via SQL, and allows for new records to be made by filling out fields in a form. I have some computer science background, but I really do not know much at all about database management or SQL. I recently implemented a search engine in this GUI that displays data from our Access databases. Previously, people were sharing the same Access database files on a network drive and opening them concurrently to look up study participants and occasionally make updates. I've been reading and apparently this is very much not good practice and invites the risk for data corruption, the database files are almost always locked during the workday and the Access databases are not split into a front end and back end. This has been their workflow for about 5 years though, with thousands of records, and they haven't had any major issues. However, recently, we've been having an issue of new records being sporadically deleted/disappearing from one of the databases. It only happens in one particular database, the one connected to the GUI New Record form, and it seemingly happens randomly. If I were to make 10 new records using the form on the GUI, probably about 3 of those records might disappear despite the fact that they do immediately appear in the database right after I submit the form. I originally implemented the GUI search engine to prevent people from having the same file opened constantly, but I actually think the issue of multiple users is worse now because everyone is using the search engine and accessing data from the same file(s) more quickly and frequently than they otherwise were before. I'm sorry for the lengthy post, and if I seem unfamiliar with database fundamentals (I am). My question is, how can I best optimize their data management and workflow given these conditions? I don't think they'd be willing to migrate away from Access, and we are currently at a road block of splitting the Access files into front end and back end since it's on a network drive of a larger organization that blocks Macros, and apparently, the splitter wizard necessitates Macros. This can probably be circumvented. The GUI search engine works so well and has made things much easier for everyone. I just want to make sure our data doesn't keep getting lost and that this is sustainable.",5,0.73,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nlngm5/advice_on_allowing_multiple_users_to_access_an/,2025-09-20 03:17:42,2025-09-22 01:40:55

Then the data is served through an API (with FastAPI) with endpoints that allow to fetch historical data etc.Everything works as expected and I had fun building it as I never worked with Timescale. However, after a month I have collected already like 1 TB of raw data (around 100 GB on timescale after compression) .

Iâve little to 0 experience in coding.Sorry, this is going to be long so I divided it into backstory and technical questions:ââBackstoryââI live in a small valley town in Malaysia. That said when it floods, ANNUALLY, it becomes a choke point for people travelling to, from and between cities, suburbs and rural areas.Last year, while a young couple died trying to feed stranded families with babies in cars, the young wife fatally fell into a storm drain (hidden by deep flood waters). Now, just last week it rained again and people are stranded - and I just heard that three people have died in the span of less than a week due to record level landslides in this region.Look, everyone knows everyone in this part of the world. So when someone dies, everyone is devastated. And it saddens me that it happens to the those with the best or intentions. Not to mentions property and income losses. Iâm talking those who just bought a car to go to work and now itâs CAKED with silt while some have to spend tens of thousands replacing books, devices and furniture cause they didnât have time to move their stuff elsewhere. You might be thinking why donât they move their cars uphill or carry your fridge upstairs when it rains? Would you do that every time it rains? Itâs a tropical country anyway. Anyway, we can only extrapolate so much. If only, we had an app that tells us when a water has reached a certain threshold, people can avoid driving into the valley and move their cars or property to safer place. Again I have 0 experience in creating this app and I know that thatâs just half the problem. I also need to think about the other half of the device - the flood detection thingy. In highschool I met someone in an invention convention that managed to create a device that sends a text message whenever they detect landslide/earthquake in a zone with an Arduino - so itâs like an early prevention mechanism. Iâm thinking of emulating that and placing in select flood prone regions upstream as a gauge to let people flee in times when water rises to a certain threshold. I realise the ginormous uphill battle there is on this, but if I could just make one family - even if itâs just my family to turn back and not enter the valley when it floods, or move their car uphill or evacuate their home. Iâll sleep more peacefully.ââTechnical QuestionsââApp: 1. What courses/topics should I take and learn as basics - and do I need to take this first or learn while developing the app?2. What language should I be using? I rather it be a multiplatform app instead of a native one so I charter to both ios and android users.3. How âsimpleâ will this app be? Iâm not thinking fancy UIs, just maybe pings and alert when one or more of the flood detection gets activated.Flood detection:1. Is an Arduino enough to build this?2. If not, what should the detection be? Is there already an invention that does this?General:- Is this possible? How long will this take me? NB: Iâm gonna fund this entirely on my own and Iâll be doing this on the side on top of my already PACKED work schedule.Obviously my questions are wacked cause I honestly donât know what to ask. I work in an entirely different field and I always have been stupid in class when it comes to STEM.

1nj7stx,Received a broken project too large for Github to accept.,Sleep_Raider,learnprogramming,"I kinda feel like I'm asking someone to do my homework, but I'm really stuck here and am only trying to advance SOMEWHERE to the next phase(s) of my issues.For my internship I was assigned to a company by my school, said company was trying to make a simulation of someplace.The problem? None of them really knew programming... and the guy they hired to lead it is gone. Because of that, I (and some fellow interns who are game developers) were tasked to increase the performance of the project. Naturally I inquired about their Github first and as a response I heard their Github was ""broken"". I initially thought going back a few pushes would fix it... but when I asked for more details it wasn't necessarily that their Github was broken... rather that they didn't have one.They didn't work with Github.The entire project was made and maintained on literally. A single. Computer.Now, I'm not a software god by any means, far from it, but I'm fairly certain Github is necessary for working with multiple people. I've learned 2 issues. The first one being that Github doesn't accept files larger than 100mb, and I'm currently learning how to work with Github Large Files to remedy that issue, as well as testing which files I can delete that won't even affect the project. However the second problem is that Github doesn't accept repositories larger than 5Gb? Mine is about 17Gb...I've already been looking up on reddit and Stackoverflow for advice but it seems that not many run into a problem like this. If anyone can share any thoughts with me would be highly appreciated.",242,0.92,189,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nj7stx/received_a_broken_project_too_large_for_github_to/,2025-09-17 08:48:30,2025-09-22 01:40:56
1nmn054,Thinking of dropping out of college for programming? Let me tell you why that might be a big mistake.,LeekNecessary3190,learnprogramming,"I've been seeing this question pop up almost every day for a year and a half, and it's always the same old storyâ¦ 'I'm 17, 19 years old' + 'I feel like college is a waste of money' + 'All I want is to work' + 'How do I become a developer without a degree?'Let me be honest with you: your chances are very slim. Sure, you can teach yourself everything you need in 3 to 5 years, maybe two if you push hard, and build a good portfolio. But what's your plan to find that dev job? You think you'll ace the technical interviews? Great. But how will you even get those interviews? Your CV, no matter how much you polish and fix it, will look very weak next to someone from a coding bootcamp, not to mention a CS graduate applying for the same entry-level job.Look, I get you. College is very expensive, and they won't teach you specific job-related things like Vue or Svelte. Many people, myself included, entered this field without a CS degree. But my path wasn't easy. I managed to get dev experience at a company I was already with, and that gave me the two years of experience (2 YOE) required for them to even look at my resume for my current job. And I got that first job because I had a bachelor's and master's degree in a completely different field they happened to need. Even with all that, I sent out about 250 applications, got 3 interviews, and in the end, only one offer. And that single offer came through a referral by pure luck.The irony is that you can indeed learn all the required skills for a fraction of the cost and in less than 5 years, thanks to all the amazing online resources available. But if you're about to finish high school and haven't entered college yet, I'm honestly very surprised that some people think skipping college is the 'easy path.' You're not taking a shortcut; on the contrary, you're choosing the hardest path. You're like a salmon trying to swim upstream â a few might make it, but the vast majority won't.If you want to gamble with your professional future, that's your decision. You can always try to go to college after you've likely struggled a lot to find your first job. The only thing you'll lose is time, and you can never get that back. I just don't understand why someone would intentionally make it harder for themselves from the start. This field is very difficult to get into.Just to be clear, this is directed at young people of typical college age who don't have major life responsibilities like children or debt. If you're older â say 26, 31, 36 â and thinking of a career change, this isn't for you. I myself am 38 and just entered this field a few years ago. For us, the calculation is different. But for the young folks, I'm telling you as a self-taught dev: this path is a meat grinder, and I absolutely do not recommend it.Some people might misunderstand me. I'm not saying you're a lesser person for not having a degree. I'm saying that HR and recruiters will likely filter out your CV and not look at it because there are stronger ones. It's all a numbers game. Imagine a single entry-level job gets 700 applications. Let's say 350 have CS degrees, 250 have bootcamp certificates, and 100 are self-taught. The hiring manager needs to pick 25 or 35 people to interview. Why would they even start with the self-taught pile? From their perspective, it's easier and safer to pull the best CVs from the people with CS degrees. It's not about your actual skill; it's about how you look on paper amidst a sea of competitors. That's the reality.Am I the only one who thinks the 'follow your passion' advice is a scam? This is the title of an [article ](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1nihjhc/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_the_follow_your/)I came across recently. My opinion is that passion is important, but your education is extremely important.

However, this will result in circular dependency since Buff class knows about unit, and Unit class need to know about Buff.I could use a interface or abstract class to only expose a certain part of the implementation detail, it still feels messy because the fact that usage is circular doesnt change.

1njmixn,Should I continue pursuing software engineering given my situation?,Possible-Drawing5132,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone,I just started studying software engineering at university, but Iâm feeling conflicted and unsure about the future. Most of my friends who enrolled in this program have already left, and Iâm one of the few still sticking with it.Hereâs my situation:* Iâm 21 and just starting my degree. If all goes well, Iâd finish in about 3â4 years.* At my university in Canada, internships are mandatory. Without them, you canât graduate. The school provides some help, but itâs still hard to find one â for some people, it takes 6+ months or even a year.* Iâm married, and I really want to finish as quickly as possible so I donât make my wife wait longer than necessary.* On a personal note, my mother passed away this past January from a brain tumor. Before she passed, I wanted her to see me married, so I made that choice out of love for her and my wife. I know I have to carry the responsibility of that decision, but I donât regret it.Looking ahead, Iâd like to specialize in AI ,specifically deep learning and machine learning. I know thatâs a path that might require pursuing a masterâs degree or additional studies after my bachelorâs.And about passion, people often say âif youâre not passionate, switch programs.â Iâd say I am passionate, but in my own way. What I really love is solving problems, whether itâs in math, physics, or programming. Coding itself is fun, but Iâm not the type who will stay up all night coding just for the sake of it. For me, the thrill is in figuring out the solution.So far, Iâve only done one or two very small side projects, and Iâm starting a third one (a bit harder, I want to make a simple GPT wrapper). Theyâre nothing big, but Iâm slowly building up.My concern is: should I stick with software engineering?By the time I graduate, will it still be worth it? Or is the field going to be so saturated that even with a degree and internships, finding a job will be tough?Has anyone here been in a similar situation, balancing marriage, studies, and an uncertain job market?

1njsucu,How is data stored as bytes? How is different information separated?,FactoryBuilder,learnprogramming,"So a bit of âhow I got hereâ for my question:I was programming in Godot and learning file access and data storage. I found out that I can store integers as bytes in a text file and the file when opened in a text editor will have those bytes translated to their ASCII characters but Godot will still read the data as bytes and return integers when the program reads the file.I thought itâd be funny to have a simple text file, not .dat or .json or any other specialized data storage format, for storing data. Because the text editor spits out the ASCII codes, it will look like gibberish. Representing the data I need stored as integers is easy. The problem is that Iâm not sure how to separate different pieces of information. Letâs say variable A is an integer. Simple. Store its binary 8 bit value. Letâs say variable B is an array. Well it could be of a varied length so I need some way to tell the program when itâs reading the file that the data for this variable starts here and ends here. I canât use any of the 256 combinations of 8 bits because they all represent numbers that the value Iâm trying to store could be.**So how can I mark the beginning and end of certain pieces of data in bytes?** Iâm sure this is a very basic computer science problem but Iâm not proficient enough in Google-fu to find it online.",21,0.75,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1njsucu/how_is_data_stored_as_bytes_how_is_different/,2025-09-17 23:34:42,2025-09-22 01:40:56

1nkai24,How to balance your life as a CS student?,Agitated_Issue_1410,learnprogramming,"Hey, Iâm a 2nd year Compurer Science student and my studies already take up a ton of time and energy. Most of my day is basically just me sitting behind my laptop grinding through uni work so I can keep my grades up.At the same time, I also have the ambition to build my own projects, either to make money from programming or at least to create tools that are genuinely useful to me. The problem is I havenât even managed to start a project yet. I struggle with discipline and time. After a full day of studying, my brain just feels fried, and at that point I usually need to do something physical instead. Iâm pretty active and I love sports, so I go to MMA once a week and try to squeeze in short workouts on other days. Honestly, without sports Iâd probably go crazy.Another factor is that I still live at home. My family expects me to spend a lot of time with them, helping out aroud the hosue, hanging with my sibling, etc. I feel guilty if I ignore them, so usually when I get back from uni I end up just chilling in the living room instead of working on a personal project. On top of that, my little brother has been sick for a few years and canât really leave the house, so he needs more of my time and energy too. I hope he gets better soon, since that would have a good impact on both our lives.Iâm the type of person who really likes having structure and a routine, so part of me feels like moving out nearby could help me manage my time better. But then that also makes me feel guilty for âleavingâ my family.Meanwhile, one of my classmates (and a good friend) has the same ambitions as me, but his routine is very different. After studying all day, he takes break at home, then spends the rest of the evening grinding on a personal project until he goes to bed. He basically lives on his own, doesnât care much for sports, and spends almost all his time in front of a screen. I can see it working for him, heâs making progress and hitting his goals, but I also suspect itâs taking a toll on his health. Still, I canât help but compare myself to him and admire his discipline.Sorry for the info dump, but I just wanted to put it out there. If anyone has advice on how to balance studies, family, health, and personal projects, Iâd really appreciate it. I would also appreciate it if people got drop some project ideas or just routes i can take. I only looked into automating stuff in my live.

I donât know anything about coding or software engineering yet but Iâm thinking of going for Computer Science as my major. I kinda feel like itâs the best option for me but Iâm also not 100% sure.I keep hearing people say stuff like âAI is gonna take all our jobs,â and some people seem scared of going into CS because of that. But honestly I feel like this is the best time to do it, since everyone else is scared and maybe leaving space for me to get a job later.Right now Iâm in what they call âpreparatory years,â which is mostly math and physics for two years (calculus, analysis, linear algebra, thermodynamics, electrostatics, organic chemistry, all that stuff). After that, Iâll choose my major, probably CS unless something changes.My plan is to start self-teaching programming and development during these two years so by the time I actually get into CS Iâm not a total beginner. I want to become good enough at coding and development by the end of the 5 years to freelance whenever I want and build some kind of financial freedom, so Iâm not stuck depending on a job forever.I know itâs a big goal and Iâm starting with zero experience in coding but Iâm serious about making it work.Hereâs what Iâm worried about:\* Is it actually possible to become really good at coding from zero in 5 years? Like good enough to freelance or get decent jobs?\* Should I be scared about AI taking all the software jobs?\* How safe is CS compared to other majors like mechanical or electrical engineering?\* What should I be doing during these two prep years to prepare myself ?

1nk5f8k,"Should I switch to Java or C++, is C++ worth it?",JavaniusS,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,A bit of background about me: Iâm a mid-level software engineer mainly focused on backend development with Go. I have around 2 years of professional experience (plus personal projects), and my degree is in Industrial Engineering, not CS, unfortunately.Iâm currently exploring job opportunities in the EU and I live in Turkey as a EU citizen. From what Iâve seen, Go related roles are quite limited and often target senior/lead engineers (likely for teams migrating to Go). Because of this, Iâm considering shifting to Java for backend work, since it seems to have a much broader job market.At the same time, Iâm also tempted by C++. There arenât many developers specializing in low-level coding, and I feel that makes it a valuable skill in the long run. On top of that, I really enjoy thinking about systems, hardware, and OS-level concepts (not recommend assembly :) ), though I have very limited knowledge since I donât come from a CS background. This makes me wonder if transitioning to C++ would be worth compared to Java.Iâd love to hear your thoughts and experiences, whether itâs about job market trends, learning paths, or the trade-offs between going deeper into Go, switching to Java, or investing in C++.Thanks in advance!",8,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nk5f8k/should_i_switch_to_java_or_c_is_c_worth_it/,2025-09-18 11:14:15,2025-09-22 01:40:56

1nlig1c,Can't decide what to learn.,vap0ri,learnprogramming,"Firstly, I'm tired of endlessly reading books/tutorials on languages. I switched three resources for C++. The last one was the most recommended - C++ primer, 5th edition (or whatever edition covers C++11). After authors told me about auto and decltype() in SECOND chapter, I dropped it, because... No. Just no. Why would they teach me this, if they even couldn't provide me some real-world examples of its usage? The worst thing is that I know C++'s basics, so reading any book on C++ becomes mostly a torment for me. And yet I can't just ""skip to the interesting part"", because I never know what I'm gonna miss unless I read that. :) And the most important: I'm just tired of doing nothing. Yeah, there are these little exercises in each chapter, but I wanna learn programming to make software, not to accomplish those exercises. That means, I would like to start building something as soon as possible.I have some experience in C, C++, C#, Python. The last language I used was python. Python did let me start building as soon as possible (thanks to python's docs and previous experience in C-languages). I mostly liked it, but I'm pretty sure that I don't wanna tie my life to it. I tried building a text-only roguelike with it, but I struggled with the structure. Not that I'm saying this is python's fault, just sharing what I made so far with it. I made the main game loop (fight system, basically) and classes of characters (warrior, mage, etc). Each character has max health, max mana, level, some spells and growths of health and mana with each level (like growths of attributes in DoTA 2). Stopped and decided to rewrite the whole thing, because it felt like the structure got too messy. The largest barrier in making it is import cycles existence and relations between classes. Also I had to work on C# for two weeks. I made a GUI calculator with it, which uses the worst but (it seems) working algorithm of evaluation. C# let me start building right away too, thanks to my previous C++ knowledge. I also found Microsoft docs really helpful. I have ~~experience~~ knowledge of old C++, which is compatible with C (raw pointers, C-strings, C-arrays, etc), and knowledge of just a few things that comes only with C++, like vectors/stacks/queues and classes (basics of all of them).Finally, I would like to provide my vision on languages that I'm interested in OR have ever tried. Note that I don't consider web at all (and even electron or whatever way to use JS for software developing). I'm not interested in it.C++: seems too low-level to just let me start building things, plus it has terrible ecosystem with all of these build systems, their generators (CMake, Meson) and unpleasant ways to get 3rd party libraries.Rust: seems too low-level to just let me start building things. It does have better ecosystem, but I guess there are just no resources on it for newbies like me.C#: tied to windows... Not that I hate it, but coding on windows just feels wrong, plus I've never found something better than bare GNU Emacs when it comes to text editors, but it works fine only on native linux setup. There is .NET SDK for Linux, but... I'm not sure. I sort of can't believe that it's actually good and is being used in production, knowing what Linux to Microsoft is.Java: ...Not sure when it comes to future... I heard that there are no new projects on Java...Python: I don't see myself using it, knowing where it's being used mostly (I would like to make standalone software). Also, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be much harder to find a job because of how popular Python is.I ask you to give your views on what I should and shouldn't do and your views on the languages I listed above.

1niyv29,A deep dive into a real-world Rust FFI project: wrapping a C++ bioinformatics library,AdditionalMushroom13,learnprogramming,"Hey r/learnprogramming,I've been using Rust for a while and recently finished a project that involved some interesting challenges I thought would be valuable to share, especially for those curious about using Rust with other languages.# ## The GoalIn my field (bioinformatics), there's a powerful C++ tool called `odgi` for working with complex DNA data. I wanted to use its features inside a Rust program to leverage Rust's safety and concurrency, which meant building a bridge between the two languages.# ## The Learning Journey & Key ChallengesEven with experience, this project presented some great learning opportunities:1. **Tackling FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** The core of the project was making Rust and C++ talk to each other. I used the `cxx` crate, which is a fantastic tool for generating safe bindings. It was a deep dive into how to manage data and function calls across the language boundary, which is a common task in systems programming.2. **Designing a ""Safe"" API:** A key principle in Rust is memory safety. A big part of the design work was creating a public API that completely hides the `unsafe` FFI calls. This ensures anyone using my library can write 100% safe Rust code, a rewarding design challenge.3. **Complex Build Scripts:** I had to write a [`build.rs`](http://build.rs) script to compile the entire C++ `odgi` library from source before building the Rust code. It's a good reminder of how complex real-world build pipelines can get when you're integrating different ecosystems.# ## The OutcomeThe result is a library (`odgi-ffi`) that other Rust developers in my field can now use as a solid foundation for their own tools.# ## Key Takeaways* **Real-world problems push your skills:** Integrating existing, complex libraries is a great way to move beyond language basics.* **Modern tooling makes hard problems accessible:** FFI used to be a very manual and error-prone process. Crates like `cxx` make it significantly more manageable and safe.I just wanted to share the experience in case it's helpful. I'm happy to answer any questions about the process, or about using Rust and C++ together.",2,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1niyv29/a_deep_dive_into_a_realworld_rust_ffi_project/,2025-09-17 00:39:30,2025-09-22 01:40:56
1niiu6r,coding an animation program?,flufishere,learnprogramming,"Heyo. I haven't been coding very long, I know python and I've only just started learning Java. But I've been very interested in the idea of making an animation program (Adobe Animate, Toon Boom Harmony, etc) but I have no idea how the logic of saving data to frames and then showing/hiding that data would work. Everytime I try to search anything about it I only get searches on how to play animations in java, which I don't think would apply for what I'm trying to do? (I'm unsure.) I'm not looking for a ginormous step by step guide or anything, just a general push in the direction of how a coder would think about doing something like that. The only way I can think to do it in my head involves quite literally an infinite number of if statements/switch statements, which I feel that can't be right. See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.This is an example of how I'm thinking of this in my head (This isn't a specific coding language, I'm nore trying to get across the concept of what I'm doing)\---If current\_frame == 1: erase previous drawing on screen show drawing\_1 on screenif current\_frame ==2: erase previous drawing on screen show drawing\_2 on screen\---etc etc it goes infinitely, these could also be switch statements, but I'm not sure how that makes it any better.I'm aware of the existence of dictionaries/mapping/lookup tables/whatever their called you know what I'm trying to talk about, but those have a finite amount of entries in them (as far as I'm aware?) the amount of frames the user decides to make is literally infinite.This may be a silly question, I'm not very familiar with coding visuals yet, so maybe this is obvious to soneone who is familiar with coding visuals.

Presumably the candidate they chose over me left or something and now the team is willing to give me an offer without redoing the interview process. This is a VERY well known entertainment company and they are offering me a better compensation package:130k base salary, up to 25% annual RSU, 7% annual bonus, and a 25% sign-on bonus in stock. The title is actually lower since im a senior in my current role, but this is a fullstack position. The team works on a more mature product, but probably less exciting. The work is Springboot Java with a sprinkle of React (idk any frontend so its an upskill opportunity)The catch is itâs 4x a week in office and currently a 30-45 minute commute to the most touristy part of the city. The company had a recent round of layoffs as well so im not sure if itâs really the much more stable apart from the product being more mature.Obviously, iâd feel bad leaving a company within a few months especially one that i really like, but is it dumb to pass up such a pay raise?Any advice or additional considerations is welcome.",146,0.85,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1njxlh1/130k_remote_vs_170k_rto_offer/,2025-09-18 03:21:23,2025-09-22 01:40:57

1njb0d3,Why do software engineers talk so much about their salaries and perks compared to other fields?,x_mad_scientist_y,cscareerquestions,"Iâve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, thereâs a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from âDay in the Lifeâ YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.Donât get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isnât true.There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:* Corporate law - long hours at the top firms, but once you make partner or move in-house, the pay and perks can be incredible.* Management consulting - high salaries, travel perks, and later the option to slide into cushy corporate strategy roles.* Finance (investment banking, hedge funds, private equity) - brutal in the early years, but the compensation and eventual lifestyle roles can be extremely attractive.* Pharma/biotech corporate roles - especially regulatory affairs, medical affairs, or corporate strategy, where salaries and work-life balance can be excellent.* Government or quasi-gov jobs - not always âhigh salaryâ in the traditional sense, but great stability, pensions, benefits, and very relaxed day-to-day in some roles.I think tech gets the spotlight partly because1. Itâs more relatable, everyone uses apps and websites, so people âgetâ what a software engineer does2. The industry actively markets itself through social media and content like those âDay in the Lifeâ vlogsMeanwhile, most law firms or finance offices arenât putting out lifestyle videos showing their perksCurious what others think: is it just the marketing or social media presence, or is there something unique about tech culture that makes people talk about salaries and perks more than other fields?",139,0.8,143,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1njb0d3/why_do_software_engineers_talk_so_much_about/,2025-09-17 11:53:00,2025-09-22 01:40:57

Before people say, ""well, you could be a retail or or x worker"". I actually worked those jobs, unlike many in this field who say that line. I wasn't even close to as stressed as I am in this field. I would probably still work them if they paid the bills, but they don't. At least in the US.The unrealistic deadlines, the mismanagement of projects that then gets dumped on the devs to make up for, the work culture that comes from overseas because this field is filled with abused H1B workers. I see things eventually turning into 996 schedules in the US if this doesn't stop.Then to escape horrible jobs...you have to practice interviewing on your own free time. Interviews have rarely anything to do with what you do on the job. Thanks to all the endless technology programmers have to make up every year, good luck keeping up with everything. Also, look forward to 3-5 rounds of BS each time. Good luck finding the time to do this if you have a job you hate. I guess good luck if you run out of days to use for interviews. I guess you just have to quit your job or get fired to escape?I'm seeing a therapist but it isn't helping. They even admit that most of my problems sound like it comes from this job field. They say they have never heard of a work field in the US that is this bad from any of their clients in other fields.Can't really change job fields because I can't afford to go back to college debt now.

1ni9htj,Finishing a CS degree and realizing you're really crap at software dev. What to do?,Lamereddituser312,cscareerquestions,"The way I learnt to code was kind of backwards. I started off on forums like MPGH, first learning how to use a debugger, then learning x86 asm, and then C. For most of my coding ""life"", I just wrote everything in asm, and then later on C but still mostly asm because I found everything else kind of confusing. I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),This kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the ""low-level"", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.Now I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.I struggle to use git lolCI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusingI struggle with database stuffI struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own ""OOP"" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.Get fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shitAll of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool ""high level"" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.It's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.None of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).None of these things are ""software"" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).To be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field.

1nk09zi,Why are companies scared of ambitious people?,Fantastic-Average-25,cscareerquestions,"I changed careers at the age of 35 and moved into tech and i am from a third world country. I was fortunate to land a DevOps role at a company that has a very relaxed culture. Nobody really cares whether you are working from the office or from home.Because I felt I had started a little late, I set clear goals for myself and committed to following them with full focus. The company provides resources for learning, so I used every single one of them. On top of that I bought my own courses, set up AWS accounts, and practiced daily. I even had an old server lying around at home. I spun it up with Ubuntu and started building a homelab on weekends.Excited about my progress, I shared everything with my boss, hoping for feedback and guidance. Instead of encouragement, I was labeled as âtoo ambitiousâ and even considered a flight risk(the very next day HR in a very friendly manner if i am happy working here?). After that conversation, the communication from my boss slowly disappeared.At first that was disappointing. Then something unexpected happened. I found a mentor here on Reddit. Even though he lives in a different time zone,. He reviews my work, gives me honest suggestions, and the only thing he has asked in return is that I pay it forward when my time comes. That single request has inspired me more than anything else.My plan is simple. I want to stay where I am for the next three years, collect AWS certifications, and keep building homelabs with different tools. I am not going anywhere. I am a resilient and determined MF, and no lack of support will stop me from learning and growing.What I have realized is that ambition makes some people uncomfortable, but it also attracts the right kind of people who genuinely want to see you succeed.

1nmthec,Should I quit the entire field because I suck at it UPDATE,GaslightingGreenbean,cscareerquestions,"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/s/M6Xb9M9qmAPrevious post^So, my new manager (my third one) made me send an email after every sprint saying how much carry over is made, any defects made, and how many questions I ask. Iâve never caused carry over or an immediate defect since joining the team so I had no problem, and I send every question I ask since my tech lead keeps telling him Iâm not technically independent.After two sprints, my manager was like âyeah I donât have anything to say about this, Iâll look into what you can do to get to exceeding expectations. Make sure youâre more vocal about your accomplishments from here on out.âSo just like that, I went from being underperforming and on the verge of being let go for 7 months straight to doing fine. I guess my tech lead was overwhelming him with so much negative feedback that he thought âman, this guy must be having people straight up coding for him every sprint.â Absolutely not. My work is my own work. I never caused carry over. I do not have people code for me. I ask for help by saying what I tried first. But this whole experience has really made me feel stressed and unstable in this position. Iâm doing the work load of a senior developer with one year of experience currently, and my tech lead wants me to do that while approving prâs (no problem) while fixing random problems with the application( problem) , while volunteering for extra work (beyond what I can do). And if I say a âbad questionâ this guy goes straight to my manager. What is a bad question? Whatever pisses him off after his boss gets done yelling at him apparently.

My resume has been reviewed and I'm told it looks excellent, but I feel like I blow up a lot of it and that the whole thing is this shitty cardboard Potemkin village set that'll just collapse with one nudge. Some of my resume stuff is literally just stupid ChatGPT stuff. I feel like I'm likely to fail any technical interview or OA I'm given, and while I'm actively trying to correct this, I think it's genuinely too little too late. I can barely remember a lot of the stuff I've learned a few years ago (including pre-GPT). I believe if I were where I currently am but 1 year ago, I'd actually be really cracked and have better success with internships, but now it's too late to apply to most of those.I'm realistic about my goals and don't expect to ever break into FAANG or anything of that tier in my lifetime. I knew I wasn't FAANG material since high school. But all I want is to be able to live on my own away from my shitty Asian parents. I've applied to tech roles at non-tech companies, SWE-adjacent roles rather than pure SWE, etc. On average I'm speaking with one real human per month, but as I move into full-time recruitment rather than intern recruitment, I notice signs of this slowing.I feel average no matter what I do. And in this job market, you cannot be average. I feel gravely ashamed of myself for being so average when I was smart in elementary school. (Long story but I got kicked out of middle school, which could explain my inability to succeed or be ""at the top of the pack""). In many ways I honestly regret even majoring in CS, but I concede many other fields, e.g. the hard sciences, might've been even worse choices for me, and had I chosen those I wouldn't likely even have semi-stellar grades to brag about. And since I'm so far ahead in the game, it's literally too late to even do so. Plus my parents refuse to pay beyond 4 years of tuition and think delaying graduation is stupid (and to be honest they're probably right). When I suggested pivoting to nursing or the trades, they just laughed in my face over how poorly I'd do in those jobs (and again, they're right, I genuinely am physically weak and would struggle in those roles).If things don't get better by next summer after I graduate, I honestly wonder if I should just spend all of my money on bus tickets to some random city in the Midwest and live on the street there. Maybe blow the rest on lottery tickets since at this point there's almost no difference. Sure beats having to shuttle to and from my crummy parents' house. I sometimes wish I could turn back time and obey my parents more so I wouldn't be in this situation, but then I realize even that wouldn't have helped.I know that ideally, this year I should be going crazy with everything, but at this point I'm saddled with so many course and other responsibilities (including some dismaying parental conflicts) that I think there's a genuine possibility that my grades could even plummet below 3.6 GPA. Also, my parents are also begging me to consider a Master's, but I really don't even know if I should do so - what if even with a Master's I fail?For further context I'm Chinese American, have an autism dx, and grew up under a Protestant Christian background. So what should I do, and how hopeless do I seem?",56,0.83,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nmdnzr/college_senior_in_cs_regretting_everything_and/,2025-09-21 00:08:56,2025-09-22 01:40:57

1nmbxpv,What backend language to go deep on?,beb0,cscareerquestions,"I'm a web dev with over 10 years experience in a number of different languages, when jobs changed so did tech stack; I can give a little context to each one. C/C++: my weakest of the languages used it professionally for 8 months on a legacy backend system with many layers of contractor crap. It was my first job out of college, and it was hard I was over my head and lost in the sauce. I would say I know this language 1/10 Java: I've worked with this on and off for a number of years, ironically always with spring framework, know it decently well in terms of usage, would need to brush up on multithreading/concurrency, have used SpringThreadExecutor in the past for big batch jobs. I would say I know this language 8/10Golang: I've used this on and off too but not as much or as deeply as Java usually in a microservice context and didn't do any concurrent programming with it but does look a lot nice to work with in that context than the others. It's been sometime since I used this. I would say I know this language 5/10PHP: I used this for a couple of years as old job had a monolith, I actually didn't mind this language and was really easy to pick up, no concurrency or like just a straight crud app with a LAMP stack. I would say I know this language 5/10Python: Used for some scripts, Advent of Code and leetcode job interview questions fun way to use and nice that its closest to pseudo code yeah spacing can be annoying but overall, I liked it. I would say I know this language 5 maybe 6/10JavaScript: Used it for a couple of years from what i remember it was promise chain hell, have done some stuff with it recently on a full stack node.js app but it has so much crap on top I am not a fan, I tend to almost write Java like code in Javascript. I would say I know this language 3/10 I really want to get a deeper knowledge of one of these languages and make it my main one, I feel almost a tie between C/Python/Golang. C for just sheer simplicity I'm sure it will be segfaults out the ass in the beginning but would be fun to get that low level and just be me talking to the computer's memory, then again it may break me. Could open opportunities for hardware or os programming.Python I feel fast and free with this language, just having to remember at times when func params are copied etc. Fast to work with but many others have called it slow, also nice that it's the default language of AI so very versatile. Golang easier use of pointers and mem management, simplified concurrency programming, I haven't done much beyond crud so hard to know just how efficient this language could be if I go a little deeper. Also seems that lots of jobs openings.Sorry if this post is a little rambley I'm just out of work and wanting to enjoy programming again for fun, so just thinking aloud.

Feeling dejected and hopeless and not sure how to proceed.,roundish_square_face,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,Some background: my mom has been dealing with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My dad died almost exactly one year ago, the same week my live-in partner admitted to being unfaithful and left me. I am getting help but dealt with severe depression before this, and all this launched me into a new stratosphere of grief. This got even worse when we found out my momâs cancer spread again last month. Iâve barely been able to feed myself, bathe, or do the bare minimum at my current job.Iâm a data engineer and I am currently employed at an ok company doing consulting. Itâs not perfect, upper management is abusive with our time and there is client drama. I have no intention of staying long term but Iâve been there over a year and itâs remote so I can visit my mom and qualify for FMLA.A few months back when things were ok with my mom, I applied for a job at databricks for a solution architect and unexpectedly got an interview several months later. Itâs also remote, and I wouldnât get FMLA if I needed it. I am unhappy at my current job and this pays more so I wanted to give it a shot. Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. Itâs all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. Iâm very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that Iâve squandered this opportunity.I had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, Iâm afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But Iâm not. Iâm afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, Iâll end up in a situation where Iâll get fired or theyâll find out Iâm not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I canât code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just canât now.I donât know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter. I donât even want to try to take the assessment because Iâm so overwhelmed, Iâm behind at my current job and donât have the time or energy for the interview process, but I also feel stuck and sad at my current job, at least Iâm comfortable though.I guess Iâm just looking for sympathy and support, and maybe some advice as to what I should say to the recruiter.

1nmllw2,"Architect turned software engineer, feel stuck",pailhead011,cscareerquestions,"Iâve been working for 10 years as a software engineer and I feel stuck. I have a degree in architecture (but never worked as an architect) and I did 3d art professionally for almost 15 years prior to making the switch.I was basically aiming to become a technical artist by adding some coding skills, but overshot it, first becoming a âcreative technologistâ and then landing a software engineering role. Since then, I worked exclusively for startups, most of which folded. By the time I realized I should have been applying for big companies, the layoffs started happening. Most of my roles revolved around WebGL which feels like a really weird niche. I donât really consider myself a graphics engineer, but I do work a lot with shaders, GPGPU stuff, can read some whitepapers and such. I have some vague understanding of how GPUs work, but not enough to understand cache coherence, never worked with geometry shaders etc. WebGL felt like a path of least resistance - thereâs no need to understand compute shaders when they donât exist. Also, what these âcloud viewersâ need, usually isnât that advanced, one can get a lot of mileage by just knowing how to write shaders and understanding what draw calls are. So instead of growing in that direction and trying to become a bonafide graphics engineer, I thought that it would be easier and better to become a front end engineer that has some graphics chops.Iâm not entirely sure if I succeed at this. Iâve had a job where I was mentoring people on react and typescript in addition to doing graphics, was making architecture decisions and such. Iâve had one where I made a Final Cut Pro clone with react. But ive also had some where Iâd get laid off once the graphics need was gone, and there were other dedicated FE engineers. I think because 3D meshes may feel alien to a backend/full stack engineer, i ended up doing some computational geometry as well. But again like WebGL, what I did felt amateurish - it did the job, but was typescript, not c++ or rust. Sometimes it would run in the browser, sometimes in node, but far from using something like open cascade. As in, I wasnât able to combine mature systems in a serious language. But I was able to implement my own half edges, quadtree and such, surgically, to solve a problem. Iâd grind leetcode and do well in interviews, which is how I landed my best jobs, but this seems like itâs over now. I did poorly at an AI interview earlier this year. Obviously this is all IC type of stuff, which I do like, but Iâve been exposed to different management styles. Some times it was a free for all, no code reviews, anyone can nuke the master branch, no standup, no retro, just me and my CEO sitting side by side, while our CTO is missing in action. Other times it was really anal agile for the sake of being agile. My favorite situation was when a place that lacked structure got a very good technical program manager. She introduced processes gradually, each time outlining what we were struggling with and then offering a solution. This got me interested in management in general, but I wasnât able to really pick up much. I worked with some engineers who transitioned to managers, and they were just way more on top of these things. Worked with some that remained ICs but were still super organized. I am lucky to be employed atm and I actually really like my job. If all goes well I may just get unstuck on my own. But having been through the grinder, and since this is another startup, I may be back to where I started. So, what can I do to be employable in the next ten years, even better, to thrive?If I were to leverage my architectural background, how could I do that? By far the two shittiest jobs that I had were in two construction tech startups. Iâm still not sure what happened there, I thought Iâd bring some domain knowledge to the table, in addition to useful coding skills, it didnât happen. Is there anything that the 3d art is good for? I feel like the ship for this has sailed 10 years ago. I had a massive imposter syndrome after my first creative technologist job. I did not reach out to my bosses friend who worked at META, and instead bent over backwards to land a job as a FE engineer. I recently saw a talk by this lady who was a UX designer there, where she says how she has no idea how she got hired there in the first place as a graphics designer. 10 years ago I met a person at a hackathon in SF, same profile - a 3d artist looking to break into tech. I donât think they ever became a software engineer, but maybe even better - a VR evangelist for Mozilla.How could I utilize this if at all? Go âby the way, I have an eye for color and compositionâ? âI can speak the same language as both your 3d artists and your engineersâ? Who am I even trying to convince here, a 20yo CEO probably doesnât care about some 3d renderings from 20 years ago no matter how good they were for the time?Maybe just pick up figma and say âlook I do UX/UI tooâ?If I were to put all my money on the IC path, what should I focus on? More graphics? More web (full stack)? Try to become an expert on rust?What about going back to school, what field would even make sense?Sorry about the stream of consciousness.",14,0.79,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nmllw2/architect_turned_software_engineer_feel_stuck/,2025-09-21 07:27:50,2025-09-22 01:40:57
1nk5eig,Baby while working?,JustForArkona,cscareerquestions,"Lots of little details here so bear with me. Tech lead, 13 YOE, F500, WFH 95% of the time. Only need to go into the office for select VIP meetings. I am 9 weeks into ""maternity leave"" (aka 6 weeks to heal from major abdominal surgery plus 6 weeks unpaid leave) and I am getting anxiety about the end of it looming - mostly about dropping off my baby into daycare. First time mom. Husband works a blue collar job. I make good money for our MCOL area but shit money compared to FAANG peeps. But I typically work strictly 40 hours/week and it's flexible. We cannot afford an in home nanny.This part is about baby/daycare specifics so skip this paragraph to get to the work stuff. He's so little. He's still unable to fall asleep on his own and he does not sleep very long in his bassinet during the day so I've been doing a lot of contact napping. Also the daycare has had a change in management since we signed him up for it and they've been hard to reach/accumulating some bad reviews since then. Also also, I made the mistake of reading about how, while older kids do well in preschool to help prepare them for kindergarten in terms of social and academic achievements, there are only negative outcomes associated with a baby under a year old going into daycare. I'm just getting super nervous about all of this and I'm literally losing sleep over it (which is hard to come by at the moment to begin with haha).I have had a couple coworkers (admittedly more in project management type roles) tell me just keep the baby at home for the first year! It'll be fine! I just don't understand how that's gonna work. I have days of back to back meetings, presenting or leading coding ensembles, trying to focus and get work done. He's still too young to get on a schedule, and he was slightly underbaked. We can start working towards a schedule soon but it's way too chaotic at the moment. I am not nursing or pumping so that doesn't factor into all of this.An additional complicating factor... My team, who had been together for 5+ years, was disbanded three weeks before I had to have my baby. I have been shoved into a ""solution architect"" position now, and despite me begging for time with my new manager, no one took the time to explain wtf you actually do as a SA in our company and what my new role responsibilities were. My team never worked with one so I have no idea. I spent those 3 weeks (before I suddenly developed pre-eclampsia and had to deliver) being upset about the changes, mad about no one communicating with me, and just mad in general cause I was heavily pregnant in the dead of summer haha. So there's a high degree of uncertainty of what I'll be doing when I do get back. And I'm sad that there's a good possibility I won't be coding anymore, won't be leading and mentoring anymore, but the job market appears to be shit so all in all feeling stuck, frustrated, anxious, and hormonal. So I guess my questions are... Has anyone successfully taken care of a baby while in a technical role like this? Am I crazy for contemplating how I can make it work?

It was kind of like a repeat of the previous inerview, I thought. I asked them about it, asked what brought this about given I already accepted the offer weeks ago. They said that it's a ""pipeline"" thing, I didn't quite follow. Something about how at that time they were gearing up for the recompete, and how we all have background checks and security clerance to be done, and basically that the purpose of this was, now that we're approaching the work for real, the get a feel for precisely where I should be on this large team. Honestly, that still doesn't quite make sense to me, because as I said this interview was almost a repeat of the last one. Why not talk to those interviewers and ask them where they think I should go? Regardless, judging from their response we should be good to go.

I work closely with low-level details of microcontrollers (I have not had the chance to be a part of new board bring up). Most of work so far has gained me experience and exposed me to XCP, CAN, SPI, CAN-FD, SENT, UART. Outside of protocols, RTOS, on-chip debugging (test setup/in-vehicle debugging).I want to move to G/amzn/mfst type of companies as a generalist or even specialized team but main point being Iâd be an embedded engineer coming into more of a generalist C++/Java/Python team.I am worried I will be interviewed accordingly as well, meaning, not only will they hit me with leetcodes but they might bring in a couple of their resident embedded experts into one of the rounds or something just to grill me.I think the driving reason for this concern is the fact that I havenât been apart of ground zero board bring up and then application development, I mostly dabble around the app layer and sometimes have to go deeper into the things I mention above (hence the previous distinction between experience and exposure).Although I am able to navigate the codebase and solve problems, I donât TRULY know whatâs going on from the ground up all the way to the application layer.If someone asked me how a CAN transceiver works I couldnât answer, âuhhh high low, take the delta??

I started as a junior SWE building automation scripts and batch jobs for customer provisioning and order management flows. I liked the WLB since I worked from home most days and the hours were manageable.Last year the project I was working on ended, and I was moved into an incident manager role in the IT department of a smaller subsidiary of the company. Itâs been rough and honestly taking a toll on my mental health. Most days are just nonstop incident calls with no coding to brush up on my skills. The environment is toxic and draining with constant cost cutting, shifting expectations, and heavy micromanagement from leadership. I have terrible hours and Iâm expected to be on-call on weekends. Since I joined, two people were let go and now there are only three of us handling even more responsibilities. On top of that, I didnât get a raise this year because I switched teams. My salary was above average for my area and experience, but not getting a raise really discouraged me. It's obvious they're taking advantage of the tough job market.Iâve been in my current role almost a year now and Iâm ready to jump ship.

Unfortunately, I was laid off about a year later.I've since landed a new role, the title is Software Engineer, but it is very AI centric, and any dev work is heavily done using AI tools where software engineers more or less prompt and review the generated code. Writing actual code is minimal, just small tweaks to results. The brainwork is mostly being offloaded to AI, we're instructed to write agents to attempt to automate almost anything and everything.Iâm concerned about not being able to grow my dev skills. I genuinely miss writing and reading code and delving into codebases to solve problems. I miss debugging/troubleshooting, and learning intricacies, nuances, and quirks of the language and technologies that I am working with.In the off chance that these AI tools for dev work end up being scrapped several years down the line, Iâm concerned that my skills will not have grown here. Iâve already heard first hand stories of experienced devs using these kinds of tools feeling as if their skills are dulling.Still being very early in my career, Iâm wondering if I should stay in my current role (because this may be the future), or if I should try to find a job with a company that still does traditional software engineering with complemental AI use (e.g. Copilot in VS) to help me hone my raw SDE skills.I personally feel that these AI tools are best used by experienced engineers who have learned over time what to ask for, what looks good etc. I feel as though it is probably easier for an experienced dev to learn and make use of AI tools/coding assistants than someone whoâs inexperienced and won't know enough to even know what to look for.So regardless of where things are headed, I think that real life hands-on coding experience is going to be king, but this is just one opinion. I'd like to hear some different points of view so I can make an informed choice.Are there any arguments for me staying in an AI centric role (which may be the future)? Or should I try and move back to a traditional dev role (which may serve me best regardless)?**\*UPDATE/EDIT\***Perhaps ""AI Vibe Coding"" was the wrong term, even though my job title is still Software Engineer, my role is more like ""Prompt Engineer"".I don't want to give too much details, but my team is currently coming up with and providing prompts for other teams to use in certain AI tools to expedite their workflows. We have also been training them on communication with the AI tools being used, basically ""AI Evangelists/Crusaders"" at this point.I haven't had the chance to write any code, and future projects are to create more prompts to feed these AI agents so they can automate more workflows. This process doesn't involve me ever having to delve deep into a codebase or understand an actual product. I'm basically working on just prompts.",6,0.67,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nhs71a/stay_in_ai_vibe_coding_job_or_find_a_more/,2025-09-15 17:26:31,2025-09-22 01:40:57

1nl8jwd,AWS Offer vs Current Company (Startup),TellerOTPS,cscareerquestions,"Hello, I realize I might get clowned for asking this, but I do genuinely think hearing peoples' perspectives will help me.I have been working as a Software Engineer at a relatively large (for a startup) startup for 3 years now (was 22 then, am 25 now). I work on pretty low-levelled stuff with C, like Linux kernel stuff, network stuff, etc. I started as an intern right out of college making $25 an hour, but gradually moved up each year to $140,000 per year which I make now.My team is really chill overall, and I am good friends with a good-sized portion of the team members. I do think that I have learned a lot already throughout my \~3 years at my current role, but I know I could still learn more here if I stayed. But it would have to come from myself searching out new opportunities actively within the organization, as the work I have been getting has been kind of the same for a while, and I do feel kind of monotonous at times. However, I also fault myself for not being more proactive and asking my boss for more interesting work, I realize I've been kind of just doing whatever they needed me to do, without advocating to be given what I think would be most interesting/ best for my learning. Lastly I should mention that I do lots of work with an overseas team so sometimes I have to do late night meetings and stuff which is not exactly preferable (though I'm sure that's not necessarily something that is avoidable, and might happen at any other job).The situation I am in is, I have just received an offer from AWS as an SDE II, at around \~$330,000 total compensation. I wasn't really seeking it out, I just got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, and thought I'd give it a shot and see how the interview process went. And then, yeah I just kind of Forrest Gump'd to an offer. So yeah it all kind of happened sort of fast for me, so I have mixed emotions. Obviously, the money is more (though the startup I work at might get acquired, I think we do have potential offers etc., but I am not entirely sure as the management hasn't directly told us). But I am trying to decide what is best for my career. While I love my current team, I do think that I could gain a lot from expanding my horizons. And working at Amazon might also allow me to open new doors. The team I was offered to join is pretty similar to what I am doing now (systems level and network stuff). But I also would potentially have more opportunities to move around within the organization (eventually) and try new things, which is definitely not really possible with my current company. Also I think I might want to try living somewhere else some day (been in the Bay Area really my whole life) and obviously it might be easier to do that if I had other offices at my company I could go to (not really an option at my current company). So I guess I just want to hear what people would do in my shoes, it is surprisingly a little difficult to decide. I do think I know what most of you are going to say but I just thought it would be good to seek the guidance of the forefathers/foremothers, the pioneers who have walked this path before me.

1nl9eoj,Tenure and job hunting in an unstable career,CricketDrop,cscareerquestions,"Has anyone else had job hopping imposed on them by employers? I'm jobless again and I've recently received feedback from what I suspect is an automated system that one of the things they prioritize is tenure. I think as I approach 8 years in, advance in my career, and seek more senior roles, this is going to become problematic.My history looks like this:* Job 1 left after 1 year 6 months* Job 2 left after 1 year 7 months* Job 3 laid off after 1 year 10 months* Job 4 laid off after 1 year* Job 5 laid off after 1 year 3 monthsJob 3 was Twitter. I would have stayed there indefinitely if it hadn't become a train wreck and I and everyone I knew was let go. Since then each job has been a place I enjoyed but my employer makes the decision for me that me and many others can no longer work there.On one hand I empathize with the desire for a candidate with longer tenure, but it's starting to feel rigged. I generally get good feedback from my managers and then I'm blindsided by what I assume are decisions made above them. It's a bit slow-going finding a new job after my most recent layoff and I'm wondering how much this might be holding me back. In addition to feeling quite jaded at this point, it feels rigged in the sense the industry has decided that employees are easily disposable and long term hiring decisions are not important, but they also want heavily tenured and battle-hardened engineers.I tend to get significantly above-average pay packages at these places compared to the industry median (but not necessarily compared to the company) and they have all been remote roles, so I wonder if that puts a target on my back, i.e., ""high-risk high-reward,"" but the last two companies aren't what I'd call ""big tech"". Against my better judgement I've included ""company-wide layoffs"" next to my last three roles because I worry employers might balk otherwise, but I wonder if there's anything else to be done in my situation, and what this all has cost me.",4,0.76,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nl9eoj/tenure_and_job_hunting_in_an_unstable_career/,2025-09-19 17:11:25,2025-09-22 01:40:57
