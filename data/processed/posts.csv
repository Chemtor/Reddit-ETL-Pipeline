1no36ho,Please explain normalization to me like I'm a child :(,soosmagmangos,dataengineering,"Hi guys! :) I hope it's the right place for this question.So I have a databases and webtechnolgies exam on thursday and it's freaking me out. This is the first and probably last time I'm in touch with databases since it has absolutely nothing to do with my degree but I have to take this exam anyway. So you're taking to a noob :/I've been having my issues with normalization. I get the concept, I also kind of get what I'm supposed to do and somehow I manage to do it correctly. But I just don't understand and it freaks me out that I can normalize but don't know what I'm doing at the same time. So the first normal form (english is not my mother tongue so ig thats what you'd call it in english) is to check every attribute of a table for atomicity. So I make another columns and so on. I get this one, it's easy. I think I have to do it so I avoid that there aren't many values? That's where it begins, I don't even know what one, I just do it and it's correct. Then I go on and check for the second normal form. It has something to do with dependencies and keys. At this point I check the table and something in me says ""yeah girl, looks logical, do it"" and I make a second or third table so attributes that work together are in one table. Same problem, I don't know why I do it. And this is also where the struggle begins. I don't even know what I'm doing, I'm just doing it right, but I'm never doing it because I know. But it gets horrible with the third normal form. Transitive dependencies??? I don't even know what that exactly means. At this point I feel like I have to make my tables smaller and smaller and look for the minimal amount of attributes that need to be together to make sense. And I kind of get these right too ¡-¡ But I have make the most mistakes in the third form. But the worst is this one way of spelling my professor uses sometimes. Something like A -> B, B -> CD or whatever. It describes my tables and also dependencies? But I really don't get this one. We also have exercises where this spelling is the only thing given and I have to normalize only with that. I need my tables to manage this. Maybe you understand what I don't understand? I don't know why I exactly do it and I don't know what I actually have to look for. It freaks me out. I've been watching videos, asking ChatGPT, asking friends in my course and I just don't understand. At least I'm doing it right at some point. Do you think you can explain it to me? :(Edit: Thanks to everyone who explained it to me!!! I finally understand and I'm so happy that I understand now! Makes everything so much easier, I never thought I'd ever get it, but I do!

1nqsuyj,"In way over my head, feel like a fraud",SoloArtist91,dataengineering,"My career has definitely taken a weird set of turns over the last few years to get me to end up where I have today. Initially, I started off building Tableau dashboards with datasets handed to me and things were good. After a while, I picked up Alteryx to better develop datasets meant specifically for Tableau reports. All good, no problems there. Eventually, I got hired at by a company to keep doing those two things, building reports and the workflows to support them.Now this company has had a lot of vendors in the past which means its data architecture and pipelines have spaghettied out of control even before I arrived. The company isn't a tech company, and there are a lot of boomers in it who can barely work Excel. It still makes a lot of money though, since it's primarily in the retail/sales space of luxury items. Once I took over, I've tried to do my best to keep things organized but it's a real mess. I should note that it's just me that manages these pipelines and databases, no one else really touches them. If there's ever a data question, they just ask me to figure it out.Fast forward to earlier this year, and my bosses tell me that they want to me explore Azure, the cloud, and see if we can move our analytics ahead. I have spent hours researching and trying to learn as much as I can. I created a Databricks instance and started writing notebooks to recreate some of the ETL processes that exist on our on-prem servers. I've definitely gotten more comfortable with writing code, databricks in general, and slowly understanding that world more, but the more I read online the more I feel like a total hack and fraud.I don't do anything with Git, I vaguely know that it's meant for version control but nothing past that. CI/CD is foreign to me. Unit tests, what are those? There are so many terms that I see in this subreddit that feel like complete jibberish to me, and I'm totally disheartened. How can I possibly bridge this gap? I feel like they gave me keys to a Ferrari and I've just been driving a Vespa up to this point. I do understand the concepts of data modeling, dim and fact tables, prod and dev, but I've never learned any formal testing. I constantly run into issues of a table updating incorrectly, or the numbers not matching between two reports, etc and I just fly by the seat of my pants. We don't have one source of truth or anything like that, the requirements constantly shift, the stakeholders constantly jump from one project to the other, it's all a big whirlwind.Can anyone else sympathize? What should I do? Hiring a vendor to come and teach me isn't an option, and I can't just quit to find something else, the market is terrible and I have another baby on the way.

Instead, can't they use a continuous sequence as a primary key? What are the practical benefits of using a hashed value as a primary key?

1nquwi3,How to deal with non engineer people,sundowner_99,dataengineering,"Hi, maybe some of you have been in a similar situation.I am working with a team coming from a university background. They have never worked with databases, and I was hired as a data engineer to support them. My approach was to design and build a database for their project.The project goal is to run a model more than 3,000 times with different setups. I designed an architecture to store each setup, so results can be validated later and shared across departments. The company itself is only at the very early stages of building a data warehouse—there is not yet much awareness or culture around data-driven processes.The challenge: every meeting feels like a struggle. From their perspective, they are unsure whether a database is necessary and would prefer to save each run in a separate file instead. But I cannot imagine handling 3,000 separate files—and if reruns are required, this could easily grow to 30,000 files, which would be impossible to manage effectively.On top of that, they want to execute all runs over 30 days straight, without using any workflow orchestration tools like Airflow. To me, this feels unmanageable and unsustainable. Right now, my only thought is to let them experience it themselves before they see the need for a proper solution. What are your thoughts?

I was never that fascinated by writing sql transformations but rather tooling, optimizations and infra and moved more and more to building platforms for data engineers.I now have 2 offers at hand (both pay equal). The first one is as a data engineer. I would be the only data guy in a department of 30 people and there is a large initiative to automate some financial reporting. The tasks are building dbt models with Trino. Also building some dashboards which I have never done. I would be responsible which is cool, but the tasks don’t seem to deep. Sure I could probably come up with e.g a testing pipeline for dbt models and implement that on my own to have some technical challenges but that is it. There is a department taking care of all services and development of the platform. I am a bit afraid that I will be stuck in writing pipelines when I take that job and will not be invited to tooling / infra heavy roles.The other one is as a platform engineer where I would work in a platform team to build multi cloud K8s microservices and handle monitoring and logging etc. That seems to be more challenging from a technical perspective but I would not be in the data sphere anymore.

She has used this huge, slow, unvalidated query that I wrote for her to create reports with AI. She always wants stuff added to it so it keeps growing. She manually downloads data from customers into csv. AI wrote python to make html reports from csv.She’s made good reports for customers but it all lives entirely outside of our app. Shes having issues making it work for all clients, so they want me to get involved.My thinking is to let her do her thing, and then once designed, build the reports into our app. With the goal being:1) Using simple, validated functions/queries (that we spent a lot of time making test cases to validate) and not this big ass query2) Each report component is modularized and easily reusable in other reports3) Generating a report is all obviously automated. Now, they messaged me today about providing estimates on delivering something similar to the app’s reporting structure for her to use offline, just generating the html from csv, using the monster query. With the goal that:1) She can continue to craft reports with AI having all data points readily available 2) The reports can easily be plugged into the app’s reporting infrastructure Another idea that they thought of that I didn’t think much of at first was to just copy her AI generated html into the app so it has a place to live for clients.My biggest concerns are the AI not understanding our schema, what is available to use as far as validated functions, etc. Having to manage stuff offline vs in the app. Using this unnecessary big ass query. Having to work with what the AI produces.Should I push going full AI route and not dealing with the app at all?

We employ three Lambda functions to extract, transform, and load data in our current configuration. Step Functions manages all of this. The state machine takes all the S3 file paths that come from each Lambda and sends them to the load Lambda as a list. Each Transform Lambda can make one or more output files. The load Lambda understands exactly how to process the files since we control the order in that list and utilize environment variables to assist it understand the file roles. All of the files end up in the same S3 folder. The problem I'm having right now is that our new Glue task will produce a lot of files, and those files will need to be processed in a certain order. For instance, file1 has to be processed before file2. Right now, I'm using S3 event triggers to start the load Lambda, but S3 only fires one event per file, which messes up the order logic. To make things even worse, I can't change the load Lambda, and I want to maintain the system completely serverless and separate, which means that the Glue task shouldn't call any Lambdas directly. I'm searching for suggestions on how to handle processing files in order in this kind of setup.

It's expensive as shit, slow to work in, complicated to deploy customizations to. Worst of all, everyone in your company heavily relies on data export for reporting. Unfortunately getting that data has been an agonizing process since *forever*. The timeline (give or take) has been something like this:**ODATA (circa 2017)** \- Paintfully slow and just plain stupid for any serious data export. \- Relies on *URLs* for paging.. \- Completely unusable if you had more than toy-sized data.**BYOD (2017-2020)** “Bring Your Own Database” aka *Bring Your Own Pain.* \- No delta feed just brute-force emptied and inserted data again and again. \- Bogged down performance of the entire system while exports ran until batch servers were introduced. You had to stagger the timing of exports and run cleanup jobs. \- You could only export ""entities"" , custom tables required you to deploy packages. \- You had to manage everything (schema, indexes, perf, costs).**Export to Data Lake (2021–2023)** \- Finally, the least bad option. Just dumped CSV files into ADLS. \- You had to parse out the data using Synapse which was slow \- Not perfect, but at least it was predictable to build pipelines on. Eventually some delta functionality hacks were implemented.**Fabric (2023 → today)** **-** Scrap all that, because FU. Everything must go into Fabric now: \- Missing columns, messed up enums, table schemas don't match, missing rows etc. \- **Forced** deprication of Export to Data Lake, alienating and enraging all their customers causing them to lose all trust, causing panic \- More expensive in every way, from data storage, to parquet conversion \- Fabric still in alpha. Buggy as shit. Limited T-SQL scope. Fragile and can cause loss of data. \- A hopeless development team on the Microsoft payroll that don't solve anything and outright lie and pretend everything is working and that this is so much better than what we had before.In practice, every few years an organization has to re-adapt their entire workflow.

1nnchyu,Data extraction - Salesforce into Excel,Juicebox5150,dataengineering,"Not sure if this is the right community to post this or not. If not, please do let me know where you think I should post it. I will do my best to explain what it is i am trying to achieve I have a sheet in excel which is used for data and revenue tracking of customer ordersThe information that gets inputted into this sheet eventually gets inputted into Salesforce. I believe this sheet is redundant as it is the same information being entered in twice and manually, so there is room for errors. I will mentioned that there are drop down menus within the sheet in excel, which sometimes needs to be changed to a different value depending on the information of the order. However, there are probably only a max of 6 combinations. So really I could have 6 separate sheets that the information would need to go into for each combination if needed.I am hoping there is a way to extract specific data from salesforce and input it directly into these sheets? Typically there can be anywhere from 1 to 50 sheets that get made each day. And each sheet contains different information for each specific order. However, the information is always in the same spot within salesforce I am hoping there is a way to this automatically where I would go through each order in sales force and push a couple of buttons to extract that data into these sheets. Or a completely automated wayI think I have fully explained what it is I am trying to do. But if its not clear let me know. If I am able to achieve this, it will save me so much time and energy!

1nrrhbh,Best Course Resources for Part-Time Learning Data Engg,reficul97,dataengineering,"TL;DRI know enough about Python and SQL upto Joins but no standard database knowledge all through Chatgpt/Gemini and screwing up with some data that was handed to me. I want to learn more about other tools as well as using cloud. Have no industry experience per se and would love some advice on how to get to a level of building reliable pipelines for real world use. I havent used a single Apache tool, just theoretical knowledge and YT. Thats how bad it is.Hi everyone, Im ngl this thread alone has taught me so much for the work I've done. Im a self taught programmer (~4 years now). I started off with Python had absolutely no idea about SQL (still kinda don't). When I started to learn programming (~2021) I had just finished uni with Bio degree and I began to take keen interest into it as my thesis was based on computational simulation of binding molecules and I was heavily limited by the software GUI which my lecturer showed me could have been much more efficient using Python. Hence, began my journey. I started off learning HTML, CSS and JS (that alone killed my interest for a while), but then I stumbled onto Python. Keep in mind late 2020 to early 2021 had a massive hype of online ML courses and thats how I forayed into the world of Python.Given its high-level and massive community made it easier to understand a lot of concepts and it has a library for the most random shit you'd wanna not code yourself. However, I have realized my biggest limiting factor was:1. Tutorial Hell2. Never knowing if I know enough? (Primarily because of not having any industry experience with SQL and Git, as well as QA with unit testing/TDD. These were just concepts I've about).To put it frankly I was/am extremely underconfident of being able to build reliable code that can be used in the real world. But I have a very stubborn attitude and for better or for worse that has pushed me. My Python knowledge and my subject expertise gave me an advantage to quickly understand high level ML/DL topics to train and experiment with models, but I always enjoyed data engineering i.e., building the pipelines that feed the right data to AI.But I constantly feel like I am lacking. I started small[ish] since last December. MY mom runs a small cafe but we struggled to keep track of financials. Few reasons being, barebones POS system, with a basic analytics dashboard, handwritten inventory tracking, no accurate insights from sales through delivery partners. I initially thought I could just export the excel files and clean and analyze it in Python. But there were a lot of issues and so I picked up Postgres (open-source few!) with the basics (upto Joins, I use CTEs cause for the life of me I don't see myself using views etc.). The data totals up i.e., from all data sources to ~100k rows. I used sqlalchemy to pushed the cleaning datasets to a postgres database and I used duckdb for in memory transformations to build the fact tables (3 of them for the orders, items, and added financial expenses).This was way more tedious than Ive explained. Primarily due to a lot of issues like duplicated invoice no.s (the POS system was restarted this year on the advice of my mom, but thats another story for another day), basically no definitive primary key (created a composite key with the date), the delivery partners order ids are not shown in the same report as the master report, and so on. Without getting much into detail,Here is my current situation and why I have asked this question on this thread:I was using Gemini to help me structure the Python code I wrote in my notebook and write the SQL queries (only to realize it was not upto the mark so I pretty much wrote 70% of the CTE myself) and used duckdb engine to query the data from the staging tables directly into a fact table. But I learnt all these terminologies because of Gemini. I just didnt share any financial data with it which is probably why it gave me the garbage[ish] query. But the point being I learnt that. I was setting the data types configs using Pandas and I didn't create any tables in SQL it was directly mapped by SQLalchemy.Then I came across dimension tables, data marts, etc. I feel like I am damn close and I can pick this up but the learning feels extremely ad hoc and I keep doubting my existing code infrastructure a lot.So my question is should I continue to learn like this (making a ridiculously insane amount of mistake only to realize there are existing theories on how to model data, transform data, etc., later on). Or is it wise to actually take on a certification course? I also have zero actual cloud knowledge (have just tinkered with BigQuery on Googles Cloud skill boos courses)As much as it frustrates me I love seeing data coming together like to provide useful, viable information as an output. But I feel like my knowledge is my limitation.I would love to hear your inputs, personal experiences, book reccos (I am a better visual learner tbh). Most of what I can find have very basic intros to Python, SQL, etc. and yes I can always be better with my basics but if I start off like and get bored I know I am going to slack off and never finish the course.I think weirdly I am asking people to rate my level (cant believe im seeking validation on a data engg thread) and suggest any good learning sources.

1np9hg0,"The most effective way to learn programming is to want to build something, and then to try and build it.",RockaBabyDarling,learnprogramming,"I've been programming for nearly two decades, and the way I got my start, the way many of my most talented friends got their start, was not through a 16-week boot camp. Although I'm not saying there's no value there. Having a goal and moving through each of several key areas in a full-stack SDLC, they do well enough.If you're trying to learn all the things you need to know to be even a junior to mid-level engineer, it can be difficult to glue all those pieces together in your mind. It can feel like you're learning HTML, but it looks like crap, so then you learn CSS. But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript. Now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work, but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like React or Angular. But then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard-coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so it's not hard-coded, so you learn some backend framework. Now you've got APIs, but you're still hard-coding, so then you learn how to stand up a database. All along the way, there are all these choices and decisions to make, pros and cons, and it's always changing.I've gone through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, Spring Boot and Java, the MEAN stack with Angular 1, and then Angular 2 (which wasn't even the same thing as the first), the MERN stack, all the little frameworks and libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object-oriented versus functional or GraphQL vs REST, and it keeps changing. It keeps going: one thing gets simpler, the next gets more complicated. If you don't have some central thing you can use to glue all these concepts together, they come and go and you've never really learned much. You learned kind of how to touch Kubernetes one day and then never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you could do because you're actually on something worse than k8s. But I digress.If you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice after being a software engineer forever is to do these things:**1. Think of the coolest, most badass thing you can think of that you would like to go try and build.**Take as long as you need here. This is the most important part. It really has to resonate as ""you know what, holy shit, I would actually like to build this,"" and you start getting amped about it. That energy is going to get you through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together. You can look back and say, ""Oh yeah, I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mixins combined with the other features of the language. I just dropped plain CSS and LESS overnight. Oh yeah, I've heard of Tailwind. I dabbled with it. It's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly,"" etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.**2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it with, because I promise you the chances that you're going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea through analysis paralysis are going to be astronomical.**Do some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, and patterns are for whatever it is you're trying to build. I recommend a full-stack JavaScript stack, or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge in complexity and the learning curve when just starting out, mainly because it reduces having to learn two languages when context-switching from the frontend to the backend if you're looking to be full-stack. People ask me what the best programming language is, and I always tell them it's the one you've spent five years learning. You can do just about anything with just about any language out there. Some of them are hyper-specialized like Erlang or Rust or Go, but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share. If it's popular, that means people are hiring for it, it means people like it, and that there's support out there for it. Whichever you pick, you'll be fine. You're getting an education either way.**3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you.**Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there, building out the UI, learning how to make a mockup, and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you.**4. You are going to change your mind about things. People who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from six months ago and say to yourself ""what was I thinking here?"" then you're not growing.**Don't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or becoming paralyzed because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale. So now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12-factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale while you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join. These are just growing pains. There's so much reading out there, so many opinions, different patterns, different hills that people will die on. Pick yours. Look at it like building out your own custom set of opinions. I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck. That's the nature of it.Lastly, if you find that your passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure you still want to go in that direction, but you're thinking ""okay, there's this whole other direction that's actually really cool,"" that's fine. The likelihood that you're going to change is just as likely as the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner. I've not been bored in almost two decades of programming. Each day it's more of the same but nothing is the same. No two days are alike. You get to express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely.So if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build. Immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day, even if it's just updating the README every single day until you pick a framework. Start building that part of your resume right away. Show you're active. Try to open a pull request on an open-source project. Go try to build up your HackerRank. Have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do. It'll make all the difference in holding this together for you. Best of luck to you out there.Edit: fixed several small grammatical and spelling errors due to voice to text",372,0.99,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1np9hg0/the_most_effective_way_to_learn_programming_is_to/,2025-09-24 11:21:51,2025-09-29 01:28:00

1nrrxml,How did you teach yourself programming when there was no internet/web?,spankinglyargho,learnprogramming,"Nowadays, we see so many people asking the same questions about ""how to learn to code"" in different ways on different platforms across the web. We see people trying to optimize their learning by choosing the best possible course (like maybe CS50 or The Odin Project or perhaps something else). Some even, perhaps, hyper optimize to such a degree that it leads to analysis paralysis and then they eventually quit programming as a whole.So, how did the early guys do it? There was no Reddit (or forums) back then. So did you hyper optimize your learning path or were you like ""let's pick a book and start doing""? How did you manage to learn a programming language (or programming in general) when there was no web (or perhaps when there weren't so many courses on Python, C, C++, Java, and Assembly)?Not trying to put anyone down (that applies to both the younger and the older generation).

It, however, won me “nerd status” among my schoolmates and peers. According to them, I was the one that truly knew how to program. These little projects were enough to land my first programming jobs.Things seem to be quite different now. My son will soon approach the teenage period, and with the current state of the industry, I’m hesitant whether it’s worth involving him in this field.Apparently, none of the average HR folks today would get impressed by a similar portfolio. You are supposed to develop an “app” just like “X”, that “solves something”, using the cloud infrastructure of a big corporation and the latest front-end framework, pushed by another corporation. This comes with a significant investment in a particular toolset, and requires heavy scaffolding, possibly assisted with LLMs. On the job market, you are not a “programmer” anymore.

I’ll spend 2 hours watching a React tutorial, follow along perfectly, even build the project. Then the next day when I try to implement something similar… blank. Like I never watched it.Started digging into why this happens and apparently there’s a name for it - the “forgetting curve.” Some German psychologist figured out we lose about 70% of new info within 24 hours. Fun.Here’s what I think is happening with programming tutorials specifically:We’re basically just watching someone else code. It feels like learning because we can follow along, but our brains aren’t actually doing the heavy lifting. It’s like watching someone lift weights and thinking you got stronger.Most tutorials also cram way too much into one session. I counted - the last Next.js tutorial I watched introduced 12 different concepts in 45 minutes. No wonder my brain tapped out.And we never go back. We watch once, maybe take some notes, then move on to the next shiny tutorial. But memory doesn’t work that way.So I’ve been experimenting with some stuff that actually seems to help:After watching a section, I pause and try to write down everything I remember without looking. Painful but effective.I also try to explain concepts out loud like I’m teaching someone. Sounds dumb but it forces you to actually understand vs just recognize.The biggest thing though - I go back to my notes after a few days. Not rewatching the video, just testing myself on what I wrote down.

I took some simple database courses years back in college and thought they were fun, and from just browsing, the work hours seem pretty concrete and work/life balance is pretty nice (from what I read).I would say i’m about ~15 - 20 hours in following a Udemy course that i’m nearing finishing. I just started doing some online “practice” like AnalystBuilder and I can confidently say I feel like maybe 1/2 of what I learned through udemy courses stuck lol. I’m not discouraged, but I am curious what to expect if I keep going down the rabbit hole.First off, i’m curious to what actual Data Engineers/Analysts think about starting to learn SQL now that AI had changed the game imo. I could imagine if AI scales like it has been in the last few years, in less than 10 years part of data analysis will be fully automated (like everything else probably). Whats the panic level in the industry if any? I know some engineering jobs are more resilient.More relevant to me and my learning process:How long would you say it takes to really grasp and understanding of syntax? To me it all seems very overwhelming, I have a feeling a lot of you will say you’ve been working with it for a decade and still reference the docs every day for simple stuff lol, but I mean for it to “click” when reading a question, instead of having to revisit material to jog your memory.What was the best way you learned? Videos? Real world problems (websites for practice), actual real world data? I’m open to suggestions, but i don’t want to waste my time with doing things like AnalystBuilder if there are better ways to get a real glimpse into the day in the life if that makes sense and will prepare me for an actual job.I am a college grad in Computer science (CIS), so i’m willing to bet just like all other CS jobs, its a brutal job market, are certs absolutely needed?

The structure is a weekly lecture given a professor, an assigned reading, and a problem set.They are generally self-paced. Some will grade your submissions, and some will even give you a certificate of completion, it's not worth much, but it can be motivating.**Harvard CS50** and friends (CS50P, CS50 AI, etc) — These serve as general introductions. They have been taken by thousand and are high quality. CS50 teaches you the basics of *C* (Week 1-5), *Python* (week 6), *SQL* (week 7), and finally some *HTML* with *Flask*. CS50P (Python) is similar but focuses on Python only, you cover the basics (conditionals, loops, exception, libraries, testing, I/O, and some OOP). If you sign up through EdX you can track your progress.# Text BasedThese courses are mostly text based, you read through a module then go practice an assignment.Popular courses include: The Odin Project, FullStack Open, FreeCodeCamp, and Code Academy.**The Odin Project** teaches you the basics of Web Development. The first part focuses on HTML, CSS, and JS. Then splits into either FullStack JS (React, Node, Express) or Fullstack Rails (React, Ruby). The final module offers tips on getting hired. They have a big discord community.**Fullstack Open** is another high quality resource focused on Web Development. It starts with the the basics of HTML & CSS, before quickly jumping into React. The next modules show you to work with NodeJS and express to build a backend.# BooksI'm a big fan books, anything from **O'Reilly**, **Manning**, or **Starch Press** is usually solid.Books like *Automate the Boring stuff with Python* are often recommended, you can download it for free.I learned C, C++, and Rust from books, ex: *Effective C*, *C++ Crash Course*, *The Rust Book*# Interactive**Scrimba** & **Bootdev** are websites that have interactive exercises, they follow a freemium model where some content is free, but you have to pay to unlock everything. I tired Scrimba and I was pretty impressed.# Others**100Devs** is another popular community with a large discord channel.

1nrbxvb,How to develop a technical vernacular/fluency in order to actually learn to develop projects and debug from scratch?,tree332,learnprogramming,"I have been really struggling at times with the advice to just learn programming by jumping into projects.I have to think inductively and I am not fully prepared, even when I feel I have done my best to memorize, but I must not be doing enough to memorize. Only until I can recite every fact mentioned to me in the slide and more am I ready for the exam, or even my homework.At the very least, trying to memorize all the given axioms(definitions, rules, properties, relationships)gives you a vernacular to communicate confusion with a practice problem more clearly than “I don’t know where to start. I don’t get this.”the problem is when I also don’t know what exactly to memorize, such as in programming which can be more laissez faire in teaching, you are told to just start coding in order to learn.  When I tried to look into whether I should take ‘intermediate’ and ‘advanced’ intro to x programming language courses online at the very least to develop more vocabulary to google implementation and debug effectively, I saw comments such as these:[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lj1ay9/stem\_student\_here\_should\_i\_master\_one\_programming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lj1ay9/stem_student_here_should_i_master_one_programming/)Don't focus on languages. Think of something fun (database, web app, data science project, whatever), research what languages fit the use case and just build it. Nothing beats the skills you gather from solving your own problems and they will mostly be transferrable to other technologies later on.THAT BEING SAID, if you really want to get deep into understanding programming languages from the ground up, get yourself a copy of ""C - A modern approach"" (K. N. King, available on the internet archive for free). It will teach you the most fundamental of all programming languages, C, but almost more importantly: You will understand every other language afterwards more easily, especially a lot of design decisions in C++, Java, Rust and many more.It has little exercises and some larger programming projects in it to directly apply the stuff you read about. The book might seem intimidating at 800 pages, but it's actually a rather swift read, there are just a lot of examples and additional explanations. [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1f7rhs9/how\_to\_learn\_advanced\_python/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1f7rhs9/how_to_learn_advanced_python/)OP, everyone so far except the duck saxophone guy is giving you shitty advice.You already know decorators exist. You've never used them. Do you think reading about other things that also exist will help you learn how to use them?Don't read a thing. **If you want to learn advanced programming, start working on an advanced project**. Aim too high.When you can't figure out how to do something or think that there must be an easier way to do this or that, then go look that up, read that, and implement it. Then go on programming.Reading advanced literature without programming yourself is useless. I tried to follow this advice to just make projects even when I felt I was just incoherently babbling when searching for implementation approaches  and googling errors & bugs. I mainly just got yelled at on stack overflow for asking trite questions I could have googled and posting overly specific  project case scenarios,  but I lacked the vocabulary to dissect  and google my problems in a  better way.I might as well just try going through dozens of “master python books” because at least it’s something different, I am like a baby pointing at food it wants without any better way to communicate and getting yelled at for it.  sometimes I don’t even fully understand the ‘food’(implementation) I want because I cannot describe ‘tastes’ or ‘ingredients’(don’t understand how to design the pseudocode/blueprints properly or  account for every needed feature)I just know: “it needs to be sour”  But similarly to  a person learning a second language you must also commit the axioms to memory to then be able to question and deduce.  It is just hard memorizing so many things at once.  How do I allocate time between rereading over and over, trying to ask a question to actively engage then going on a wikipedia rabbit hole of concepts I don’t understand or questions I lack the field terminology to phrase coherently, and I ultimately feel it is ridiculous even though I try to remind myself it is necessary.recall back to grammar classes. compared to learning vernacular which is just involuntary exposure to people speaking 24/7, grammar has to be established by rote practice- but also by reading books for exposure to information. I  just keep forgetting, especially in programming, but I don’t reread books, I usually rewatch intro to x programming language video and then start trying to google reference to implement a feature for a project.I don’t know how trying to design a project then awkwardly googling with no real certainty of what you are looking for is any different than tutorial hell.",4,0.75,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nrbxvb/how_to_develop_a_technical_vernacularfluency_in/,2025-09-26 20:22:47,2025-09-29 01:28:00

I know ""hard"" is subjective but would you suggest this language for beginners? It seems simpler than others but doesn't seem to have the same use as another broader language like python or C.3. Finally, how difficult is it front other conventional languages?

I'm a little more familiar with Python since I specialize in AI and had some focus on data science courses. I'm ok with Data Science technologies like R and Python but I'm not really as interested in analysing data as I am with AI. So I know where I want to go from here. I've found some things I need to focus on [Roadmap.sh](http://Roadmap.sh) but let me be honest I really am overwhelmed and lost where to go from here. There's just too many resources, frameworks, technologies and I don't know how to start from scratch.I feel like I wasted my past few years in Uni even though my GPA is decent because I usually forgot most things I learned after the course is over and never really applied it to projects. To add on, I'm just learning how to upload projects on github. I like solving problems and experimenting with AI especially back in one module I learnt on Computer Visions and Natural Language so I know I'm interested in that. So before I graduate, I really want to focus on building up skills and making projects.But here's the problem I hate reading theory and going back over basic foundations because I already understand the basics and it's boring to do pointless tutorials on websites like FreeCodeCamp or the likes. I'm currently just starting with smaller projects like [practisepython.org](http://practisepython.org) and learning CLI projects on [Roadmap.sh](http://Roadmap.sh) but even those are not going to help me learn AI models and technologies. I'm aware I can't just jump to that without practising coding on smaller projects like what I'm doing but I would also prefer to learn while doing some challenging projects that are not too hard but at the same time forces me to learn new things along the way. For example, I just started trying to build a chatbot using langchain documentation but even setting up the dependencies are a pain in the ass.I really want to learn and develop my AI skills before I graduate in a very time-efficient manner so I would appreciate on any advice, tips, resources that are not theory heavy/focused or boring tutorials.

I have been replacing OS-specific semaphores with calls into the new portability layer version, and have been mystified by how the semaphores were being used.Without going into specifics, the question I have is this: Is there an upper limit on the number of resources a semaphore initialized to control N resources can actually control? In the new implementation, it seems to me that even if the semaphore is controlling a single resource, if I call Post() 100 times, I can then call Wait() 100 times and the calling thread will never be blocked and we'll have 100 threads simultaneously using the protected resource.I would have expected that if I create a semaphore to control a single resource and then call Post() twice, the second call would fail because there isn't a second resource to release.Colleagues are telling me that it is normal for a semaphore to be able to be released an unlimited number of times.

The HIRE Act 2025 proposes a 25% tax on offshore spending, which would generate about $40 billion annually. That figure comes just from U.S. spending in India, before even considering other countries. Instead of disappearing overseas, that money would be reinvested here at home, funding apprenticeships, reskilling programs, and workforce training. In practice, that means more Americans getting the chance to learn in-demand tech skills, land better jobs, and actually compete for the roles that are currently being offshored.With the new $100K H-1B fees, companies will likely push even more jobs offshore. That’s why the HIRE Act matters, it’s the only effort on the table to regulate offshoring and redirect that money into building up our own workforce.Money-hungry U.S. companies keep chasing lower costs overseas instead of putting resources into developing Americans and strengthening the US economy.[HIRE Act 2025 (PDF)](https://www.moreno.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-HIRE-Act.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",983,0.84,489,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nnekhu/the_hire_act_2025_the_only_real_effort_to/,2025-09-22 05:57:29,2025-09-29 01:28:02

I think I could get more offers tbh but after I found the company I really liked I accepted an offer and stopped the interview process with the rest. I interviewed with Capital One, Visa, UKG, Amazon, Circle, Apollo, Citadel, FICO, GM and some no names or startups. That’s all to say that after reading reddit I was anxious to even apply but I think I got a decent amount of interviews and negotiated my offers to be either at the higher end of the salary range for the role or even above advertised. I do recognize it’s much harder for junior engineers these days but is there really a shortage for experienced engineers? I haven’t felt that.

At my job there is no real mentoring, company structure, training, or development. I feel mediocre because I can't contribute at the same level as a senior dev and I've been doing this for 5 years. I also feel like the actual coding part does not play to my natural skillset (I never coded as a kid, I didn't do well at math) and so I find I'm not picking up naturally (things light architecture and system design). This week my company said that everyone must be on track to be a senior developer, and must become a senior developer in an allotted amount of time (specifics of this haven't been provided yet). I know you might suggest that I do a bunch of side projects and weekend work, but I've got young kids and honestly no time for learning outside of work. I like my job, it pays the bills, but when I compare myself to the seniors I work with, I know I will never be as good of a developer.",215,0.92,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1np1wqx/5_years_innot_sure_im_cut_out_for_this/,2025-09-24 03:32:43,2025-09-29 01:28:02
1nsvv1z,PSA: LinkedIn and Indeed don't have all the jobs,jjzwork,cscareerquestions,"tldr; Find jobs that aren't on LinkedIn/Indeed and your chances of getting a job will dramatically improve.Some people know this, many don't: lots of jobs don't end up on LinkedIn and Indeed.* Sometimes companies intentionally don't post their jobs there because they don't want to be flooded by applications.* Sometimes LinkedIn just takes a few weeks or months to start scraping these companies because they are relatively small (15-100 employees).* Sometimes LinkedIn doesn't do a good job at scraping certain government/city/public sector job sites.If you're limiting yourself to the big sites then you are going to miss out on the jobs that don't get posted there. What's worse is that you will ONLY apply to the jobs that everyone and their dog is applying to, which means your competition will be 10x higher.Example: I recently came across an NYC startup hiring multiple software engineers remotely in Canada that is paying $240-$300k base for people with 4-10 years of experience. Their website has 3 positions listed but LinkedIn shows 0 jobs for their company.I know the above is true because I spend hours a week finding jobs for my job board and regularly find companies with 0 jobs on LinkedIn but multiple jobs on their career pages. My point is, you need to start thinking outside of the box when job searching, especially in today's environment. You can't expect to do the same thing everyone else is doing and to see different results.And job boards are just one source of finding job openings, there are a few others that most people don't even consider.

And it will make you feel that everything is hopeless.It's important for your mental health that you moderate this. Yes, the job market is bad, but the posts in this subreddit make it seem far worse than it is.Now for a **real talk** about some people...I've been going around helping people with their resumes and portfolios to fix potential issues, and one thing I have noticed is that there is a decent amount of people (not all) who could do a lot more to boost their chances but feel demotivated from the job market and have just given up too early.I'm talking people who have applied for tons of software jobs but don't have a single original complete project on their github, or who have just got their degree and have nothing else to back it up.Yes the job market is bad. Yes it is harder than it was a few years ago. No it is not impossible. While for a lot of people their resume and portfolio are strong, there is a decent amount who actually need some honesty and realize that part of the problem is them.The most recent one I saw was a guy saying the job market was cooked, the comments offering a lot of sympathy. But the guy had a mess of projects on his github in obscure niche areas of programming with no comments or READMEs or anything to help organize it or explain what it was. And then had one of the least concise resumes I'd seen, I had to read over half of it just to try and even figure out what tech skills he had. Yet had been complaining he hadn't been able to get a tech job despite trying for over a year. I was honest but kind about it and gave advice and told him to ask for honest advice from people rather than just getting sympathy.Before I get **downvoted into oblivion**, I am not saying this is true of everyone. It's just common enough from the posts I've seen in the last few weeks when I've looked at people's resumes and githubs/portfolios.* Have personal projects that are original. (Keep code copied from tutorials for learning, not for showing publicly)* Have tech skills that are relevant to jobs in your area.* Organize them neatly and with clear information for people to read.* Get your resume checked by different people. Do small projects with other people to show you can collaborate.* Help with open source projects to show you can meaningfully contribute to work that isn't yours.I am not denying at all that it's way harder than it use to be to land a tech job but it's not impossible either.",63,0.87,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nqip88/be_careful_how_much_doom_and_gloom_you_read_have/,2025-09-25 21:08:31,2025-09-29 01:28:02

1nrd1tc,"Beginning to think CS, and as a whole tech, just isn't for me",Iseith31,cscareerquestions,"I think I first start to get into programing was when I was 10? Using some Pascal IDE on my old Windows XP (I'm not that old at all, just grew up poor), that I hacked together from parts of all the other broken computers I had.I always loved to fix things, break things, then fix them again. Computers and programming is actually what got me into fixing other things. Electronics, then cars, then I even started building stuff (like carpentry). I guess it sort of inspired me to be a ""life long learner"".For work as a teen, I went towards anything where you could fix stuff, or solve a problem people had. So I worked as a trades assistant in a variety of differrnt trades, and a machine operator until I had the money to go university to study CS, with the idea that this was going to be it for me as this as what I'd *always* done.What I noticed along the way with study is my urge to code in my own time wained as I studied. As well as this, I guess particularly in the last 10 years, I've developed a general disinterest in tech advancements and new software. To be honest, I resent a lot of it, because most of the stuff I inevitably have to use feels convoluted, old reddit > new reddit, type thing. Now that I do have some work experience I've realized one important thing I never considered:**Problem solving in the realm of software development is nothing like problem solving for yourself, or small clients** If I fix a thing for a client (as a tradesman), it's immediately rewarding. You're helping someone with something they can't provide themselves, and it's usually something they need. It's immediately rewarding (for me).The process of building software for a company, who's problem is they want/need more money, does not provide me with that same sense of reward and satisfaction.Even the whole idea of ""continuous improvement"" irritates me. Constantly changing stuff for the sake of... I'm not really sure? And often in the process, just making the product worse.

Should I go back for a degree?",Caramel-Makiatto,cscareerquestions,"I'm entirely self taught, I picked up a project 8 years ago that ended up getting me a job offer related to the project after two years of working on it. I learned entirely on the go, picked everything up as I needed it for the work being done. But now the company I'm with is slowly dissolving and likely has only a few years left and I personally may have even less than that before they just decide to lay me off to help them delay the inevitable.The thing is, right now I have extremely good savings and virtually zero debt. I own my home with no mortgage to pay, my utility bills are cheap, own my car, and have zero reason to move from where I am considering how good the cost of living is and how much of my family is around me. I don't like the idea of moving for work.So my hope was to find literally any local-ish tech job or something fully remote (but lol, all remote jobs are inundated with applicants), there's a decent amount on offer because I'm only an hour out from a major city and right next to it is a sort of 'corporate hub' that has all of the state's big businesses. I didn't give a shit if I'm making half the pay of a cs newly grad, I applied for literally everything that I thought I could do. Ended up with around 80 applications sent, using a resume my buddy who's a team lead for a big tech company helped me build up with more than enough decent projects listed.In the end I got three interviews, all of them were technical focused. None of them went well, they all seemed to immediately acknowledge that I don't have a degree and went really hard on testing the limits of my knowledge. Things that I've never had to learn, like databases or algorithms. I knew they were over the moment they started throwing vocabulary at me that I had never even dreamed of. I still did my best, hoping to God maybe they were just pushing my buttons to test me, but nope, didn't end up working.So I go back to my buddy and his advice was basically to check out WGU, told me that I'd probably be able to finish a degree in a decent amount of time, especially if I optimize credits with Sophia and study (the website, not the act of studying). That I'd be able to rush through courses that cover topics I already know and fill in gaps of knowledge with courses I don't already know.I do think it's a decent idea, but my alternative is to just pick up more certs and start to learn topics outside of my knowledge zone, and that would probably end up taking less time, effort and money, but I have no idea if that's even going to make it any easier to continue my career.",22,0.87,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ns0962/self_taught_6yoe_but_large_gaps_in_knowledge/,2025-09-27 16:57:29,2025-09-29 01:28:02

They think the process will take 2-3 months.So, they want me to start as a US-based contractor. Problem is, they're only offering me $8,333/month. That barely covers my costs, let alone they expect me to pay for the visa (almost $7k) and they expect me to pay my own travel back and forth for their monthly in-person in London (they said they'd pay my flights in the interview).I pushed back and they offered $10k/mo, but this is still so low.

I'll basically have to dip into my savings to work for them, they don't seem to understand the costs that a contractor incurs. The CEO gave some chat about bootstrapping it with limited cashflow, but it's a spinoff from an existing company that's been around for 70 years, so unless he has mismanaged that company they should be able to offer decent comp.Also, they were aware from when I started interviewing in July that I would not be based fulltime in London due to my caring responsibilities in California. I don't even have a flat in London at the minute. They said they'd cover flights and I'd cover accommodation. The market is bad so okay. But I have my mom's dog to care for in California and I live an 8 hour drive from a big airport, so I need parking or an uber from a relative's house or something -- essentially getting to/from airports will cost as much as an economy flight. The UK salary offered is 80k, which will seem low here but trust me, it's not bad. I don't have a ton of experience.That's the other weird thing, I don't have a ton of experience, but they think I'll be fine in essentially a CTO role for this startup. I'm the sole SWE. So on the one hand 80k GBP is not horrible in the UK for my experience level; on the other hand given the amount of responsibility it is low.But anyways, the main issue is what to do about the lowball contractor rate for California. I can't afford to live on that and fly to London and pay the visa. They could get the visa sponsorship in 10 days, but they're not willing to rush, so I'm essentially eating that cost while they dilly dally.But the market is so crap and I don't have much experience so I feel I have to take it. Any advice would be super welcome.

(web dev grad),Massive_Instance_452,cscareerquestions,"I've been learning web development these last few months (after switching from game dev) and I based it off what languages and tools seemed to be most common for jobs in my area. Which looked to be React, .Net, Node.js and Typescript.What I am finding while learning is that there are a lot of other frameworks/libraries (apologies if I am using the wrong terms) that are used with these. Like Next.js, Tailwind, Zustard, React Query etc. I've ended up learning a lot more than I intended to try and make sure I can make some portfolio pieces that more closely resemble what a real app might actually be using.My problem is that these frameworks make things easier and I am unsure if that means I am effectively missing some fundamentals because its making it easier for me, and that I should try to use them less. Or do you think it doesn't really matter?It's kind of like the AI argument where if AI makes it all then it means I haven't really made it myself, just to a lesser extent. But it also seems silly to make it harder for myself if that's not how it would really be in an actual job.The job listings in my area don't specifically mention what framworks/libraries they use but I wouldn't really expect them to either. And at the same time I'd be surprised if they didn't use them as well but there are also so many different frameworks and options that I feel there is a decent chance that whatever I use, wherever I eventually get a job might use completely different ones.So my question is, should I try to keep to just kind of 'pure' React, Node, etc or do you think it doesn't really matter to be using these frameworks/libraries?",16,0.87,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nnzhs4/should_i_avoid_using_a_lot_of_frameworkslibraries/,2025-09-22 21:42:09,2025-09-29 01:28:02

When asked, he mentioned that a promotion could be considered in my next annual review.I don't think this compensation reflects the value I've brought to the company or my team. This raise puts me at 78k while the position's listed salary band is 70-90k. I expected to be at the very least in the upper half of this salary band. I've also been praised for my work by many senior colleagues, even frequently mentioning that they think I deserve a promotion. All this makes me feel that I'm severely undercompensated.I'm not sure what my strategy should be when walking into his office on Monday.

1nptyrk,"How viable is it to land a job as a UX Engineer or Frontend Designer in 2025, and why is it there are almost no open vacancies for these roles?",totisketches,cscareerquestions,"As someone with a decent background in UI/UX design and frontend development, I have always wondered why is it so difficult to find open vacancies for these type of hybrid-skill roles, and how well-accepted are they within the industry now with the AI hype that is changing the way developers test and ship new digital products. For the past few years I have had good jobs both as a designer and as a frontend developer, and things seemed to go well for me on both ends (financially and career wise). This year, however –with the surge of AI–, I no longer have a stable job and find myself lost in such a competitive market. I am trying to find ways to stay relevant in this aggressive, quick-changing industry, which has led me to explore new opportunities in other not-so-competitive areas and job positions. So my question for all of you is, why do you think these two roles haven't gained as much visibility yet, and what advice would you give to someone like me who stands right in the middle between design and development, with no formal CS-related education?Thank you for reading.edit: typos",5,0.78,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nptyrk/how_viable_is_it_to_land_a_job_as_a_ux_engineer/,2025-09-25 01:29:02,2025-09-29 01:28:02

1nsupf1,Struggling with invisible projects and lack of recognition,Ok-Road5378,cscareerquestions,"I recently started a new job as a project manager, along with a few other new colleagues. What’s been bothering me is how differently things are playing out for me compared to them.While my colleagues immediately got assigned very visible projects — lots of cross-department meetings, presentations with senior leadership, etc. — I was given “invisible” projects: mostly administrative and conceptual work like knowledge management and internal online tasks.The issue is, I’m often left out of relevant discussions that would actually help me do my job. For example, I was tasked with building a basic knowledge management structure for our team. Later, I found out by accident that an entire department-wide wiki platform is about to be launched soon. That made my work feel redundant and pretty frustrating.On top of that, any successes I’ve had are never mentioned in meetings. But when colleagues on visible projects make progress, even small wins, they get thanked and publicly acknowledged right away. It’s demotivating, and I can’t help but feel inferior — even though I came in highly motivated and with solid prior experience.Another weird part: when I first joined, I was assigned to a different project. I tried to approach it like a project manager — getting an overview, structuring the situation. But I was told, *“That’s the manager’s responsibility,”* and then reassigned. The strange thing is, the other project managers are doing exactly that, and for them it’s fine.Right now I feel like I’m being sidelined.

In that order.Given this background, which programming paths or job roles would make the best use of my skills? And would be easier to start with? It seems like no matter how much I improve, its never enough, and the bar keeps raising.
