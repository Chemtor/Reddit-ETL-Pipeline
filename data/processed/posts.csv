1nuj7jq,We just shipped Apache Gravitino 1.0 – an open-source alternative to Unity Catalog,Q-U-A-N,dataengineering,"Hey folks,As part of the Apache Gravitino project, I’ve been contributing to what we call a **“catalog of catalogs”** – a unified metadata layer that sits on top of your existing systems. With 1.0 now released, I wanted to share why I think it matters for anyone in the Databricks / Snowflake ecosystem.**Where Gravitino differs from Unity Catalog by Databricks*** **Open & neutral**: Unity Catalog is excellent inside the Databricks ecosystem. And it was not open sourced until last year. Gravitino is Apache-licensed, open-sourced from day 1, and works across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, S3, ML model registries, and more.* **Extensible connectors**: Out-of-the-box connectors for multiple platforms, plus an API layer to plug into whatever you need.* **Metadata-driven actions**: Define compaction/TTL policies, run governance jobs, or enforce PII cleanup directly inside Gravitino. Unity Catalog focuses on access control; Gravitino extends to automated actions.* **Agent-ready**: With the MCP server, you can connect LLMs or AI agents to metadata. Unity Catalog doesn’t (yet) expose metadata for conversational use.**What’s new in 1.0*** Unified access control with enforced RBAC across catalogs/schemas.* Broader ecosystem support (Iceberg 1.9, StarRocks catalog).* Metadata-driven action system (statistics + policy + job engine).* MCP server integration to let AI tools talk to metadata directly.Here’s a simplified architecture view we’ve been sharing:*(diagram of catalogs, schemas, tables, filesets, models, Kafka topics unified under one metadata brain)***Why I’m excited** Gravitino doesn’t replace Unity Catalog or Snowflake’s governance. Instead, it complements them by acting as a **layer above multiple systems**, so enterprises with hybrid stacks can finally have one source of truth.Repo: [https://github.com/apache/gravitino](https://github.com/apache/gravitino)Would love feedback from folks who are deep in Databricks or Snowflake or any other data engineering fields.

1nte7px,Are big take home projects a red flag?,pimmen89,dataengineering,"Many months ago I was rejected after doing a take home project. My friends say I dodged a bullet but it did a number on my self esteem.I was purposefully tasked with building a ppipeline in a technology I didn’t know to see how well I learn new tech, and I had to use formulas from a physics article they supplied to see how well I learn new domains (I’m not a physicist). I also had to evaluate the data quality.It took me about half a day to learn the tech through tutorials and examples, and a couple of hours to find all the incomplete rows, missing rows, and duplicate rows. I then had to visit family for a week, so I only had a day to work on it.When I talked with the company again they praised my code and engineering, but they were disappointed that I didn’t use the physics article to find out which values are reasonable and then apply outlier detection, filters or something else to evaluate the output better.I was a bit taken aback because that would’ve required a lot more work for a take home project that I purposefully was not prepared for. I felt like I am not that good since I needed so much time to learn the tech and domain, but my friendstell me I dodged a bullet because if they expect this much from a take home project they would’ve worked me to the bone once I was on the payroll.What do you guys think?

In November 2023, NHS England awarded Palantir a £330m contract to deploy a Federated Data Platform that aims to provide “joined up” NHS services. The NHS has many operational challenges around data such as the frequency of data for in-day decisions in hospitals and consuming health services in multiple regions or hospital departments because of siloed data. As a Platform Engineer now, having built data platforms and conducted cloud migrations in a few UK private sectors and coming to understand how much vendor lock in can have significant ramifications for an organisation. I’m astounded at the decision to see a public service consuming a platform with complete vendor lock in.This seems completely bonkers; please tell me you can host Palantir services in your own cloud accounts and within your own internal networks! From what I’ve read, Palantir is just a shiny wrapper built on Spark and Delta Lake hosted on k8’s with the choice of leaving insanely hard. What value-add does Palantir provide that I’m missing here? The NHS has been continually shifting towards the cloud for the last ten years and from my point of view, this was simply an architectural problem to solve to federate NHS trusts rather than buy into a noddy spark wrapper?

This will likely grow to 27, 45, 53, ... event types because of tracking niche feature interactions. Volume-wise, we are talking hundreds of millions of events daily.2 pain points I'd love input on:1. Every event lands in its own table, but we are rarely interested in one event. Unioning all to create this sequence of events feels rough as event types grow. Is it? Any scalable patterns people swear by?2. We have no explicit link between events, e.g. views and clicks, or clicks and page loads; causality is guessed by joining on many fields or connecting timestamps. How is this commonly solved? Should we push back for source-sided identifiers to handle this?We are optimizing for scalability, usability, and simplicity for analytics. Really curious about different perspectives on this.**EDIT:** To provide additional information, we do have a sessionId. However, within a session we still rely on timestamps for inference. ""Did this view lead to this click?"" Unlike an additional, common identifier between views and clicks specifically for example (like a hook that 1:1 matches both). I am wondering if the latter is common.Also, we actually are plugging into existing solutions like Segment, RudderStack, Snowplow, Amplitude (one of them not all 4) that provides us the ability to create structured tracking plans for events. Every event defined in this plan currently lands as a separate table in BQ. It's then that we start to make sense of it, potentially creating one big table of them by unioning. Am I missing possibilities, e.g. having them land as one table in the first place?

1ntw5sv,"Pontoon, an open-source data export platform",alexdriedger,dataengineering,"Hi, we're Alex and Kalan, the creators of Pontoon ([https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon)). Pontoon is an **open source, self-hosted, data export platform**. We built Pontoon from the ground up for the use case of shipping data products to enterprise customers. Check out our [demo ](https://app.storylane.io/share/onova7c23ai6)or try it out with docker [here](https://pontoon-data.github.io/Pontoon/getting-started/quick-start/).While at our prior roles as data engineers, we’ve both felt the pain of data APIs. We either had to spend weeks building out data pipelines in house or spend a lot on ETL tools like [Fivetran](https://www.fivetran.com/). However, there were a few companies that offered data syncs that would sync directly to our data warehouse (eg. Redshift, Snowflake, etc.), and when that was an option, we always chose it. This led us to wonder “**Why don’t more companies offer data syncs?**”. So we created Pontoon to be a platform that any company can self host to provide data syncs to their customers!We designed Pontoon to be:* **Easily Deployed**: We provide a single, self-contained [Docker image](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon/pkgs/container/pontoon%2Fpontoon-unified)* **Support Modern Data Warehouses:** Supports Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, (we're working on S3, GGS)* **Multi-cloud**: Can send data from any cloud to any cloud* **Developer Friendly:** Data syncs can also be built via the API* **Open Source:** Pontoon is free to use by anyoneUnder the hood, we use [Apache Arrow ](https://arrow.apache.org/)and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy) to move data. Arrow has been fantastic, being very helpful with managing the slightly different data / column types between different databases. Arrow has also been really performant, averaging around 1 million records per minute on our benchmark.In the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:* Adding support for DBT models to make adding data models easier* UX improvements like better error messaging and monitoring of data syncs* More sources and destination (S3, GCS, Databricks, etc.)In the longer-term, we want to make data sharing as easy as possible. As data engineers, we sometimes felt like second class citizens with how we were told to get the data we needed - “just loop through this api 1000 times”, “you probably won’t get rate limited” (we did), “we can schedule an email to send you a csv every day”. We want to change how modern data sharing is done and make it simple for everyone.Give it a try [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon) and let us know if you have any feedback.

It's expensive as shit, slow to work in, complicated to deploy customizations to. Worst of all, everyone in your company heavily relies on data export for reporting. Unfortunately getting that data has been an agonizing process since *forever*. The timeline (give or take) has been something like this:**ODATA (circa 2017)** \- Paintfully slow and just plain stupid for any serious data export. \- Relies on *URLs* for paging.. \- Completely unusable if you had more than toy-sized data.**BYOD (2017-2020)** “Bring Your Own Database” aka *Bring Your Own Pain.* \- No delta feed just brute-force emptied and inserted data again and again. \- Bogged down performance of the entire system while exports ran until batch servers were introduced. You had to stagger the timing of exports and run cleanup jobs. \- You could only export ""entities"" , custom tables required you to deploy packages. \- You had to manage everything (schema, indexes, perf, costs).**Export to Data Lake (2021–2023)** \- Finally, the least bad option. Just dumped CSV files into ADLS. \- You had to parse out the data using Synapse which was slow \- Not perfect, but at least it was predictable to build pipelines on. Eventually some delta functionality hacks were implemented.**Fabric (2023 → today)** **-** Scrap all that, because FU. Everything must go into Fabric now: \- Missing columns, messed up enums, table schemas don't match, missing rows etc. \- **Forced** deprication of Export to Data Lake, alienating and enraging all their customers causing them to lose all trust, causing panic \- More expensive in every way, from data storage, to parquet conversion \- Fabric still in alpha. Buggy as shit. Limited T-SQL scope. Fragile and can cause loss of data. \- A hopeless development team on the Microsoft payroll that don't solve anything and outright lie and pretend everything is working and that this is so much better than what we had before.In practice, every few years an organization has to re-adapt their entire workflow. Rebuild reports, views and whatnot. Hundreds of hours of work. All of this because Microsoft refuses to allow access to production database or read-only replicas. To your own data.

1nvialm,Git branching with dbt... moving from stage/uat environment to prod?,SeaYouLaterAllig8tor,dataengineering,"So, we have multiple dbt projects at my employer, one which has three environments (dev, stage and prod). The issue we're having is merging from the staging env to prod. For reference, in most of our other projects, we simply have dev and prod. Every branch gets tested and reviewed in a PR (we also have a CI environment and job that runs and checks to make sure nothing will break in Prod from changes being implemented) and then merged into a main branch, which is Production. A couple months back we implemented ""stage"" or a UAT environment for one of primary/largest dbt projects. The environment works fine the issue is that in git, once a developer's PR is reviewed and approved in dev and their code is merged into stage, it gets merged into a single stage branch in git. This is somewhat problematic since we'll typically end up with a backlog of changes over time which all need to go to Prod, but not all changes are tested/UAT'd at the same time. So, you end up having some changes that are ready for prod while others are awaiting UAT review. Since all changes in stage exist in a single branch, anything that was merged from dev to stage has to go to Prod all at once. I've been trying to figure out if there's a way to ""cherry pick"" a handful of commits in the stage branch and merge only those to prod in a PR. A colleague suggested using git releases to do this functionality but that doesn't seem to be (based on videos I've watched) what we need. How are people handling this type of functionality? Once your changes go to your stage/uat environment do you have a way of handling merging individual commits to production?",14,0.86,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nvialm/git_branching_with_dbt_moving_from_stageuat/,2025-10-01 19:41:52,2025-10-04 01:21:49

1ntjg60,Is flattening an event_param struct in bigquery the best option for data modelling?,PalaceCarebear,dataengineering,"In BQ, I have firebase event logs in a date-sharded table which I'm set up an incremental dbt job to reformat as a partitioned table.The event_params contain different keys for different events, and sometimes the same event will have different keys depending on app-version and other context details.I'm using dbt to build some data models on these events, and figure that flattening out the event params into one big table with a column for each param key will make querying most efficient. Especially for events that I'm not sure what params will be present, this will let me see everything present without any unknowns. The models will have an incremental load that add new columns on schema change - whenever a new param is introduced.Does this approach seem sound? I know the structs must be used because they are more efficient, and I'm worried I might be taking the path of least resistance and most compute.",5,0.86,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ntjg60/is_flattening_an_event_param_struct_in_bigquery/,2025-09-29 14:26:20,2025-10-04 01:21:49

1nt7qu1,Introducing Pixeltable: Open Source Data Infrastructure for Multimodal Workloads,Norqj,dataengineering,"**TL;DR**: Open-source **declarative data infrastructure** for multimodal AI applications. Define what you want computed once, engine handles incremental updates, dependency tracking, and optimization automatically. Replace your vector DB + orchestration + storage stack with one `pip install`. Built by folks behind Parquet/Impala + ML infra leads from Twitter/Airbnb/Amazon and founding engineers of MapR, Dremio, and Yellowbrick.We found that working with multimodal AI data sucks with traditional tools. You end up writing tons of imperative Python and glue code that breaks easily, tracks nothing, doesn't perform well without custom infrastructure, or requires stitching individual tools together.* What if this fails halfway through?* What if I add one new video/image/doc?* What if I want to change the model?**With Pixeltable you define what you want, engine figures out how:** import pixeltable as pxt # Table with multimodal column types (Image, Video, Audio, Document) t = pxt.create_table('images', {'input_image': pxt.Image}) # Computed columns: define transformation logic once, runs on all data from pixeltable.functions import huggingface # Object detection with automatic model management t.add_computed_column( detections=huggingface.detr_for_object_detection( t.input_image, model_id='facebook/detr-resnet-50' ) ) # Extract specific fields from detection results t.add_computed_column(detections_labels=t.detections.labels) # OpenAI Vision API integration with built-in rate limiting and async management from pixeltable.functions import openai t.add_computed_column( vision=openai.vision( prompt=""Describe what's in this image."", image=t.input_image, model='gpt-4o-mini' ) ) # Insert data directly from an external URL # Automatically triggers computation of all computed columns t.insert({'input_image': 'https://raw.github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/release/docs/resources/images/000000000025.jpg'}) # Query - All data, metadata, and computed results are persistently stored results = t.select(t.input_image, t.detections_labels, t.vision).collect()**Why This Matters Beyond Computer Vision and ML Pipelines:**Same declarative approach works for agent/LLM infrastructure and context engineering: from pixeltable.functions import openai # Agent memory that doesn't require separate vector databases memory = pxt.create_table('agent_memory', { 'message': pxt.String, 'attachments': pxt.Json }) # Automatic embedding index for context retrieval memory.add_embedding_index( 'message', string_embed=openai.embeddings(model='text-embedding-ada-002') ) # Regular UDF tool @pxt.udf def web_search(query: str) -> dict: return search_api.query(query) # Query function for RAG retrieval @pxt.query def search_memory(query_text: str, limit: int = 5): """"""Search agent memory for relevant context"""""" sim = memory.message.similarity(query_text) return (memory .order_by(sim, asc=False) .limit(limit) .select(memory.message, memory.attachments)) # Load MCP tools from server mcp_tools = pxt.mcp_udfs('http://localhost:8000/mcp') # Register all tools together: UDFs, Query functions, and MCP tools tools = pxt.tools(web_search, search_memory, *mcp_tools) # Agent workflow with comprehensive tool calling agent_table = pxt.create_table('agent_conversations', { 'user_message': pxt.String }) # LLM with access to all tool types agent_table.add_computed_column( response=openai.chat_completions( model='gpt-4o', messages=[{ 'role': 'system', 'content': 'You have access to web search, memory retrieval, and various MCP tools.' }, { 'role': 'user', 'content': agent_table.user_message }], tools=tools ) ) # Execute tool calls chosen by LLM from pixeltable.functions.anthropic import invoke_tools agent_table.add_computed_column( tool_results=invoke_tools(tools, agent_table.response) ) etc..No more manually syncing vector databases with your data. No more rebuilding embeddings when you add new context. What I've shown:* **Regular UDF**: `web_search()` \- custom Python function* **Query function**: `search_memory()` \- retrieves from Pixeltable tables/views* **MCP tools**: `pxt.mcp_udfs()` \- loads tools from MCP server* **Combined registration**: `pxt.tools()` accepts all types* **Tool execution**: `invoke_tools()` executes whatever tools the LLM chose* **Context integration**: Query functions provide RAG-style context retrievalThe LLM can now choose between web search, memory retrieval, or any MCP server tools automatically based on the user's question.**Why does it matter?*** **Incremental processing** \- only recompute what changed* **Automatic dependency tracking** \- changes propagate through pipeline* **Multimodal storage** \- Video/Audio/Images/Documents/JSON/Array as first-class types* **Built-in vector search** \- no separate ETL and Vector DB needed* **Versioning & lineage** \- full data history tracking and operational integrity**Good for**: AI applications with mixed data types, anything needing incremental processing, complex dependency chains**Skip if**: Purely structured data, simple one-off jobs, real-time streamingWould love feedback/2cts!

1nu5761,Lake Formation Column Security Not Working with DataZone/SageMaker Studio & Redshift,XxThatWeirdGuyxX,dataengineering,"Hey all,I've hit a wall on what seems like a core use case for the modern AWS data stack, and I'm hoping someone here has seen this specific failure mode before. I've been troubleshooting for days and have exhausted the official documentation.My Goal (What I'm trying to achieve): An analyst logs into AWS via IAM Identity Center. They open our Amazon DataZone project (which uses the SageMaker Unified Studio interface). They run a SELECT * FROM customers query against a Redshift external schema. Lake Formation should intercept this and, based on their group membership, return only the 2 columns they are allowed to see (revenue and signup_date).The Problem (The ""Smoking Gun""): The user (analyst1) can log in and access the project. However, the system is behaving as if Trusted Identity Propagation (TIP) is completely disabled, even though all settings appear correct. I can prove this with two states: 1.If I give the project's execution role (datazone_usr_role_...) SELECT in Lake Formation: The query runs, but it returns ALL columns. The user's fine-grained permission is ignored. 2.If I revoke SELECT from the execution role: The query fails with TABLE_NOT_FOUND: Table '...customers' does not exist. The Data Explorer UI confirms the user can't see any tables. This proves Lake Formation is only ever seeing the service role's identity, never the end user's. The Architecture: •Identity: IAM Identity Center (User: analyst1, Group: Analysts). •UI: Amazon DataZone project using a SageMaker Unified Domain. •Query Engine: Amazon Redshift with an external schema pointing to Glue. •Data Catalog: AWS Glue. •Governance: AWS Lake Formation. What I Have Already Done (The Exhaustive List): I'm 99% sure this is not a basic permissions issue. We have meticulously configured every documented prerequisite for TIP: •Created a new DataZone/SageMaker Domain specifically with IAM Identity Center authentication.•Enabled Domain-Level TIP: The ""Enable trusted identity propagation for all users on this domain"" checkbox is checked. •Enabled Project Profile-Level TIP: The Project Profile has the enableTrustedIdentityPropagationPermissions blueprint parameter set to True. •Created a NEW Project: The project we are testing was created after the profile was updated with the TIP flag. •Updated the Execution Role Trust Policy: The datazone_usr_role_... has been verified to include sts:SetContext in its trust relationship for the sagemaker.amazonaws.com principal. •Assigned the SSO Application: The Analysts group is correctly assigned to the Amazon SageMaker Studio application in the IAM Identity Center console. •Tried All LF Permission Combos: We have tried every permutation of Lake Formation grants to the user's SSO role (AWSReservedSSO_...) and the service role (datazone_usr_role_...). The result is always one of the two failure states described above.My Final Question: Given that every documented switch for enabling Trusted Identity Propagation has been flipped, what is the final, non-obvious, expert-level piece of the puzzle I am missing? Is there a known bug or a subtle configuration in one of these places? •The Redshift external schema itself? •The DataZone ""Data Source"" connection settings? •A specific IAM permission missing from the user's Permission Set that's needed to carry the identity token? •A known issue with this specific stack (DataZone + Redshift + LF)?I'm at the end of my rope here and would be grateful for any insights from someone who has successfully built similar architecture.

1ntevmj,Is there any need for Data Quality/QA Analyst role?,anyfactor,dataengineering,"Because I think I would like to do that.I like looking at data, though I no longer work professionally in a data analytics or data engineering role. However, I still feel like I could bring value in that area, on a fraction scale. I wonder if there is a role like a Data QA Analyst as a sidehustle/fractional role.My plan is to pitch the idea that I will write the analytics code that evaluates the quality of data pipelines every day. I think in day-to-day DE operation, the tests folks write are mostly about pipeline health. With everyone integrating AI-based transformation, there is value in having someone test the output.So, I was wondering if data quality analysis is even a thing? I think this is not a role to have someone entirely dedicated to full-time, but rather someone familiar with the feature or product to data analytics test code and look at data.My plan is to:- Stare the at the data produced from DE operations- Come up with different questions and tests cases- Write simple code for those tests cases- And flag them to DE or production sideWhen I was doing web scraping work, I used to write operations that simply scraped the data. Whenever security measures were enforced, the automation program I used was smart enough to adapt - utilizing tricks like fooling captchas or rotating proxies. However, I have recently learned that in flight ticket data scraping, if the system detects a scraping operation in progress, premiums are dynamically added to the ticket prices. They do not raise any security measures, but instead corrupt the data from the source.If you are running a large-scale data scraping operation, it is unreasonable to expect the person doing the scraping to be aware of these issues. The reality is that you need someone to develop an test case that can monitor pricing data volatility to detect abnormalities. Most Data Analysts simply take the data provided by Data Engineers at face value and do not conduct a thorough analysis of it and nor should they.But then again, this is just an idea. Please let me know what you think. I might pitch this idea to my employer.

Keep in mind late 2020 to early 2021 had a massive hype of online ML courses and thats how I forayed into the world of Python.Given its high-level and massive community made it easier to understand a lot of concepts and it has a library for the most random shit you'd wanna not code yourself.

(Primarily because of not having any industry experience with SQL and Git, as well as QA with unit testing/TDD. These were just concepts I've about).To put it frankly I was/am extremely underconfident of being able to build reliable code that can be used in the real world. But I have a very stubborn attitude and for better or for worse that has pushed me. My Python knowledge and my subject expertise gave me an advantage to quickly understand high level ML/DL topics to train and experiment with models, but I always enjoyed data engineering i.e., building the pipelines that feed the right data to AI.But I constantly feel like I am lacking. I started small[ish] since last December. MY mom runs a small cafe but we struggled to keep track of financials. Few reasons being, barebones POS system, with a basic analytics dashboard, handwritten inventory tracking, no accurate insights from sales through delivery partners. I initially thought I could just export the excel files and clean and analyze it in Python. But there were a lot of issues and so I picked up Postgres (open-source few!) with the basics (upto Joins, I use CTEs cause for the life of me I don't see myself using views etc.). The data totals up i.e., from all data sources to ~100k rows. I used sqlalchemy to pushed the cleaning datasets to a postgres database and I used duckdb for in memory transformations to build the fact tables (3 of them for the orders, items, and added financial expenses).This was way more tedious than Ive explained. Primarily due to a lot of issues like duplicated invoice no.s (the POS system was restarted this year on the advice of my mom, but thats another story for another day), basically no definitive primary key (created a composite key with the date), the delivery partners order ids are not shown in the same report as the master report, and so on. Without getting much into detail,Here is my current situation and why I have asked this question on this thread:I was using Gemini to help me structure the Python code I wrote in my notebook and write the SQL queries (only to realize it was not upto the mark so I pretty much wrote 70% of the CTE myself) and used duckdb engine to query the data from the staging tables directly into a fact table. But I learnt all these terminologies because of Gemini. I just didnt share any financial data with it which is probably why it gave me the garbage[ish] query. But the point being I learnt that. I was setting the data types configs using Pandas and I didn't create any tables in SQL it was directly mapped by SQLalchemy.Then I came across dimension tables, data marts, etc. I feel like I am damn close and I can pick this up but the learning feels extremely ad hoc and I keep doubting my existing code infrastructure a lot.So my question is should I continue to learn like this (making a ridiculously insane amount of mistake only to realize there are existing theories on how to model data, transform data, etc., later on). Or is it wise to actually take on a certification course? I also have zero actual cloud knowledge (have just tinkered with BigQuery on Googles Cloud skill boos courses)As much as it frustrates me I love seeing data coming together like to provide useful, viable information as an output. But I feel like my knowledge is my limitation.I would love to hear your inputs, personal experiences, book reccos (I am a better visual learner tbh). Most of what I can find have very basic intros to Python, SQL, etc. and yes I can always be better with my basics but if I start off like and get bored I know I am going to slack off and never finish the course.I think weirdly I am asking people to rate my level (cant believe im seeking validation on a data engg thread) and suggest any good learning sources.

Its a desktop app that lets you search stuff intelligently. e.g. Put all your grocery bills and find out how much you spent on milk?The architecture is different. Instead of using a vector Database, I went with a different approach. I used a tag based solution. The process looks like this.Ingestion side:1. Upload a doc and trigger ingestion agent2. ingestion agent calls the LLM to creates relevant tags. These tags are stored in a sqllite db with the relevant tags.Query side: Running a query triggers two agent retrieval agent and post\_processor agent.1. Retrieval agent processes the query with all available tags and extracts relevant tags using LLM2. Post processor agent searches the sqllite db to get all docs with the tags and extracts useful content.3. After extracting relevant content post processor agent does any math operation. In the grocery case, if it finds milk in 10 reciepets. It adds them returns result.Tag based architecture seems pretty accurate for small scale use case like mine. Let me know your thoughts.

I’m in a decent position to move up.The company is big but my team is small (1 manager, 1 senior, 2 juniors). It’s generally a good place to work, though promotions and recognition are quite slow — most people move internally to progress. As the other junior and senior are on a single project, I'm doing all others currently.I normally get bored after about a year in a job, but I’ve been here for 2 years and still enjoy most of the work despite a few frustrations.Current situation:My girlfriend lives in Germany (we’ve been together for 4 years), and I want to move there. My current job doesn’t allow working abroad, so I’ll need to find something a way to make it happen. I do fortunately have EU citizenshipI’ve had a few opportunites in Germany. Some looked promising but didn’t work out (e.g. they needed someone to start immediately, or misrepresented parts of the process). Overall, though, I seem to get decent interest.Main issue:A lot of roles in Germany require a degree (I’m working on one but don’t have it yet).Many jobs also want fluent German. Mine is still pretty basic, but I’m learning.I'm considering:EU contracting - I like the idea of doing different projects every 6–12 months while living in Germany. I haven’t looked properly into the legal/tax side yet, but it sounds like it could fit well.Building a product/startup- I’ve built a very basic MVP that provides analytics (including some predictive analysis) for small–mid sized e-commerce companies. It’s early, but I think it could be developed into more of a template/solution to offer as a service potentially.Career progression - I don’t want to stay as a junior any longer and its so low priority for the company currently. I want to keep build towards something bigger but feel like times not on my side I’m juggling a lot right now: work, uni, the product idea, and the thought of switching to contracting and moving abroad. I want to move things forward without getting stuck in the same place for too long or burning out trying to do everything at once.Any advice on * Moving to Germany as a data professional without fluent German* Whether EU contracting is a good stepping stone or just a distraction right now* If it’s smarter to build the product before or after relocating* General advice on avoiding career stagnation while juggling multiple prioritiesTL;DR:3.5 yrs as a Data Engineer, junior title, £40k, started a degree.

It feels like learning because we can follow along, but our brains aren’t actually doing the heavy lifting. It’s like watching someone lift weights and thinking you got stronger.Most tutorials also cram way too much into one session.

We watch once, maybe take some notes, then move on to the next shiny tutorial.

Painful but effective.I also try to explain concepts out loud like I’m teaching someone. Sounds dumb but it forces you to actually understand vs just recognize.The biggest thing though - I go back to my notes after a few days.

I could do things like control where each of the 4 corner points are and then use trig and other math to programmatically animate them.I miss it. I do stuff with the HTML canvas and enjoy that, but Flash was much more robust.Whenever I'd have like an IT person telling me that Flash sucked I would automatically think ""Well, they clearly do not know what they are talking about."" Their criticism is about security and performance issues. It's a valid criticism. Flash had a lot of vulnerabilities because it gave freedom to the software engineer.

1nwtydy,Trouble extracting recipe data with python-chefkoch,DaveDarell,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I’m currently working on a side project: I want to build a web application for recipe management. Originally, I thought about making a native iOS app, but I quickly realized how complicated and restrictive it is to develop and deploy apps on iOS without going through a lot of hurdles. So instead, I want to start with a web app.The idea:* Add recipes manually (via text input).* Import recipes from [chefkoch.de](https://www.chefkoch.de/) automatically.* Store and manage them in a structured way (ingredients, preparation steps, total time, tags, etc.).For the import, I found this Python package [https://pypi.org/project/python-chefkoch/2.1.0/](https://pypi.org/project/python-chefkoch/2.1.0/)But when I try to use it, I run into an error. Here’s my minimal example:`from chefkoch.recipe import Recipe``recipe = Recipe('https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/1069361212490339/Haehnchen-Ananas-Curry-mit-Reis.html')``print(recipe.total_time)`And this is the traceback: Traceback (most recent call last): File ""C:\Users\xxx\Documents\Programmieren\xxx\github.py"", line 4, in print(recipe.total_time) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File ""C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\functools.py"", line 1026, in __get__ val = self.func(instance) File ""C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\site-packages\chefkoch\recipe.py"", line 193, in total_time time_str = self.__info_dict[""totalTime""] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^ KeyError: 'totalTime'It looks like the `totalTime` key is missing from the recipe’s info dictionary. Maybe the site changed their structure since the package was last updated?My goal is to extract:* preparation time,* cooking time,* total time,* ingredients,* instructions,* maybe also tags/keywords.Has anyone worked with this library recently or knows a better way to parse recipes from Chefkoch? Should I instead scrape the site myself (e.g. with BeautifulSoup) or is there a more up-to-date package that I missed?As I'm a newbie, any advice would be appreciated",2,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nwtydy/trouble_extracting_recipe_data_with_pythonchefkoch/,2025-10-03 08:59:53,2025-10-04 01:21:50

1nto6kw,[PSA] The real reason you're struggling in the tech market: Almost EVERYONE is lying.,cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"(TL;DR at bottom of post)First let's get one thing out of the way: I'm not suggesting that you lie as well. That's an individual decision. I'm here just to tell you about my experiences as being part of the hiring process for a FAANG-adjacent company.Secondly, I just want to state right away that I believe this is an issue that stems from the hiring / recruiter side more than it does on the candidate side. We are the ones who have drilled into your heads that you MUST have metrics, impacts and keywords or else your resume is ""trash"". Candidates are simply doing what they need to do to survive in this crazy market.With that out of the way.... let me tell you about my experiences.Every job posting that our team puts up receives roughly 2000 - 3000 applicants within a day or two. Out of this 3000, maybe 300 make it past the initial automated resume screen and online assessment. Out of those 300, a recruiter might chat with 30-50. And from that pool, only about 20-30 candidates ever make it to the initial phone screen and subsequent onsites.Now here’s the part that really opened my eyes: once you’re sitting on the other side of the table long enough, you start to notice patterns, and one of the biggest is how much of what’s on those resumes is either overstated, strategically worded, or just not true.I’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve brought someone in who claimed to have “architected a high-scale distributed system” and it turned out they wrote a couple of endpoints under heavy supervision. Or people who listed “launched a revenue-generating product used by millions” when, digging deeper, they built an internal tool with a handful of users. I’ve seen candidates inflate internship projects into “production systems,” or even list companies that, when we checked, they’d never actually worked at in any real capacity.A big one that’s become increasingly common is people lying about the technology stacks they’ve used. You’d be shocked how many resumes list technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, or Kafka as “production experience,” but when we ask follow-ups in the interview, it’s clear they’ve maybe followed a tutorial or briefly shadowed someone who worked with those tools.And here’s an important reality that most candidates (and even some hiring managers) don’t fully realize: background checks almost never verify WHAT you did. They usually just confirm your job title and employment dates. So if someone says they built a large-scale React application or ran infrastructure on AWS, there’s no background check that’s going to expose that as false. Unless an interviewer digs into the details, the exaggeration often goes completely unchallenged.And the thing is, many of these candidates still get interviews. Sometimes they even get offers. Not because they’re necessarily more skilled, but because their resumes are packed with the right keywords and “impact statements” that our systems and recruiters are trained to look for. Meanwhile, a candidate who honestly describes their experience with modest, accurate language often never even gets a shot.This creates a really frustrating dynamic. The people who embellish tend to stand out in the resume pile, which pressures others to do the same just to keep up. And from where I’m sitting as a SWE involved in this process, that pressure is entirely on us, the hiring side, for building a system that rewards buzzwords and inflated claims over substance and honesty.So if you’re sitting there wondering why you’re not getting callbacks despite real skills and solid experience, it might not be because you’re underqualified. It might just be that you’re competing with a lot of resumes that have been heavily optimized, or outright fabricated, for the hiring process. And unfortunately, those are the ones that often float to the top.Our team specifically now mostly just relies on references or ""people who know people"". We value that far more than trying to hire someone who noone on the team can speak about.**TL;DR:*** People are inflating, exaggerating and lying on their resumes like you wouldn't believe.* The vast majority of honest candidates never even make it to the recruiter screening* I'm noticing it happen more and more (at least 70%+ of candidates who make it to onsite). Every resume has tons of impact, tons of metrics, tons of technologies. Yet the candidates can't speak about any of it in the interview.* I believe the blame is on the hiring side, not the candidates. It's been drilled into your heads to have metrics, impacts, and keywords to beat the ATS and impress recruiters* Our team is shifting to mostly just hiring people based on references instead. Far less risky.Has anyone else experienced this? I'm not sure what the solution is. Like I said, our team is now focused more on references than anything else but even that isn't a perfect system.",1652,0.95,371,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nto6kw/psa_the_real_reason_youre_struggling_in_the_tech/,2025-09-29 17:24:25,2025-10-04 01:21:51

1nv27jt,"Why do so many new grads cannot perform the ""basics""?",None,cscareerquestions,"I work in a FAANG, and my team hired around 3 new grads this year. Been looking at their code reviews and I often notice that it's about 90% LLM generated code that are often complicated, out of context, unnecessary addons and stuffs like that. While coaching them on 1:1, I notice they struggle to meet the basic SDE standards that are well within the scope of a new CS grad or at least something that is easy to find in internet.For example - there's a dude that wasn't able to understand that a javascript function can return another function and not just a concrete value/object. He also asked me how a basic lodash function work - which is basically 1 google search away. Another dude was not able to explain his thought process on the code he wrote because I found that there is no relevance of the change he made for the feature development that was assigned. So, on a high level, I have observed that they cannot grasp the understanding of the system, have patience to read through documentations, question what it does and how to think of when writing code. Now, there could be a couple of possibilities on this. First, maybe they are overwhelmed and feel like they need to push gold standard code from month 1, else they get fired. The brutal job market might be making them scared to lose the job and is presurring them to show up as an expert already. Second, maybe the ChatGPT really ruined their critical thinking ability and attention span for reading through documentations / articles.

1nsvv1z,PSA: LinkedIn and Indeed don't have all the jobs,jjzwork,cscareerquestions,"tldr; Find jobs that aren't on LinkedIn/Indeed and your chances of getting a job will dramatically improve.Some people know this, many don't: lots of jobs don't end up on LinkedIn and Indeed.* Sometimes companies intentionally don't post their jobs there because they don't want to be flooded by applications.* Sometimes LinkedIn just takes a few weeks or months to start scraping these companies because they are relatively small (15-100 employees).* Sometimes LinkedIn doesn't do a good job at scraping certain government/city/public sector job sites.If you're limiting yourself to the big sites then you are going to miss out on the jobs that don't get posted there. What's worse is that you will ONLY apply to the jobs that everyone and their dog is applying to, which means your competition will be 10x higher.Example: I recently came across an NYC startup hiring multiple software engineers remotely in Canada that is paying $240-$300k base for people with 4-10 years of experience. They have [3 job openings](https://meterwork.com/employer/affiniti_YhHt2) but LinkedIn shows 0 jobs for [their company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/affiniti-finance/jobs/).I know the above is true because I spend hours a week finding jobs for my job board and regularly find companies with 0 jobs on LinkedIn but multiple jobs on their career pages. My point is, you need to start thinking outside of the box when job searching, especially in today's environment. You can't expect to do the same thing everyone else is doing and to see different results.And job boards are just one source of finding job openings, there are a few others that most people don't even consider.

I still love coding. I still love my job. My reviews are great at work.

I would read books, do side projects, keep up with the latest news and trends. My goal at the time was eventually become a staff/principal level dev earning 150-200k a year 10 years down the road. My hard work eventually paid off, I went from a no-name school to a few scrappy startups to better mid level company and eventually hit a big tech remote job.

They could clearly explain what the problems they were trying to solve were, and how the solution did thatThis seemed also true at bigger companies. Companies like google or netflix were at least *trying* to make products that appealed to consumers, even if it wasn't always a hit. Companies seemed to be run fairly well, or they were at least stable day to day. There was also lots of ""aspirational"" jobs, like places where if you got a job there, it felt like you hit the lotteryNowadays things just... don't really seem like that.

In both fast-paced environments and environments where the devs don’t really care about their output, it seems like you don’t ever hear people claim they’re working on clean code. When output, delivery or promotions are more important than the actual content to managers and higher-ups, why spend more time refactoring if that’s a problem for a future you or a future dev? Headcount and resources in many places are low for the expected output (especially with expectations from AI), and so deadlines can become even tighter.Have you worked on clean code, and if so, how have you been able to?

But it's still bad, if you're a junior / have no experience you will have hard time finding a job.My major was CSE ie Computer Science and Engineering which is like halfway between electrical and software engineers (but I focused on the software part, because that was the most interesting part to me).Barely anyone is hiring people without experience / juniors these days. The few places that do hire juniors get a large amount of applications and vast majority will be rejected. There is a very low amount of entry level jobs.Bootcamps were a thing in my country by mid 2010s already (some of them already went bankrupt by now) and due to the ""learn to code"" movement a lot more people took CS and related majors at Universities than before. As a result, the job market became very oversaturated at junior / entry level.There's also the AI hype which I think makes employers less likely to want entry lever developers.In mid to late 2010s people were told that ""coding is cool"", ""coding is an easy path to success"", ""it's easy to get high paying job if you get a degree"" and that kind of stuff. I was naive and hopped on the bandwagon.By the time I graduated in 2022, entry level developers were much less in demand than in mid / late 2010 because the market was oversaturated by then. I think the knowledge I had in 2022 would have been enough to land a job around 2015.

We're doing quite well, but man, I just feel like shit whenever I think too hard about it. This stuff barely works, it's barely getting any better, and the economic, environmental, and social costs of producing it are exploding exponentially.Before this, I worked at a company that did electronics manufacturing for various large corporations. We were poorly-run and a godawful waste of money. Before that, a company that made software that assisted in fracking. Before that, a company that staffed fucking *call centers*. I used to think that these were stepping stones to a meaningful job, but... I don't know what that would be, at this point. Maybe I could go work in clean energy? Or on theoretical AI research that might eventually yield more useful advances? Or... something else? I don't know.I love working on software.

I feel like I won't be morally clean unless I give all my money to charity and go become a monk and wear a hair shirt.

The whole ""do an 8 week bootcamp and land a job with basic JS"" approach is long gone.That said, I think it's unproductive to just say ""entry level SWE is dead.""For context: I don’t have a CS degree. I did an 18 month apprenticeship, a bootcamp before that, then stayed with the company I apprenticed at for 3.5 more years. So about 5 years total experience, now mid-level, but all at one place. I’ve been out of the market the whole time and things have changed a lot, now looking for new opportunities and trying to get my bearings.I wanted to start a discussion about what skills are actually needed today to get hired as an entry or mid-level engineer, both for the benefit of people trying to break into the field for the first time and for mid-levels who are looking for a new placement after 3–5 years of experience.For entry I’d define it as something like:- Strong in at least one backend language- HTML, CSS, JS fundamentals- Understanding of version control and Git workflows- Testing basics (unit, integration, maybe e2e)- Databases (querying, relational vs non-relational)- Basic infra knowledge (what AWS is, main services and what they’re useful for)- Ability to debug code and solve basic errors- Basic understanding of work process and how to collaborate in a team5+ years ago this probably would have put you mid-level, so maybe I’m stretching it.On mid-level, I honestly don’t know how to define it. I feel the line between senior and mid has blurred a lot. Most times I just do the same stuff as the seniors on my team, they're just able to get it done faster, have more stuff in-flight concurrently, and they communicate with the non-technical people more than me. Maybe mid-level just needs the same skills as I listed above, but with more independence, more depth in certain areas, and the ability to not shit your pants when things go wrong in production.Curious what others think. What skills are truly needed now?EDIT: Thanks for the thoughtful answers. I’m mostly gonna stop engaging now since this thread turned into a circular degree vs no-degree debate.

I got a mostly positive response to that mostly pessimistic post. I updated based on recent data and expanded to cover industries that rely on Tech and Quant related skills. I’ll repost to finance careers as well this time.In my original post, I shared that in my experience the job market largely reflects confidence that earnings growth will outpace inflation and bond markets. Here’s the S&P 500  [YOY RE growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-earnings-growth/table/by-quarter) over the last nine months:* Mar 31, 2025  10.58%* Dec 31, 2024  6.15%* Sep 30, 2024  6.11%* Jun 30, 2024  5.12%[Real M2 Money Supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2REAL) appears to have also reverted back to a normal rate of growth from before the pandemic. That, in addition to the earnings growth, should start a return to a “normal” job market. Unfortunately, back-to-normal is taking longer than anyone wants.I poked around a little more and noticed the following trend for S&P 500 [YOY Real Sales Per Share growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-sales-growth/table/by-quarter) over that same time period:* Mar 31, 2025  2.25%* Dec 31, 2024  2.24%* Sep 30, 2024  2.75%* Jun 30, 2024  1.95%That suggests that companies realized earnings growth not through sales but instead through cost cutting by presumably reducing headcount. I posted a public [dashboard on FRED that shows headcount growth flatlining](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/dashboard/121649) (you can create your own economic dashboard on FRED).Unfortunately, I don’t think lower rates alone from the Fed will be enough. Also, unlike what I wrote in my original post, I don’t think there are any safe jobs or companies. Here are some other larger trends I’ve begun looking at - I am curious if others on Reddit agree or disagree:1. Between security concerns, software as a service, and low/no code customization, the number of products and versions have shrunk. Hence, companies have eliminated many jobs patching older versions of SW or journeyman jobs maintaining custom code.2. Overall, [the number of publicly traded companies has shrunk](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LDOM.NO?locations=US) since the 1990s. If it wasn’t for SPACs, the numbers would likely have gone even further lower. With fewer companies, M&A, auditing, compliance, and finance all rely on less and less headcount.3. The [increase in college educated professionals](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MJlq) has diluted the unique value of any college degree. Even if you suspended H1B and OPT roles, it wouldn’t change the scale at which college educated professionals now participate in the job market relative to what they did 20 years ago.Growth in public companies followed public market deregulation by Reagan in the 1980s and not regulating the internet starting with Clinton in the 1990s (Sec 230).

(I'm not sure of the bands, I think its like £85k base and some stock).Perhaps moving to google, I can get promoted soon-ish too, since I am not a new grad and L4 google is L5 amazon, so theres a big salary bump incoming too?Staying at Amazon could be good as it is pretty chill and team is comfortable, and I'm learning as an engineer, and I can get those stock options I guess, but I don't think staying comfortable is great? Also interviewing with a startup that pays around £130k, might be good - I can move and challenge myself elsewhere, take a risk while I'm young, and make more money for it too?A lot of my friends are saying stay for SDEII promo, then move e.g to google or Meta as SDEII, instead of starting again as SDEI.

1nuepbp,What's the worst career / financial situation you've ever seen someone you personally know who studied tech end up?,MarathonMarathon,cscareerquestions,"(Have a hunch that a lot of the answers are gonna be ""myself"".)People often joke about CS grads having to pivot to nursing / trades / burger-flipping due to being unable to find employment in their field. But how dire does it actually get in terms of people you personally know?For me, despite being woefully unable to secure much progress through September as a senior set to graduate into an awful job market, even then it's not myself. There was some guy from my uni a few years older than me who did some drug dealing and ended up getting arrested. So while things do look economically bleak for me (and likely many others), at least I've got retained enough integrity not to end up turning to a life of crime and getting saddled on drugs (yet).It's not like I personally know this person though. He just happened to attend my school. Absolute rock bottom might be Luigi from last winter (who has a MS CS), but I'm pretty confident most people don't personally know him.Most people I know are students lol, my age or younger. All my tech classmates who have graduated before me (2025 or earlier) are gainfully and relevantly employed to at least some extent right now.In terms of people I actually know, mine would have to be one friend's sibling who majored in IT and hardly cared about anything, who right now just has a remote help desk job that pays less than McDonald's. At least it's not only paid but domain-relevant, and I'm sure many grads would be dying to be in a similar situation. My friend told me their sibling *could* upskill to IT Engineer if they just put in the effort but they just choose not to.

I learned entirely on the go, picked everything up as I needed it for the work being done. But now the company I'm with is slowly dissolving and likely has only a few years left and I personally may have even less than that before they just decide to lay me off to help them delay the inevitable.The thing is, right now I have extremely good savings and virtually zero debt. I own my home with no mortgage to pay, my utility bills are cheap, own my car, and have zero reason to move from where I am considering how good the cost of living is and how much of my family is around me. I don't like the idea of moving for work.So my hope was to find literally any local-ish tech job or something fully remote (but lol, all remote jobs are inundated with applicants), there's a decent amount on offer because I'm only an hour out from a major city and right next to it is a sort of 'corporate hub' that has all of the state's big businesses.

I still did my best, hoping to God maybe they were just pushing my buttons to test me, but nope, didn't end up working.So I go back to my buddy and his advice was basically to check out WGU, told me that I'd probably be able to finish a degree in a decent amount of time, especially if I optimize credits with Sophia and study (the website, not the act of studying). That I'd be able to rush through courses that cover topics I already know and fill in gaps of knowledge with courses I don't already know.I do think it's a decent idea, but my alternative is to just pick up more certs and start to learn topics outside of my knowledge zone, and that would probably end up taking less time, effort and money, but I have no idea if that's even going to make it any easier to continue my career.",28,0.9,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ns0962/self_taught_6yoe_but_large_gaps_in_knowledge/,2025-09-27 16:57:29,2025-10-04 01:21:51

Thankfully I grew up with parents who have been fairly reasonable when it comes to my academics (though admittedly falling short in other sectors), and I'm well aware that letter grades mean jack shit when it comes to employability, but man, the sentiment does ring true when it comes to what you need to do to get interviews, ace interviews, and receive offers.You have to outcompete everybody (technically, behaviorally, experientially) for a small number of roles (often just 1 or 2). Could range from 50 to 5000 applicants per role. But even if you do get selected you have to prove you're better than like 10 to 200 people. Referrals and nepo can help a slight bit, but they're no panacea (and I think part of the problem here is my family and I not knowing enough high-ranking people at smaller companies). Even the CS adjacent jobs like IT and data analysis or business analysis which might be more boring or compensate less face similar gauntlets as they seem to attract even more people from even more walks of life. It's like a shitty tournament or Squid Game.Which means, if you're not the best of the best? You end up in the rejection pile. Big companies or small companies, 50k or 6 figs, government or industry, all seem crazy competitive, and oftentimes you end up rejected for no reason.I just wish I could've punched my past freshman self in the face and shake some sense into him. Whether that means taking CS, upskilling, interview prep, and LeetCode / systems design more seriously, or just choosing a different field altogether, it's hard to tell. But I feel like with so many applications per week and hardly a single callback, even with what I've been told is an impressive-seeming resume, it's getting hard to see anything but disaster down the line.I feel like I grew up hating competition, and was never really the type to win trophies in high school or anything. I remember sitting in my high school's auditorium listening to the vice principal name everyone who was in the top 10% GPA of the class, and I was sadly not one of them.

When asked, he mentioned that a promotion could be considered in my next annual review.I don't think this compensation reflects the value I've brought to the company or my team. This raise puts me at 78k while the position's listed salary band is 70-90k. I expected to be at the very least in the upper half of this salary band. I've also been praised for my work by many senior colleagues, even frequently mentioning that they think I deserve a promotion. All this makes me feel that I'm severely undercompensated.I'm not sure what my strategy should be when walking into his office on Monday. Should I push for a promotion to get a larger raise (I've heard stories of 7-10% at my company)? Should I just push for a larger raise without promotion? Should I negotiate other benefits like more PTO?I have been actively applying for about 4 months now, but haven't gotten any offers back yet, so I unfortunately don't have anything to leverage beyond my 1 YOE and many character references at this company.

Outside of me, my boss, and our data scientist none of us are on the same page about anything. We all have a guy who is more or less “the project leader” and could be considered our superior. He’s been writing a program for about two years for one of our data tasks. It’s terrible. Like the dude is passing images into pandas dataframes and then iterating over the dataframe. To run the program once would take around 75 hours. I managed to cut it down to just under an hour. It’s not accurate either but that’s a story for another time.Well this superior says he wants to run his code. If we have any ideas for changes to the code we need to run it by him for him to change. Even regarding the massive runtime cut I had, he would prefer to make the changes himself. The issue is 1.) he’s not good at coding 2.) he’s extremely busy so a simple change might take an entire week. My boss told me to just change the code without letting him know. He and a few others have done this in the past before (this superior is typically weird like this about his code).

1nutz6h,Feeling unsure about continuing studies with the current market outlook,part_time_pimp,cscareerquestions,"I'm a Canadian who graduated from the University of Toronto in 2020 with what is essentially a double major in mathematics and statistics. I did well enough in this degree that they hired me as a undergraduate TA to teach tutorials and grade exams for 3 out of the 5 years of my undergrad. I graduated right into the height of the pandemic so at the time, with the uncertainty of how the pandemic would shake everything up, even though I was looking for a job in data science or related fields, I took the first thing I could get. The first job I got was related to front-end web development at a government agency and I stayed there for 5 years. I was a top performer for the last few years of my employment there (always got glowing reviews from my managers), but since front-end was something I kind of fell into, I decided to go back to school for CS and so started applying for schools again last September. Additionally, I have a younger sibling that was accepted to Google as a SWE this past year, so that gave me extra inspiration to work on myself.Right before I started school again this month, my team was made redundant and I was laid off. I was hoping to work there at least one more year while I took part time studies (I am part time for my first year as my math and stats degree requirements have all transferred and my gen-ed requirements waived), but fortunately I have enough savings to get me through my entire degree. My current school (York University) is probably a tier-2 equivalent school (if you would consider the University of Toronto a tier 1 school). However, I want to do co-op which would extend my second degree to 4 years. Between co-op and EI (which I applied for as I am a part time student) I will have some financial buffer. But what I'm truly worried about is the CS market still being absolute shit by the time I graduate. I tell myself that this market downturn is only temporary as advancements in AI will most likely plateau, maybe the government down south stabilizes and the economy with it too, and like all market downturns there will be a time where it resurges but that's never a certainty.If it were just me I think I would be able to manage. But my parents are getting up there in age and I'm afraid that if I can't get a job as soon as I graduate then I won't be able to support them when they retire. What is the best way for me, currently, to best maximize my employment chances as soon as I graduate (in terms of CS fields focus on) - given that I have a math and stats background I think either AI or Fintech would be my best options. I will network and do side projects. Ultimately the dream would be to join my younger sibling in working at a FAANG but for now I just need to maximize my chances at quick employment after graduation.

For context I want to be a swe. I see people say “if I can’t get a job offer or internship I will just go to grad school”, as if this route is smarter financially. Grad school is incredibly expensive, federal aid is non existent for grad students, scholarships incredibly difficult to come by, and loans carry high interest rates. How in any way is this better than graduating, working a temporary job while continuing to code and build projects and apply to jobs?During school we must build side projects because the degree is in computer science not software engineering, the paper is not enough. If this is the case, why would post graduation be any different in that you would work a normal job and continue to grind. Are internships impossible to come by after graduation? If you graduate without internship experience you are somehow walled away because internships are a prerequisite to swe junior rolls? I would imagine you could find a gig even at a small company. Even if it took a while, your progress would still be faster because you’re not pushing the goalpost back two years.

1nvlfxq,How cooked am I - Update and help,sokkamf,cscareerquestions,"Just had the interview. Asked me about my AWS decisions relating to my current projects. Easy enough to explain what I'm doing.They asked me a coding problem off Leet code, and by the grace of God it happened to be the one problem I had reviewed to get a better understanding on LinkedLists. So I was able to say what I would do because I remembered the understanding of the solution form studying yesterday. The manager joined after I pseudocode it and said don't worry about that the new issue - They want to in person code interview me next week. This is literally my nightmare. I barely scraped together the concepts of Java, OOP, and data structures since Monday. Like all day studying. There is absolutely no fucking way I can pull the next one off.Also - They said they want me up and running by week 2. That I should be committing code by eow2. Is that even realistic? It took me like a month to get a hold of all the shit my current job was doing. They want me as productive as the other team members by week 2. I have no choice but to Leetcode for a week straight and then attend my humiliation ritual. I hate every ounce of this so much. Not even sure I want this job anymore. It's better financially and for my career, but I'm giving up a WFH and very stress free job for what sounds like something that will make me want to die lmfao.

1nv9j33,Preventing inevitable knowledge leak while job searching,kickassgamernurse,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in August of last year. I've been a nurse for over 10 years and finally had the opportunity to return to school and start down a pathway I am much more passionate about. I work in a school system and unfortunately got caught up with finishing out the school year, both from a lack of finding a new job in the technology field as well as feeling guilt towards the thought of bailing my nursing team and feeling an obligation to stay (my husband tells me I don't owe them anything, but it's just how I am). In my free time, I studied to take Security+ and passed on the first attempt in June of this year. I am interested in many facets of CompSci, but majorly IT (including health IT), network security and cybersecurity. I looked and applied for jobs of all sorts during summer break as well as the past few months, but have come up short. I'm sure you all know that the job market sucks.Anyways, to the point of my post. I have issues with working memory and I can feel all of the knowledge I learned during my degree program just slowly fading away. Basically an ""if you don't use it, you lose it"" type situation. I am a lifelong learner and am looking for recommendations on how to retain what I've learned (while looking for a job) as well as learning new things too.How do you all handle this ""knowledge leak"" and do you have any recommendations on resources/books for me to retain what I've learned?Thank you!",7,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nv9j33/preventing_inevitable_knowledge_leak_while_job/,2025-10-01 14:20:55,2025-10-04 01:21:51

1ns6q7q,What programming career path should i focus on considering my current skills (C++ / JS / Gamedev) ?,FutureLynx_,cscareerquestions,"# I’m trying to decide where to focus my career as a programmer. As im all over the place.Languages: C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, React, also touched a bit of assembly and reverse engineering.Worked a lot with Unreal Engine (lots of C++), and some Unity and Godot, SFML.I love everything related to programming, though i prefer C++, C# or JS. In that order.Given this background, which programming paths or job roles would make the best use of my skills? And would be easier to start with? It seems like no matter how much I improve, its never enough, and the bar keeps raising. And the more i know the less it seems i know.That is why i focus mostly on gamedev, because i feel i can finish a game and perhaps sell it. Plus i love to do it, so im always self-motivated.Though im aware its practically impossible to get a job in the gamedev industry at the moment. So in case i cant get a job, i can always make games...The part i love the most about gamedev is programming, and solving problems. Making systems work. Especially RTS style battles.I have a degree and master degree in Architecture, im an architect by career, though changed to gamedev years ago, and this is what i like to do. But i want to work with anything related to programming, i just dont know where to focus.This is my github, youtube and itch:[https://lastiberianlynx.itch.io/](https://lastiberianlynx.itch.io/)[https://github.com/LastIberianLynx](https://github.com/LastIberianLynx)[https://www.youtube.com/@LastIberianLynx\_GameDev](https://www.youtube.com/@LastIberianLynx_GameDev)Any advice is welcomed.",5,0.86,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ns6q7q/what_programming_career_path_should_i_focus_on/,2025-09-27 21:22:14,2025-10-04 01:21:51

I recently started a full-time full stack developer role, but I’m already thinking about my options. I also have 8 months of internship experience at a small company from school before.Here’s the situation:Option 1: Stay at my current full-time role•Permanent position.•Cons: The company culture is toxic, lots of overtime, and not the healthiest environment.•Pros: Full-time experience means my next job hunt will be easier. I’m planning to quit after about a year anyway.Option 2: Take an 8-month internship at a large, globally recognized tech company•Pros: Amazing brand name for my resume, structured learning environment, mentorship, and likely healthier culture. Could open doors for interviews at top tech companies.•Cons: Only 8 months, so I’d be back on the job market afterward. Since it’s an internship, I’d likely have to apply for junior-level roles again and we all know how the junior dev market is rn. Pay would be 20–25% less than my current full-time role. No guarantee of full-time conversion.My dilemma:•Staying at the full-time role gives continuous experience and a higher paycheck, but the culture is toxic and might burn me out.•Taking the internship gives brand recognition and a healthier environment, but I’d earn less and likely have to apply for junior roles again after 8 months.I don’t care much about money right now at the moment, so the decision is more about career trajectory, learning, and next-job opportunities.",4,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nvdh61/8month_internship_at_a_big_brand_vs_fulltime_full/,2025-10-01 16:47:43,2025-10-04 01:21:51
