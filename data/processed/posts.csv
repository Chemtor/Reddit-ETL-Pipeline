1lxxka0,An attempt at vibe coding as a Data Engineer,roey132,dataengineering,"Recently I decided to start out as a Freelancer, a big part of my problem was that I need to show some projects in my portfolio and github, but most of my work was in corporates and I cant share any of the information or show code from my experience. So, I decided to make some projects for my portfolio, to show demos of what I offer as a freelancer for companies and startups.As an experiment, I decided to try out vibe coding, setting up a fully automated daily batch etl from api requests to aws lambda functions, athena db and daily jobs with flows and crawlers.Takes from my first project:1. Vibe coding is a trap, if I didn't have 5 years of experience, I wouldv'e made the worst project I could imagine, with bad and old practices, unreadable code, no edgecase handling and just a lot of bad stuff2. It can help with direction, and setting up very simple tasks one by one, but you shouldn't give the AI large tasks at once.3. Always try to provide your prompts a taste of the data, the structure is never enough.4. If you spend more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem with AI, it probably won't solve it. (at least not in a clean and logical way)5. The code it creates between files and tasks is very inconsistent, looks like a different developer made it everytime, make sure to provide it with older code it made so it knows to keep the consistency.Example of my worst experience:I tried creating a crawler for my partitioned data reading CSV files from S3 into an athena table. my main problem was that my dates didnt show up correctly, the problem the AI thought was very focused on trying to change data formats until it hits something that athena supports. the real problem was actually in another column that contained commas in the strings, but because I gave the AI the data and it looked at the dates as the problem, no matter what it tried, it never tried to look outside the box. I tried for around 2.5-3 hours fixing this problem, and ended up fixing it in 15 minutes by using my eyes instead of the AI. Link to the final project repo: [https://github.com/roey132/aws\_batch\_data\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/aws_batch_data_demo)\*Note\* - The project could be better, and there are many places to fix and use much better practices, i might review them in the future, but for now, im moving onto the next project (taking the data from aws to a streamlit dashboard.)Hope it helps anyone! good luck with your projects and learning, and remember, AI is good, but its still not a replacement for your experience.",131,0.91,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lxxka0/an_attempt_at_vibe_coding_as_a_data_engineer/,2025-07-12 10:50:08,2025-07-19 01:46:58

It doesn't help that the documentation isn't opinionated, straightforward, easy to follow, not all over the place, doesn't show clear examples, how to set it up, what's the proper project structure, what to do if you have a previous project, etc.Again, I concede this may be a skill issue.

1lxuj1h,How to move forward while feeling like a failure,thro0away12,dataengineering,"Im a DE with several years of experience in analytics, but after a year into my role, I’m starting to feel like a failure. I wanted to become a DE because somewhere along the lines of me being an analyst, I decided I like SWE more than data analysis/science and felt DE was a happy medium.But 1 year in, I’m not sure what I signed up for. I constantly feel like a failure at my job. Every single day I feel utterly confused because the business side of things is not clear to me - I’m given tasks, not sure what the big picture is, not sure what it is I’m supposed to accomplish. I just “do” without really knowing the upstream side of things. Then I’m told to go through source data and just feel expected to “know” how everything tied together without receiving guidance or training on the data. I ask questions and I’ve been more proactive after receiving some negative feedback lately about my ability to turn things around-frequently assigned tasks that are assumed to be “4 hours of effort” that realistically take at least few days. Multiply one task by 4-5 tasks and this is expected to be completed in a span of less than 2 weeks. I ask, communicate, document, etc. But at the end of it all, I still feel my questions aren’t being answered and my lack of knowledge due to lack of exposure or clear instructions makes me seem frequently dumb (ie: manager will be like “why would you not do this” when it was never previously explained to me and where there was no way I’d know without somebody telling me). I’ve made mistakes that felt sh*tty too because I’m so pressured to get something done on time that it ends up being sloppy. I am not really using my technical skills at all-at my old job, being one of the few people who wrote code relatively well, I developed interactive tools or built programs/libraries that really streamlined the work and helped scale things and I was frequently recognized for that work. When I go on the data science sub, I’m made to feel that my emphasis on technical skills is a waste of time because it’s the “business” and not “technical skills” that’s worth $$$. I don’t see how the 2 are mutually exclusive? I find my team has a technical debt problem and the deeper we get there, the more I don’t think this helps scale business. A lot of our “business solutions” can be scaled up for several clients but because we don’t write code and do processes in a way where we can re-use it for different use cases, we’re left with spending way too much time doing stuff tediously and manually that prolongs delays that usually then ends up feeling like a blame game that comes right back at me. I’ve been trying, really trying to reflect and be honest with myself. I’ve tried to communicate with my boss that I’m struggling with the workload. But I feel like there’s a feeling at the end that it’s me. I don’t feel great. I wish I was in a SWE role but I don’t even think that’s realistically possible for me given my lack of experience and the job market. Also not sure SWE is the move. My role seems to be evolving into a project management/product manager role and while I don’t mind gaining those skills, I also don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t think this job seems like a good fit for me but I don’t know what other jobs I can do. I’ve thought about the AI/ML engineering team on my job but I don’t have enough experience at all for it. I feel too technically unskilled for other engineer jobs but not “business savvy” enough to do a non-technical project/product based role. If anybody has insight, I’d appreciate it.",54,0.93,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lxuj1h/how_to_move_forward_while_feeling_like_a_failure/,2025-07-12 07:26:41,2025-07-19 01:46:58
1m0hxav,Analytics Engineer for 2 years and I am feeling stuck,Nothing-Wide,dataengineering,"Hello,I started working as a Data Engineer, albeit mostly on the analytics side of things. I handle communications with business stakeholders, build DBT models, sometimes manage ingestions etc. I am currently feeling very stuck. The data setup was probably built in a hurry and the team has had no time in fixing the issues. There is no organisation in the data we maintain, and everything is just running on hot fixes. There isn't even incremental processing of the facts, or anything for that matter. There is no SCD implementation. The only thing I have built a knack for is handling business logic.

1lyav6g,Do I have a good job?,Advanced-Average-514,dataengineering,"So I am in my first DE job, been here for a year, working for a company who hasn't had someone whose title was DE before. There were lots of people doing small scale data engineering type tasks using a variety of no-code tools, but no one was writing custom pipelines or working with a data warehouse. I basically set up our snowflake database, ETL pipelines, and a few high impact dashboards. The situation was such that even as a relative beginner there was low-hanging fruit where I could make a big impact.When I was getting hired, it seemed like they were taking a chance on me as an individual but also 'data engineering' as a concept, they didn't really know if they 'needed it'. I think partly because of this, and partly because I was just out of school, my compensation is pretty low for a DE at 72k (living in a US city but not a major coastal city).But, there are good benefits, I haven't needed to work more than 40 hours more than two or three times, and I feel like the work is interesting. I'm also able to learn on the job because I'm pretty much defining/inventing the tech stack as I go. There is a source of tension though where it feels like no one really understands when I do something innovative or creative to solve a problem, and because of that sometimes it feels like timelines/expectations are expressed with no knowledge of what goes into my work which can be a little frustrating. But, to be fair nothing ever really happens when a timeline is missed.My hunch is that if I asked for a raise it would be denied since they seem to be under the impression anyone with a basic data engineering related education could take my place. IMO, if someone tried to take my place there would be a months-long learning process about the business and all the data relationships before they could support existing work let alone produce more.Anyway, just curious if this seems like I'm hoping for too much? I'm happy overall, but don't know if I am just being naive and should be getting more in terms of recognition, money, opportunities to advance. What are other people's work experiences like? I have a feeling people make more than me by a lot but I don't know if that comes with more stress too.

1m1ihb6,Stories about open source vs in-house,koldblade,dataengineering,"This is mostly a question for experienced engineers / leads: was there a time when you've regretted going open source instead of building something in-house, or vica versa?For context, at work we're mostly reading different databases, and some web apis, and load them to SQL server. So we decided on writing some lightweight wrappers for extract and load, and use those for SQL server. During my last EL task I've decided to use DLT for exploration, and maybe use our in-house solution for production.Here's the kicker: DLT took around 5 minutes for a 140k row table, which was processed in 10s with our wrappers (still way too long, working on optimizing it). So as much as initially I've hated implementijg our in-house solution, with all the weird edge cases, in the end I couldn't be happier. Not to mention no breaking changes, that could break our pipelines.Looking at the code for both implementations, it's obvious that DLT simply can't perform the same optimizations as we can, because it has less information about our environments. But these results are quite weird: DLT is the fastest ingestion tool we tested, and it can be easily beat in our specific use case, by an average-at-best set of programmers.But I still feel unease, what if a new programmer comes to our team, and they can't be productive for extra 2 months? Was the fact that we can do big table ingestions in 2 minutes vs 1 hour worth the cost of extra 2-3 hours of work when inevitably a new type of source / sink comes in? What are some war stories? Some choices that you regret / greatly appreciate in hindsight?

1m2j3st,Is there a need for a local-first data lake platform?,SnooDogs4383,dataengineering,"Hey folks, I recently joined a consultancy where we manage data solutions for clients. My team primarily works on Databricks, and I was really impressed at first with Delta Live Tables (now called Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline) and Photon. It felt super intuitive, until I saw the $200 bill just from me testing it out. That was kinda absurd.Around the same time, I was optimizing a server for another team and stumbled onto DuckDB. I got pulled into a DuckDB rabbit hole. I loved how portable it is, and the idea of single-node compute vs. distributed jobs like Spark made a lot of sense. From what the DuckDB team claims, it can outperform Spark for datasets under \~5TB, which covers most of what we do.That got me thinking: Why not build a data platform where DuckDB is the compute engine, with the option to later switch to Spark (or something else) via an adaptor?Here’s the rough idea:1. Everything should work locally—compute and storage.2. Add adaptors to connect to any external data source or platform.3. Include tools that help design and stress-test data models (seriously, why do most platforms not have this built-in?). I also saw that DuckDB Foundation released a new data lake standard that seems like a cleaner way to structure metadata compared to loose files on S3.Meanwhile:* Databricks just announced **Lakeflow Connect** to integrate with lots of SaaS platforms. * MotherDuck is about to announce **Estuary**, which sounds like it’ll offer similar functionality. * DuckLake (MotherDuck’s implementation of the lake standard) looks promising too. So here’s my actual question: **Is there room or real need for a local-first data lake platform?** One that starts local for speed, cost, and simplicity—but can scale to the cloud later?I know it sounds like a niche idea. But a lot of small businesses generate a fair amount of data and don’t have the tools or people to set up a proper warehouse. Maybe starting local-first makes it easier for developers to play around without worrying about getting billed every time they test something?Curious to hear your thoughts.

Most of the topics are in Avro format. The Kafka clusteris provided by an external company, which also has a UI to see some data andsome metrics.Now, the more topics we have, the more our devs want to debug certain things and analytics people want to explore data. So the ui technically allows that, but search for a specific message is not possible. We have now explored other methods to do ""data exploration"":* Flink -> too complicated and too much overhead* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Json) fails to properly deserialize logicalType ""decimal"" (wtf?)* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Parquet) can handle decimals, but ignores tombstones (wtf?)* besides: Kafka Connect means, having an immutable copy of the topic - probably not a good idea anyways* we are using AWS, so Athena provides a Kafka Connector. Implementation and configuration is so hacky. It cannot even connect to our Schema registry and requires to have a copy of the schema in Glue (wtf?)* Trino's Kafka Connector works surprisingly good, but has the same issue with decimals.For you Kafka users out there, do you have the same issues? I was a bit surprised having these kinds of issues with a technology that is that mature and widely adopted. Any tool suggestions? Is everyone using Json as a topic format? Is it the same with ProtoBuf?A little side rant: I was writing a consumer in python, which should write the data as parquet files. Getting data from Avro+AvroSchema into a Arrow table, while using the provided schema is also rather complicated. Both Avro and Arrow are big Apache projects. I was expecting some interoperability.

I’d love to get your thoughts, since this is our first time migrating to a modern data stack.The idea is to use Snowpipes to load data into Snowflake from ADLS Gen2, where we land all our raw data. From there, we want to leverage dynamic tables to simplify orchestration and transformation. We’re only dealing with batch data for now so no streaming requirements.For CI/CD, we’re planning to use either Azure DevOps or GitHub, using the Snowflake repository stage and we currently have three separate Snowflake accounts, so zero-copy cloning won’t be an option.The files in ADLS will contain all columns from the source systems, but in Snowflake we’ll only keep the ones we actually need for reporting. Finally, for slowly changing dimensions, we're planning to use integer surrogate keys instead of hash keys.Do you think this setup is sufficient? I’m also considering using dbt, mainly for data quality testing and documentation. Since lineage is already available in Snowflake and we’re handling CI/CD externally, I'm wondering if there are still strong reasons to bring dbt into the stack. Any downsides or things I should keep in mind?Also, I’m a bit concerned about orchestration.

We're considering switching to the Confluent S3 Sink Connector to write Avro files to S3, and then ingesting the data into Redshift via batch processes.

Company works with high sensitivity data and is very slow to adopt new technology due to hesitance to change. Company has a bespoke software suite and doesn’t hold user data.

I am looking to progress to DE as my skill set (I would say) is more suited to DE and I see this as a suitable next step.

1m1qxws,Lakehouse vs. Warehouse in AWS,fabuloussir,dataengineering,"I apologize in advance for my lack of expertise. I'm the sole data analyst at a small company. We explore most of our data via our source systems, and do not have a database. My ingestion experience consists of exporting CSVs from our source systems to SharePoint, then connecting to Power BI and transforming there. I got buy-in from management for a centralized data solution in AWS. We reached out to a couple of engineering teams and received two proposals. The first one proceeds with our original intent of building a warehouse in Redshift, while the second one aims for lakehouse architecture using S3/Athena/Iceberg/Glue. I had not even heard of a lakehouse before starting this project. We record our work across multiple cloud software and need to merge them into a single source of truth. We also need to store historical snapshots of our data, which we are not able to do currently. While structured, this internal data is not large. We do not generate even 1GB of data annually. I understand that such a data size is laughable for considering a managed warehouse. However, we plan on ingesting JSON files spanning hundreds of gigs every month. While I am sure that we will not need most of the data in those files, I still want to keep them in their original format just in case. Since I have been unable to peek inside these files, I will be exploring this data for the first time. I feel that the production data will only be a few gigs. We are also reconfiguring our Jira projects, so I worry that field deletions and schema changes would convolute a warehouse implementation. While I would like to build this myself, I have no coding experience and we work with healthcare data so we would need security expertise as well. Thousands of dollars per month is out of the question at the moment, so I am looking for a cost-effective and scalable solution. I just wonder if Redshift or S3 + Athena is that solution.

But still curiosity may lead to some fruitful discussion.We have a typical data pipeline, where some data are going to go daily through a series of transformations, and finally written into a unified database schema. Now, for most cases, the source and destination/sink of that data is on the same database instance. Therefore, what we can do, is to just run everything a sequence of SQL statements (`INSERT INTO T(n+1).... SELECT ... FROM Tn` etc), without actually ""loading"" any data into our server. So all data stays in teh database server and transformed there. It has the huge benefit that we don't have to deal with partitioning, distribution etc. So, it's quite clear to me that it's not ETL since we don't extract data into our data processing server and then transform it (or not?).

We have set up glue connection to the database with jdbc connector and the tables are crawled and available in AWS glue data catalog.What are the options to go from here? The obvious one is probably to write spark scripts in AWS glue for obfuscation and pipe the data to the target cluster. Is this a common practice?Edit to add: we considered DMS but I don't think we want a live replication for QA testing, as they will be doing read/write queries to the target db.

1m1b0b3,Alteryx ETL vs Airbyte->DW->DBT: Convincing my boss,JazzlikeFly484,dataengineering,"Hey, I would just like to open by saying this post is extremely biased and selfish in nature. Now with that in mind, I work at a bank as a Student Data Engineer while doing an Msc in Data Engineering.My team consists of my supervisor and myself. He is a Data Analyst that doesn't have much technical expertise (just some Python and SQL knowledge but for doing basic things).We handle data at a monthly granularity level. When I was brought in 11 months ago, the needs weren't well defined (in fact they weren't defined at all). Since then, we've been slowly gaining more clarity. Our work now mainly consists of exporting data from SAP Business Objects, doing Extract-Transform in Python and exporting aggregates (typed cleansed joined data). This is in fact what I did. He then uses the aggregates to do some dashboarding in Excel. Now he started using Power BI for dashboarding.I suggested moving to an Airbyte->DW->DBT ELT pipeline. I'm implementing a POC for this purpose. But my supervisor asked if it would be better to use Alteryx as an ETL tool instead. His motives are that he wants us to remain a business oriented team not a technical one that implements and maintains technical solutions, another motive of his is that the data isn't voluminous enough to warrant the approach I suggested (Most of our source excel files are less than 100k rows with one being less than 150k rows and another being at more than 1.5M rows)My motives on the other hand are why I said this post is selfish. I plan to use this as a Final Year Project. And, I feel like this would advance my career (improve my CV) better than Alteryx which I feel is more targeted towards Data Analysts who like Drag-and-Drop UIs and no code quality of life approaches.One point I know my approach beats out Alteryx in is auditability. It is important to document the transformations our data goes through and I feel that that is more easily done and ensured with my approach.Two questions:1. Am I too selfish in what I'm doing or is it ok (considering I'm going to soon be freshly graduated and really want to be able to show this 14 month long experience as genuine, real work that will be relevant to the type of positions I would be targeting) ?2.

But the thing is , today is it worth it to continue put my energy into that ?

1lyqipq,How did you actually learn how to learn?,Leading_Spot_3618,learnprogramming,"So this has been on my mind lately, not just how people learn stuff like coding or math, but how they figured out how to learn in the first place. Like, what made the switch from “I’m just reading stuff” to “I actually understand what I’m doing”?Most advice out there is the same laundry list: spaced repetition, Pomodoro, flashcards, blah blah. But I’m way more curious about how people landed on what works for them. Did you start by failing a lot and then tweaking your method? Copy a YouTuber’s setup and slowly ditch most of it? Realize that everything falls apart after 3 p.m. so you built your schedule around that?I think a lot of us, especially in programming, go through that phase where we’re doing tutorials on autopilot, feeling like we’re learning, but nothing sticks. Then something clicks. Maybe it's building your own project, maybe it's just doing spaced recall the right way, or realizing that you need to write code, not just watch it being written.Personally, I used to grind tutorial after tutorial thinking I was improving, but I couldn’t build anything from scratch. Only after I started using flashcards and forcing myself to explain stuff in my own words did things actually start sticking.Anyway, I’d love to hear what your turning point was.

1lxyuy0,Self-taught. Uni degree isn't an option. Where do I start to cover the bases? OSSU? Teach Yourself CS?,colorofthetruth,learnprogramming,"I've been coding for fun on and off since I was a kid. Though I'd say it only 'clicked' 7-8 years ago when I got into automation and scraping for some hobby projects (mostly in Python, but dabbled with a few other languages and Android apps too).Never got any formal training, not even classes at school (I was homeschooled throughout). Honestly looking back, my stuff was pretty much cobbled together from Stack Overflow - but they worked at the time, and I genuinely enjoyed making them.Well, that lasted until a couple years ago when some shit hit the fan around high school grad age. Convinced myself I'm burnt out, and barely learned anything during that period, except finishing CS50X and CS50P.Anyway, figured it's time to cut the cycle. I'm still unsure which subfield or job I want, but I know I should work on my understanding of CS theory - and that would mean basically everything beyond basic scripting.An IRL formal CS uni degree is currently not an option for that, so I'm looking for a structured, self-taught online alternative. Looking over the resources list, OSSU and TeachYourselfCS caught my eye, so now I'm trying to decide between those two before I commit.From what I understand, OSSU starts from zero and is a 1-2 years long commitment but has a more active community, while TeachYourselfCS assumes some prior knowledge but claims to have a more targeted scope.

1m22xja,"Tip: Remember that ""programming"" is writing in a language!",peterlinddk,learnprogramming,"I don't know if this will reach those who need it the most, but I've seen a lot of posts from people being confused as to which programming language to choose, asking how long it will take to learn something, asking when you'll have learned enough to learn more or get a job. But unfortunately those questions can't really be answered - but fortunately it doesn't really matter!Remember that a programming language is *a language* \- and just like other languages created by humans, they are used to convey ideas to other humans. The computer doesn't care about the language you program it in, it only understands machine code, so the moment your program compiles you are basically free to throw away the source code. Except you don't do that, because you might want to change things later, or have someone else look at the code, another human, or a large language model, that also (tries to) understand language.So learning a programming language is a lot like learning any other language - there are syntax rules, grammar, different classes of words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and there are all the words in the language. A lot of them added by other humans, and in most cases still being added.If you managed to learn English (or whatever other secondary language you learnt) by reading the definition of the grammar and syntax, committing all the special cases to memory, and memorizing every single word, well, then maybe that will also work for you when learning programming! - But most of us didn't learn it that way, we picked up a few words, understood the sentence-structure, partly, tried to use the language, spoke and wrote, and made a lot of mistakes. And gradually we got better and better, learned more ""rules"" and even more exceptions to those rules, and picked up a lot of new words as we went along.Nobody has ever ""completed"" learning English - for one the language always changes, and always has, and also there are simply to many words, to many dialects even, to ever learn everything.Same goes for programming - you will probably never complete any language, there will always be something new to learn, or something that *you* use so rarely that you forget about it, and have to look it up on the rare occasions that you *do* need it.But that shouldn't discourage you from learning other languages - if you have to travel to France or Spain, you'll probably need to learn some French or Spanish, and you might even like it so much that you decide to stay and learn more - while still keeping your English, maybe forgetting a bit more than before, but never mind, you still know how to look it up!There are some grammar rules that you'll never understand, but somehow manage to use anyways. A lot of languages have gendered words, with very unspecific rules about why a specific word is one gender, but you'll get used to it ""sounding wrong"" when you use the wrong one. Same in programming, you might not be able to fully comprehend async or lambdas or closure, but just use it to write code where it ""sounds right"". A number of books and blogposts will try to invent rules to remember, but often they are even more difficult to understand, and also quite often simply wrong. So you'll get by and just ""do programming"" always feeling that you don't fully understand everything.Like you don't fully understand everything in the languages you write or speak - like you haven't meticulously memorized every single word, but somehow still use them. And some people find it easy to adapt to new languages, while others keep talking the dialect of their hometown even after having lived everywhere else their entire life. Sometimes you hear or read a word, and immediately understand it, other times you'll struggle your entire career with the spelling or pronouncination of some. The experience is different for everyone, and there is no set speed for how anything takes anyone else to learn.I hope that those of you fixating on languages will read and understand this - and maybe stop worrying so much, and get going using the languages - the programming languages - to actually build something. Not important original masterpieces, just small stories where you use the language as you are learning.",61,0.78,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m22xja/tip_remember_that_programming_is_writing_in_a/,2025-07-17 09:22:22,2025-07-19 01:46:59

Looking for advice on the best next step in my programming journey.**Background:** 37 y/o attorney with a Bachelors from Duke but in a non-STEM field. Spent the last 3 years doing MIT's undergrad Computer Science curriculum as well as the Odin Project. I would say I have an intermediate-level understanding of a lot of the concepts you would typically learn in an undergrad CS curriculum like OOP, DSA (basic concepts like DFS, BFS, linked lists, etc. as well as some slightly more advanced concepts like skip lists, VEB trees, linear programming, etc.), basic hardness proofs, discrete math, basic computer architecture, etc. Unfortunately because I went the entirely self-taught route, aside from portfolio projects I don't have any sort of credential to demonstrate this knowledge (for this reason, I'd recommend people avoid going that route if they can help it).**Goals:** At a minimum, I'd like to be able to sit for the patent bar and potentially leverage that to work more with clients in the tech industry. The dream scenario would be to make a career switch to software engineering but given my age and the state of the market I know that is extremely unlikely, so more focused on how I could leverage this for my law practice.**Path I'm Considering:** Am I crazy for thinking that Western Governors University is a logical next step for me? It's inexpensive, it seems like I might be able to grind through the curriculum pretty quick, and then I would at least have the Bachelors in CS box checked. The downside is that some of the stuff I read elsewhere on Reddit makes it sound like a diploma mill. But other online bachelors are much more expensive and might take me over 2 years to finish, and at the end of the day they are still online degrees so not sure they would even carry that much more weight anyway. I'm also really intrigued by Georgia Tech's OMSCS, but surprisingly it sounds like it would *not* be enough for me to sit for the patent bar because it's a Masters not a Bachelors. However, if I could knock out WGU in the next 6-9 months I could apply to GT in the Spring if I decide I want to go that route, so that's maybe another benefit of taking the WGU path.For those who have gone to WGU or who are knowledgeable about the various options for an online bachelors in CS, is WGU really so much worse than other online programs that it is worth the extra time and money to do another program?

Along with this I am also studying nextjs for SEO which react lacks in. It feels like I have put so much effort into learning all this because I know a lot of people who don’t even code outside uni despite having a passion for cs. But at the same time there are students who I work with at uni who feel so much more ahead of me and much more prepared for this industry. Yes I know comparison is the theft of joy. But I feel like it’s just unavoidable. At the same time with all the LLMs going around and vibe coding, I see students who vibe code websites under a day which would take me at least a few days to create all while them not even having a grasp of what the code is about.

I am a complete beginner to programming and my second language is Cree. I am posting here to ask how I should tackle this large project I have envisioned. My goal is to create a desktop-based application that is a dictionary for my Indigenous language. However I would like this to be more than just a dictionary, for example I would like to include all the conjugation tables for all verbs, which we have quite a lot in Cree. (In fact, around 85% of “words” in Cree are verbs). This would literally require tens of thousands of entries.Now every word can have quite a number of connections to other concepts. For example I envision this dictionary to include a section for synonyms and antonyms for each entry, each entry having a section for “semantic field” for related entries, a section for each entry showing all other entries from the root of that word. As well as relationships between words that mean the same, for example the same verb, just simply having a different gender for the object.I will just give some examples below:ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓐ (aahkwaatin) means “it is fierce, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓰᐤ (aahkwaatisiiu) means “s/he is fierce, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᔅᑲᑎᓐ (aahkwaaskatin) means “it is frozen very solid”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᔕᒻ (aahkwaatisham) means “s/he cuts it badly, seriously”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑲᒥᑌᐤ (aahkwaakamiteu) means “it is painfully hot liquid”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑌᔨᒣᐤ (aahkwaateyimeu) means “s/he thinks s/he is harmful, dangerous”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᓯᓈᑯᓐ (aahkwaasinaakun) means “it looks dangerous, harmful”ᐋᐦᐧᑳᑖᐦᑲᓴᒻ (aahkwaataahkasam) means “s/he burns it badly”You can see the pattern. Certain parts of the word mean certain things and this can be applied to all other words, this complex connectedness is what I would like to show and be able to interact with in my dictionary. To be able to categorize, display and filter through such related roots and terms.My question is which programming language should I learn to attempt such a project? As well as any tips or references that you all may have on how I should approach such a complex project.Thank you very much for taking the time to read through this and helping me keep my language alive and flourishing.Also, if this language interests you, feel free to PM me to learn more about it!

I am learning it by building a super simple 2D game with the Raylib library.I noticed today that if you free(ptr), and forget to set it to NULL, then you have no way to know later, when trying to access or modify it, that it was actually freed!

The program might keep running and have an unexpected bug/crash deep down the road unexpectedly. I have asked some LLMs and they recommended this macro: #define SAFE_FREE(ptr) do { free(ptr); ptr = NULL; } while(0)This seems safer *to me* compared to calling free directly, because I already forgot to set pointers to NULL after freeing them. I like this idea, but I'm not immediately using it because I'm a noob and am suspicious.I came here to ask this: Is there a catch here?

As such, I’ve spent the most time with C++, especially with graphics because that is so far my favorite area of CS and C++ is built for such high performance yet complex applications like game engines and has very good support for OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, GLFW, GLM, etc. But, even after 5 years of time spent, every time I start up a big project I get super bummed out because my code looks nothing like other folks code bases. Or I’ll end up watching some CPP con talk where the speaker essentially says everything I’m doing is wrong. Even going through the r/CPP subreddit (a great subreddit, no hate), it just seems like my code is way too archaic and I just don’t get it. No matter how much I try to modularize and use professional OOP principles in my programs, it just doesn’t ever look right and leads to essentially a more procedural approach which seems to be looked down upon by most C++ programmers.Of course, this imposter syndrome leads me to quit projects and rage delete everything that I’m working on. My GitHub went from 20 projects to about 2 because of how much I hated all my stuff. I just don’t have this issue with other languages either; for the most part with C, Java, Rust, etc. there is an intuitive way of doing things but with C++ it drives me insane because I have no idea the right way to do things when there’s so much stuff. But there’s not much other choice when it comes to computer graphics because it seems that C++ is the primary language for that kind of stuff so I just have to deal with itSo is this a normal feeling? Should I continue with C++ or should I maybe get better at using another language and then applying what i learn from other languages to C++? Or is there a good alternative to C++?",6,0.88,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m0llzn/imposter_syndrome_after_5_years_of_c/,2025-07-15 15:59:15,2025-07-19 01:46:59

1m2jf07,How can I get better at understanding documentations?,AreYouXeriouss,learnprogramming,"I always had a hard time understanding documentations, because lot of the times they are so abstract for me, I can’t really visualize what can I do with them, unless I see an example, or it’s written in a “for dummies” way.

Here are some examples I just found:Go unsafe package Alignof function:“Alignof takes an expression x of any type and returns the required alignment of a hypothetical variable v as if v was declared via var v = x. It is the largest value m such that the address of v is always zero mod m. It is the same as the value returned by…” okay? No idea how could I use this? Why would I need an alignment of a hypothetical variable?Kea DHCP:“Designed to Integrate with Your Existing Systems. Kea allows you to separate the data from the execution environment, enabling new deployment options.” This is so broad, what data can I separate? What is the execution environment? What this has to do with dhcp?I could search for more, but I hope this two kinda illustrates my point. And JUST TO BE CLEAR, I’m not blaming the people who write the documentations, in fact I envy them, and I want to learn how to understand them better (if it’s possible, maybe I’m just dumb), because now basically the only way I can learn something is through video tutorials, as they explain it in a very friendly way usually, or if the documentation is very well and easily understandably written.",3,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m2jf07/how_can_i_get_better_at_understanding/,2025-07-17 21:07:59,2025-07-19 01:46:59

Are there any free resources / websites that people would suggest for learning java?

(although text is preferred)I don't mind if it starts from the basics, that would be fine as a little refresher and to see what java does differently than other languages, I can always skip what I already know.Also its a small annoyance, not really a problem, but I don't like sites that offer free resources or tutorials and stuff but then force you to create an account. Although if its worth it for what they offer and they have good resources that's fine, but I just don't like having to create 5 different accounts for a bunch of different services. I know its unlikely anyone will know it but a while ago (might have been on a different subreddit) there was someone who posted a website they were making to teach others java and it was pretty nice, plain text, some examples with syntax highlighting, but no adds or images that I had noticed, just text.If anyone happens to know remember the site it would be neat if you could comment the link thanks.Edit: just as context for the type of site I would (ideally) like to look for.

I watched an AI agent, part of an internally built tool our company is piloting, take in a small Jira ticket. It was the kind of task that would usually take me or a teammate about an hour. Mostly writing a SQL query and making a small change to some backend code.The AI read through our codebase, figured out the context, wrote the query, updated the code, created a PR with a clear diff and a well-written description, and pushed it for review. All in just a few minutes.This wasn’t boilerplate. It followed our naming conventions, made logical decisions, and even updated a test. One of our senior engineers reviewed the PR and said it looked solid and accurate. They would have done it the same way.What really hit me is that this isn’t some future concept. This AI tool is being gradually rolled out across teams in our org as part of a pilot program. And it’s already producing results like this.I’ve been following AI developments, but watching it do my job in my codebase made everything feel real in a way headlines never could. It was a ticket I would have knocked out before lunch, and now it’s being done faster and with less effort by a machine.I’m not saying engineers will be out of jobs tomorrow.

1m2nz4j,I quit my job. In this economy.,YonghaeCho,cscareerquestions,"Long story short, I just couldn't take it anymore.I worked at a small startup, so things had to be fast-paced. I worked hard. Really hard. Always put up with long nights, long code reviews, etc. The whole nine yards. But, in the real world, working hard doesn't mean jack shit if it doesn't produce good results. Or, at least, the results your boss wants in the timely manner that they please. So I was always on the disappointing end of my boss. There was never a time when I was good enough for him. I always felt... mediocre. And this isn't to pin anything on my boss or whatever. I'm just saying that I wasn't able to live up to his expectations.I lost a lot of sleep over the fact that I was just never good enough; I was never off of work mode, due to the anxiety and the constant self-deprecation. There were even nights when I'd run to the toilet for a quick vomit session due to the stress.There was always something to complain about. Something to say about my not being good at this or that. ""Why did you do it like this?"" and ""You definitely had AI write up this code, didn't you?"" (no, I didn't). Despite it all, I still tried. I tried my darnedest. I grit my teeth and took everything as feedback and always thanked him. I always tried applying what I was told. I always admitted when I fell short, never pushing back or disrespecting my boss due to my feelings or ego being hurt. I always took everything on the chin. But it always ate at me. So, of course, I snapped. I told my boss that I was quitting cold turkey. Why? It was the only way out of the intense burnout that I could see.To my surprise, he didn't want me to quit. But of course. It costs money to find, hire, and train a new engineer, and it's risky when you don't really know what that new engineer could be capable of (or not), as opposed to the engineer that you already have and are familiar with. So I'm not surprised. But I've known my boss for a while now. Me revoking my quitting was not going to solve anything for *me*. Maybe it would've in the short-term at my job, but I know that things would've just gone back to how they always were. That's how life rolls.

1m2dbq7,"Differences I see from my experience in Defense, MAANG and Big tech industries.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,cscareerquestions,"Hey all,Im 7 YOE. I have worked in the defense industry my first few years (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc), then during the hiring height of 2020-2022 I went to FAANG-level company and spent a few years there in their cloud based system. THis year I got laid off and after a few months I was able to get a job in a big tech cloud based system. I wouldnt consider my current company FAANG level but id say most people would know it. I will pre-face this that it is my experience. Im not saying every project in each industry is like this, I've known people in AWS who claim to not have to do anything past 5 pm and get great reviews and bonuses. I know people in defense who say they work a shitload of hours to get things done.Here are some of the differences I've seen from all three jobs:# Onboarding:Defense - didnt really have an onboarding. It was just kind of, build and run the system. I remember they gave me a task to change the headers of a few files just as an excuse to get me to build.FAANG - they bascially gave me an onboarding doc, that didnt even seem official. It was just a doc that got passed around with steps. I was surpriused nobody had ever took time to put it in a version control style doc system. It was just in the middle of some doc sharing system online.Current: to my surprise their onboarding was the best and most chill. They gave me clear indiciation of where they expect me to be. The first week was just 3 hour courses each day of onboarding for my company. The second week was a self paced class for onboarding for my team. The videos were very instructive, and easy to follow along and my favorite part was they basically gave us guidelines for how to get promoted.# work life balance:Defense - probably had the best work life balance of the bunch. I never had to think about work after 5pm. By 6 the building was a ghost town with a few stragglers. They worked on a 9/80 schedule so I had 3 day weekends 2-3 times a month (26 times a year). I could also work for extra PTO, where if I worked extra hours one week I could save it in a ""extra time"" bank and use it as future PTO.FAANG - definetely the worse of the 3 so far. It was expected ot be available practically 24/7. I went to that FAANG company because I had heard it was one of the few that you coould have a life, but I never realized that cloud was the exception to that rule. People were respodning to emails late at night, getting on calls late, responding on vacation, etc. THey were cool about taking time off but it felt like if you weren't drinking the kool aid and doing 10x more like verybody else was doing, it wouldnt go well for you.Current - still early to tell but it seems that there isnt as much of a ""work late"" culture here. People set their own times, some work a bit later but Ive never seen any crazy discussions happen at 11 pm like I did in my last job. A few principal engineers have gone on vacation and not yet have I seen any of them get on a call or message thread to answer any type of question.# Expectiations:Defense - really didnt have much expectations. I practically worked 20 hours, coasted the rest, was my team's scrum master, etc and over excelled in their eyes. There was no real due date on things because contracts in defense last multiple years. I remember when I got there the expectation was to complete the project within my first year. It took 3 years to finish and nobody batted an eye.FAANG - expectations were very high. If you were finishin up with a major task, theyd throw another one at you before you were even done with the first. Seemed even as aJr/mid-level I was expected to lead meetings, always be available, etc. I worked way more at this job than I did at defense and felt like i was underperforming because if I did 8-10 hours, most others did 10-12 hour days. In reviews it seemed like I was compared to my teammates, not so much compared to what the expectation of the job was.Current - again still early. But seems like their expectations are pretty fair. A quote from the first day I like was ""if you want to be the person that does 40 hour weeks and gets your job done, you can have a long career here. If you want to be the person that does 50+ hour weeks here for that quicker promotion, you can do that but just respect your work-life balance"".# Time and meetings:Defense - hardly had any meetings. We did standup evertday (except fridays) for 30 minutes but it mostly lasted 15 minutes. We hardly went over. I never learned the concept of parking lot until I got to FAANG lol. It was in office so just walking to someone's desk was really just the norm.FAANG - seemed like if your day didnt have 4 hours of meetings, you were underperforming. Everything was a discussion. Parking lot would take an extra hour and most of it was discussing things that I felt didnt really have to take that long. At times some of my tasks were pushed back due to someone wanting to discuss about one simple change. If you had to talk to someone, it was hard to get them on a call and when you did they didnt appreciate their time being wasted. In meetings it seemed everyone was stressed to have the meeting finish.Current - seems nobody is really stressed about meetings. Parking lot items get resolved pretty quickly. Everybody doesn't mind hopping on a call and lasting an hour with you.Edit: someone asked for interview styles. I wont give exact details but ill say more or less how it was.# Interview:Defense: I was a college grad so I got invited to an all day hriing event by the company. It seemed like the interviews didnt ask anything technical, they jsut wanted to get ot know me. At the end of the day they had me list my favorite teams and told me theyd let me know. I've interviewed for other defense companies, tbh there were no leetcode questions or anything like that. Technical questions were more like ""what is OOP?"" or how I would design a simple code.FAANG - first was a pre-round codesignal style question to see if I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that I went through 2-3 rounds of interviews asking leetcode style questions and then a manager meet.Big tech - similar to faang. Pre-interview exam to make sure I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that it was 2-3 rounds of code/system questions.Edit 2: people asked about TC# TC\- Defense: as a college grad in a HCOL state I started at about 78k wiht a 5k bonus. Within 4 years and 1 promotion I was making 90k and yearly bonuses that was around 5k-8k. No stock. I know people who jumped to other defense company and they are around 120k. Promotion seemed like it happened every 2-3 years.\- FAANG - I never got promoted in my few years though I doubt I deserved it in their eyes. I never really saw anybody get promoted really. Like one mid level SWE had been working more than most seniors and she didnt get promoted. AS for TC it was about 220k between base stocks and signing bonus. I moved to a low COL state shortly after joining and my base pay dropped by 20k so it ended up being around 200k\- Current company - TC is about 200k with just basepay and stock (no signing bonus) but according to them, im promised up to 10% bonus that would bring my total pay to around 215k.# Benefits\- Defense: 3 weeks of accrued PTO. But since there was timsheet we technically were not allowed to do overtime. A work around was if I worked 90 hours in a 2 week period, I could use 10 hours and save it in a special bank that I could use later on. So If in a 4 week period I worked 200 hours, I could set 40 hours to that special bank. And if I had a 2week vacation I could use the special bank for the first week and my regular PTO for the second week. It was good benefits outside of that, tuition reimbursement which I used to get my master's degree without taking on more debt. Discounts on personal travel (it wasnt amazing but good enough) etc.\- FAANG - Unlimited PTO. Some of the best benefits i've ever seen will probably will ever have. There were multiple different types of reimbursement programs for almost anything. Discount codes on almost any store that were actually pretty good discounts. Similar benefits when it comes to tuition reimbursement, etc.\- Big tech - unlimited PTO. Again good benefits, just not as good as FAANG. Company will give random 3 day weekends to employees that they announce pretty early so people have it prepared.",200,0.94,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m2dbq7/differences_i_see_from_my_experience_in_defense/,2025-07-17 17:13:44,2025-07-19 01:47:00

1m1rmts,Why AI is not replacing you anytime soon,therealslimshady1234,cscareerquestions,"If you think AI will be replacing you as an engineer, you are probably wildly overestimating the AI, or underestimating yourself. Let me explain.The best AI cannot even do 10% of my job as a senior software engineer I estimate. And there are hard problems which prevent them from doing any better, not in the least of which is that they already ran out of training data. They are also burning through billions with no profitability in sight, almost as quickly as they are burning through natural resources such as water, electricity and chips. Not even to mention the hardest problem which is that it is a machine (or rather, routine), not a sentient being with creativity. It will always think ""inside the box"" even if that box appears to be very large. While they are at it, they hallucinate quite a good percentage of their answers as well, making them critically flawed for even the more mundane tasks without tight supervision. None of these problems have a solution in the LLM paradigm. LLMs for coding is a square peg for a round hole. People tend to think that due to AI being a program that it naturally must be good at programming, but it really doesn't work that way. It is the engineers that make the program, not the other way around. They are far better at stuff like writing and marketing, but even there it is still a tool at best and not replacing any human directly. Yes, it can replace humans indirectly through efficiency gains but only up till a point. In the long term, the added productivity gained from using the tool should merit hiring more people, so this would lead to more jobs, not less.The reason we are seeing so many layoffs right now is simply due to the post-pandemic slump. Companies hired like crazy, had all kinds of fiscal incentives and the demand was at an all time high. Now all these factors have been reversed and the market is correcting. Also, the psychopathic tendency to value investors over people has increased warranting even more cost cutting measures disguised as AI efficiency gains. That's why it is so loved by investors, it's a carte blanche to fire people and ""trim the fat"" as they put it. For the same reason, Microsoft's CEO is spouting nonsense that XX% of the code is already written by AI. It's not true, but it raises the stock price like clockwork, and that’s the primary mission of a CEO of a large public company.tl;dr AI is mostly a grift artificially kept afloat by investor billions which are quickly running out",112,0.75,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m1rmts/why_ai_is_not_replacing_you_anytime_soon/,2025-07-16 23:11:54,2025-07-19 01:47:00

I also did an unpaid internship after second year of college where I didn’t learn anything. I never include it on my resume because I believe it is hard to verify unpaid internship and I genuinely believe it added no value to my resume. I ended up adding the unpaid internship and tutoring/proctoring i did in school to my updated resume and sent it to the recruiter along with the screenshots of the communication I had with the startup i did an unpaid internship for as proof. Am I screwed? I am so confused why HR has this policy when I never lied on my resume or application and I passed the interview as software engineer 2.

1m0vgst,Too late for career change?,coldestfusion,cscareerquestions,"I'm 48 years old in the USA and wondering if it's too late for a career change. I have been at my very small(less than 20 employees) non-tech company 19 years, and for the last 15 of those years I have been solely responsible for both developing our customer facing applications and managing the infrastructure they run on. I shifted the entire company's tech from a closet in the office to AWS in 2017, and in since then our downtime can be measured in minutes. While our company is tiny, we have several very large clients and the applications I have written(mostly in .NET) have scaled well to their often heavy demands. And I painstakingly migrated a few huge, monolithic [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms apps to Razor Pages and Blazor. I am also the sole manager of Active Directory, virtual desktops, etc. The good: I am fully remote and make $140,000 a year. Because I have the company's tech basically on auto-pilot I might work ten hours in a busy week. I have no deadlines, no one looking over my shoulder, one pointless meeting a week, and if I need to buy something for the company tech-wise no one even notices. I nominally have a boss, but he's in his late 60's and checked out years ago.The bad: I made $135,000 before COVID and I don't see that changing any time soon. No raise this year. I receive no benefits, no bonus, no retirement funding beyond my own contributions. I am fortunate that my wife has a good job and great health insurance so that is not a concern. And even though I don't work a ton of hours, I always need to be available because there is no one else but me to answer customer questions or deal with even the most minor of glitches in the system. I haven't had a full work day off in over an year, even on vacation I always have to do something and be available. There is no budget to hire anyone else. Because neither our employees or clients are technically adept all my interactions with them are on the level of helping my Mom print an email. I am concerned about the long term viability of this company and bored out of my mind, but who would hire me? I've never worked on a team. I've never managed anyone. I have no idea how ""real"" companies develop production code. I code in Visual Studio, push to Github which kicks off an AWS Codepipeline, done. Nobody checks my work. We don't have budgets. I don't know what a pull request is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.I plan to retire by 62 so I know the easy answer is to just ride this out until then but like I said, I don't know that the company will be around that long.

Or it’ll suggest a “quick fix” that completely ignores the ADR you spent two days writing.It’s not just that it’s wrong sometimes but it’s that it’s convincingly wrong. Which is worse than useless when you’re moving fast.I’ve even had to consciously dial back my use of it on one of our event-driven services because I noticed I was rubber-stamping suggestions instead of thinking about the architecture myself. Anyway just curious if anyone else has had the same arc. I’m not anti-AI. It’s staying in my toolbox.

1m10ljk,Feeling let down after making simple mistakes in a coding test as an experienced developer,Jbentansan,cscareerquestions,"I have about 3 years of experience as a software engineer. For the past 1.5 years, my old manager asked me to work with another team which is more Data science/Data engineering related. It's more backend and data science-oriented. I didn't have any prior data science experience, but the codebase was manageable, and most of my tasks involved fixing bugs or building straightforward features without deep DS knowledge.Recently, my manager asked me if I wanted to change my job title to reflect my current role, I agreed. But to officially ""transfer"", I had to pass a Python coding test. I was surprised since by this point I'd already shipped multiple features, fixed a shit ton of bugs, but went ahead anyway.The first test went super badly lol, questions about two-sum, basic string manipulation, pandas, and numpy threw me off. I felt terrible and asked for a retake. I studied pandas thoroughly as that was the one thing I had no experience in, but the second test didn't even have pandas questions, it had a simple fizzbuzz-type problem, some question regarding numpys again (which I got right, but I hadn't converted the original array to np.array, which got me a zero lol), For the fizz buzz type question, I messed up badly by using `if` instead of `elif`.I asked for one last try. The third test (10) questions were incredilby easy, I thought they felt pity for me lol, then came question 11 and 12, 11 had pass some argument or something to a parser, I honestly didn't even understand the question and 12 had me converting a sentence to numbers, like tokenization. I got the logic right, but couldn't remember the syntax for removing punctuation. Unfortunately, CoderPad doesn't give partial credit, so I failed again. Now I'm seriously doubting my abilities. In my mind, its like I can just look up this information ( syntax about removing punctuation) is it really fair for me to get a zero on this?Even though my manager has had no complaints and my performance reviews have been good, I'm suddenly experiencing major imposter syndrome. Missing these simple questions is making me spiral. I'm worried that without the title change, I won't get promoted, or worse, might lose my job.Maybe I'm just venting, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. The self-doubt is really impacting my productivity and emotional stateEDIT: My day to day doesn't really involve lot of coding nowadays, its mostly shipping features from existing codebase and just migrating it with some minor adjustments. Fixing bugs and talking with the stakeholders to see what kind of results are they expecting. Even when I do this, I can always test/debug, but its pretty much not possible to debug on the 'coderpad' tests.",24,0.8,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m10ljk/feeling_let_down_after_making_simple_mistakes_in/,2025-07-16 02:06:58,2025-07-19 01:47:00

It’s possible that for now, I can sneak by just volunteering for some other project, but I’m sure that will run out eventually. If all hands presentations are any indicator, my company is really drinking the ""Pivot to AI as a business model"" Kool Aid. And so I feel like I can’t turn down AI projects or even discuss my concerns without it seeming like insubordination, or putting a target on my back as not aligned with the company’s vision, or seeming like a luddite uninterested in learning new skills.I realize “AI” is a lot more than just ChatGPT-generated slop, and so I want to at least be open-minded to the ways it can be a useful tool without the ethical concerns. But I’m unsure to what extent those applications \*do\* exist, and if they do, how to initiate a conversation about finding projects that would be less soul-crushing.

However, in order to bring life to my project and take it out of the database I have been teaching myself Flask in order to create a basic website. Right now I am kind of at a crossroads. I can either finish my basic webpage and focus my energy on deepening my data engineering skills and knowledge (e.g. learning Spark, NoSQL, Kafka, Snowflake, practicing SQL more etc.) or expand my frontend skills and knowledge (e.g. learning Javascript, Typescript, and frontend framework such as React).I ask because I am starting a graduate program (Msc Computer Science conversion) but I will still likely need to build these skills in my own time, but I'll definitely have limited time and won't be able to do both.I also ask because while I find DE very interesting and engaging, I understand that DE isn't something people do right after graduating as it is quite niche and it takes a few years experience either being an analyst or a SWE.My goal is to develop the skills to maximize my chances of employability.Help me help myself Thanks!",7,0.82,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lxyj9p/yet_to_be_cs_postgrad_breadth_vs_depth_should_i/,2025-07-12 11:48:51,2025-07-19 01:47:00

I'm planning to graduate in 3.5 to 3 years, and so far, I'm on track to do so.My most relevant courses are a data engineering in python course, a general OOP course, calc 2, stats 2, and discrete math. I have an unpaid ""internship"" at some fintech startup this summer where I used ""python and AI agent tools to automate workflows"", but we don't really do anything so that's basically just resume filler.My main ""experience"" is from doing projects on my own. I listed them below:1. I made a linear regression model from scratch and trained it on the WHO life expectancy data, and found it matched scikit-learn's model pretty much exactly.2. I fine-tuned an open-source LLM on better completing inspirational English quotes and pushed it to HuggingFace.3. I'm currently working on this but I'm almost done; but I'm implementing the transformer architecture described in the research paper ""Attention is All You Need"" from scratch.I have heard usually people start off as data engineers/scientists and work their way up to becoming an ML engineer, and I know that you need knowledge with cloud services, containerization, generally good engineering practices, etc. etc. I'm sure you need solid DSA skills too.Given my background, I was basically wondering what my next steps are here. Obviously I'd love to secure a more relevant, paid internship, but beyond that, what do I need to do in order to achieve my end goal? What things should I focus on at what times in order to best optimize my career path for the future?I'd really appreciate whatever advice you guys give, because I really want to make sure I'm doing the right thing. Thank you!",3,0.71,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m1op1k/roadmap_advice_to_becoming_an_ml_engineer/,2025-07-16 21:11:11,2025-07-19 01:47:00
1m0r76e,Recent BS Grad. Trying to land first job.,Drink-MoreWater,cscareerquestions,"[US Based] Got my BS in SofDev and Security from a not well-known school, and I’ve started applying like crazy. I got a couple responses, but nothing guaranteed of course, as I’ve got no real world experience. So, my question is, what could I do moving forward to pad up the resume? I’ve seen people say they could care less about certificates, but surely some have to have some sort of value.(?) For example certs in AWS, Kubernetes, Oracle, cloud, etc. for gaining detailed familiarity on tool and environments an organization might use?I’ve seen the usual recommendation of creating something that is impressive and unique to show off your talent. I definitely need to get to this as my university’s assignments were not very impressive, but I also like the idea of getting something tangible like a certificate.My current company is kind of tech related and offers all the study materials for free for practically all certs available. I just have to pay for the test I think. So, paying for a cert is not an issue. Certificates won’t make me a mid-level dev, but it will show initiative and that I’ve done what I can on my end.Lastly, do FAANG certs help to get into FAANG? I know FAANG is not the only place to aspire to be at, but I just wanted tho throw that out there.Any advice? Thank you.",3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m0r76e/recent_bs_grad_trying_to_land_first_job/,2025-07-15 19:26:35,2025-07-19 01:47:00
