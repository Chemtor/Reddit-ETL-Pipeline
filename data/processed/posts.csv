1moanf4,The push for LLMs is making my data team's work worse,Hunt_Visible,dataengineering,"The board is pressuring us to adopt LLMs for tasks we already had deterministic, reliable solutions for. The result is a drop in quality and an increase in errors. And I know that my team will be held responsible for these errors, even though their use is imposed and they are inevitable.Here are a few examples that we are working on across the team and that are currently suffering from this:* Data Extraction from PDFs/Websites: We used to use a case-by-case approach with things like regex, keywords, and stopwords, which was highly reliable. Now, we're using LLMs that are more flexible but make many more mistakes.* Fuzzy Matching: Matching strings, like customer names, was a deterministic process. LLMs are being used instead, and they're less accurate.* Data Categorization: We had fixed rules or supervised models trained for high-accuracy classification of products and events. The new LLM-based approach is simply less precise.The technology we had before was accurate and predictable. This new direction is trading reliability for perceived innovation, and the business is suffering for it. The board doesn't want us to apply specific solutions to specific problems anymore; they want the magical LLM black box to solve everything in a generic way.",293,0.99,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1moanf4/the_push_for_llms_is_making_my_data_teams_work/,2025-08-12 14:43:52,2025-08-15 01:46:34

1mloi5n,Column-level lineage from SQL… in the browser?!,AdNumerous2187,dataengineering,"Hi everyone!Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been working on a small library that generates **column-level lineage** from SQL queries **directly in the browser**.The idea came from wanting to leverage column-level lineage **on the front-end** — for things like visualizing data flows or propagating business metadata.Now, I know there are already great tools for this, like [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) or the [OpenLineage SQL parser](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/sql). But those are built for Python or Java. That means if you want to use them in a browser-based app, you either:* Stand up an API to call them, or* Run a Python runtime in the browser via something like Pyodide (which feels a bit heavy when you just want some metadata in JS :smiling_face_with_tear:)This got me thinking — there’s still a pretty big gap between **data engineering tooling** and **front-end use cases**. We’re starting to see more tools ship with WASM builds, but there’s still a lot of room to grow an ecosystem here.I’d love to hear if you’ve run into similar gaps.If you want to check it out (or see a partially “vibe-coded” demo :grinning_face_with_sweat:), here are the links:* [Repo](https://github.com/nickBes/meta-sql)* [Demo](https://nickbes.github.io/meta-sql/)**Note:** The library is still experimental and may change significantly.",144,0.91,22,https://i.redd.it/aau9eu53ezhf1.png,2025-08-09 12:42:28,2025-08-15 01:46:34

1mky6wv,Quantum Odyssey update: now close to being a complete bible of quantum computing for data engineering,QuantumOdysseyGame,dataengineering,"Hey guys,I want to share with you the latest Quantum Odyssey update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post (4 weeks ago), to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists.In a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in ""quantum logic"". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.Although still in Early Access, now it should be completely bug free and everything works as it should. From now on I'll focus solely on building features requested by players.Game now teaches:1. Linear algebra - vector-matrix multiplication, complex numbers, pretty much everything about SU2 group matrices and their impact on qubits by visually seeing the quantum state vector at all times.2. Clifford group (rotations X, Z , S, Y, Hadamard), SX , T and you can see the Kronecker product for any SU2 group combinations up to 2\^5 and their impact on any given quantum state for up to 5 qubits in Hilbert space.3. All quantum phenomena and quantum algorithms that are the result of what the math implies. Every visual generated on the screen is 1:1 to the linear algebra behind (BV, Grover, Shor..)4. Sandbox mode allows absolutely anything to be constructed using both complex numbers and polars.5. Now working on setting up some ideas for weekly competitions in-game. Would be super cool if we could have some real use cases that we can split in up to 5 qubit state compilation/ decomposition problems and serve these through tournaments.. but it might be too early lmk if you got ideas.TL;DR: 60h+ of actual content that takes this a bit beyond even what is regularly though in Quantum Information Science classes Msc level around the world (the game is used by 23 universities in EU via [https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/](https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/) ) and a ton of community made stuff. You can literally read a science paper about some quantum algorithm and port it in the game to see its Hilbert space or ask players to optimize it.Improvements in the past 4 weeks:In-game quotes now come from contemporary physicists. If you have some epic quote you'd like to add to the game (and your name, if you work in the field) for one of the puzzles do let me know. This was some super tedious work (check this patch update [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english) )Big one:We started working on making an offline version that is snycable to the Steam version when you have an internet connection that will be delivered in two phases:Phase 1: Asynchronous Gameplay FlowWe're introducing a system where you no longer have to necessarily wait for the server to respond with your score and XP after each puzzle. These updates will be handled asynchronously, letting you move straight to the next puzzle. This should improve the experience of players on spotty internet connections!Phase 2: Fully Offline ModeWe’re planning to support full offline play, where all progress is saved locally and synced to the server once you're back online. This means you’ll be able to enjoy the game uninterrupted, even without an internet connectionWhy the game requires an internet connection atm?Single player is just the learning part - which can only be done well by seeing how players solve things, how long they spend on tutorials and where they get stuck in game, not to mention this is an open-ended puzzle game where new solutions to old problems are discovered as time goes on. I want players to be rewarded for inventing new solutions or trying to find those already discovered, stuff that requires online and alerts that new solves were discovered. The game branches into bounty hunting (hacking other players) and community content creation/ solving/ rewards after that, currently. A lot more in the future, if things go well.We wanted offline from the start but it was practically not feasible since simply nailing down a good learning curve for quantum computing one cannot just ""guess"".",63,0.89,11,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mky6wv,2025-08-08 15:25:34,2025-08-15 01:46:34
1mkt82k,How can Databricks be faster than Snowflake? Doesn't make sense.,Razzmatazz110,dataengineering,"This article and many others say that Databricks is much faster/cheaper than Snowflake. [https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b](https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b)So I am new to Databricks, and still just in the initial exploring stages. But I have been using Snowflake for quite a while now for my job. The thing I dont understand is how is Databricks faster when running a query than on Snowflake.The Scenario I am thinking is - I got lets say 10 TB of CSV data in an AWS S3 bucket., and I have no choice in the file format or partitioning. Let us say it is some kind of transaction data, and the data is stored partitioned by **DATE** (but I might be not interested in filtering based on Date, I could be interested in filtering by Product ID).1. Now on Snowflake, I know that I have to ingest the data into a Snowflake Internal Table. This converts the data into a columnar Snowflake proprietary format, which is best suited for Snowflake to read the data. Lets say I cluster the table on Date itself, resembling a similar file partition as on the S3 bucket. But I enable search optimization on the table too. 2. Now if I am to do the same thing on Databricks (Please correct me if I am wrong), Databricks doesnt create any proprietary database file format. It uses the underlying S3 bucket itself as data, and creates a table based on that. It is not modified to any database friendly version. **(Please do let me know if there is a way to convert data to a database friendly format similar to Snowflake on Databricks).**Considering that Snowflake makes everything SQL query friendly, and Databricks just has a bunch of CSV files in an S3 bucket, for the comparable size of compute on both, how can Databricks be faster than Snowflake? What magic is that? Or am I thinking about this completely wrong and using or not knowing the functionality Databricks has? In terms of the use case scenario, I am not interested in Machine learning in this context, just pure SQL execution on a large database table. I do understand Databricks is much better for ML stuff.",62,0.83,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mkt82k/how_can_databricks_be_faster_than_snowflake/,2025-08-08 11:58:32,2025-08-15 01:46:34

1mpo86v,# Roast my project: DataCompose: I brought shadcn's copy-to-own pattern to pyspark - am I stupid?,nonamenomonet,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, sorry for the provocative title. I'd love to get some feedback on a project I've been working on. I was inspired by how full-stack developers use shadcn and shadcn-svelte (svelte is superior to react btw) with their ""copy-to-own"" pattern. I think this pattern could solve a common pain point in data engineering: most of us work in environments where adding new dependencies requires extensive justification. What if we could get the functionality we need without adding dependencies, while still owning and understanding every line of code?Here's how it works: [DataCompose](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose) maintains a registry of battle tested (read: aggressively unit tested) data cleaning primitives. The CLI copies these directly into your repo as plain PySpark code. No runtime dependencies, no magic. You can modify, extend, or completely rewrite them. Once the code is in your repo, you can even delete the CLI and everything still works.**Note**: The generated code assumes you already have PySpark set up in your environment. DataCompose focuses on providing the cleaning logic, not managing your Spark installation. ## Code Example ```bashdatacompose init# Generate email cleaning primitivesdatacompose add clean_emails --target pyspark# Generate address standardization primitives datacompose add clean_addresses --target pyspark# Generate phone number validation primitivesdatacompose add clean_phone_numbers --target pyspark``````pythonfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSessionfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F# Import the generated primitivesfrom build.pyspark.clean_emails.email_primitives import emails# Create Spark sessionspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(""DataCleaning"").getOrCreate()# Load your datadf = spark.read.csv(""data.csv"", header=True)# Apply email transformationscleaned_df = df.withColumn( ""email_clean"", emails.standardize_email(F.col(""email""))).withColumn( ""email_domain"", emails.extract_domain(F.col(""email_clean""))).withColumn( ""is_valid"", emails.is_valid_email(F.col(""email_clean"")))# Filter to valid emails onlyvalid_emails = cleaned_df.filter(F.col(""is_valid""))````I wanted to bring some of Svelte's magic to this, so my personal favorite way to do data transformations is like this:```pythonfrom build.clean_emails.email_primitives import emails# Create a comprehensive email cleaning pipeline@emails.compose()def clean_email_pipeline(email_col): # Fix common typos first (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc) email = emails.fix_common_typos(email_col) # Standardize the email (lowercase, trim whitespace) email = emails.standardize_email(email) # For Gmail addresses, normalize dots and plus addressing if emails.is_gmail(email): email = emails.normalize_gmail(email) # Validate and mark suspicious patterns is_valid = emails.is_valid_email(email) is_disposable = emails.is_disposable_domain(email)# Apply the pipeline to your dataframedf = df.withColumn(""email_results"", clean_email_pipeline(F.col(""raw_email"")))```Or you can do it like this (like a normie):```pythondef clean_email_pipeline(col): # Fix common typos first (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc) col = emails.fix_common_typos(col) col = emails.standardize_email(col) # For Gmail addresses, normalize dots and plus addressing if emails.is_gmail(col): col = emails.normalize_gmail(col) return coldf = df.withColumn(""email_results"", clean_email_pipeline(F.col(""raw_email"")))```## Key Features- **Composable Primitives**: Build complex transformations from simple, reusable functions- **Smart Partial Application**: Configure transformations with parameters for reuse- **Pipeline Compilation**: Convert declarative pipeline definitions into optimized Spark operations- **Code Generation**: Generate standalone PySpark code with embedded dependencies- **Comprehensive Libraries**: Pre-built primitives for emails, addresses, and phone numbers- **Conditional Logic**: Support for if/else branching in pipelines- **Type Safe Operations**: All transformations maintain Spark column type safety## Why This Approach?- **You Own Your Code**: No external dependencies to manage or worry about breaking changes- **Full Transparency**: Every transformation is readable, debuggable PySpark code you can understand- **Customization First**: Need to adjust a transformation? Just edit the code## I AM LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK !!!! I WANT TO KNOW IF I AM CRAZY OR NOT!Currently supporting three primitive types: addresses, emails, and phone numbers.

1molb7d,The most senior guy on my team treats me horribly while others don't really do much,Mathlete7,dataengineering,"I started working at a pretty respected company about three years ago. There was never really a proper learning pathway here. It is more of a watch and try to do it yourself type of setup. Over time I have built a decent number of reports and have become one of the few people on the team who consistently does actual work. Out of a team of 10 it feels like only about three of us really contribute. Honestly it is kind of crazy.The biggest issue I am dealing with is the most senior guy on the team. For some reason he seems to have it out for me. I have taken feedback from plenty of stakeholders without any problem. They treat me with respect. But this guy is never happy with anything I do. I can follow his instructions exactly and he still finds something to criticise. He has even called me names in front of the team and regularly insults my work. I am not claiming to be the best data engineer in the world but I do put in the effort. Meanwhile there are people on the team who have not done real work in months yet he treats them like gold.The tricky part is that despite how he treats me he is the only person I can really go to for help because he knows everything. The problem is if he is wrong about something he will just double down and act like he is right. For example last week he claimed we could not use Power BI for a report because the stakeholder’s PC could not handle it even though I am pretty sure most of the heavy lifting is done by PowerBI.com.The team has been together for over 30 years so even if I went to HR I doubt anyone would back me up. And the newer people would not want to stir the pot since they have it easy getting paid for doing almost nothing.I have mentioned my concerns to my line manager and he says that I am being to sensitive to the feedback on my work and its just how the guy is. There may be some truth to that, but its kinda hard to take feedback when every other comment is laced with a snide/condescending comment Some of the team members say that he's been talking about me on calls for hours after I leave, and I told him that it makes me feel like I am not safe here, to which he said ""That's because you are not safe x"" and the entire call went silent.

(sigh)We use Domo for a web-based data sharing app, so I can control permissions and dole out some ability for users to create their own reports without having them even needing to know that the SQL db exists.

Big win. Maybe AI-generated reports could increase this time savings if it were offered as a tool to data consumers? * Has anyone had experience using AI to *effectively* handle any of the reporting steps? * Report generation seems like one of those fiddly things where AI could be used - does it do better for cosmetic changes to reporting than it does for field mapping and/or generating calculated fields? * Any advice on how to incorporate AI so that it's actually time-saving and not a new headache?",31,0.89,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mp757f/has_anyone_actually_done_aigenerated_reporting/,2025-08-13 15:12:19,2025-08-15 01:46:34

This UI handles users upto 1000 (light weight operations), and it currently uses dynamoDb as its backend. We are planning to move to Azure in future, so wondering which back end database would be a good choice. Our top options are Postgres and mongoDb. Postgres is less expensive, and offers good features of a traditional transactional database.However, dynamoDb to Postgres migration would require a lot of functional changes as we move from a Nosql to an RDS. Could someone please weigh in like pros and cons of these two?Another unusual idea floated was - using data bricks as the backend for the UI.

It's built in Rust using Apache Arrow and DataFusion, so it's pretty fast for large datasets.Some of the things it can do (there are currently more than 30 commands):* Basic data inspection (head, tail, schema, metadata, stats)* Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, sampling, deduplication)* Quality checks (outlier detection, search across columns, frequency analysis)* File operations (merging, splitting, format conversion, optimization)* Analysis tools (correlations, binning, pivot tables)The project has grown to include quite a few subcommands over time, but honestly, I'm starting to run out of fresh ideas for new features. Development has slowed down recently because I've covered most of the use cases I personally encounter.If you work with Parquet files regularly, I'd really appreciate hearing about pain points you have with existing tools, workflows that could be streamlined and features that would actually be useful in your day-to-day workThe tool is open source and available through simple command `cargo install nail-parquet`. I know there are already great tools out there like DuckDB CLI and others, but this aims to be more specialized for Parquet workflows with a focus on being fast and having sensible defaults.No pressure at all, but if anyone has ideas for improvements or finds it useful, I'd love to hear about it.

However it seems that this would cause a lot of pickle serialization to/from multiprocessing which doesn't seem the best idea.Besides that I thought of the following: * multiprocessing shared memory - if I read/write from/to shared memory in my asyncio workers it seems like it would be a blocking operation and I would stop downloading/uploading just to push the data to/from multiprocessing. That doesn't seem like a good idea.* writing to/from disk (maybe use mmap?) - that would be 4 operations to/from the disk (2 writes and 2 reads each), isn't there a better/faster way?* use only multiprocessing - not using asyncio could work but that would also mean that I would ""waste time"" not downloading/uploading the data while I do the processing although I could run another async loop in each individual process that does the up- and downloading but I wanted to ask here before going down that rabbit hole :))* use multithreading instead? - this can work but I'm afraid that the decompression + compression will be much slower because it will only run on one core. Even if the GIL is released for the compression stuff and downloads/uploads can run concurrently it seems like it would slower overall.I'm also open to picking something else than Python if another language has better tooling for this usecase, however since this is a general high IO + high CPU usage workload that requires sharing memory between processes I can imagine it's not the easiest on any runtime.",10,0.83,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1monh1w/whats_the_best_way_to_process_data_in_a_python/,2025-08-12 22:43:56,2025-08-15 01:46:34

1mogizo,Data warehouse for a small company,rod_motier,dataengineering,"Hello.I work as a PM in a small company and recently the management asked me for a set of BI dashboards to help them make informed decisions. We use Google Workspace so I think the best option is using Looker Studio for data visualization. Right now we have some simple reports to allow the operations team to download real-time information from our database (AWS RDS) since they lack SQL or programming skills. The thing is these reports are connected directly to our database so the data transformation occurs directly in Looker Studio, sometimes using complex queries affects the performance causing some reports to load quite slowly.So I've been thinking maybe it's the right time for setting up a Data Warehouse. But I'm not sure if it's a good idea since our database is small (our main table storages transactions and is roughly 50.000 rows and 30 MiB). It'll obviously grow, but I wouldn't expect it to grow exponentially.Since I want to use Looker Studio, I was thinking on setting up a pipeline that replicates the database in real time using AWS DMS or something, transfer the data to Google BigQuery for transformation (I don't know what the best tool would be for this) and then use Looker Studio for visualization. Do you think this is a good idea, or would it be better to set up the data warehouse entirely in AWS and then use a Looker Studio connector to create the dashboards?What do you think?",7,0.75,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mogizo/data_warehouse_for_a_small_company/,2025-08-12 18:20:33,2025-08-15 01:46:34

Healthcare company, I know this automatically carries a premium.2. Just one source system, around 20 instances, 1 for each location. Standard enterprise healthcare software that many businesses use.3. Refresh once a day.4. Around 60GB of data, so not much, as far as my understanding goes.We want to unify this data to have a view of all the company. Right now we have a bunch of people working with Excel and it has become extremely burdensome and time consuming. What a surprise!On top of the data warehouse, we'd also like reporting, so that we can extend it in the future when we get someone that knows the reporting tool. We have no one in IT right now.Now, these are some of the offers we got and found.1. 20k and around 3 weeks: install application on each server that dumps source databases at night to a Linux VM that we purchase in our Microsoft environment, where they get processed in Postgres. Reporting they would use Power BI. Costs would be the 20k, plus VM and licenses costs on our side, nothing else unless we want their support. This sounds incredibly cheap and fast. I'm sure there are more details that I don't understand.2. ~50k and 1 month + 2k monthly: they would set us up in Snowflake and use some cloud reporting tool that I don't remember the name of.3. ~80k and around 1 month + some ongoing maintainance: similar to above, Snowflake and something else.4. ~120k and 3 weeks + 5k monthly: some pre-made application that they already implement multiple times on the same system.5. ~200k and around 3 months + maintainance: well, similar as above, Snowflake and something else.6. ~300k and anything between 3-6 months: one time payment, ""custom solution"" whatever that means, they take care of everything and give us support for 5 (yes, five) years.How am I supposed to pick between any of them. If I researched more I'm sure I would find pretty much everything in between all these... a guy I know currently hired some consultancy for 500k for some job, more complex I'm sure but still...

1mlhk5h,Java Spark Questions,Inner_Butterfly1991,dataengineering,"Hey, I used to work at a Scala Spark shop, and we cared a lot about code optimization, we avoided writing UDFs, ensured the vast majority of operations were using the Dataframe API when possible, and although sometimes we had to leverage UDFs that was the exception. We ran all our jobs in batch and were able to run ETL jobs where data was in the 100s of GBs in 10-15 minutes. I recently got a new job at a Java Spark shop, and we use the spark streaming API. Our code starts with a foreach, and all of our code base is assuming we're operating on a single row. But then I took a java spark udemy course and it seems like it's teaching the very thing we're doing in java. But we end up streaming \~20gb of data and our jobs take hours. Now I know we don't even really need to use spark with data that size, but given we have a spark code base, I guess I just have a few questions:1. Is it normal in java spark to use foreach and treat each row differently, and does the java spark engine recognize common transformations written in foreach and leverage it to create a plan that operates on the larger dataframe in a performant fashion? Is the scala logic of ensuring we focus on Dataframe operations rather than row-level UDFs the same in Java? 2. Is java spark, if written well, less performant than Scala Spark? 3. Is it possible that the streaming part could make Spark less performant when looking at \~20gb of data?

1mnoy85,"Help engineering an optimized solution with limited resources as an entry level ""DE""",echanuda,dataengineering,"I started my job as a ""data engineer"" almost a year ago. The company I work for is pretty weird, and I'd bet most of the work I do is not quite relevant to your typical data engineer. The layman's way of describing it would be a data wrangler. I essentially capture data from certain sources that are loosely affiliated with us and organize them through pipelines to transform them into useful stuff for our own warehouses. But the tools we use aren't really the industry standard, I think?I mostly work with Python + Polars and whatever else might fit the bill. I don't really work with spark, no cloud whatsoever, and I hardly even touch SQL (though I know my way around it). I don't work on a proper ""team"" either. I mostly get handed projects and complete it on my own time. Our team works on two dedicated machines of our choice. They're mostly identical, except one physically hosts a drive that is used as an NFS drive for the other (so I usually stick to the former for lower latency). They're quite beefy, with 350G of memory each, and 40 processors each to work with (albeit lower clock speeds on them).I'm not really sure what counts as ""big data,"" but I certainly work with very large datasets. Recently I've had to work with a particularly large dataset that is 1.9BB rows. It's essentially a very large graph network, with 2/2 columns being nodes, and the row representing an outgoing edge from column\_1 to column\_2. I'm tasked with taking this data, identifying which nodes belong to our own data, and enhancing the graph with incoming connections as well. e.g., a few connections might be represented likeA->BA->CC->Bwhich can extrapolate to incoming connections like soB<-AB<-CA<-CWell, this is really difficult to do, despite the theoretical simplicity. It would be one thing if I just had to do this once, but the dataset is being updated daily with hundreds of thousands of records. These might be inserts, upserts, or removals. I also need to produce a ""diff"" of what was changed after an update, which is a file containing any of the records that were changed/inserted.My solution so far is to maintain two branches of hive-partitioned directories - one for outgoing edges, the other for incoming edges. The data is partitioned on a prefix of the root node, which ends up making it workable within memory (though I'm sure the partition sizes are skewed for some chunks, the majority fall under 250K in size). Updates are partitioned on the fly in memory, and joined to the main branches respectively. A diff dataframe is maintained during each branch's update, which collects all of the changed/inserted records. This entire process takes anywhere from 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on the update size. And for some reason, the reverse edge updates take 10 times as long or longer (even though the reverse edge list is already materialized and re-used for each partition merge). As if it weren't difficult enough, a change is also reflected whenever a new record is deemed to ""touch"" one of our own. This requires integrating our own data as an update across both branches, which simply determines if a node has one of our IDs added. This usually adds a good 20 minutes, with a grand total maximum runtime of 1.3 hours.My team does not work in a conventional sense, so I can't really look to them for help in this matter. That would be a whole other topic to delve into, so I won't get into it here. Basically I am looking here for potential solutions. The one I have is rather convoluted (even though I summarized it quite a bit), but that's because I've tried a ton of simpler solutions before landing on this. I would love some tutelage from actual DE's around here if possible. Note that cloud compute is not an option, and the tools I'm allowed to work with can be quite restricted. But please, I would love any tips for working on this.

1movdoq,Sensitive schema suggestions,domestic_protobuf,dataengineering,"Dealing with sensitive data is pretty straightforward, but dealing with sensitive schemas is a new problem for me and my team. Data infrastructure is all AWS based using DBT on top of Athena. We have use cases where the schema of our tables are restricted due to the name and description of the columns giving too much information.The only solution I could come up with was leveraging AWS secrets and aliasing the columns at runtime. In this case, an approved developer would have to flatten out the source data and map the keys/column to the secret. For example, if colA is sensitive then we create a secret “colA” with value “fooA”. This seems like a huge pain to maintain because we would have to restrict secrets to specific AWS accounts.Suggestions are highly welcomed.",4,0.84,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1movdoq/sensitive_schema_suggestions/,2025-08-13 04:57:08,2025-08-15 01:46:34

1mo14fm,Batch processing 2 source tables row-by-row Insert/Updates,_GoldenDoorknob_,dataengineering,"Hi guys,I am looking for some advice on merging 2 source tables , to update a destination table (which is a combination of both table). Currently I am doing select queries on both tables ( I have a boolean which showcases if the record has been replicated (for both table). To fetch the record, then I see if the record based on a UID column exists in the destination table. If not, i insert (currently the one table can insert before the other, which leads to the other source table to do a update on the UID). So, when the records (UID) exists, i need to update certain columns in the destination table. Currently I am looping (python) through the columns of that record and doing a update (on the specific column). The table has 150+ columns, the process is being triggerd by Eventbridge (for both source tables), and the proicessing is being done in AWS Lambda. THe source tables are both PostgresSQL (in our AWS enviroment) and the destination table is also PostgresSQL on the same Database, just a different schema. THe problem is, this is a heavy Load processing for Lambda. I currently batch the pricessing for 100 record (from each source table). SOmetimes there can be over 20 000 records to summarise.

1mng31f,Stay at contract job or join Mentor’s company,PM_ME_MEMES_PLZ,dataengineering,"This is a very specific question and the answer might be obvious but looking for opinions that aren’t my parents or friends. All numbers in usdI’m currently in a good stable holding pattern for my work but it’s basically just money with not a ton of growth. I’m currently at a large f500 firm as a contractor making ~85/hour doing a regular 9-5. I’m also doing what is equivalent to 20 hours a week at 150/hour for my mentors new consulting startup, the work is all deliverable based so I’m doing it all before and after the contract job to keep things ethical.My work life balance is ok but not awesome, I have time on weekends to go on trips but my weeks are pretty packed and the contract role wants me to be going into the office minimum twice a week which is fine but a little exhausting.My mentor approached me and has another gig that would pay 40 hours a week through this new consulting startup and he’s asking me to come on full time at this startup, still do the 20 hours I’m currently doing and then do these 40 hours at roughly 100/hour. The gig is for three months but there would likely be more work after the three months but obviously there’s zero guarantee.Contractor role doesn’t really have healthcare and no pto so it would be a raise per hour and since the work is deliverable based rather than a corporate 9-5 I’ll have more flexibility to take time off as long as my work is keeping up.I think this current contract gig is probably pretty stable, there was a round of layoffs recently but I’m on a pretty critical tech project so I could probably just coast here if I wanted to but it’s been made reasonably clear that fte conversions are gonna be on hold since the purse strings are held pretty close. It’s essentially a money printing machine as long as things go well enough.I’m 25, no kids so my gf, parents and friends are all telling me to full send it since on paper it’s more money, way better leadership and if it takes off I’m lining myself up to be the most senior consultant on the team but just looking for more opinions.",2,0.59,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mng31f/stay_at_contract_job_or_join_mentors_company/,2025-08-11 15:28:43,2025-08-15 01:46:34

1mox1cp,"Architectural Challenge: Robust Token & BBox Alignment between LiLT, OCR, and spaCy for PDF Layout Extraction",-XxFiraxX-,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I'm working on a complex document processing pipeline in Python to ingest and semantically structure content from PDFs. After a significant refactoring journey, I've landed on a ""Canonical Tokenization"" architecture that works, but I'm looking for ideas and critiques to refine the alignment and post-processing logic, which remains the biggest challenge.The Goal:To build a pipeline that can ingest a PDF and produce a list of text segments with accurate layout labels (e.g., title, paragraph, reference_item), enriched with linguistic data (POS, NER).The Current Architecture (""Canonical Tokenization""):To avoid the nightmare of aligning different tokenizer outputs from multiple tools, my pipeline follows a serial enrichment flow:Single Source of Truth Extraction: PyMuPDF extracts all words from a page with their bboxes. This data is immediately sent to a FastAPI microservice running a LiLT model (LiltForTokenClassification) to get a layout label for each word (Title, Text, Table, etc.). If LiLT is uncertain, it returns a fallback label like 'X'. The output of this stage is a list of CanonicalTokens (Pydantic objects), each containing {text, bbox, lilt_label, start_char, end_char}.NLP Enrichment: I then construct a spaCy Doc object from these CanonicalTokens using Doc(nlp.vocab, words=[...]). This avoids re-tokenization and guarantees a 1:1 alignment. I run the spaCy pipeline (without spacy-layout) to populate the CanonicalToken objects with .pos_tag, .is_entity, etc.Layout Fallback (The ""Cascade""): For CanonicalTokens that were marked with 'X' by LiLT, I use a series of custom heuristics (in a custom spaCy pipeline component called token_refiner) to try and assign a more intelligent label (e.g., if .isupper(), promote to title).Grouping: After all tokens have a label, a second custom spaCy component (layout_grouper) groups consecutive tokens with the same label into spaCy.tokens.Span objects.Post-processing: I pass this list of Spans through a post-processing module with business rules that attempts to:Merge multi-line titles (merge_multiline_titles).Reclassify and merge bibliographic references (reclassify_page_numbers_in_references).Correct obvious misclassifications (e.g., demoting single-letter titles).Final Segmentation: The final, cleaned Spans are passed to a SpacyTextChunker that splits them into TextSegments of an ideal size for persistence and RAG.The Current Challenge:The architecture works, but the ""weak link"" is still the Post-processing stage. The merging of titles and reclassification of references, which rely on heuristics of geometric proximity (bbox) and sequential context, still fail in complex cases. The output is good, but not yet fully coherent.My Questions for the Community:Alignment Strategies: Has anyone implemented a similar ""Canonical Tokenization"" architecture? Are there alignment strategies between different sources (e.g., a span from spaCy-layout and tokens from LiLT/Doctr) that are more robust than simple bbox containment?Rule Engines for Post-processing: Instead of a chain of Python functions in my postprocessing.py, has anyone used a more formal rule engine to define and apply document cleaning heuristics?Fine-tuning vs. Rules: I know that fine-tuning the LiLT model on my specific data is the ultimate goal. But in your experience, how far can one get with intelligent post-processing rules alone? Is there a point of diminishing returns where fine-tuning becomes the only viable option?Alternative Tools: Are there other libraries or approaches you would recommend for the layout grouping stage that might be more robust or configurable than the custom combination I'm using?I would be incredibly grateful for any insights, critiques, or suggestions you can offer. This is a fascinating and complex problem, and I'm eager to learn from the community's experience.Thank you",2,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mox1cp/architectural_challenge_robust_token_bbox/,2025-08-13 06:34:31,2025-08-15 01:46:34

1mlmi7k,"Been coding for 5ish years, talked to about a dozen beginners here - some real talk",SmopShark,learnprogramming,"# Been coding for 5ish years, talked to about a dozen beginners here - some real talkHi all,(Get my 5-Year Dev Career Roadmap: Month-by-month skill progression, Project ideas by experience level, When to apply for jobs (with confidence levels here → \[[Substack](http://typedweekly.com)\].)I've been chatting with a bunch of beginners from this sub over the past couple months (like 12 of you lol), and thought I'd dump some thoughts on what actually matters when ur starting out. Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.**Stop obsessing about languages**Everyone's like ""which language should I learn???"" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff.JS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.**What companies acutally look for**I've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough.Your starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch.One of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**One legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes.If you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af?As for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.**Find ppl who get it**You need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click.Stack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better!I was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.**Just. Pick. Something**""People keep saying mixed things about X"" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru.Every ""wrong"" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time.Also don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.**The secret sauce**Consistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways.I still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like ""damn I'm good at this"". It's normal.Hit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.Edit 1: Been getting a bunch of dмs with similar questions — I’ll write small posts on Medium / [Substack](http://typedweekly.com) so it’s easier to share in next days.",775,0.93,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mlmi7k/been_coding_for_5ish_years_talked_to_about_a/,2025-08-09 10:49:13,2025-08-15 01:46:36

1mm9of2,The approach that finally made data structures click after months of struggling,CreditOk5063,learnprogramming,"I spent a solid several months grinding LeetCode. Hundreds of problems. I memorized all the common patterns, read every top-voted solution... but still couldn’t solve new problems without getting stuck.It finally clicked that I wasn’t actually *understanding* anything, I was just getting really good at pattern matching.I realized since I started drawing every data structure out by hand—arrays, trees, linked lists, everything. Visualizing how they behave in memory made stuff like recursion and pointers suddenly make sense. I also began explaining my solutions to myself, and every time I stumbled, it exposed what I didn’t really understand. However, if you wanna make great progress, you also need feedback to every explanation. I used Beyz for record and suggestions,but there are many similar software available on the market now. You can choose the one that is the most affordable. Later, I tried re-implementing basic structures in 3 different languages, Python, JavaScript, and Java, just to separate concept from syntax. It helped a ton.Now, I spend more time on *why* a solution works than memorizing *what* the solution is. It feels slower, but it’s way more durable.Anyone else go through this shift?

1mlnc7i,Why most programming beginners struggle: evaluation,wordbit12,learnprogramming,"I'm a CS student who's really into metacognition and how people learn programming. I get to see lots of students at university and talk with them about their code (sometimes JavaScript), and I've noticed something that I think is a huge problem.The fundamental concept that causes the most trouble for beginners is that **they don't understand evaluation** \- what it actually means to evaluate an expression until it becomes a value.People always say universities are rigorous and full of definitions, but they (or at least my university) seem to completely fail at teaching the definitions that actually matter. I can't count how many friends have told me that programming suddenly ""clicked"" once they understood these basic definitions:* **Value**: an expression that evaluates to itself* **Evaluation**: transforming an expression, step by step, into a valueOnce you get this, everything else builds naturally. Assignment makes sense because it's basically a function that takes two arguments: a name and a value. If there's an expression on the right side, you have to evaluate it first, step by step. Functions only accept values, so arguments have to be evaluated first - boom, functional composition becomes way easier to understand. and same for functions calls, because the student start seeing the call as an operator that takes a function on its left, not just syntax to memorize.Later when you study first-class functions, a statement like ""functions are values"" actually makes sense. Students start asking the right questions: ""But what kind of value? How does it look?"" And that naturally leads to closures and understanding that the value contains a reference to the environment where the function was defined.Here's the thing - I truly believe understanding these basic concepts early helps students ask the right questions. When they face something unexpected with a new expression, the first thing they think is ""How does this evaluate? There must be some evaluation rules.""I think all CS 101 classes should start with (or at least teach at some points) these fundamentals: evaluation, values, the difference between statements and expressions, etc. Instead we get thrown into syntax and algorithms without understanding what's actually happening under the hood.

I understand even Doctorate level people are looking for work unsuccessfully.2. I understand the journey never really ends, and the number of things you could learn is near infinite. That's what draws me to this field in the first place.With those understood I'm curious how much is enough for Junior Developers? I recently got to the last 4 interviewees for an entry level job and I was rejected for being weaker than the others on the technical side. So I know this isn't a normal time in software, I just want to know how far off I am.* I can build a REST API CRUD app in Javascript & Python.* I know the basics of environment management and I can set up Node, Express, Django, etc. in both languages.* I'm a little more proficient in Javascript understanding some of those runtimes and frameworks at a deeper level including styling with Tailwind & Bootstrap as well as using Node & AJAX to set up Asynchronous data management to recieve input from the user then display the JSON/XML.* I'm familiar with basics setting up logic in the REST API Routes such as using findOne to search by UUID so that you can set up a view page for each entry in your API.* I'm already using error handling with try/catch methods to look for errors and send to an error page.* I can use React to set up a vite project and use it to manage state dynamically.* I can deploy the app via my AWS EC2.* I'm proficient with Git & Version control with a couple dozen repositories and over 400 commits.I plan on doing some Unit Testing and getting more practice with my debugger next, but I'm feeling rejected after getting so close and hearing ""Not enough""Edit: Since a couple people asked about education.I do have a college degree in Business Administration, and I did a 12 week 60+ hour weeks intensive co-op on the basics of web development. Do you think that would be sufficient? Or should I plan on getting a second major in my future.I grew up in a very poor area, and neither my high school or early college had a CS program.

By this I mean code simple stuff that I, myself has built from scratch but when it comes to working in a large group and have to tap into other people’s mind and their code, all of a sudden I feel like a black sheep.For example when I was tasked with creating a simple web app to serve some users it was pretty easy at the start since there was a lot of documentation about the language and the framework so I just googled the questions that I have and 9 out of 10 times it would come up for me and I just Copied it and changed some of the lines but I feel like I still didn’t learn as much.

1mlmu16,Is Codefinity worth It? Here’s what I learned after finishing the course,FrozenFan123,learnprogramming,"I recently finished the Codefinity course after wrapping up CS50, and I wanted to share my honest experience for anyone wondering if it’s worth the investment.Before Codefinity, I had a decent grasp of Python basics from CS50, but I struggled with building real projects on my own. Codefinity’s step-by-step lessons were great for breaking down concepts into manageable chunks, and I found the small projects really helpful for practicing what I learned.That said, it’s not perfect some parts felt slow, and if you’re already confident with basics, you might find it a bit repetitive. Still, it gave me the structure and confidence to move from “I know Python syntax” to actually building things I can show.For those interested, my goal is to eventually work in robotics, and I’ve been using a Raspberry Pi alongside the course to try out small hardware projects. The combination has been helpful to connect coding with real-world applications.I’d love to hear from others who’ve tried Codefinity did it help you move forward?

I have already completed my diploma back in 2020, and gotten mostly through my BSc, and finished more than 90% of the program.

Because of this, I have to work on projects that would resolve this issue. I was advised to volunteer for organizations that would need computer science skills.

(for example, Winston Churchill used english in a different way than JK Rowling).A programming example is Larry Page. At least, according to Paul Graham, ""The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search.""My question is: how much did you know when you built your domain knowledge? ie. what was the process like when you transitioned from ""learning programming"" --> ""solving problems""?For example, my car could break down and I would know it can be solved, but don't know how. Whereas my friend would be able to solve it because he's watched videos to mod his own car -- I suppose the answer is learn whatever you need to solve the problem.Well, in that case, how do I build an operating system?

I’ve always been curious about low-latency systems, multithreaded programming, and how real-time trading platforms manage high-throughput workloads efficiently.To explore these topics hands-on, I built a mini trading engine in C++. It’s a simple simulation right now — it includes:* An order book with support for basic market and limit orders.* Matching logic for buy/sell orders.* A basic mean-reversion strategy (just for testing).* Multithreaded architecture: one thread ingests mock market data, another executes strategy logic.* Data structures optimized for quick access and low overhead.* Performance benchmark scores and graphs to showcase real performance.* Basic tests to make sure every build runs smoothly.It’s very much a work in progress and far from perfect, but building it has taught me a ton already about threading and performance bottlenecks in real-time systems.I don't have any idea how C++ code is written in a professional environment so I’d really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or ideas for what I could improve.

1mlyrcl,"The Recursive Leap of Faith, Explained",AlSweigart,learnprogramming,"https://inventwithpython.com/blog/leap-of-faith.htmlI've written a short tutorial about what exactly the vague ""leap of faith"" technique for writing recursive functions means, with factorial and permutation examples. The code is written in Python.TL;DR:1. Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.2. Next, implement the base case.3. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.4. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.5. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.I also go into why so many other tutorials fail to explain what ""leap of faith"" actually is and the unstated assumptions they make. There's also the explanation for the concept that ChatGPT gives, and how it matches the deficiencies of other recursion tutorials.I also have this absolutely demented (but technically correct!) implementation of recursive factorial: def factorial(number): if number < 0: raise Exception('number must be a positive integer') if number % 1 != 0: raise Exception('number must be an integer') if number == 100: # BASE CASE return 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000 elif number < 100: # RECURSIVE CASE return factorial(number + 1) // (number + 1) else: # ANOTHER RECURSIVE CASE return number * factorial(number - 1)",7,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mlyrcl/the_recursive_leap_of_faith_explained/,2025-08-09 20:01:11,2025-08-15 01:46:36

I’m starting to think maybe I had it all backwards and should’ve committed to a single stack rather than a full stack. I tried surfing subreddits for similar experiences but always came across mixed opinions. Overall, I like backend and I’m willing to learn it with Python or Java (my cs classes will be taught in either of these), JavaScript is cool but I don’t think it’s healthy to learn with a tool I’m not passionate in using.

1mouh4h,Speculation on why AI is sold as being able to replace specifically software engineers.,United_Papaya9920,cscareerquestions,"Working with LLMs I noticed at least four important shortcomings that make them unsuitable to really replace software engineers.1. Non-deterministic, software engineers like other engineers usually chose this career path because they are able to thinker with things and expect a specific response, it doesn't take much tinkering to start to dislike the LLMs prompts.2. Highly inconsistent code, often code produced with LLM happens to lack [consistency](https://medium.com/@jonfinerty/consistency-in-software-42626ac4219f) from line to line.3. Lack of precision of the generated code. Code is highly imprecise compared with a mediocre coder, and even a beginner coder, at this section is the fact that most of the time there is superfluous code. Also generated code cannot be made more precise by a human, because usually best code come in the engineers mind through ideation and abstraction among others things LLM are incapable of doing. This precision thing is also one reason a specific kind of people are attracted to software engineering.4. Speed, coding speed is not improved by LLMs if you count for quality, debugging and code-coverage, actually if you account for fixing the other 3 shortcoming enumerated before it is much, much slower needing more developers to fix these shortcoming introduced by the LLMs.Another shortcoming I wanted to add is the total lack of congruence but that can be derived from the lack of consistency, also this term is not well defined and used in software engineering. Given at least these four shortcomings you would think that LLMs are not fit to replace software engineers, at least at this stage, you would think that they could try first replacing customer support or marketing or other sections from the corporate structure. Not that I think it can replace these people either, but I mean for the sake of the argument that shows software engineers are specifically selected from a bunch of people.I think is a selling point, software engineers are the most expensive people that don't belong to the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)crowd or their flunkies. And a lot of the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)is heavily invested in this AI thing on a metaphysical level.I think the AI bubble is about to pop and the Tech bros are selling replacing software engineers to the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)bunch as a last resort since it wasn't able to make any profit and also lately not making any visible progress, Thus [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)was sold on the idea hopes to obtain two things:\- a lot of profit from replacing most of software engineers;\- drag the price down for the remaining software engineers the way customer service robots did for entry customer service people.But both of these are not reachable.I think this move is the most dangerous move for our guild and our careers: \- Layoffs are already happening;\- Hiring market is in disarray;\- And massive amounts of capital from software industry is already gone and going on a ruse;My two cents.",656,0.93,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mouh4h/speculation_on_why_ai_is_sold_as_being_able_to/,2025-08-13 04:07:11,2025-08-15 01:46:37

1mm4jbh,How to Incentivize hiring americans to stop outsourcing,therealsparticus,cscareerquestions,"We need a tax policy that favors hiring in America. Raise the corporate tax rate and then give tax rebates to companies for every dollar they spend hiring in the US. This will help every industry that's facing outsourcing - tech, accounting, project management, all the jobs that people want!Edits:1. We are not taxing outsourcing itself as that's hard to implement. We are raising the whole corporate tax rate and then giving tax rebates to companies that show a large American payroll. This puts the burden of proof on the company to show they are hiring Americans. Harder to loophole this.2. This is more like EV/Clean Energy incentives rather than tariffs. It's a transfer payment from American companies that outsource to American companies that hire Americans.3. This is not targetting H-1Bs/immigrants. H-1Bs are separate but atleast they recycle money back into the American economy. I get it that PhDs and top talent should come to the US, I am not targetting H-1Bs but rather targetting outsourcing.4. Rich tech companies that earn more money will get hit harder by corporate tax rate and thus need a larger American payroll to get credits. How much Americans a company needs to hire is proportional to the amount of money they make.5. We are hiring the best. We want to make an 150k American salary = 40k Overseas Salary + 110k in missed rebates. Now that both hiring and Americans and overseas cost 150k, please hire the best.6. No extra tax cost to give rebates. The funds come from higher corporate tax rate. It will be a transfer payment from outsourcing companies to ones that are hiring American.7.

It's a possibility my prompt engineering skills were not good enough, but I think that if chatgpt/grok, are going to be blindly followed (and I know this is going to happen) there could be disastrous consequences. What I'm trying to say is that Grok is not at the point where it should be trusted for relatively simple calculus problems. In one place Grok mentioned that my reasoning was fallacious do to circular reasoning, but apparently circular reasoning not as it's commonly understood in any logic textbook, (and therefore, not actually fallacious for the same reason). So if I can't even trust Grok to use language to convey a correct meaning, now I'm hit with a conundrum if I should even waste my time using grok to help with learning (like the time I wasted writing this post)Is there like some sort of secret AI that companies are using that are that much better than chatgpt/grok that justifies them firing people and making our economy hell (besides h1b and outsourcing mainly to india of course)?

1mly7bn,Post Layoff Job Search Sucks,cybergypsy26,cscareerquestions,"My company had mass layoffs back in April 2024, which I was affected by. I had been at the company for a little over 2 years at that point and had purchased a house in October of the year before. The first few months, I wasn’t that worried, I had rented out the house and was also doing Airbnb to keep the mortgage payments covered. I was interviewing and hearing back, getting ghosted, getting reached out to by recruiters. My former company had a career counselor program for everyone who was laid off, but obviously it yielded no success. Winter came, airbnb bookings were low and I really started to feel the pressure. April came around again and I started to just feel like a straight up failure.Anytime people would talk about CS (I did computer engineering tho not that it really matters) being a dying field now or just about how horrible the job market was, I just didn’t think much of it because I figured there would always be something.I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I was in a forbearance period for my mortgage but the forbearance period is over and I’ve missed 2 payments. I got a notification in the mail from my mortgage company with a pamphlet about “Tips to avoid foreclosure”. It feels like there’s a noose around my neck. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic. I don’t want to ask my parents (who I live with) for money because it seems like money is tight right now, but I know they would find the money if I did ask. I just feel so hopeless, it’s like nothing is working. I have no money. I don’t even respond to my friends anymore because I’m tired of telling them that I have no money. I’m in credit card debt too from the money I spent to furnish my airbnb. It’s like no one around me can even comprehend how much money occupies my mind. I’ve been going outside in nature a lot more recently and in those moments it feels like everything will be okay but then I get home and I remember.Honestly I’m kind of tired of typing so I’m gonna stop here, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit.",71,0.91,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mly7bn/post_layoff_job_search_sucks/,2025-08-09 19:37:45,2025-08-15 01:46:37

1mppry5,Am I a poor developer and this is a standard dev experience?,TangeloTraditional36,cscareerquestions,"I was laid off from a job relatively recently. It was my first job out of college and it was at a small company. I wasn't included in meetings that decided my work and I was handed tasks from the lead dev, usually in the form of a paragraph with a visual and that was about it. I'd be told ""lets see what you come up with"" and from there I'd have to do my own research and planning. The lead dev already had a full idea of what the project should be, its requirements, and specifications and I would be penalized if what I came up with didn't line up with what he had. I essentially worked in a bubble and only had interactions once in a while, essentially starting projects from scratch. When I asked questions, I'd basically be given a 20 question knowledge check and denied answers if I didn't think the same way a dev with 10 years of experience did. I basically hit a point where my default assumption is that I'm always wrong. I was basically laid off for not operating like a dev with 10 years of experience because the assumption management and the lead dev had was that 3 years should mean I'm, on par with the lead dev. I also had no mentorship while on the job after the first 2-3 weeks.I guess I went in with the preconceived notion from college that there would be more collaboration and discussion on tasks and have a clear image of how a project should work what it should do and why before even starting to code. The expectation my manager laid out in my last few months was ""You've been here for 3 years, you shouldn't need to work with anyone on projects, you should be able to take projects yourself and do them by yourself."" I was then put on a big project that involved reworking a ton of code to be sent externally and me asking for stand up meetings to make sure I'm in expectations was considered a negative point against me. Is this just a standard developer experience, full on trial by fire every day and if you aren't solving every issue, it means you've failed as a developer?

However, I always end up making mistakes that seem obvious, and that end up reducing all my work to a zero.Two instances come to mind, among many:1. I was tasked to create a bottom sheet using a Figma design as a reference. I got too caught up in the functionality, which I did implement correctly for the most part. But the bottom sheet was supposed to show over all the other components in the UI, which I forgot to do. My team lead reviewed the task and pointed it out to me.2. I created another bottom sheet that was supposed to have a certain appearance in both landscape and portrait mode. I was able to implement it correctly, and tested it in both orientations, as well as landscape -> portrait and portrait -> landscape (or so I thought). Later, it was discovered that despite my thorough testing, i missed the portrait->landscape scenario, leading to the UI looking bad. Once again, an obvious mistake that should have been avoided and pointed to me by my team lead.It is a problem because ""needs to get better at testing"" has appeared far too many times in my performance review which comes every 3 months and instances like these are cited to me far too often.We only get performance based increments, and because of this, I have never been able to get one, as I believe their perception of me is ""Makes too many obvious mistakes"".I have tried the advice of ""write down all test cases beforehand"", but as scenario 2 shows, even that doesn't stop me from making errors like those.I seem to have hit a wall, one that I can't get over.Has anyone ever faced a problem like this before?

The more intense, algorithm-heavy, grindy SWE work doesn’t excite me.What I am really good at is managing, organizing, and coordinating. I thrive when I’m planning, running projects, and keeping people on track.

1mphqlh,Sacrificing a promotion to move?,TheYanginyourYin,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,I’m a software engineer with 3YoE at a large financial institution. I’m in a tough spot right now because I’m in the running for a promotion to the next job grade but also have a lease starting in a new city with my girlfriend.The lease starts in 3 weeks, and I have an internal job offer in the new city for my current job grade. I’m feeling very indecisive though because I’ve had a strong year on my current team and was told many months ago that I had been nominated to be promoted at the end of this year.Part of me wants to wait and secure that because it would be another 1-2 years before that opportunity arises again. However, my girlfriend really wants me to move with her. I did try to suggest we wait but she’s very eager to go now, and have since signed for a place.I have a place in our current city so that’s not the issue, it’s mainly leaving a promotion for my relationship or staying and risk missing out on 5+ months in the new city with her.I know this is a bit between career/relationship advice but as someone relatively new to their career I’m very curious what others in the field think.EDIT: Thanks everyone for sharing your insights, I really do feel a lot more at peace now. Given that I don’t want to stay with this company much longer anyways, and the realization that having the promotion won’t necessarily give me that much more leverage for a new position, I’m going to take the new opportunity and move.

1mqgewe,"Joined ""big tech"" a few months ago and I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop",wont-share-food,cscareerquestions,"Before I joined my current role, I was making an average of 80k a year (in a very hcol area). I decided to apply to FAANG thinking that I probably won't get an interview anyways but I somehow got it and somehow passed it and now I'm making more money than I've ever dreamed of. I have 4 YoE at a startup where I wore many hats and learned an incredible amount of things but at the end of the day, it was still a very small startup serving a few hundred users. Everything I did could've been boiled down to simple CRUD work with some business logic sprinkled in, that you could learn from a Udemy course. So when I was joining, I was extremely scared and thought that I wouldn't be good enough because I felt like I was in the minor leagues and now I was coming up to the big leagues so of course the stakes are higher, pay is amazing, the work will be more intense, etc.However to be honest it feels like not much has changed. I know I'm only a few months in but I'm working on things ranging from minor tickets to full blown apps and it's still the same CRUD work I used to do. In fact here, so many things are abstracted away that I don't need to worry about a ton of things so it feels even easier. That comes with having to setup a ton of boilerplate to create a simple route, but seeing how other routes have it setup basically lets you know all you need to know.Obviously there's issues regarding scale as I never had to worry about it, but again it's as straightforward as saying I want this new data model to be shared by having a keyword and boom, everything is taken care of. It's honestly incredible. So all that to say, I've realized that I've never felt comfortable or ""safe"" yet, like I'm almost waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like is this it? Is it really this straightforward and I was worried for nothing?

This job had near impossible standards to meet, so I'd be fixing roughly 10-20 tickets a day every day working \~7am to \~5pm. I told him explicitly I can't work from 5PM - 7PM, but could work after that. Despite this, every single time the manager would have a meeting with me, he would ask these questions that seemed to imply I wasn't working. He would say things like ""where are you working from"", ""when did you start working today"", ""how many hours have you been working"", stuff like thatHe tried scheduling a meeting at 6pm my time. I told him, I could not make it to this time and he would have to schedule it at either 4pm or 7:30pm. He took a heavy amount of offense to this and started saying some cryptic stuff about how it's not acceptable that I ""disappear"" at that time. I didn't want to explain to him the reason (why's it his business?), but I had to have this time off to do physical therapy due to a busted hip, which will prep me for a surgery. I simply can't put this off, because it was causing a lot of painFinally, I think the ""breaking point"" was one day when I woke up at 6am and looked at my phone to see a bunch of notifications from around 2AM, one after the other, asking me if I was online. I messaged back (at now 6AM) and said I just woke up, was it something urgent? He said it wasn't, but I should have been awake. I was not on call. Anyway, I ended up getting fired and when I asked HR why, they said I ""disappeared"".

1mnmy0d,Help Me Pull Out Of My Career Nosedive,Patmurf,cscareerquestions,"First and foremost, thank you for even clicking on this. I'm going to lay out my career path, how I got here, and essentially ask for help on what I need to do to get out of this dead end in the next six to 12 months.Very long story short, one unexpected kid at 20 and I didn't get my college degree until 2019 at the age of 33. It was incredibly brutal to get there but I had a compsci degree from the University of Minnesota.Despite that, all of my efforts at job fairs were a bust. My best guess was my age was a factor, but I can't know. Regardless, the only job I could get my hands on at graduation was for a local embedded linux hardware company of \~400 employees for \~$70k. It was a bit of a tough pill to swallow given all of the guys I studied with (and often performed better than) landed at either Amazon or Target for significantly more money.I got some moderate Yocto experience and enough C++ to know I'd rather write in straight C than untangle legacy bowls of spaghetti. Covid hit almost immediately after I was hired and my subpar wage dipped into straight up rough territory within a year. When they called me back into the office I said no and flailed to look for a new job.That too was utterly brutal. I only really had \~1.5yrs of Yocto/embedded experience and was still very green. The only job I could find was a remote gig in another embedded device company in Fargo. The pay was $100k. It wasn't great, but it was a raise, and they promised me I would continue my embedded Yocto experience. This struck me as a deal as I could continue to transport my kids to school and work on the same skillset. Id eventually be a marketable embedded developer in +/- 3 years I felt.It was also a lie. I never, ever touched anything embedded, leaving all of my experience at my first job to largely rot before I could get it to the magic ""5 years"" point. Instead it was secretly full Reactjs/Swift/XCode/C# userspace server code. I now have \~3.5 years of that when my company was bought and I was thrown out of that team into a.... yocto embedded team. I now have 6 more months of experience there. Most of that time was spent remembering things I had completely forgotten.I have been looking for a job to get off this roller coaster since early 2023. I barely even get callbacks. I've gotten two interviews. One was a dud, the other was a trap that offered me $80k without asking me a single tech question. I know this Reddit is aware of the pitfalls and stressors of looking for a job in this field right now so there is no reason to go further.My work history is essentially in shambles and looks horrible on paper from all this thrashing. Both companies do not have names that make my resume stand out in any meaningful way. I realize (or presume) that the only way out for me is to work all day, then code all night and create a portfolio in a space that mildly interests me.I have been working in Rust, which I thoroughly enjoy, and have been messing around in Ratatui crate, which I also enjoy, but work is slow between two high school kids I teach how to drive simultaneously, being the one breadwinner, the one adult that drives, and the one person who does household shopping and cooking. I am too stretched thin to not be attacking this with maximum efficiency.I need to stop wandering in the dark and find the straightest line possible to get me out of my stagnant job/wage. I came to this whole industry late and dont have either the best discipline or sense on how one furthers their career as quickly as possible and becomes marketable in the most effective way, and I'm up to my eyeballs in all the extraneous ""life"" stuff that is non-negotiable. I basically need a road map.Thank you for spending any amount of time on that. I am 100% serious and have the work ethic, I just don't have the direction.

One is an internship, which is still okay in my book as they stated there is a possibility for conversion. However, the other is a full-time role, but seems to be giving off a bad feeling.The full-time startup is a company that has been around for 5 years but has not seemed to produce anything of value. They have an app with no users and that is actually outdated on the current Android version.

1mpvbzw,Struggling with my first job right out of college,kelporice,cscareerquestions,"I am ~8 months into my first job after graduation as a software developer but I feel that I am coping really poorly.My team is relatively small, 4 people: me (junior), 2 senior developers and my manager. My manager isn't someone who is a technical coder so that only leaves 2 people in my team I can seek insights from regarding the code. Which is kind of difficult as they are really busy and with the more individualistic culture here, it is harder for me to gel into the team dynamics as a newbie. In terms of tech, we utilize AWS cloud for development. The team doesn't do much active development for now and the foreseeable future, so my task is really more towards writing request reports, L3 support, liaising with other departments regarding networking/infrastructure issues and very rarely scripts/code changes.A few months into the role I had a chat with my manager to get a better clarity on my job scope and there was a misalignment as my manager was looking for a L3 support head count but I interviewed for a software developer with the hiring manager and this isn't what I was expecting...The current issue I face is that I rarely touch and interact with the code base as my other task takes a bulk of my time. When I was new one of the senior dev did a quick run through of the code base ~1h and I was struggling to note down everything he said and that was it for the knowledge transfer... And I did not get better as the next few tasks I was assigned was not code base related.I probably work on the code base 4~6 times thus far and it was a huge struggle as every time I do interact with it, it feels like my first time. There isn't really useful documentation and to me the code doesn't seem to show strong links between how the application flows from the lambda.I did an internship before where the team was relatively huge as it was agile so getting help and information from different members was a lot easier and they were a lot more open to guiding about the code base. I felt more confident in my abilities as an intern than I do now :(Is this type of environment normal in y'all experience? Am I too needy or require too much hand holding? Being so long into the job, I am still struggling to do anything on my own and I still require guidance from others.I would love to have some constructive insights from fellow developers, particularly developers with more experience as I really do want to try to make the best out of this opportunity that I have while I seek other opportunities as this isn't what I expected to do coming in as a software developer...",8,0.84,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mpvbzw/struggling_with_my_first_job_right_out_of_college/,2025-08-14 09:02:15,2025-08-15 01:46:37
1ml5biy,I did not get any return offers today (last day of my internship),LongjumpingPage6168,cscareerquestions,"I am an IT Analyst Intern at a multi-industry corporation (let's call this company ""T""). My manager just called me this morning. We talked about my experience, my projects that I have been working in,... as well as his feedback for my performance. He said I am a great team member and I have the qualities and passions of becoming a software developer, and then he told me that no offers are extended at this time. One of my friend immediately got his return offer and some high school interns are invited to continue their internships at T the upcoming summers (even a high school intern I am working with got hired to work full-time that he did not even have to attend university).Several of my friends also did not get anything too. It's strange. Even though I expected at some point that I might not get any return offer but I don't know why am I still disappointed and depressed right now. I keep telling myself that it is OK, I can try again next time but I am not OK. I feel like all of my hard work and contribution go to waste now. Since the beginning of my internship, I have done my best at every work, be nice, and network with as many people as possible. I have always shown my passion and initiative, done every project the best I could, and even asked for more work a lot of time (I did not get much work). I even won competitions/hackathons (1st place) for this company. I kept thinking what did I do wrong or what did I miss, and what do others have to get hired but I don't. So many things are going on in my mind right now. I feel absolutely embarrassed when facing my friend or anyone who gets hired. I feel like a failure. I am even scared to talk to my family about this. They have sacrificed and expected so much for me.I have put in a lot of my blood, sweat, and tears for the past three years for this first internship, and always aim for return offers so my career is secure and stable. I will graduate in May 2026 and I don't want any days or weeks or months of being unemployed.
