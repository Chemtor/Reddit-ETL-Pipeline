1mw70hb,My friend just inherited a data infrastructure built by a guy who left 3 months ago… and it’s pure chaos,UnusualRuin7916,dataengineering,"So this xyz company had a guy who built the entire data infrastructure on his own but with zero documentation, no version control, and he named tables like temp_2020, final_v3, and new_final_latest.Pipelines? All manually scheduled cron jobs spread across 3 different servers. Some scripts run in Python 2, some in Bash, some in SQL procedures. Nobody knows why.He eventually left the company… and now they hired my friend to take over.On his first week:He found a random ETL job that pulls data from an API… but the API was deprecated 3 years ago and somehow the job still runs.Half the queries are 300+ lines of nested joins, with zero comments.Data quality checks? Non-existent. The check is basically “if it fails, restart it and pray.”Every time he fixes one DAG, two more fail somewhere else.Now he spends his days staring at broken pipelines, trying to reverse-engineer this black box of a system.

Here are my stats:Total Applications : 100+Rejection : 70+Recruiter Call : 15+Offer : 1I would have managed to get fee more offers but I wasn’t motivated enough and I was happy with the offer from the company.Here are my takes:1) ChatGpt : Asked GPT to write a CV summary based on job description 2) Job Analytics Chrome Extension: Used to include keywords in the CV and make them white text at the bottom.3) Keep applying until you get an offer not until you had a good inter view.4) If you did well in the inter view, you will hear back within 3-4 days. Otherwise, companies are just benching you or don’t care. I used to chase on 4th day for a response, if I don’t hear back, I never chased.5) Speed : Apply to jobs posted within a week and move faster in the process. Candidates who move fast have high chances to get job. Remember, if someone takes inter view before you and are a good fit, they will get the job doesn’t matter how good you are . 6) Just learn new tools and did some projects, and you are good to go with that technology.Best of Luck to Everyone!!!!",319,0.95,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mupgrv/finally_got_a_job_offer/,2025-08-19 17:44:14,2025-08-23 01:27:46

1ms2j53,Data Engineer/ Architect --> Data Strategist --> Director of Data,Smooth-Leadership-35,dataengineering,"I'm hoping some experienced folks can give some insight. I am a data engineer and architect who worked his way up from analytics engineer. I've built end-to-end pipelines that served data scientists, visualizations, applications, or other groups data platforms numerous times. I can do everything from the DataOps / MLOps to the actual analytics if needed (I have an academic ML background). I can also troubleshoot pipelines that see large volumes of users on the application end and my last technical role was as an architect/ reliability engineer consulting across many different sized companies.I've finally secured a more leadership-type position as the principal data strategist (I have no interest in being middle management leading technical groups). The issue is the company is in the construction sector and largely only uses Microsoft365. There is some Azure usage that is currently locked down by IT and they won't even give me read-only access. There is no one at the company who understands cloud concepts or software engineering -- the Azure env is set up from consoles, there is no versioning (like no Git let alone Yaml), and the CIO doesn't even understand containers. The engineers vibe code and if they need an application demo for a client, they'll vibe the python and use Streamlit and put it on a free public server.I'm honestly beside myself and don't know what to do about the environment in general. IT is largely incompetent when it comes to any sort of modern practices and there's a lot of nepotism so no one gets fired and if you aren't related to someone, you're shit out of luck.I'm trying to figure out what to do here. Pros: \- I have the elevated title so I feel like that raises me to a different ""social level"" as I find higher leaders are now wanting to engage with me on LinkedIn \- Right now I kind of have a very flexible schedule and can decide how I want to structure my day. That is very different from other roles I've been in that had mandatory standups and JIRAs and all that jazz \- This gives me time to think about pet projects.\- Adding a pro I forgot to add -- there is room for me to kind of learn this type of position (more leadership, less tech) and make mistakes. There's no one else gunning for this position (they kind of made it for me) so I have no fear of testing something out and then having it fail -- whether that's an idea, a communication style, a long term strategy map, etc. They don't know what to expect from me honestly so I have the freedom to kind of make something up. The fear is that nothing ends up being accepted as actionable due to the culture of not wanting to change processes.Cons: \- I'm paid 'ok' but nothing special. I gave up a $40k higher salary when I took this position. \- There is absolutely no one who can talk about modern software. It's all vibe coders who try to use LLMs for everything. There is absolutely no structure to the company either -- everyone is silo'ed and everyone does what they want so there's just random Python notebooks all over Sharepoint, random csv files where ever, etc \- The company is very old school so everything is Microsoft365. I can't even get a true Azure playground. if I want to develop on the cloud, I'll need to buy my own subscription. I'm forced to use a PC. \- I feel like it's going to be hard to stay current, but I do have colleagues to talk to from previous jobs who are current and intelligent. \- My day to day is extremely frustrating because no one understands software in the slightest. I'm still trying to figure out what I can even suggest to improve their data issues. There are no allies since IT is so locked down (I can't even get answers to questions from them) and their leader doesn't understand cloud or software engineering. Also no one at the company wants to change their ways in the slightest.Right now my plan is: (this is what I'm asking for feedback on) \- Try to make it here at least 2 years and use the elevated title to network -- I suck at networking though so can you give some pointers? \- use this time to grow my brand. Post to Medium, post to LinkedIn about current topics and any pet projects I can come up with. \- Take some MBA level courses as I will admit that I have no business background and if I want to try to align to business goals, I have to understand how businesses (larger businesses) work. \- Try to stay current -- this is the hard one -- I'm not sure if I should just start paying out the nose for my own cloud playground? My biggest shortcoming is never building a high volume streaming pipeline end-to-end. I understand all the tech and I've designed such pipelines for clients, but have never had to build and work in one day to day which would reveal many more things to take into consideration. To do this on my own may be $$$. I will be looking for side consulting jobs to try to stay in the game as well. \- I'm hoping that if I can stay just current enough and add in business strategy skills, I'd be a unique candidate for some high level roles? All my career people have always told me that I'm different because I'm a really intelligent person who actually has social skills (I have a lot of interesting hobbies that I can connect with others over).Or I could bounce, make $45k+ more and go back into a higher pressure, faster moving env as a Lead Data Architect/ engineer. I kind of don't want to do that bc I do need a temporary break from the startup world. If I wait and try to move toward director of data platform, I could make at least $75k more, but I guess I'm not sure what to do between now and then to make sure I could score that sort of title considering it's going to be REALLY hard to prove my strategy can create movement at this current company. I'm mostly scared of staying here and getting really far behind and never being able to get another position.",71,0.89,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ms2j53/data_engineer_architect_data_strategist_director/,2025-08-16 17:54:55,2025-08-23 01:27:46

1mu2fj5,Too much Excel…Help!,Own-Raise-4184,dataengineering,"Joined a company as a data analyst. Previous analysts were strictly excel wizards. As a result, there’s so much heavy logic stuck in excel. Most all of the important dashboards are just pivot tables upon pivot tables. We get about 200 emails a day and the CSV reports that our data engineers send us have to be downloaded DAILY and transformed even more before we can finally get to the KPIs that our managers and team need. Recently, I’ve been trying to automate this process using R and VBA macros that can just pull the downloaded data into the dashboard and clean everything and have the pivot tables refreshed….however it can’t fully be automated (atleast I don’t want it to be because that would just make more of a mess for the next person) Unfortunately, the data engineer team is small and not great at communicating (they’re probably overwhelmed). I’m kind of looking for data engineers to share their experiences with something like this and how maybe you pushed away from getting 100+ automated emails a day from old queries and even lifted dashboards out of large .xlsb files. The end goal, to me, should look like us moving out of excel so that we can store more data, analyze it more quickly without spending half a day updating 10+ LARGE excel dashboards, and obviously get decisions made faster.

Performance/Cost? (Pre-aggregating data to make queries faster and cheaper).2. Simplicity/Self-Service?

Another problem in the project was, the data is full of PII information that only the data owner can access the data. We, the data engineers that doing the migration do not have any permission to see the production data. Hence for development, we rely on sandbox env of the SaaS app that filled with dummy data and just hope it will works in production.

1mx05yq,"Is there possible to develop an OS for DB specific, for performance?",Motor_Crew7918,dataengineering,"The idea of a ""Database OS"" has been a sort of holy grail for decades, but it's making a huge comeback for a very modern reason.My colleagues and I just had a paper on this exact topic accepted to SIGMOD 2025. I can share our perspective.**TL;DR: Yes, but not in the way you might think. We're not replacing Linux. We're giving the database a safe, hardware-assisted ""kernel mode"" of its own, inside a normal Linux process.**# The Problem: The OS is the New Slow DiskFor years, the motto was ""CPU waits for I/O."" But with NVMe SSDs hitting millions of IOPS and microsecond latencies, the bottleneck has shifted. Now, very often, the **CPU is waiting for the OS**.The Linux kernel is a marvel of general-purpose engineering. But that ""general-purpose"" nature comes with costs: layers of abstraction, context switches, complex locking, and safety checks. For a high-performance database, these are pure overhead.Database devs have been fighting this for years with heroic efforts:* Building their own buffer pools to bypass the kernel's page cache.* Using io\_uring to minimize system calls.But these are workarounds. We're still fundamentally ""begging"" the OS for permission. We can't touch the real levers of power: direct page table manipulation, interrupt handling, or privileged instructions.# The Two ""Dead End"" SolutionsThis leaves us with two bad choices:1. **""Just patch the Linux kernel.""** This is a nightmare. You're performing surgery on a 30-million-line codebase that's constantly changing. It's incredibly risky (remember the recent CrowdStrike outage?), and you're now stuck maintaining a custom fork forever.2. **""Build a new OS from scratch (a Unikernel).""** The idealistic approach. But in reality, you're throwing away 30+ years of the Linux ecosystem: drivers, debuggers (gdb), profilers (perf), monitoring tools, and an entire world of operational knowledge. No serious production database can afford this.# Our ""Third Way"": Virtualization for Empowerment, Not Just IsolationHere's our breakthrough, inspired by the classic [Dune paper (OSDI '12)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Fconference%2Fosdi12%2Ftechnical-sessions%2Fpresentation%2Fbelay). We realized that hardware virtualization features (like Intel VT-x) can be used for more than just running VMs. They can be used to **grant a single process temporary, hardware-sandboxed kernel privileges.**Here's how it works:* Your database starts as a normal Linux process.* When it needs to do something performance-critical (like manage its buffer pool), it executes a special instruction and ""enters"" a guest mode.* In this mode, it becomes its own mini-kernel. It has its own page table, can handle certain interrupts, and can execute privileged instructions—all with hardware-enforced protection. If it screws up, it only crashes itself, not the host system.* When it needs to do something generic, like send a network packet, it ""exits"" and hands the request back to the host Linux kernel to handle.This gives us the best of both worlds:* **Total Control:** We can re-design core OS mechanisms specifically for the database's needs.* **Full Linux Ecosystem:** We're still running on a standard Linux kernel, so we lose nothing. All the tools, drivers, and libraries still work.* **Hardware-Guaranteed Safety:** Our ""guest kernel"" is fully isolated from the host.# Two Quick, Concrete Examples from Our PaperThis new freedom lets us do things that were previously impossible in userspace:1. **Blazing Fast Snapshots (vs. fork()):** Linux's fork() is slow for large processes because it has to copy page tables and set up copy-on-write with reference counting for every single shared memory page. In our guest kernel, we designed a simple, epoch-based mechanism that ditches per-page reference counting entirely. **Result: We can create a snapshot of a massive buffer pool in milliseconds.**2. **Smarter Buffer Pool (vs. mmap):** A big reason database devs hate mmap is that evicting a page requires unmapping it, which can trigger a ""TLB Shootdown."" This is an expensive operation that interrupts every other CPU core on the machine to tell them to flush that memory address from their translation caches. It's a performance killer. In our guest kernel, the database can directly manipulate its own page tables and use the INVLPG instruction to **flush the TLB of only the local core**. Or, even better, we can just leave the mapping and handle it lazily, eliminating the shootdown entirely.So, to answer your question: a full-blown ""Database OS"" that replaces Linux is probably not practical. But a **co-designed system where the database runs its own privileged kernel code in a hardware-enforced sandbox** is not only possible but also extremely powerful.We call this paradigm ""Privileged Kernel Bypass.""If you're interested, you can check out the work here:* **Paper:** Zhou, Xinjing, et al. ""Practical db-os co-design with privileged kernel bypass."" SIGMOD (2025).

1mx0je0,Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg : What's the better approach for ML pipelines and batch analytics?,datazipinc,dataengineering,"We recently took a dive into comparing Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg, especially for batch analytics and ML pipelines, and I wanted to share some findings in a practical way. The blog post we wrote goes into detail, but here’s a quick rundown and the approach we took and the things we covered: First off, both formats bring serious warehouse-level power to data lakes think ACID transactions, time travel, and easy schema evolution.That’s huge for ETL, feature engineering, and reproducible model training. Some of the key points we explored: \-Firstly, the delta Lake’s copy-on-write mechanism and the new Deletion Vectors (DVs) feature, which streamlines updates and deletes (especially handy for update-heavy streaming). ﻿ \- Iceberg’s more flexible approach with your position/equality deletes and a hierarchical metadata model for a fast query planning even across a lot(millions) of files. \- We also covered the partitioning strategies where we have Delta’s Liquid Clustering and Iceberg’s true partition evolution and they let you optimize your data as it grows.  \- Most importantly for us was the ecosystem integration iceberg is super engine-neutral, with rich support across Spark, Flink, Trino, BigQuery, Snowflake, and more. Delta is strongest with Spark/Databricks, but OSS support is evolving. \-Case studies went a long way too where we have doordash saved up to 40% on costs migrating to Iceberg, mainly through better storage and resource use.Refer  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRKHEA8-3bYFinal) thoughts: \- Go Iceberg if you want max flexibility, cost savings, and governance neutrality. \- Go Delta if you’re deep in Databricks, want managed features, and real-time/streaming is critical.We covered operational realities too, like setup and table maintenance, so if you’re looking for hands-on experience, I think you’ll find some actionable details.

For context I'm kind of in an odd spot where I've joined a new company working as an 'automation engineer' where the company is quite tech immature and old fashioned and has kinda placed me in a new role to help automate a lot of processes with an understanding that this could take a while to allow for discovery, building POCs, getting approval for things etc. Coming from a data background I'm viewing it as a ""they need data engineering but just don't know it yet"" type role with some IT and reporting thrown in and it's been going alright so far though they use some ancient, obscure or in-house tools and I feel it will probably stunt my career long term though it gives me lots of free time to learn on my own and autonomy to introduce new tools/practices.

1mv97xj,Data Analyst suddenly in charge of building data infra from scratch - Advice?,Just_Ad_5527,dataengineering,"Hey everyone!I could use some advice on my current situation. I’ve been working as a Data Analyst for about a year, but I recently switched jobs and landed in a company that has zero data infrastructure or reporting. I was brought in to establish both sides: create an organized database (pulling together all the scattered Excel files) and then build out dashboards and reporting templates. To be fair, the reason I got this opportunity is less about being a seasoned data engineer and more about my analyst background + the fact that my boss liked my overall vibe/approach. That said, I’m honestly really hyped about the data engineering part — I see a ton of potential here both for personal growth and to build something properly from scratch (no legacy mess, no past bad decisions to clean up). The company isn’t huge (about 50 people), so the data volume isn’t crazy — probably tens to hundreds of GB — but it’s very dispersed across departments. Everything we use is Microsoft ecosystem. Here’s the approach I’ve been leaning toward (based on my reading so far): Excels uploaded to SharePoint → ingested into ADLS Set up bronze/silver/gold layersUse Azure Data Factory (or Synapse pipelines) to move/transform data Use Purview for governance/lineage/monitoring Publish reports via Power BIPossibly separate into dev/test/prod environments Regarding data management, I was thinking of keeping a OneNote Notebook or Sharepoint Site with most of the rules and documentation and a diagram.io where I document the relationships and all the fields.My questions for you all: Does this approach make sense for a company of this size, or am I overengineering it? Is this generally aligned with best practices?In what order should I prioritize stuff?Any good Coursera (or similar) courses you’d recommend for someone in my shoes?

It’s very laid back, I don’t really work with others very much, and I can (kinda) do whatever I want. There’s no sprints or agile stuff, I work on projects here and there, shifting my focus kinda haphazardly to whatever needs done. There’s just a couple problems.1. I make $19/hr. This is astronomically low, though what I’m doing isn’t all that hard.2. I don’t think my work is the same as the rest of the industry. I work with mostly whatever tools I want, but we don’t do any cloud stuff, I don’t really collaborate with anyone, there’s no code reviews or PRs or anything like that. My work mainly consists of “find x data source, setup a way to ingest it, do some transformations, and maybe load it into our DB if we want it.” I mostly do stuff with polars, duckdb, and sometimes pandas. I also do some random things on the side like web scraping/browser automation. We work with A LOT of data, so we have 2 beefy servers, but even then not working with the cloud is really odd to me (though we are a niche government contracted company).3. The restrictions are kinda insane. First of all, because we’re government contractors, we went from 2/5 work from home days to 5/5 in office days (thanks Trump). So that sucks, but also the software I can use is heavily restricted. We use company PCs, so I can’t download anything onto them, not even browser extensions. Many sites are blocked, and things move slowly. On the development side, only Python packages are allowed on an individual basis. Anything else needs to go through the admin team and takes awhile to get approved. I’ve found ways around this, but it’s not something I should be doing.So, after working here for almost a year, is it time to look for other jobs? I don’t have a degree, but I’ve been programming since I was a kid with a lot of projects under my belt, and now this “professional” experience. Mostly I just want more money, and the commute is long, and working from home a bit would be nice. But honestly I just wanna make $60k a year for 5 years and I’ll be good.

1msstih,How to improve RAG retrieval to avoid attention distribution problem,jdnnendndb,dataengineering,"Hey community, I'm building an AI workflow for an internal tool and would appreciate some advice, as this is my first time working with something like that. My background is DevOps not AI so please excuse any ignorant question.Our company has a programming tool for controlling sorting robots, where workflows are defined in a YAML file. Each step in the workflow is a block that can execute a CLI tool.. I am using an LLM (Gemini 2.5 pro) to automatically generate these yaml files from a simplified user prompt (build a workflow to sort red and green cubes). Currently we have around 1000 internal helper CLIs for these tasks so no LLM knows about them.My current approach:Since the LLM has no knowledge of our interna CLI tools, I've come up with this two-stage process which is reecommend everywhere:1. **Stage 1** The users prompt is sent to an LLM. Its task is to formulate questions for a vector database (which contains all our CLI tool man pages) to figure out which specific tools are needed to fulfill the users request, and which flags to use.2. **Stage 2** The man page (or sections) retrieved in the first stage is then passed to a second LLM call, along with the original user prompt and instructions on how to structure the YAML. This stage generates the final output.So here is my problem or lack of understanding:For the first stage, how can I help the LLM to generate the right search queries for a vector database and select the right CLI tools from over these 1000? Should it also generate questions at this first stage to find the right flags for each CLI tool?Is providing the LLM with a simple list of all CLI tool names and a one-line description for each the best way to start? I'm not sure how it would know to ask the right questions about specific flags, arguments, and their usage without more basic context. But I also can't provide it with 1000 basic descriptions? Gemini has a large attention window but I mean its still a lot.For the second stage, I'm not sure what is the best way to provide the retrieved docs to the generator LLM. I've two options I believe?* **Option A: entire manpage** For each CLI tool chosen by he first LLM I pass in the entire man page. A workflow could have 10 manpages or even more, so I would pass 10 entire man pages to the second stage, that feels overkill. This for sure contains all info to the LLM but its enourmous and the token count is through the roof, and the LLM might even loose attention?* **Option B: chunks** I could generate smaller more targeted chunks of the man pages and add them to the Vector database. This would help with my token problem but I also feel this might miss important context since the LLM has 0 knowledge about these tools.So I am not sure if I identified the right problems, or if the problem I have is actually a different one. Can anyone help me understand this more?

When these inputs are queried from the destination database, do you typically read from the replica knowing that you will be writing to the primary, or do you just run your SELECT statement against the primary?It seems the safest pattern in terms of reducing resource contention and locking, particularly when you are running parallel jobs that write to the same group of tables, would be the former option.

We're applying data vault although we sometimes abuse it as in that besides strict link, hub and sats, we throw bridge tables in the mix. One of the issues we currently see in our transformations is that links are dependent on keys/hashes of other objects (that's natural i would say). Most of the time, we fill the hash of the object in the same workflow as the corresponding id key column in the link table. Yet, this creates a soup of dependencies and doesn't feel that professional.The main solution we're thinking off is to make use of a keychain. We would define all the keys of the objects on basis of the source tables (which we call layer 1 tables, i believe it would be called bronze right?). and fill the keychain first before running any layer 2/silver transformations. This way, we would have a much clearer approach in handling keys without making it a jungle of dependencies.

Admittedly I *like* my job because 1) I like what I’m doing, and I want to learn more so I can do more DE work, 2) I believe in the company (I know, I know) I think they are profitable and I really think this could grow, and 3) outside of technical stuff, I’m learning a lot about how business works, meeting with new people with way more experience from different places, 4 ) honestly I need money, and the money is *really* good considering my area, even when compared to other entry positions.

This is why you have have samples or dummy data to supplement testing when not all data have been cleansed. However, my colleague seems to be adamant that from a risk mitigation perspective, it would be risky for developers not to insist on full data cleansing and migration before testing.

1msp0i4,Starrocks Performance,Correct_Nebula_8301,dataengineering,"I recently compared Duck Lake with Starrocks. I was surprised to see that Starrocks performed much better than Duklake+duckdbSome background on DuckDb - I have previously implemented DuckDb in a lambda to service download requests asynchronously- based on filter criteria selected from the UI, a query is constructed in the lambda and queries pre-aggregated parquet files to create CSVs. This works well with fairly compelx queries involving self joins, group by, having etc, for data size upto 5-8GB. However, given DuckDb's limitations around concurrency (multiple process can't read and write to the .DuckDb file at the same time), couldn't really use it in solutions designed with persistent mode. With DuckLake, this is no longer the case, as the data can reside in the object store, and ETL processes can safely update the data in DuckLake while being available to service queries. I get that comparison with a distributed processing engine isn't exactly a fair one- but the dataset size (SSB data) was ~30GB uncompressed- ~8GB in parquet. So this is right up DuckDb's alley. Also worth noting is that memory allocation to Starrocks BE nodes was ~7 GB per node, whereas DuckDb had around 23GB memory available. I was shocked to see DuckDb's in memory processing come short, having seen it easily outperform traditional DBMS like Postgres as well as modern engines like Druid in other projects.Please see the detailed comparison here-https://medium.com/@anigma.55/rethinking-the-lakehouse-6f92dba519dcLet me know your thoughts.",5,0.65,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1msp0i4/starrocks_performance/,2025-08-17 11:58:48,2025-08-23 01:27:46

1mvmawa,Recommendations for Where to Start,Thiseffingguy2,dataengineering,"Hi team,Let me start by saying I'm not a data engineer by training but have picked up a good amount of knowledge over the years. I mainly have analyst experience, using the limited tools I've been allowed to use. I've been with my company for over a decade, and we're hopelessly behind the curve when it comes to our data infrastructure maturity. The short version is that we have a VERY paranoid/old-school parent company who controls most of our sources, and we rely on individuals to export Excel files, manually wrangle, report as needed. One of the primary functions of my current role is to modernize, and I'd REALLY like to make at least a dent in this before starting to look for the next move.We recently had a little, but significant, breakthrough with our parent company - they've agreed to build us a standalone database (on-prem SQL...) to pull in data from multiple sources, to act as a basic data warehouse. I cannot undersell how heavy of a lift it was to get them to agree to just this. It's progress, nonetheless. From here, the loose plan is to start building semantic models in Power BI service, and train up our Excel gurus on what that means. Curate some datasets, replace some reports.The more I dive into engineering concepts, the more overwhelmed I become, and can't really tell the best direction in which to get started along the right path. Eventually, I'd like to convince our parent company how much better their data system could be, to implement modern tools, maybe add some DS roles to really take the whole thing to a new level... but getting there just seems impossible. So, my question really is, in your experience, what should I be focusing on now?

1mu16in,How to access AWS SSM from a private VPC Lambda without costly VPC endpoints?,CrimsonPilgrim,dataengineering,"My AWS-based side project has suddenly hit a wall while trying to get resources in a private VPC to reach AWS services.I'm a junior data engineer with less than a year of experience, and I've been working on a solo project to strengthen my skills, learn, and build my portfolio. Initially, it was mostly a data science project (NLP, model training, NER), but those are now long-forgotten memories. Instead, I've been diving deep into infrastructure, networking, and Terraform, discovering new worlds of pain every day while trying to optimize for every penny.After nearly a year of working on it at night, I'm proud of what I've learned, even though a public release is still a (very) distant goal. I was making steady progress... until four days ago.So far, I have a Lambda function that writes S3 data into my Postgres database. Both are in the same private VPC. My database password was fully exposed in my Lambda function (I know, I know... there's just so much to learn as a single developer, and it was just for testing).Recently, I tried to make my infrastructure cleaner by storing the database password in SSM Parameter Store. To do this, my Lambda function now needs to access the SSM (and KMS) APIs. The recommended way to do this is by using VPC private endpoints. The problem is that they are billed per endpoint, per AZ, per hour, which I've desperately tried to avoid. This adds a significant cost ($14/month for two endpoints) for such a small necessity in my whole project.I'm really trying to find a solution. The only other path I've found is to use a lambda-to-lambda pattern (a public lambda calls the private lambda), but I'm afraid it won't scale and will cause problems later if I use this pattern every time I have this issue. I've considered simply not using SSM/KMS, but I'll probably face a similar same issue sooner or later with other services.Is there a solution that won't be billed hourly, as it dramatically increases my costs?",5,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mu16in/how_to_access_aws_ssm_from_a_private_vpc_lambda/,2025-08-18 22:48:11,2025-08-23 01:27:46

So we built a lightrag ish knowledge graph into the agent.**How it works:**1. Ingestion → The agent ingests alerts, logs, configs, and monitoring data.2. Entity extraction → From that, it creates nodes like service, deployment, pod, node, alert, metric, code change, ticket.3. Graph building → It links them: * service → deployment → pod → node * alert → metric → code change * ticket → incident → root cause4. Querying → When a new alert comes in, the agent doesn’t just check “what fired.” It walks the graph to see how things connect and retrieves context using lighrag (graph traversal + lightweight retrieval).**Example:*** engineer get paged on checkout-service* The agent walks the graph: checkout-service → depends\_on → payments-service → runs\_on → node-42.* It finds a code change merged into payments-service 2h earlier.* Output: “This looks like a payments-service regression propagating into checkout.”**Why we like this approach:*** so cheaper (tech company can have 1tb of logs per day)* easy to visualise and explain* It gives the agent long-term memory of infra patterns: next time the same dependency chain fails, it recalls the past RCA.what we used:1. lightrag [https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG)2. mastra for agent/frontend: [https://mastra.ai/](https://mastra.ai/)3. the agent: [https://getcalmo.com/](https://getcalmo.com/)",4,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mvc0fx/how_our_agent_uses_lightrag_knowledge_graphs_to/,2025-08-20 11:21:28,2025-08-23 01:27:46

This turned our agent into a modular AI Analyst that can securely connect to external services in real time.Here’s why MCP beats a single-agent setup:**1. Flexibility*** *Single Agent*: Each integration is custom-built → hard to maintain.* *MCP*: Standard protocol for external tools → plug/unplug tools with minimal effort.This is the only code your would need to post to add MCP server to your agentSample MCP configuration ""playwright"": { ""command"": ""npx"", ""args"": [ ""@playwright/mcp@latest"" ] }**2. Maintainability*** *Single Agent*: Tightly coupled integrations mean big updates if one tool changes.* *MCP*: Independent servers → modular and easy to swap in/out.**3. Security & Governance*** *Single Agent*: Permissions can be complex and less controllable (agent gets too much permissions compared to what is needed.* *MCP*: standardized permissions and easy to review (read-only/write).&#8203; ""servers"": { ""filesystem"": { ""permissions"": { ""read"": [ ""./docs"", ""./config"" ], ""write"": [ ""./output"" ] } } }:backhand_index_pointing_right: You can try out to connect MCP servers to data agent to perform tasks that were commonly done by data analysts and data scientists: [GitHub — datu-core](https://github.com/Datuanalytics/datu-core). The ecosystem is growing fast and there are a lot of ready made MCP servers* [**mcp.so**](http://mcp.so) — a large directory of available MCP servers across different categories.* [**MCPLink.ai**](http://MCPLink.ai) — a marketplace for discovering and deploying MCP servers.* [**MCPServers.org**](http://MCPServers.org) — a curated list of servers and integrations maintained by the community.* [**MCPServers.net**](http://MCPServers.net) — tutorials and navigation resources for exploring and setting up servers.Has anyone here tried building with MCP?

1muo6oj,I built a free tool to visualize complex Teradata BTEQ scripts,Azriel_84spa,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,Like some of you, I've spent my fair share of time wrestling with legacy Teradata ETLs. You know the drill: you inherit a massive BTEQ script with no documentation and have to spend hours, sometimes days, just tracing the data lineage to figure out what it's actually doing before you can even think about modifying or debugging it.Out of that frustration, I decided to build a little side project to make my own life easier, and I thought it might be useful for some of you as well.**It's a web-based tool called SQL Flow Visualizer:** **Link:**[**https://www.dfv.azprojs.net/**](https://www.dfv.azprojs.net/)**What it does:** You upload one or more BTEQ script files, and it parses them to generate an interactive data flow diagram. The goal is to get a quick visual overview of the entire process: which scripts create which tables, what the dependencies are, etc.**A quick note on the tech/story:** As a personal challenge and because I'm a huge AI enthusiast, the entire project (backend, frontend, deployment scripts) was built with the help of AI development tools. It's been a fascinating experiment in AI-assisted development to solve a real-world data engineering problem.**Important points:*** It's completely free.* The app processes the files in memory and **does not store your scripts**. Still, obfuscating sensitive code is always a good practice.* It's definitely in an early stage. There are tons of features I want to add (like visualizing complex single queries, showing metadata on click, etc.).I'd genuinely love to get some feedback from the pros. Does it work for your scripts? What features are missing?

1mtcgcf,Stop being scared of AI and just learn to program.,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"Very often I'll see posts on here with a similar title. ""Should I learn to code considering AI?"" , ""Is it worth learning to code if AI exists"", and while you should definitely use Google and look at what the thousands of other developers are saying, the short answer is yes. It's worth it, even if you want a job.Programming is not coding and it has never been the same and it will never be the same. ChatGPT being able to create a game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript is not the same as what a Google senior software engineer is doing on a daily basis. Oftentimes you will hear that in professional settings you will spend more time writing out designs and reading code and in meetings that writing actual code and that is true. Meaning building out your problem solving and communication skills is way more important that anything AI could spit out. If you are truly investing all your time into AI thinking that you will get further than anyone else because you finished a To-Do app in 10 minutes, please think again. Anyone can learn to code. Coding is not what is in demand, it's programming.Coding is the tippity top of the iceberg, you will not get as far as you think you will without also training your brain. Your brain is the most important tool, not your keyboard. So, use AI wisely and do not fear the future, developers are needed because coding and programming are not the same thing. Learn it, it's fun, you can be very successful if you put in the work, and it can really change the way that you approach every day problems. AI will only replace you if you maintain that mindset of replacement and not of assistance.",743,0.94,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mtcgcf/stop_being_scared_of_ai_and_just_learn_to_program/,2025-08-18 04:38:45,2025-08-23 01:27:47
1mwyb0i,"Tutorial hell isn't the problem, it's thinking you need to understand everything before writing anything",CreditOk5063,learnprogramming,"I used to think “tutorial hell” meant bouncing from one course to the next. Looking back, my real problem wasn’t tutorials, it was believing I needed to *understand everything* before I wrote anything. I’d watch 10-hour React courses before writing a single component. I’d read entire documentation sets before typing. I’d spend days researching best practices instead of just building *something*. And then I’d wonder why nothing stuck. My learning speed is really too slow. The effect of doing something after reading is definitely not as good as reading while learning.Every senior dev says “just build stuff”, and beginners hear that as “just build stuff *correctly*.” That mindset kept me paralyzed. Bad code teaches more than no code. I’ve started using beyz coding assistant, not to hand me solutions, but to help me debug my own broken logic. Explaining *why* something doesn’t work turns out to be the fastest way to understand it. Now my rule is build → break → understand → rebuild. The understanding comes *after* the mistakes, not before. When did you stop watching “just one more tutorial” and start producing bugs instead? And how do you keep yourself from falling back into the perfectionism trap?",376,0.98,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mwyb0i/tutorial_hell_isnt_the_problem_its_thinking_you/,2025-08-22 05:45:17,2025-08-23 01:27:47

[https://kareemcarr.substack.com/p/the-hardest-part-of-learning-statistics](https://kareemcarr.substack.com/p/the-hardest-part-of-learning-statistics) .Allow me to summarize and paraphrase.People seem eager to dive into details of coding without having the structure in their life to study programming deeply. The 4 distinct subtasks are:Learning on your own - Recognize that doing things on your own is also doing things the hard way;Finding resources - finding resources that you can trust, and that fit your level of expertise and style of learning;Protecting time - regular, distraction-free time to think;Learning the content itself - syntax, semantics, libraries, development tools, algorithms, style.For me, when learning a new programming language I like to know who invented the language, what their motivation was, and what books (or blogs or channels) they have written or recommend. In my experience the most productive developers were the most effective at getting help (before AI helpers became popular).",270,0.97,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1msv7di/the_hardest_part_of_learning_programming_it_isnt/,2025-08-17 16:20:15,2025-08-23 01:27:47
1msa43x,Should I learn to code (From a 20+ year software developer),NumberNinjas_Game,learnprogramming,"Hey all, I'm David and I'm a professional software developer who still loves coding, 20 years after graduating from college with my degree. I've earned my Bachelor's in Computer Systems Engineering, my Masters in Computer Science, and I've worked across all industries: embedded ,web, automation and even making a few mobile games like my Number Ninjas game (on my profile). I'm starting with a little about me to not brag, but to a) give context on why my experience can be useful and b) to hopefully give you encouragement.As I'm sifting through the land of Reddit, I see this question come up so many times: should I learn to code? Follow on questions stem from the likes of ""is coding dead with AI,"" ""what programming language should I use"", ""Java or dotnet"", etc. Just this week with casual browsing, these all popped up on my feed. Let me break this up into parts:**1) Should I learn to code?**This is a problem that needs to be reframed at a deeper level involving your relationship with problems in life. There are two things we can encounter:1) Solving an existing problem2) Choosing better problems (or creating a good ""problem"") Think about the last time you were stuck on something. How motivated were you to fix it? When you hit roadblocks, did you just want to throw in the towel, or did you stick with it and feel REALLY good after making a breakthrough. Writing software isn't linear or not even always predictable. There will be good days. There will be days where things break, you have setbacks, and it may take WAY more time than you planned for. It requires patience, resilience and a strong mindset.I'll be honest with you. Coding is VERY polarizing. If you don't love it, you'll hate it. There really isn't much in between. Going back to problems in life, a big part of your success in life isn't living a problem-free life, but choosing better problems to have. Code is a weird dichotomy: you solve world problems by creating interesting, fun problems in the making. **2) Is coding dead with AI? Will it take my job?**There are many strong opinions on this. My personal one is that if you don't see AI as a companion versus a threat, you will be phased out. Like many things in life, mindset matters. I remember being out of shape and always being envious of people who ""seemed"" to have it ""easier"" by being in shape...until I put in the work and started crushing it myself. AI is no different. You will need to be more of a ""unicorn"" software developer these days that does ""more than their job"" used to be just a few years ago. Life has adapted quite a bit. It's faster and it's automated. You can either let it make you bitter or better. Use AI, embrace it. But also embrace the fact that AI is FAR from perfect. Make yourself irreplaceable in your craft by being ""that dev"" that understands the architectural limitations of AI today and how your solutions show why AI can't be solely relied on. Sure, you can't guarantee you'll never lose a job BUT you are in charge of your growth and becoming the best you can be. Heck, you can then make your own apps like I have with the help of AI. **3) What programming language should I use?**Very nuanced. Do you know what kind of job space you are looking at (mobile apps, security, etc)? Certain programming paradigms and even languages may be better or worse. Are you simply looking for an easy language? Sure, start with Python. My answer isn't the best or the right one for everyone, and that's the point: there's no perfect answer to this. You just need to dive into SOMETHING, write code ,make mistakes, and LEARN from them. It's just like when I was starting my math YouTube channel: instead of obsessing over making the first perfect video, many Youtubers talked about not overthinking it and to just build that muscle memory. DO SOMETHING!!! Java vs dotnet? I saw this question recently. I know both. I prefer dotnet. Why? I just do? I love the IDE I use and the tech stack a bit more (big fan of Rider IDE btw). But again, your choice may be different I hope this gives you some things to think about. Reframe those questions, really hone in on your relationship with problem solving, and just dive right in! All the best and God bless!Is your motivation simply money: I promise you, that's very fleeting and won't keep you entertained. I've met so many people, both in college and beyond, where they chased coding as the next big thing and the pay it provides, only to experience burnout and pivot entirely. Here's an interesting problem for you. Imagine I gave you 9 pennies and just one of the pennies weighs slightly more than the other pennies. You're given a weight scale where you can put any number of pennies on one side. One weigh means comparing the weight of the pennies on both sides and the scale will tell you some outcome: both sides way the same, the left side weighs more or the right. Each time you perform this measurement, that counts as a turn. Beginner programmer question: make an app to figure out which penny weighs the most. Given the assumption that penny exists, your program must ALWAYS choose the CORRECT penny. Does this problem sound fun to you? If you were to take a pause right now and try and figure it out, what's your experience (""good"" frustration, annoyance, wanting to really figure this out)? A simple ""problem"" like this can tell you a lot about your relationship with problem solving, the heart of coding. Believe me, there are days I get frustrated trying to figure out what's wrong, but it's a ""good"" frustration. Once solved, I still get that joy 20 years later.Btw, bonus problem: can you guarantee that program takes as few turns as possible :)",241,0.95,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1msa43x/should_i_learn_to_code_from_a_20_year_software/,2025-08-16 22:37:31,2025-08-23 01:27:47

And if it does, I don’t know where to find it.For example: I’ll have an idea of what I want to build, but I’m unsure if there’s already a library, function, or tool that solves part of it, or if I’d have to build it myself.And then there’s another challenge: even if I start searching, I often end up going down a huge rabbit hole, reading docs, tutorials, StackOverflow posts, GitHub repos… and suddenly I’m overwhelmed and don’t know what’s actually the *right* way forward.So my questions are:1. **How do you figure out if the programming Lego piece you need actually exists, and where do you look for it?**2. **How do you avoid getting lost or overwhelmed while searching?**Would love to hear how more experienced programmers handle this.",47,0.91,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mubjv1/programming_feels_like_lego_but_how_do_you_find/,2025-08-19 07:17:20,2025-08-23 01:27:47

Books or offline resources in CS/math that are compatible with this kind of setup2. Online or mobile-friendly resources, especially ones that work well in Termux or can run from a phone.3.

I learned that bcrypt adds a random salt each time you hash a password, so even if two user have the same password it will produce different hashes for both of them.But then, how does `bcrypt.compare(password, hash)` actually verify the password later when user actually enters the password? If salt is randomly created even if for same password how can it verify the password entered after being stored in the database with the hashed password that DB contains. If the salt is random and different each time, how can it recreate the same hash to compare with the login password?I take time to search online and stumbled upon some explanations and I think bcrypt somehow ( I don't understand the how part as well ) stores the salt along with the hash string itself, then reuses it during comparison with the new password but I’m not 100% sure if I’ve understood it correctly and it feels like I haven't understand the core concept of this Bcrypt password hashing.

Speaking of the course, the explanations are no doubt good because Harry explains well, however, it's clearly not worth 2900 and I'll tell the reasons I feel that way:You don't learn programming by just good explanations, you learn by solving more and more problems on a topic from basic to advanced. The problem in his courses is that in many sections, for example NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. There are just pure lectures and handbooks of the lectures. No questions to practice or use the things you learn in a lecture.Result? You have to search for questions yourself, filter for the basics to intermediate to advanced level questions and that would be scattered, which means , not curated to what you learnt after every lecture. And that is the second major part of why people prefer courses. It's for the ease of getting resources for practice curated to the teachings step by step.I've been a part of the Pierian Data Science Course on Udemy too, and the two MAJOR plus points of it were first, it had after every few lectures, practice questions, and that too on an integrated ipynb jupyter kernel on the website itself so you can do it then and there. And the second, the site allows you to take notes of yourself on any part of the video.

Instead, the book says, “Here’s an assembler, just write it in Java/Python using our API”.

I designed this project with my friend as a non-profit organisation that we could write on our common apps.

My website will have a minimal backend, no login/registration, just a dashboard explaining the site, and hyperlinks to different subjects and tutorials My friend has recorded.

On the practice side I tried writing the code tutor writes just to understand better.Also made a small site with HTML, little CSS, wrote some JS logic for form submission using Google Appscript, and for Python wrote a script that saved me hours of manual work (basically extracting mails from long videos). Felt good to actually use code for my own need.Then in the last 2 weeks I wanted to be more focused, so I came across OSSU. Started it, been watching, reading, and solving problem sets. What I understood is OSSU community curated a CS curriculum which is kind of equivalent to a CS program, and they say it takes 13–30 months (42 courses).Now here’s the thing: I do spend around 12h a day on desk, not just tutorials/practice but also hardware related videos. Planning to get electronics starter kit too.But still I feel like, am I doing it right?

Being calm is the actual cheat code.**I'm 4 years deep at a big tech company, and work-life balance has been absolutely brutal lately. For the past year, I went full psycho mode—trying to crush every single task, racing through my backlog, saying yes to everything.**Plot twist: It made me objectively worse at my job.**Here's what I didn't expect: When you're constantly in panic mode, your nervous system goes haywire. You become that coworker who's stressed, short with people, and honestly just not fun to be around.**And here's the kicker—being pleasant to work with is literally the most important skill in Big Tech.**Think about it: The people who get shit done aren't grinding alone in a corner. They're the ones other people WANT to help. They get faster code reviews. They get invited to the important meetings. They get context shared with them freely.When you're stressed and snappy? People avoid you. Your PRs sit in review hell. You get excluded from decisions. You end up working 2x harder for half the impact.**The counterintuitive solution: Embrace strategic calm.**I started doing less. I stopped panic-working. I took actual lunch breaks. I said ""I'll get back to you tomorrow"" instead of dropping everything.Result? My productivity went UP. My relationships improved.

I landed new jobs in what were historically some of the most difficult markets (2008, 2020, and 2025)- The industry is still growing in terms of jobs and revenue- Number of CS grads has more than doubled in recent years- CS program quality at most universities have not improved and weren't very good to begin with. Sorry, but your college probably ripped you off. take it up with them. seriously.- Efficiency in software development process has improved remarkably with cloud, devops- Most developers aren't really good at building resilient, hardened systems.- Many seasoned devs have a sense of entitlement and an aversion to acquiring new skills on their own- Offshoring is acceleratingAside from all of this, it is easy to get crushed by toxic management culture and most devs don't realize that they are actively competing for a piece of the pie with layers of useless middle managers who excel at stealing accomplishments. As the industry becomes more competitive you must adapt. If you aren't already raging, here's my advice:- Learn how to self-manage and take credit for your own work- Work fast, take risks, don't worry about tech debt (your managers don't)- Never stop expanding your skill set. We are never done learning. AI, infrastructure management, scalability, data pipelines- If you are American, fight offshoring and H1B head on by proving you are more valuable and less of a hassle, voting won't make a difference there.

Visibility, influence, etc. Things started to ‘click’ after the performance review, just coincidentally. If I could start over again I feel like I would do well, unfortunately that’s not how things work. I’m generally wondering if I want to pursue the PIP and try to save my position, or just use my time to look for a new role. I’m at 8months at c1 with about 5 yoe overall. My manager occasionally points out ways I can be more influential. I’m not sure if I sure take that as a sign that I have a decent chance. I also felt like I only received criticism right before performance reviews. That way he can say he warned me about being more influential. Realistically that isn’t something you just do over a week. I’m feeling a little burnt out, it’s very tempting to opt out of the pip and take 2 months to relax and look for new jobs. People talk about how bad the economy is though. Not sure if that means I really should use the 2 months to secure new employment or save my old job.

1mxg0g9,I uncovered a scam trying to hire for a remote engineer position,ExpensivePost,cscareerquestions,"Novel warning, but it's a good one IMO, tldr at the bottomThis is probably a common scam, but it was new to me so I figured I'd post it here in the off chance it helps someone avoid unwittingly destroying their entire company.For some time we had been getting flooded with nearly identically formatted resumes that were all very low quality. They were loaded with random keywords from our postings to try to maximize automated ranking but used very poor grammar or just nonsense word soup.They were all PDFs and all of them had similar metadata that was unique to them so I just wrote a script for our recruiters to auto-reject all of them.We got tons of them for every pure-remote posting, never in-office, or even hybrid.Curiosity got the better of me so I tried to schedule a tech screen with a few of them. Most ghosted, but I was able to actually get on a call with one.* The name was very English, first and last.* Age was late 20's which was a bit young given the timeline shown in the work history and education, but not impossible. It put them finishing their BS right at 21.* Location was listed as Austin, Texas and indicated that they were legal to work in the US without visa endorsement.* They listed a BS in Game Programming from Full Sail University (private, for-profit, online). I've had limited but mixed experience with their grads. Not an auto-reject school, but it's not going to help your resume really.* They had some work history with several short-term contracts with random non-us based small game studios and one 2-year stint with a well-known, but long defunct American studio. The timeline was a a bit dense with their first 2 contract gigs overlapping with their last year of college.Unfortunately for this person, the games industry is fairly small and I have close friends who were at the studio they listed at the time they reported having worked there. One of my friends would have been the director of the team this person reported having been a junior engineer on. My friend confirmed without question that this person was never at that studio and was never on his team.Once I got on the call (zoom), it was clear the the person was not a native English speaker. Which isn't a problem, they were conversational, just incongruitous with the name. The age also seemed unlikely; this person was probably over 40, though I've been more off on age guesses before. I'm familiar with Austin so I asked about the city a bit. It was clear that the person had never been there, let alone lived there.I poked at their technical skills and they actually seemed like they had some programming knowledge, but nothing close to what their experience and education would suggest. They used jargon more in-line with a very junior web developer than a mid-level game engineer. C++ was very weak, no knowledge of basic game design principles, and they couldn't speak at all to basic game development team structure or workflows.I was ready to get to the truth so I asked where they were calling from, making up some bullshit their IP address looking unusual (lie, zoom doesn't expose that). They said they were visiting family in Delhi but would be back in the US before the start date. I asked to confirm their legality to work in the US and they confirmed what was in their application and added that they were a natural born American citizen.I asked about their experience at the US-based game studio. I asked some specifics about their internal processes that you would only know if you were actually working there as an engineer (they had an unusual source-control workflow). Candidate had no clue and made up some bullshit. I asked about their responsibilities on the team and who they reported to; more bullshit.Time to take the mask off.I told them I know they never worked at that studio. I told them I know they've never been to Austin. And I asked directly: what's your goal here? They tried to redirect, and doubled down on the bullshit, clearly not understanding that the scam was over. So I asked about the name on the application: Is that a real person? Did you steal their identity? Are they in on it like some sort of employment mule? They immediately dropped from the call.After the call, I hit up our legal department and asked them to see if the name on the application could be identified as a real person (possibly in Austin). Turns out the name was just uncommon enough and we had just enough PII that it did match a likely real person in Austin. Legal notified the Austin PD about the probable identity theft (or possibly an accomplice to fraud) and that was the last I heard about it.My theory is that the scammers get enough info about an American to secure a remote job with that identity (really they just need a name, DoB, and SSN). They rely on companies not verifying their education and employment history (which they make difficult using small and defunct companies). Then they spam every possible remote job listing hoping to overwhelm their recruiting pipeline and sneak someone through. I imagine they would do just enough to not get immediately fired and collect a paycheck while exfiltrating as much source code, data, and other assets of value as possible once they have access. I would be surprised if they didn't also try to plant ransomware or other malware to company systems or worse, customers.This was a few months ago, and I'm no longer at that company, but their current director has told me that the resume script is still working and hitting about a hundred resumes per posting, still only for remote roles.If you have this issue, look at the PDF metadata and it should be pretty obvious what pattern I'm talking about. My script was very simple using PyMuPDF to read metadata to identify and filter them.tldr: Got lots of similar, sketchy resumes for remote postings only. I investigated and actually spoke to one of them.

Right now, I’m working at one of the most popular restaurants in NYC, making around **$115k working just 4 days a week**. This job put me through college and helped me graduate debt-free, which I’m super thankful for. Before this, the most I ever made was around $50k a year at any other restaurant, so this income honestly feels unreal.But being honest, seeing all the millionaires who dine here, I really want to break into the field I studied. I don’t want to be the server forever, I want to be the one being served, like those customers.That said, I never got an internship during college. I started at community college and thought internships were only for people already in a bachelor’s program. By the time I transferred, I felt like my projects weren’t strong enough, and I missed opportunities. Senior year came and went without an internship too.Now I’m job hunting. I’ve applied to 100+ positions this past month (mostly C++ and Python roles — C++ is really my strong suit). I do have some better projects now, but the market feels brutal. I’m not sure if I should set a “limit” on how long to keep applying before focusing my energy elsewhere.I love the restaurant job I have now, and I never expected it to be this lucrative, but at the same time, I don’t want to feel like I wasted 4 years of my life on my degree.So my question is, has anyone here broken into tech with a similar background (no internships, starting a bit late)?

1muzhe0,I just got laid off again after working for a year,Craexus,cscareerquestions,"Last year, I got caught up in one of those ""restructuring"" situations where the company eliminated a few positions from every team. Mine was one of them. That day was my first time being laid off.So when I was job hunting, I made sure to target more established companies this time as I thought it would bring me more stability. During interviews, I specifically asked about company stability related questions. For example, I asked questions about how often layoff occurs and about the length of the tenure of the employees on the team. The hiring manager gave me the usual spiel about how yes, they'd had layoffs the previous year, but my role would be ""more secure"" since those cuts mainly hit non-dev positions. When I asked about team tenure, the interviewers gave the impression that the people had been there for years.Today, my director messaged asking if I had ""a moment to chat"" and I knew I was about to be cut. It's the same dance as last year where manager suddenly requested a meeting with me. The director told me it wasn't performance orientated as 15% of the company got laid off but I still feel like maybe if I was better at my job I would be one of the ""safe"" people.I spent the rest of the day doing damage control on my finances, cancelling the subscriptions I don't need, trying to get my head straight. The timing just feels particularly brutal because my team has been grinding through overtime these past few weeks, pulling extra hours just to so we can finish our project on time and meet our side of the service level agreement.All those late nights, all that extra effort and for what? It's exhausting as none of it seems to matter in the end.

Life events are preventing me from functioning in this industry anymore.",Legitimate-mostlet,cscareerquestions,"Basically, I have about 6-8 years experience as a software developer. I am coming to the realization that it feels very difficult for me to find a work environment in this industry that matches with me and all the problems going on in my life outside work.It just feels like this industry is extremely cold and filled with cold and unsympathetic people. I worked in a different industry prior to this and even though that industry is not known for sympathetic people, it was like night and day compared to this one. The endless outsourcing and abuse that comes from management onto those workers seeps over to US workers as well.

Forced attrition cuts each year and killing the supportive culture it had.Where can one realistically pivot from a career in SWE to one that has a more chill work environment? One where I feel like I can turn off after work, I don't need to endlessly study for interviews outside work, and one where work is steady and there is none of this PIP culture or x% of people need to be laid off each year?

1mrltsk,26 4YOE Feel Like I haven’t learned much of anything?,InsaneAdoration,cscareerquestions,"Sorry if this sounds a bit of a rant, but I just passed the 4 YOE mark and am now starting to get extremely anxious over (how I feel anyway) not having learned much of anything/developed any skills as a SWE. I just need some hard truths/perspective/advice.I work for a company that is essentially a defense contractor (though not in the traditional sense). Started off at 90k with mid year and end of year raises. Am now at 132k. However, now that I look back, I feel like I haven’t learned much of anything. Listed below are the projects that I’ve worked through at my job:1. Started off by supporting a study/analysis where I was basically taking existing MatLab scripts, writing my own scripts, and cobbling them together (all in MatLab - no other tools/software) to generate, process, and manipulate data for analysis. Learned about a lot of stuff like Kalman filters, linear algebra, and math related etc, but Not software engineering - just a lot of MatLab scripting2. We received a black box software that needed to be installed and ran on my workplaces systems (including on a HPC). I had to get it running (as in, hit the executable and not have it crash). All I really did was make sure the .so files were properly linked, set up a few text config files, and figure out the right terminal command to input to get it running on the HPC. Pretty much no programming whatsoever.3. This was setting up a GitLab CI/CD for an existing project. Essentially, setting up the virtual machine for the runner, configuring the GitLab file to build and run, as well as creating a python script that analyzed unit/regression test outputs for correctness (automatically called by the runner). No real programming.4. What I consider to be my first actual large SWE project. However, the tech stack was pretty much non-existent. It was essentially a message based, event driven simulation in C++. The “database” was just a folder of CSV’s that were read in. I did create framework to connect to a MySQL server and/or SQLite server as alternatives to access the same data (learned more about abstract classes, etc). The build process was just a bunch of Make scripts (deadass just pure, rawdog Make scripts). I did implement new features, but frankly speaking, the code base was awful. The simulation framework itself was decent and I occasionally touched it, but the actual processing of events/messages was incredibly convoluted (culmination of literal generations of technical debt). I honestly felt like I was back in College, creating random ass functions and just writing huge chunks of code because to try and refactor it all was just not feasible. I did get some experience also writing BOOST unit/regression tests. 5. This was another simulation project. However, I was far less involved with the actual framework/architecture of the simulation. I mainly worked on algorithms for what was actually being simulated. IE, I did not have to think too much about classes, design philosophy. There was literally just an empty place holder function for some functionality, and I just had to come up with an algorithm to produce that functionality (think guidance and control for vehicles).6. This is what I consider to be the most “SWE” project so far (and is my current one). It’s essentially a Java desktop App (built as a Maven project) with JavaFx front end and pure Java back end. I’m still new to this project, but seeing how it’s been programmed, it looks beautiful with really clean/elegant code, though I couldn’t even explain WHY that code is clean/elegant (just the vibes). Learned more about socket connections and JavaFX. However, even in this project, we don’t really use all those full stack technologies you hear about like Kubernetes, React, Docker (I’ve also had to create Docker images before but not as part of like a larger tech stack).Essentially, I feel like nearly all of my experience has just been about hammering out code. I haven’t really touched any of that “tech stack” stuff I hear a lot about. Furthermore, just looking at how some of that code (#6) is written makes me realize that even when it comes to just hammering out code, I’m doing it in a very “College Undergraduate With a Vague Semblance of Best Practices” way instead of the clean/elegant (albeit complicated because I don’t understand all of the language’s features) way I witnessed. And don’t even get me started on system design. I know legit nothing about system design (aside from general terms like protocol, load balancing, etc).Is this normal for someone with a whole 4YOE to know this little? If not, how can I improve? I know the best way is to “create projects on your own time”, but are there any resources that that can give me starting pointers? Like a “suppose you want to create a full stack application that does whatever, here is every tech you need and how they relate” so I can at least fill out the details by myself in a project? Or what about resources that I can learn regarding elegant code (for example, I’ve been reading Effective Java 3rd Edition).",69,0.91,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mrltsk/26_4yoe_feel_like_i_havent_learned_much_of/,2025-08-16 05:27:15,2025-08-23 01:27:48

I'm more curious as to what could be behind the sudden change. It doesn't seem like my manager is actually the one behind it, but rather it's coming from upper management.

Then we got a new manager a few months ago, everything started ok, our one on one meetings are typically just him asking if I needed anything. Then a few weeks back he suddenly drops a bombshell, that I'm not performing to the level of expectations for a ""senior"" developer. And most of the reasons he gave are rather vague, ie not being ""independent"" enough, asking too many questions, etc. ie nothing to do with my work or getting stuff done. Then it just escalated, he started complaining about my pull requests with more vague things like ""why did you do it X way when Y way would have been better?"" Note that during all this time I just took it all in and never argued or tried to defend myself, because most of the things he mentioned are vague ie how do I respond to being told that I ask too many questions?

1muhjxw,"Meeting with my boss and skip manager about my boss being unusually ""aggressive"". How should I approach this?",Dreadsin,cscareerquestions,"So I'm *pretty sure* this all started one day where I was given a very large task, basically go through every design and break it down to components, then create a design system from that meeting some requirements. I made a notion doc, shared it, and worked through it. My manager told me to make tickets for it, I said I wasn't yet done with breaking things down, she got really mad and reassigned it to another teammate with no warning so I stopped working on itShe said (quote) ""\[redacted\] will be leading the theming & tokens initiative, but he's on PTO this week. he'll help build out the project w/ its various phases & tickets. i'm creating some tickets with explicit tasks for you to get started"". She then assigned me a small handful of tickets. I didn't totally understand what the actual implication of that new guy being the lead of the project meant, and she didn't explain it, so I figured it just meant ""stop working on this project"". I don't want to ask, because she responds to questions **very** negatively.We had a 1:1 where she mentioned a lot of very strange things. She said I should implicitly know what to work on 100% of the time and it's ""not her job"" to give me work to do. One thing that also came up was that I took a ticket which was ""meant"" to be for support, but was actually just sitting at the top of the backlog. To her, this was a really big miss on my part and she wouldn't stop talking about it. To me, I just saw a ticket with high priority on the backlog and grabbed itSince then, she was downright *aggressive*. I'm talking, every time I put in a pull request she'd rip it apart, but without looking at the code. She'll nitpick the description, the title, pretty much everything but the code. Some were such bizarrely small nitpicks. Prime example, I made a fix for a footer component so my commit message was like ""\[FE-29\] {footer} fixes the way images display in dark mode on the footer component"". She said that I really messed up because I didn't include a link to the storybook. I was a bit confused because a bot usually deploys it then comments the link. I asked what she meant, and she said ""I need an EXACT LINK to the footer component in dark mode"", followed by a lot of derisive comments about how I never do anything right. To me, I thought ""it says the component and it says dark mode... just click the link, click footer, and click dark mode...?"". It was never a stated convention that we would have to post a direct linkLater she comments how I'm on ""thin ice"" and how I need to tell her what I'm working on this week. I ask her a few things about prioritization, which I get a lot of non-answers to. So, I get really specific. ""Looking at both the boards, it appears the button component is the next highest priority. Is that right?"", she then explains what the component library *is* as if I haven't been working on it. The only hint is she said ""priority ahead of that is working on your existing PRs"", so it seems like she's saying ""yes, after you finish your existing PRs, do the button""Frankly, I'm a bit annoyed with the indirectness so I say ""so should I take the button component? Yes or no?"", which she said ""i'm looking for you to create a weekly work plan w/ prioritized tasks from the available information"". So then I say ""... ok... so I guess I'll take the button?"", and she replied ""i've asked for a weekly work plan — this includes a list of items that you plan to dedicate time to this week""So I gather 4-5 tickets and send them to her. I accidentally didn't include the button (just messed up one link) and before I could even edit, she started berating me and she said she was prepping to put me on PIP. I tried explaining to her, ""the reason I'm asking you this is because you reassigned that project to someone else and told me you'd make tickets for me. Because of that, I thought that you wouldn't want me to blindly take tickets and work on them"". Just the previous week, I got in trouble for taking one of ""her"" tickets, despite the fact that it was sitting in the backlog not assigned to herI got really frustrated with her at this point and reached out to my previous manager. I said I feel like I can't communicate clearly with this manager, and she set up a meeting with me and the skip. Really, I just can't deal with the leading questions, non answers, ""quizzing"" me, and negative responses to my questions.

1mt09p0,Hope this helps you improve your spoken communication skills like it did for me,SomeRandomCSGuy,cscareerquestions,"A while back, I made a post about how developing soft skills (alongside coding) helped me build visibility, trust, and alignment at work and eventually get promoted to senior much faster than others. You can check it out in my posts history if you are interested.One of the most common questions I got on that post was around how I developed my spoken communication skills because I think that is what a majority of engineers struggle with, so decided to make a separate post about it.For context, I have grown up very introverted and shy. Always have had trouble with clear spoken communication - I used to stutter, use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc, which really affected my confidence and made me want to stay quiet most of the times, even during meetings. I always used to think that this skill was reserved for extroverted people and naturals. Boy, was I wrongThis year I decided to do something about it. Since I was an introvert and used to be holed up in my apartment most of the time away from people, I used to spend an ungodly amount of time on Youtube lol. I noticed that some YouTubers that I had been following for a couple years, were just so charismatic, articulate, authentic and genuine but when I went back and saw some of their old videos, they were completely different - awkward, and ineloquent. Kind of made me realize that the fact that they had been making videos for so long, they have been training their speaking muscle over and over again, and over time got immensely good at it.This gave me the idea to try doing something similar. So I slowly started recording myself speaking to the phone camera. I wasn’t the most consistent with it but slowly overtime I slowly started seeing progress. I used to just talk / ramble about anything (my day, experiences etc) just to get comfortable and tried to keep speaking for at least 5 mins.I even started YouTube channels to keep myself accountable to keep practicing and slowly start following a structured pattern  - since at work, during meetings or presentations etc I wasn’t going to just talk about my day etc. I started off with having word for word scripted videos but that was making me come off as really inauthentic. But with consistent practice, overtime I became comfrotable enough to just riff off from the top of my head while having just 2-3 main points in front of me.This truly boosted my confidence more than I can put into words!This translated directly Into work as well because now I was able to talk a lot more fluently and eloquently, and with confidence + authority. I had fixed my issues - stuttering, losing track of thought, using filler words etc - almost by 80%+.***TL;DR*** Record yourself speaking daily (even just 5 minutes). It feels awkward at first, but it will transform how you communicate within a couple of months. Speaking really is a muscle.Thanks for reading this long post haha. Hope this helps anyone who’s struggled with speaking up!Happy to answer any questions in the comments or DMs :)",46,0.96,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mt09p0/hope_this_helps_you_improve_your_spoken/,2025-08-17 19:33:18,2025-08-23 01:27:48

I don't feel this is true, but I don't know much about it. He's applied to hundreds of jobs (full time positins) and multiple internships with no luck this far (even non CS jobs simply to get a job - he does have work experience). I know the market just sucks in general right now, but I'm hoping that some people have some advice they could give me to pass on to him as he continues looking. I've given him the ""keep applying, it will work out eventually"" spiel, but he's just now really depressed and feeling defeated. He's at the point of ""why finish? What's the point?"" Which is obviously very negative and emotionally driven, but I get the emotion. I just personally try not to linger in it, but he is not me, so. I would really appreciate any and all comments!

1mx4r5q,I suspect my manager is intentionally nitpicking PRs to make me unproductive?,cs_____question1031,cscareerquestions,"I had a task to make a button component in a shared library as part of a larger initiative. However, in this initiative, there was a ticket which was for making “design tokens”. I read through it, and it detailed we’d have design tokens for broad things like “primary color” and “accent color”. However, it also stated that individual components would have their own design tokens, so if it was a button, it might have “button primary color”. I brought this up to my manager, that I’m not sure if I should be working on the button because it seems dependent on this other ticket. I think there was a whole lot of misunderstandings, but she kinda seemed to get pretty hostile about itI guess I noticed that I really wasn’t getting anywhere with this conversation and everything I said seemed to make her even more angry. She threatened to put me on PIP at least once during this conversation, which I felt was unmerited, so I disengaged entirely and went to my previous manager. My previous manager is super chill so I was hoping we could just resolve it somehow. She set up a meeting with my skip. I just simply told him the exact situation, kinda in an emotionless, anodyne way. He seemed very receptive to it, surprisingly. He brought up that my manager had negative feedback about me “not following processes”, which we had a long conversation about, and he seemed much more “on my side” than I thought he would be. From my manager’s feedback, you’d think I’m doing everything wrong — but the skip was like “yeah it’s a new thing everyone is adjusting to. You’re fine”. I think this did get my manager in trouble, thoughI never did get an answer on the design tokens thing, but I was told to start work on the button. At first I made the button following the design tokens as the document stated, but I was told to remove this. No problem, AI was quickly able to resolve that. But then she started nitpicking pretty much every, insignificant detail. Mind you, this is really just a `` with some tailwind classes applied, with 100% unit test coverage. Specifically, she goes after the storybook (which is just a preview for the components), and constantly changes her mind there. “It should be like this” then I’ll submit it and she’ll be like “no I changed my mind make it like this”. They’re not things I would know as a developer, they’re just subjective preferences like “I want this story to be called (whatever) instead”. I find it all kinda odd, cause there are controls on storybook that let you change the preview. You can configure it to show whatever button you want using thoseI also have another ongoing PR for another component. Same thing here, she nitpicks it to death, especially the storybook. It feels like she always has a new thing to add or remove, which at some point just feels entirely unproductive, so I wonder why she’s doing it as my manager if it would reflect poorly on her. Like, even I think this is a waste of everyone’s time at this point, so I get suspiciousThen going back to the other one that originally used design tokens, she insists that I remove a css file that we would use for the design tokens in the future. This is a bit more complex than you’d think because it requires changing the build around and the exports in the package.json and I’m _pretty sure_ it might break tailwind when used in an app. I told her that I don’t think this is a good idea cause we’ll just have to revert it in the future, but she absolutely insists that we must do this. I actually feel kinda uncomfortable with it. I’m essentially making extra work for future me, for no gain and a potential bugAll this time I notice that she said I would have to ship this button this week _and_ replace all instances of the button in 3 apps. I still think she’s mad about the meeting with the skip manager we had. I really don’t wanna go to him again, but I’m concerned that she’s just trying to justify letting me go by making it impossible for me to get my work done.

1mvwc1o,"12 years at the same company, how do I get out of here?",Sysson,cscareerquestions,"I’ve spent the last 12 years as a developer in a Fortune 500 manufacturing company. I started in college studying IT/cybersecurity and took a short graphic design side gig—but a VBA script I wrote to automate reporting turned me into “the tech guy”. Since then, the company has tripled in size, and I’ve built and maintained a wide variety of internal tools: PLM apps, dashboards, automation systems, integrations, and even a 3D packing tool (Three.js/r3f). I taught myself React/Node, cloud, data engineering, and DevOps. Aside from a few college courses, everything is self-taught and \~90% custom.The catch: I’ve always been completely isolated. No peers, code reviews, or mentors. I report outside the tech org and handle all development myself. My day-to-day includes supporting \~100 users, gathering pain points, designing features, and doing analytics and reporting, since we don’t have a dedicated data person. It’s demanding—at one point I even debugged production code on a cruise ship in the Atlantic.I'm underpaid and I want out. What really broke the camel's back was when I took on the 3D packing tool, the agreement was that I'd have hires to help. That was 9 months ago, and it's still just me. I’ve reached a point where I want a team environment, collaboration exposure, and a role that still fits my skills; product engineer, full stack, or technical PM. (I'm an ""Application Project Manager"" by Title). My questions:* How do I translate 12 years of solo experience into interview answers for a team environment?* How do I close the gaps in collaboration and code review experience?* Which roles make the most sense given my mix of business-facing and technical work?Recent example: I interviewed for a Support Engineer role last week, made it to round two, and the feedback was: *“You’re very technical, but we need explicit support experience.”* It made me realize I need guidance on positioning and interviewing for traditional tech roles. I don't have any Engineering or Dev friends. Lot of tech peers and friends in PM and Data, but no one to really ask for close advice. **TL;DR:** 12 years as a lone dev in a non-tech Fortune 500 (Excel → PHP/jQuery → React/Node/Three.js). Built critical internal tools solo. Looking to move into a team-based tech role—how should I position myself, fill collaboration gaps, and navigate interviews? Anyone else have a story like this?

1mrii9d,I think I actually am an imposter. What can I do?,A3kus,cscareerquestions,"I've spent a large part of my ""career,"" doing passable work on existing projects. I was hired at my current position without a relevant degree and the world's tiniest amount of existing work. I've been in a position for five years. The entire time, I vacillated between feeling like I could do anything, and feeling like I was lucky to accomplish what I'd set out to accomplish. I've always cognitively known that I wasn't as good as a trained professional, but I think I started to lose sight of what that actually meant as time went on. Add to that the fact that there's simply so much I don't know that I don't know. Ultimately, I think I've probably been blissfully ignorant. I used to think that if I spent enough time iterating, I could figure most things out. I've frequented tutorials, articles and the messing around and finding out I used to do back when I felt I had more time. I've also been leaning hard on AI to learn new tricks.I've got a few certifications, but I strongly suspect that's because I'm good at testing and preparing to test -- not because I know the content the certifications really ask for. It's always felt like there was a lot of knowledge that ""real,"" professionals just knew; that the certs assumed. I think a few superiors of mine have been sort of covering for me? I'm not sure. But I know I've given them a front row seat to my ignorance and I've seen how they've worked around it. I don't have those supports anymore. It's led to problems -- poor, inflexible designs when I could do things, and code built on what I could accomplish, not the best tools for the job, when I couldn't. Right now, I'm in a position where I have several complex problems on my plate including buggy systems that I've written and all I know is that if I'm lucky enough to solve any of them -- they'll probably be hacked together. I'm aware at the highest possible level of techniques and practices that would help, but I've never implemented them before, and I won't be able to just ""figure things out."" anymore. My job thinks I'm somewhere between mid and senior level, and I just... Am not. My ego has been all over the place and I think I've been projecting like I was better than I was without being 100% aware of it. I'm at the point where I'd quit, if I could. I don't want to be a hinderance; I'm worried that my coworkers are depending on me, and I'm so burned out from doing everything I can to get by (short of like.... Actually having spent my years of work formally learning) that I can't even be useful in the ways that would ordinarily be expected of me. TLDR; I'm pretty sure I've been the worst example of a bad, ""hotshot"" dev.Where can I go from here? I've been thinking that I've got to let someone know that I'm out of my depth.

1mx85td,"[16] Is my much older remote colleague's (40s M) intense praise and personal interest normal, or are these red flags?",omunaman,cscareerquestions,"Hi Reddit, I need some outside perspective on a situation at my remote project that's making me extremely uncomfortable.I'm 16 and working on a tech/coding project with people from all over the world. One of my collaborators is a much older man (I think 40s) from another country(japan).How it started: Initially, everything was great and super professional. We communicated on Discord. He would compliment my work, like ""Good job on that template,"" which felt nice and motivating. He was very polite about scheduling meetings across our different time zones.**When things started to feel weird:** After a few days, he learned my age during a call. After that, the dynamic slowly started to change.1. He suggested we move our conversation from the public Discord to WhatsApp and shared his personal number.2. His compliments started shifting from my work to me as a person.3. He found out I was interested in some media from his country (like anime/manga) and offered to teach me his language one-on-one.4. He started talking about me potentially working in his country in the future and asked if I was interested.**The part that is freaking me out now:** Last night, the conversation escalated quickly. I asked for his LinkedIn to learn more about his professional background. He sent it, then immediately followed up by saying if I ever came to his country, he would ""show me around.""Then he sent these messages back-to-back: ""You are such a kind person."" ""You are a genius."" ""I'm serious.""This is where my internal alarms went off like crazy. It felt like a switch flipped from ""polite colleague"" to something intense and personal. It feels like he's trying to build some kind of deep emotional bond, and the ""I'm serious"" part felt like he was pressuring me to accept the compliments.**My question for you:** Am I overreacting? Is this just a case of ""super politeness"" from a different culture, or is this classic grooming/love-bombing behavior? My gut is screaming that this is wrong, but my logical brain keeps trying to find excuses like ""maybe he's just being nice.""What do you think is happening here, and more importantly, what is the safest and most professional way to handle this and create distance?**TL;DR:** I'm 16, my much older male colleague moved our chat to WhatsApp, and his praise has escalated to ""you're a genius, I'm serious"" after inviting me to visit him in his country. I feel creeped out and don't know if I'm misreading politeness or if this is predatory.

1msz953,Performance Dip from bad management and from life. Drowning. Not sure how to address.,GenuineClamhat,cscareerquestions,"Hey. A decade into a niche area of tech. I was an all star for the first few years, company was purchased, management changed and our roles have been changing. The last year my role has changed to something that looks nothing like my skillset and certainly not my area of talent. I was given the chat of ""We don't have enough work anymore in what you do, so you have to expand to stay relevant."" Fair, ok.Trouble is, I was immediately thrown into accelerated deadlines with no training. PMs recently were given more power due to trying to fix financial issues in the company. Basically, we charge clients a few lump sums of work and don't technically have billable hours. We track billable hours internally just to make sure things are still profitable. I got throw onto not one but two projects in which either the client misinterpreted the work and a non-technical person put together the contract which led to a loss. Or, the PMs made promises that couldn't be kept and tried to be technical and then tried to cover by forcing terrible deadlines (asking for 6 weeks of work in 4 days sort of nonsense).I've been getting whiplash and it's effected me negatively. Upper management doesn't like how to push back on timelines while at the same time stating that engineers tell the PMs what a reasonable timeline is and then reneg and support impossible goals. I keep asking for time to work on some training so I can do the new work, ask questions and actually make it my skillset (no, I can't do it in me free time, this is not a skillset that can be googled, it's purely mentored skills only, thing post-quantum crypto analysis activities in alignment with niche security standards in specific nations).I have been compensating for this lack of time being given on projects or training by working weekends...the last four. I've been 1-2 days behind on all my tasks even with long days and working weekends. I'm doing my best when management won't listen to me.Friday I saw the lab director looking at my work, he voiced he was upset I said work was done by 5PM when he found gaps. Our lead wasn't going to look at it until Monday, and I am spending the weekend making up the GAPs.They taught me that asking for the extra time was pushed back on. That the works ""should get done during the week"" while also ""recognizing the time constraints are a challenge."" I cannot win. I figure it's better to ask for forgiveness then permission. I am giving of myself.But my direct manager basically gave me a heads up that upper management is pissed and reactive right now. I have four deadlines next week on three other projects and I got scheduled for 5 hours of meetings with ominous titles. I am working on an exit strategy but am in the ""hurry up and wait"" for a clearance related job. There are four labs in the world that do what we do: none are hiring right now. This is a VERY niche area of tech.Trying to keep calm, work up a game plan. I'm biding my time until I leave. I hate that I have to have the conversation again of, ""I am compensating the best I can for poor timelines, but you're still getting quality of work. You won't OK more work days, get offended when I honestly log my hours for weekends, I'm salaried, you don't pay me more for it. You tell me engineers determine timelines, but allow the PMs to reject and reset them. Everyone is so overworked that no mentoring is available and we're getting more and more work outside of our individual scopes because you fired 70% of the lab in January. Please give me a clear and consistent response on what you need me to do, and I'll do it.""Objectively I am just in the time period of despair for some companies where management is failing hard and good workers can't compensate for their own ignorance and inconsistencies anymore. But I'm struggling. I have some real life things going on too, two deaths in the family in the last month, suing my insurance, husband had surgery, trying to squeak out some joy for myself...but I'm just drowning. I've been using my PTO liberally but it's going towards errands, those life things, and I even used a few to ""catch up on work without anyone talking to me."" I know, terrible use.I would love some insight or emotional support.

1msqr9u,Completing work that I wouldn't been able to complete without AI,Gonjanaenae319,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, this isn't ""career"" related question but something I've been experiencing recently. I'll give more concrete example for this case.I'm an L1 engineer with just under 2 YOE and my team recently started develping OpenAPI for our product. It's essentially an AWS API Gateway layer that will just redirect any incoming request to our internal endpoints with some middlewares such as authentiacation lambda and proxy for request and response transformation through VTL. Nothing too technically complicated.I realised that our team had to constantly deploy any changes made to endpoints to test them and this was delaying the development process significantly as we all had to wait 20 to 30 minutes for the whole application to test a minor change. So I started looking into testing this locally, and came across different ways such as using LocalStack or SAM Cli local and eventually settled on sam cli. I'm still not familiar with AWS and how these infrastructures work fully so I heavily relied on AI to explain to me how I can incorporate this into our existing system and get it eventually working. It ended up analysing the whole cdk and right up the entire mock auth and proxy system and start up a sam cli local server through docker. It didn't take me too long to understand what it has implemented and purpose behind it, although I knew that if I were to implement this on my own without AI, it would've taken a significant amount of time that it probably wouldn't have been worth keep digging and focus more on actual release of endpoints.It was definitely good learning experience and I feel like I learnt something quite useful and interesting but it also feels discouraging in some way that I would've not been able to deliver this in such short amount of time without AI as I basically did no coding in this context.I was wondering if I should take a different course of action in learning and developing something I have virtually no experience and knowledge in to actually learn it properly.",14,0.77,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1msqr9u/completing_work_that_i_wouldnt_been_able_to/,2025-08-17 13:20:27,2025-08-23 01:27:48

1mu5fks,Late career: Planning my final years & offramp,Repulsive_List_5639,cscareerquestions,"BLUF: I'm 45, MS & BS in CS and in technical management at a national lab. I came here because I was sick of industry, venture capital, layoffs, etc. The lab's comp and benefits package was enough for me to say fuqqit to private industry's higher comps and volatility. I also noticed the workforce skewed older, and surmised less ageism in the tech roles here. Glad to say I've been right so far. Finally, in the back of my mind I always wished I had earned a PhD so that I could be an expert in something. Doesn't mean I wanted to do pure research per-say, but just to have developed depth. The lab is supportive of that - extra time off, free grad school, connections, etc. Since I'm just over halfway through my career I've really started to map out my off ramp. The math says I can probably retire in 10 years (age 55) if I stay, thanks to a great 401K match and a small windfall I got earlier this year. There is also a tuition benefit for my kids: half off in-state if my kids qualify academically. Since I have 4, that's going to help a lot :). To make it work though, I feel a strong need to do one last push with my education and personal development, and that is where I could use some perspective from other late career folks in tech. Some paths open before me are:\- Project & Program Management. In addition to my tech management role, I manage a \~$16M contract (finances, staffing, direction, etc). I've thought I should just get a PMP so I can check the box and have some more options. (P.S. I feel like its fine to be ""older"" in these kind of management roles).\- Go for a PhD in CS with an AI focus. The lab has plenty of academic affiliations where I could seriously pursue this part-time. It would take a while, but I'd still feel good about it as a life goal. Then maybe I can teach at the community college nearby. My MS was relatively recent (5 years ago) with an AI/ML focus and straight As. I can do well academically when I put my mind to it. \- Get an MS/Dr. Eng in Systems Engineering so I can broaden the projects I work on. I've always been the guy who could extract requirements, model different approaches, build schedules, budgets, etc. I wrote plenty of code - but also raised my hand to do all the other stuff because I like variety. Probably why I'm doing some project management now.\- A wilder option is a (slow) pivot into computational physics, since we do tons of computational modeling and simulation for all sorts of scenarios that might arise in the defense of our nation. That just might mean an Applied Physics MS to start, but I could see going all the way with a PhD (probably earned at 60 though :) ). Intellectually, this grabs me the most because it would probably stretch me the most - I love learning - and get me into some really cool work.I haven't done exhaustive pros/cons to these and thats probably my next step. I'd still like some outside perspective from later career folks in CS who have maybe walked some of these paths and could provide an opinion. I'm wrestling with the feeling that this would be my last big career development goal, and I need to pick the ""right"" one.",11,0.93,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mu5fks/late_career_planning_my_final_years_offramp/,2025-08-19 01:53:32,2025-08-23 01:27:48

I live in Canada but work on remote team with my peers all over the world. I’ve been given an opportunity for a higher position but it would require me to move to the US and the company will sponsor me and take care of moving costs etc.My unique situation is I live close to the border and my office in the US is about 1.5 hr drive each way. My family does not really want to move to the US and I don’t want to leave them full time either. I was thinking of renting an apartment 30 min or so across the border and just staying the 3-4 days a week and spending the rest of the week at home in Canada. I could literally only do 1 day in the US per week if I wanted because we have a lax RTO policy. Is this doable? How many days a year do I need to say in the US to fulfill the visa terms etc?In terms of cost, based on the pay raise, the bump in us salary and just overall extra benefits working in the US I’d still come out 20-30% ahead after paying for an apartment etc (low cost of living in this area). Also it would be a huge jump in my career and would allow me to move up multiple salary bands much faster compared to staying in Canada. It would also allow my partner to be a stay at home parent which they’ve wanted to do for years now.",5,0.73,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mwsedy/working_in_the_us_as_a_canadian/,2025-08-22 00:45:12,2025-08-23 01:27:48

1mvu7mf,What should I do about my companies RTO policy?,TacoFett418,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, I've been hitting a wall with how to proceed with my career and just looking for some advice or some words of wisdom. I've gotten a good position that I've held for the past 4 years but now fear that I am stuck. I work for a relatively large company making a total comp that makes me feel the 'Golden Handcuffs' feeling. Here's where the problem comes though, recently the company has made a shift to non-remote, now I wasn't originally remote but they closed the office that I could commute to. Therefore I will need to move to San Francisco by Jan 1 in order to keep my current job. If I move I will get an 11% bump in pay which will not cover the jump in living expenses but I'd still be comfortable. However, I have not enjoyed the job and constantly feel like I'm not performing at the level they expect (despite getting positive reviews, this might just be my imposter syndrome but it's killing my quality of life). So I'll just find a new job no big deal right? Wrong, I have been met with countless no's and poor interview experiences. I fear that I have gotten to deep into how this company builds things and have lost sight on how to be marketable in the job force. For those who are still reading and are interested, I am an android developer but haven't gotten much industry experience with Jetpack Compose. Lately I've been doing more low level sensors related work (Bluetooth, location, accelerometer). But even that work is kind of built on the backs of previous team members. I feel like I haven't been really able to truly build something myself and don't even really enjoy the work per-say. Is it time to move to another domain? How would I even do that? I'd like to get out of mobile and maybe pursue something more java backend like or a Go type of role but not really sure how to start that or even what tech stack to use.For those of you who think I should just take the offer and move to San Francisco my concern is more than just the fact that I don't really enjoy the work I also have a partner who has a job she enjoys in the town that we live in... So my dilemma is why would I move half way across the country for a job I don't enjoy, rip her from a job she enjoys... for money? We will be married soon and probably trying for kids... do I want my nights that should be the happiest of my life to be stressed by this job I kind of hate? If I do make a job move how do I deal with all the rejection? How do I make myself better? I have a enterprise Udemy account in which I can seem to enroll in any class but even the motivation behind that feels low. Should I be focusing on Android classes to improve my current skill set or working on a whole new one? Will I even be able to get a job in this new domain with just some personal projects?Perhaps this is more of a rant than anything, maybe I just needed to get this out of my system and out into the internet but I've just been a little depressed about all this lately and feeling very unsure of my future. FWIW anyone who thinks I should be talking to someone about this I am utilizing therapy to try and get out of this funk but it just feels like anyone I talk to doesn't understand the tech side of things and just says I'll be ok, I must be smart if they hired me and haven't PIP'd me yet... Which just feels empty coming from people who don't understand the field.",5,0.86,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mvu7mf/what_should_i_do_about_my_companies_rto_policy/,2025-08-20 22:59:17,2025-08-23 01:27:48

The first phase was an online assessment with questions about the programming language itself (typescript and node) and a fairly standard programming puzzle (though hard).

That's also where my passion actually lies. However, I still took the devops offer because with the way the job market is, I just didn't want to risk anything (it was my only offer amongst many rejections, even to the more relevant roles to my resume). I've been passively applying here and there, tailoring my CV and doing side projects for data analytics and no luck. There are rarely any entry level jobs, yet somehow many internships (which are aimed at students, and I wouldn't actually be able to support myself with anyways)I'm still not finding the joy in devops almost a year in but now I'm starting to consider just sucking it up, going all in and focus all my efforts in becoming a great devops engineer (courses & certifications). My question is, do you think a career switch later down the line would be possible, and if so how can I work towards that?

I have been working at the company for around 2 years now and accepted a low ball offer at the start to get myself into the field.I had no prior experience and I'm self taught so no degree.I accepted 39k to start with and have asked at the beginning of this year for a raise, I was told to reach certain goals that would push me closer to a mid Level from junior ( but I'm still within what the company has down as junior). I have taken on larger projects and I'm working a lot more and on much more complex tasks, leading small parts of the app.Today my team lead called me in for a meeting without telling me what it was about. It was a raise. I will be getting 1.5k extra a year. So about 3.7%. I never negotiated this raise, it was fine by my team lead for me with the manager of the mobile department.This doesn't cover inflation over the last two years and I can't see myself getting another raise until I hit mid level, which I think would be coming in 2027 as a minimum. The company also has new rules about raises in that, this year they need to be agreed upon before September and as of next year before June. So I'm waiting probably 1.5/2.5 years now for the next raise.I feel offended by such a small number especially as the average salary for a junior android dev in Berlin is closer to 45k.We do however, get a bonus at the end of each year ( although it's not guaranteed that we will get it every year, and people seem to be questioning if we will get it this year or not) that caps out at 4k. After two years you get the full amount, so there is a chance I get this in December bringing me closer to 45, but I don't know if the bonus should count or not.Should I try to ask for a higher raise, what sort of number or percentage is even reasonable?Update: I've written to my team lead and asked to speak to him and the boss together to see if we can sort something out.
