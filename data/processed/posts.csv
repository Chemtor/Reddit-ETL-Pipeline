1l9y4pf,AI is literally coming for you job,iknewaguytwice,dataengineering,"We are hiring for a data engineering position, and I am responsible for the technical portion of the screening process. It’s pretty basic verbal stuff, explain the different sql joins, explain CTEs, explain Python function vs generator, followed by some very easy functional programming in python and some spark. Anyway — back to my story. I hop onto the meeting and introduce myself and ask some warm up questions about their background, etc. Immediately I notice this person’s head moves a LOT when they talk. And it moves in this… odd kind of way… and it does the same kind of movement over and over again. Odd, but I keep going. At one point this… agent…. Talks for about 2 min straight without taking a single breath or even sounding short of breath, which was incredibly jarring. Then we get into the actual technical exercise. I ask them to find a small bug in some python code that is just making a very simple API call. It’s a small syntax error, very basic, easy to miss but running the script and reading the error message spells it out for you. This agent starts explaining that the defect is due to a failure to authenticate with this api endpoint, which is not true at all. But the agent starts going into GREAT detail on how rest authentication works using oAuth tokens (which it wasn’t even using), and how that is the issue. Without even trying to run it. So I ask “interesting can you walk me through the code and explain how you identified that as the issue?” And it just repeats everything it just said a minute ago. I ask it again to try and explain the code to me and to fix the code. It starts saying the same thing a third time, then it drops entirely from the call. So I spent about 30 minutes today talking to someone’s scammer AI agent who somehow got their way past the basic HR screening. This is the world we are living in. This is not an advertisement for a position, please don’t ask me about the position, the intent of this post is just to share this experience with other professionals and raise some awareness to be careful with these interviews. If you contact me about this position, I promise I will just delete the message. Sorry.

But in many cases, the data volume isn’t that big, and the complexity doesn’t seem to justify all the overhead.There are now tools like DuckDB, Polars, and even pandas (with proper tuning) that can process hundreds of millions of rows in-memory on a single machine. They’re fast, simple to set up, and often much cheaper. Yet Spark remains the go-to option for a lot of teams, maybe just because “it scales” or because everyone’s already using it.So I’m wondering:•How big does your data actually need to be before Spark makes sense?•What should I really be asking myself before reaching for distributed processing?",109,0.98,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lbfcwa/when_does_spark_actually_make_sense/,2025-06-14 18:21:08,2025-06-15 01:52:58

I really enjoy the day-to-day work, but the big-business driven nature bothers me. The field is heavily geared towards business objectives, with the primary goal being to enhance stakeholder profitibility. This is amplified by how much investment is funelled to the cloud monopolies.I'd to like my job to have a positive societal impact. Perhaps in one of these areas (though im open to other ideas)?- science/discovery- renewable sector- social mobilityMy aproach so far has been: get as good as possible. That way, organisations that you'd want to work for, will want you to work for them. But, it would be better if i could focus my efforts.

1l7rd43,How do you deal with working on a team that doesn't care about quality or best practices?,analytical_dream,dataengineering,"I'm somewhat struggling right now and I could use some advice or stories from anyone who's been in a similar spot.I work on a data team at a company that doesn't really value standardization or process improvement. We just recently started using GIT for our SQL development and while the team is technically adapting to it, they're not really embracing it. There's a strong resistance to anything that might be seen as ""overhead"" like data orchestration, basic testing, good modelling, single definitions for business logic, etc. Things like QA or proper reviews are not treated with much importance because the priority is speed, even though it's very obvious that our output as a team is often chaotic (and we end up in many ""emergency data request"" situations).The problem is that the work we produce is often rushed and full of issues. We frequently ship dashboards or models that contain errors and don't scale. There's no real documentation or data lineage. And when things break, the fixes are usually quick patches rather than root cause fixes.It's been wearing on me a little. I care a lot about doing things properly. I want to build things that are scalable, maintainable, and accurate. But I feel like I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle and I'm starting to burn out from caring too much when no one else seems to.If you've ever been in a situation like this, how did you handle it?

1lb13ep,Rendering 100 million rows at 120hz,Impressive_Run8512,dataengineering,"Hi !I know this isn't a UI subreddit, but wanted to share something here.I've been working in the data space for the past 7 years and have been extremely frustrated by the lack of good UI/UX. lots of stuff is purely programatic, super static, slow, etc. Probably some of the worst UI suites out there.I've been working on an interface to work with data interactively, with as little latency as possible. To make it ***feel*** instant.We accidentally built an insanely fast rendering mechanism for large tables. I found it to be so fast that I was curious to see how much I could throw at it...So I shoved in 100 million rows (and 16 columns) of test data...The results... well... even surprised me...[100 million rows preview](https://reddit.com/link/1lb13ep/video/yeivgrn7wt6f1/player)*This is a development build, which is not available yet, but wanted show here first...*Once the data loaded (which did take some time) the scrolling performance was buttery smooth. My MacBook's display is 120hz and you cannot feel any slowdown. No lag, super smooth scrolling, and instant calculations if you add a custom column.For those curious, the main thread latency for operations like deleting a column, or reordering were between **120µs-300µs**. So that means you hit the keyboard, and it's done. No waiting. Of course this is not for *every* operation, but for the common ones, it's extremely fast.Getting results for custom columns were **<30ms**, no matter where you were in the table. Any latency you see via ### is just a UI choice we made but will probably change it (it's kinda ugly). ***How did we do this?***This technique uses a combination of lazy loading, minimal memory copying, value caching, and GPU accelerated rendering of the cells. Plus some very special sauce I frankly don't want to share ;) To be clear, **this was not easy.**We also set out to ensure that we hit a roundtrip time of <33ms UI updates per distinct user action (other than scrolling). This is the threshold for feeling instant.We explicitly avoided the use of Javascript and other web technologies, because frankly they're entirely incapable of performance like this.***Could we do more?****Actually, yes.* I have some ideas to make the initial load time even faster, but still experimenting. ***Okay, but is looking at 100 million rows actually useful?***For a 100 million rows, honestly, probably not. But who knows ? I know that for smaller datasets, in 10s of millions, I've wanted the ability to look through all the rows to copy certain values, etc.In this case, it's kind of just a side-effect of a really well-built rendering architecture ;)If you wanted, and you had a really beefy computer, I'm sure you could do 500 million or more with the same performance.

I got laid off last week and, while still processing that, two new paths have opened up. One’s predictable. The other’s risky but potentially career-changing.Option 1: Potential CTO role at a trading startup• Small early-stage team (2–3 engineers) building a medium-frequency trading platform for the Indian market (mainly F&O)• A close friend is involved and referred me to manage the technical side, they see me as a strong CTO candidate if things go well• Solid funding in place; runway isn’t a concern right now• Stack is MERN, which I’ve never worked with! I’d need to learn it from the ground up• They’re willing to fully support my ramp-up• 2–3 year commitment expected• Compensation is roughly equal to what I was earning beforeOption 2: Data Engineering role with a previous client• Work involves building a data platform on GCP• Very much in my comfort zone; I’ve done this kind of work for years• Slight pay bump• Feels safe, but also a bit stagnant—low learning, low riskWhat’s tearing me up:• The CTO role would push me outside my comfort zone and force me to become a more well-rounded engineer and leader• My Solutions Engineering background makes me confident I can bridge tech and business, which the CTO role demands• But stepping away from 7 years of focused data engineering experience—am I killing my momentum?• What if the startup fails? Will a 2–3 year detour make it harder to re-enter the data space?• The safe choice is obvious—but the risk could also pay off big, in terms of growth and leadership experiencePersonal context:• I don’t have major financial obligations right now—so if I ever wanted to take a risk, now’s probably the time• My friend vouched for me hard and believes I can do this. If I accept, I’d want to commit fully for at least a couple of yearsQuestions for you all:• Has anyone made a similar pivot from a focused engineering specialty (like data) to a full-stack or leadership role?• If so, how did it impact your career long-term? Any regrets?• Did you find it hard to return to your original path, or was the leadership experience a net positive?• Or am I overthinking this entirely?Thanks for reading this long post—honestly just needed to write it out.

I’m a master’s student, and I just wrapped up my big data analytics project where I tried to solve a problem I personally care about as a gamer: **how can indie devs make sense of hundreds of thousands of Steam reviews?**Most tools either don’t scale or aren’t designed with real-time insights in mind. So I built something myself — a **distributed review analysis pipeline** using Dask, PyTorch, and transformer-based NLP models.**The Setup:*** **Data:** 17M+ Steam reviews (\~40GB uncompressed), scraped using the Steam API* **Hardware:** Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB RAM, RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM)* **Goal:** Process massive review datasets quickly and summarize key insights (sentiment + summarization)**Engineering Challenges (and Lessons):**1. **Transformer Parallelism Pain:** Initially, each Dask worker loaded its own model — ballooned memory use 6x. Fixed it by loading the model once and passing handles to workers. GPU usage dropped drastically.2. **CUDA + Serialization Hell:** Trying to serialize CUDA tensors between workers triggered crashes. Eventually settled on keeping all GPU operations in-place with smart data partitioning + local inference.3. **Auto-Hardware Adaptation:** The system detects hardware and: * Spawns optimal number of workers * Adjusts batch sizes based on RAM/VRAM * Falls back to CPU with smaller batches (16 samples) if no GPU4. **From 30min to 2min:** For 200K reviews, the pipeline used to take over 30 minutes — now it's down to \~2 minutes. 15x speedup.**Dask Architecture Highlights:*** Dynamic worker spawning* Shared model access* Fault-tolerant processing* Smart batching and cleanup between tasks**What I’d Love Advice On:*** Is this architecture sound from a data engineering perspective?* Should I focus on scaling up to **multi-node** (Kubernetes, Ray, etc.) or polishing what I have?* Any strategies for **multi-GPU optimization** and memory handling?* Worth refactoring for **stream-based (real-time) review ingestion**?* Are there common pitfalls I’m not seeing?**Potential Applications Beyond Gaming:*** App Store reviews* Amazon product sentiment* Customer feedback for SaaS tools:link: **GitHub repo**: [https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens](https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens)I've uploaded the data I scrapped on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshgharat/steam-games-data-40-gb) if anyone want to use it Happy to take any suggestions — would love to hear thoughts from folks who've built distributed ML or analytics systems at scale!Thanks in advance :folded_hands:",28,0.98,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l8s81o/built_a_distributed_transformer_pipeline_for_17m/,2025-06-11 13:07:36,2025-06-15 01:52:58

1l6yk2v,Advice for a clueless soul,AdditionMiserable161,dataengineering,TLDR: how do I run ~25 scripts that must be run on my local company server instance but allow for tracking through an easy UI since prefect hobby tier (free) only allows server-less executions. Hello everyone! I was looking around this Reddit and thought it would be a good place to ask for some advice. Long story short I am a dashboard-developer who also for some reason does programming/pipelines for our scripts that run only on schedule (no events). I don’t have any prior background on data engineering but on our 3 man team I’m the one with the most experience in Python. We had been using Prefect which was going well before they moved to a paid model to use our own compute. Previously I had about 25 scripts that would launch at different times to my worker on our company server using prefect. It sadly has to be on my local instance of our server since they rely on something called Alteryx which our two data analysts use basically exclusively. I liked prefects UI but not the 100$ a month price tag. I don’t really have the bandwidth or good-will credits with our IT to advocate for the self-hosted version. I’ve been thinking of ways to mimic what we had before but I’m at a loss. I don’t know how to have something ‘talk’ to my local like prefect was when the worker was live. I could set up windows task scheduler but tbh when I first started I inherited a bunch of them and hated the transfer process/setup. My boss would also like to be able to see the ‘failures’ if any happen. We have things like bitbucket/s3/snowflake that we use to host code/data/files but basically always pull them down to our local/ inside Alteryx.

1l8w0wd,Advice on best OSS data ingestion tool,digEmAll,dataengineering,"Hi all, I'm looking for recommendations about data ingestion tools.We're currently using pentaho data integration for both ingestion and ETL into a Vertica DWH, and we'd like to move to something more flexible and possibly not low-code, but still OSS. Our goal would be to re-write the entire ETL pipeline (*), turning into a ELT with the T handled by dbt. For the 95% of the times we ingest data from MSSQL db (the other 5% from postgres or oracle). Searching this sub-reddit I found two interesting candidates in airbyte and singer, but these are the pros and cons that I understood: - airbyte: pros: support basically any input/output, incremental loading, easy-to-use cons: no-code, difficult to do versioning in git - singer: pros: python, very flexible, incremental loading, easy versioning in git cons: AFAIK does not support MSSQL ? Our source DBs are not very big, normally under 50GB, with a couple of exception >200-300GB, but we would like to have an easy way to do incremental loading. Do you have any suggestion?

1lbi0re,Roast my project: I created a data pipeline which matches all the rock climbing locations in England with hourly 7 day weather forecast. This is the backend,godz_ares,dataengineering,"Hey all,[https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase](https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase)I was wondering if anyone had any feedback and any recommendations to improve my code. I was especially wondering whether a DuckDB database was the right way to go. I am still learning and developing my understanding of ETL concepts. There's an explanation below but feel free to ignore if you don't want to read too much. **Explanation:**My project's goal is to allow rock climbers to better plan their outdoor climbing sessions based on which locations have the best weather (e.g. no precipitation, not too cold etc.).Currently I have the ETL pipeline sorted out.The rock climbing location Dataframe contains data such as the name of the location, the name of the routes, the difficulty of the routes as well as the safety grade where relevant. It also contains the type of rock (if known) and the type of climb.This data was scraped by a Redditor I met called u/AmbitiousTie, who gave a helping hand by scraping UKC, a very famous rock climbing website. I can't claim credit for this. I wrote some code to normalize and clean the Dataframe. Some changes I made was dropping some columns, changing the datatypes, removing nulls etc. Each row pertains to a singular route. With over 120,000 rows of data.I used the longitude and latitude of my climbing Dataframe as an argument for my Weather API call. I used OpenMeteo free tier API as it is extremely generous. Currently, the code only fetches weather data for only 50 climbing locations. But when the API is called without this limitation it has over 710,000 rows of data. While this does take a long time but I can use pagination on my endpoint to only call the weather data for the locations that is currently being seeing by the user at a single time..I used Great-Expectations to validate both Dataframe at both a schema, row and column level. I loaded both Dataframe into an in-memory DuckDB database, following the schema seen below (but without the dimDateTime table). Credit to u/No-Adhesiveness-6921 for recommending this schema. I used DuckDB because it was the easiest to use - I tried setting up a PostgreSQL database but ended up with errors and got frustrated.https://preview.redd.it/vkb85ebk7y6f1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f13454a40df069957a5aaec7b2df111830c316I used Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline. The pipeline is run every day at 1AM to ensure the weather data is up to data. Currently the DAG involves one instance which encapsulates the entire ETL pipeline. However, I plan to modularize my DAGs in the future. I am just finding it hard to find a way to process Dataframe from one instance to another.Docker was used for virtualisation to get the Airflow to run.https://preview.redd.it/7rpquq7c8y6f1.png?width=1351&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3720d0188006c25aabbf9931956bb63cf98637I also used pytest for both unit testing and features testing.**Next Steps:**I am planning on increasing the size of my climbing data. Maybe all the climbing locations in Europe, then the world. This will probably require Spark and some threading as well. I also want to create an endpoint and I am planning on learning FastAPI to do this but others have recommended Flask or Django**Challenges:**Docker - Docker is a pain in the ass to setup and is as close to black magic as I have come in my short coding journey.Great Expectations - I do not like this package. While flexible and having a great library of expectations, is is extremely cumbersome. I have to add expectations to a suite one by one. This will be a bottleneck in the future for sure. Also getting your data setup to be validated is convoluted. It also didn't play well with Airflow. I couldn't get the validation operator to work due to an import error. I also couldn't get data docs to work either. As a result I had to integrate validations directly into my ETL code and the user is forced to scour the .json file to find why a certain validation failed.

1l820qc,Patterns of Master Data (Dimension) Reconciliation,PencilBoy99,dataengineering,"Issue: you want to increase the value of the data stored, where the data comes from disparate sources, by integrating it (how does X compare to Y) but the systems have inconsistent Master Data / Dimension DataCan anyone point to a text, Udemy course, etc. that goes into detail surrounding these issues? Particularly when you don't have a mandate to implement a top-down master data management approach?Off the top of my head the solutions I've read are:1. Implement a top-down master data management approach. This authorizes you to compel the owners of the source data stores to conform their master data to some standard (e.g., everyone must conform to System X regarding the list of Departments)2. Implement some kind of mdm tool, which imports data from multiple systems, creates a ""master"" record based on the different sources, and serves as either a cross reference or updates the source system. Often used for things like customers. I would assume now MDM tools include some sort of LLM/Machine Learning to make better deicisions.3. within the data warehouse store build cross references as you detect anomalies (e.g, system X adds department ""Shops"" - there is no department ""Shops"", so you temporarily give this a unknown dimension entry, then later when you figure out that ""Shops"" is department 12345 add a cross reference and on the next pass its reassigned to 12345.4. force child systems to at least incorporate the ""owning"" systems unique identifier as a field (e.g, if you have departments then one of your fields must be the department id from System X which owns departments). then in the warehouse each of these rows ties to a different dimension, but since one of the columns is always the System X department ID, users can filter on that.Are there other design patterns I'm missing?",10,0.87,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l820qc/patterns_of_master_data_dimension_reconciliation/,2025-06-10 15:41:53,2025-06-15 01:52:58

Unfortunately, it seems like each engine can only adhere to access controls using its own primitives (eg. roles, privileges, tags, masks, etc). For example, as we understand the state of these tools, applying a policy in DB UC to a table in the Glue foreign catalog, will not enforce those permissions for Snowflake, when it attempts to query the table as a Snowflake external iceberg table.Has anyone succeeded in centralizing these permissions and possibly syncing them from abstracts into each engine's security primitives?

Some tasks are depend on others so we can fill dependency trees. But not just one, as there are subsets of tasks that do not depend on any other subsets of tasks. So those subsets can run parallel (as without dependency connection they can be started immediately by the platform).I work in Databricks, which does not allow limiting the number of in-progress tasks at once. If there are too many in-progress tasks, the driver node may receive too large workload and crash.1. Upscale driver: I do not need this, I could wait for normal, slower, cheaper run.2. Add a normal dependency from the end of A subtree to the beginning of B subtree. This way I can limit the number of in-progress tasks, but if something in A fails, B will not start. Also it messes up lineage reporting.3. Same as #2 but the dependency type is All Done. The problem is that if something in A fails, B is started and if it finishes successfully, the pipeline hides the error from A.4. Create ""dummy tasks"" as checkpoints, connect 10 tasks to the first, checkpoint, connect another 10 ... This would kill the overall performance.5. Create separated workflows to all dependent subset of tasks, and use All Done connection type between them, and set up error reporting to the sub-workflows.6. Dynamically start tasks based on the current workload.

But I don't love keeping queries up to date with a refactored data model, syntactic boilerplate and repetition, and being unable to statically analyze SQL for correctness and get type checking.

You get a clean separation between your data modeling and querying, but can still easily bridge the gap inline or extend models for adhoc exploration.

I have no professional experience yet.But to be honest—I've been pushing myself really hard for the past few years, and I’m now at the edge of burnout. Recently, I've seen many Reddit posts saying the junior job market is brutal, the IT sector is struggling, and there's a looming threat from AI automation.I feel lost and mentally exhausted. I'm not sure if all this effort will pay off, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just enjoy my remaining time in the EU and then head back home.My questions are:1. Is there still a realistic chance for someone like me (zero experience, but good German skills and strong tech learning) to break into the German job market—especially in Data Engineering, Cloud Engineering, or even DevOps (I know DevOps is usually a mid-senior role, but still curious)?2.

We were rewriting the same queries, juggling multiple tools, and losing past work and context in Slack threads.So, I built **ToolFront**: a local, open-source server that acts as a unified interface for AI assistants to query all your databases at once. It's designed to solve a few key problems:* Useful queries get written once, then lost forever in DMs or personal notes.* Constantly re-configuring database connections for different AI tools is a pain.* Most multi-database solutions are cloud-based, meaning your schema or data goes to a third party (no thanks).Here’s what it does:* Unifies all your databases with a one-step setup. Connect to PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc., and configure clients like Cursor and Copilot in a single step.* It runs locally on your machine, never exposes credentials, and enforces read-only operations by design.* Teaches the AI with your team's proven query patterns. Instead of just seeing a raw schema, the AI learns from successful, historical queries to understand your data's context and relationships.We're in **open beta** and looking for people to try it out, break it, and tell us what's missing. All features are completely free while we gather feedback.It's open-source, and you can find instructions to run it with Docker or install it via pip/uv on the GitHub page.If you're dealing with similar workflow pains, I'd love to get your thoughts!GitHub: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)",3,0.57,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lbb63d/i_built_an_opensource_tool_that_lets_ai/,2025-06-14 15:20:05,2025-06-15 01:52:58

I began with BASIC and assembler on a C64, then I started working professionally with C/C++ then Visual Basic, Lotus Notes, .NET, C#, Java/Spring and now it's mostly JS, Node and React.I've never been attached to any particular language/technique but looked at what different platforms can offer. It took me quite some time to decide to move to fullstack web since I felt for a long time that web dev was like pounding a square peg through a round hole (and it still feels like that in some aspects), but the JS eco-system is fantastic these days. And JS truly runs everywhere.Something that's always amazed me is how some people like to spend their energy on bashing the new stuff that comes along. And it's always about focusing and exaggerating the negative sides. It has reached a point where I'm compelled to give new tech extra attention if it's heavily criticized by other programmers.Back in the day those who programmed Visual Basic where ""script kiddies"" and when React and Node came out it received tons of negative opinion only to dominate a few years later. So on this note I've lately focused on using AI as much as possible when programming. And I think it's bloody fantastic if used right. And by right I mean to let it do small well defined tasks and integrate into your app. Not prompt it to build an entire app so that you don't understand and can maintain the code.Especially CSS/Tailwind which I hate passionately. Just give the layout you want to the AI and let it grind until it looks right.I get that it can be tempting for new programmers to copy paste AI generated code they don't understand into a project, which is not a good idea. But the ""don't use AI if you're new is just silly in my opinion. A great aspect with AI is that you can have it explain programming concepts ""like I'm five"".

1l7r3i2,Understanding a code but not being able to reproduce it,None,learnprogramming,"Hello, I am currently in my second year of a useless college where we don't learn much and have to learn it ourselves. Last year during my algorithm classes, I was able to write code myself (in C) and do well in oop(sadly it was taught in python so they didn't teach us much besides classes and basic stuff). The problem began when we were tasked of building an rpg game using a library we didn't know (pygame) in about a month. So I used AI a lot and since then I had been using Ai to code most of my stuff (even my personal projects). The problem began when we had a course where we had to build a full stack app in c# and angular. I made most of the project with Ai again, and was able to understand and explain it quite well. But when it came to do it myself, I found myself lost and didn't know what I should start by doing. I could only code when the steps were told to me clearly. So my question is, how do I relearn programming? Where do I start? From the beginning? I actually do enjoy creating stuff and I enjoy coding when I know what to do.

1laq7r3,Is OOP overrated or I am simply bad at it?,yughiro_destroyer,learnprogramming,"Hello! When I started to learn programming a few years ago, I was introduced to OOP and I thought ""Woah, that's the best way to reason about data in programming!"". Over my experience as a programmer, I saw OOP to be highly encouraged in academy and to some degree even to my workplace. As I programmed more and more I started to hit tons of roadblocks that kept me from truly finishing my projects (mostly related to game development). It wasn't until I tried data oriented paradigms, such as an entity component system (ECS) that I saw better progress. With OOP, you have to plan very carefully how you plan your inheritance chain. You might initially make Player and Enemy inherit from Character but then decide that Player and Enemy share many things that you eventually make Player inherit from Enemy too. Then you also realize that Enemy should have a behavior you don't want Player to have. No matter what you do, you either load unused behaviors into the object or you are forced to rewrite the same code for two classes. Your object can't be two things at one. Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ? Or FigherAndMageAndArcher. Code gets ugly real fast. Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate. With ECS you have a relation of ""IT HAS"" instead of ""IT IS"". An ""object"" is a collection of components (position, volume...) and a system is a function that operates on objects that have certain components. With this, adding new behaviors becomes easy plug and play, as adding or removing logic doesn't break the entire program. If I were to compare this to a real life application, OOP is like building a computer in one single circuit board - something breaks, the whole computer breaks. With ECS (or DOD similar paradigms) it's like building a computer from multile parts - if an SSD fails the rest of the computer keeps working. And refactoring or modifying an OOP class is very risky, especially if that happens to a parent class, beacuse there's no way how the children will react to those changes. OOP through composition is an alternative to inheritance and cleaner in my view but there's still some issues a pure DOD paradigm doesn't have. For instance, a composed class Button that is made of class Position and class Volume needs the method ""pressed()"" which in fact will act on those two inner classes. But if you change the Volume and Position, it could break again, and what if you wanted to share ""pressed()"" to another class like ""CheckBox"" ? Will you inherit from ""Button""? It's possible but that causes lots of chains to follow that at some point becomes exhausting to keep track of. With an ECS paradigm for example the entities are self explanatory - it has that component then it's subjected to this action. I find OOP has use for creating data models or classes with unique behaviors no other class has. Or use composition to build bigger classes from smaller classes. How do you view this?",57,0.73,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1laq7r3/is_oop_overrated_or_i_am_simply_bad_at_it/,2025-06-13 20:27:22,2025-06-15 01:52:59

1lbnhws,Hot take: Documentation SHOULDN'T be your main learning resource,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"I understand that documentation pretty much has everything you could ever want to know about a certain technology, but I personally HATE learning through documentation.I never understood the advice of, ""just read the documentation"", SPECIFICALLY towards beginners. Never worked for me. I feel like I've learned better and more effectively through having a MAIN course for something I want to learn and documentation as a SIDE-RESOURCE that I use to refresh my memory or learn new concepts quickly for a technology I'm already comfortable with. I want to learn the bigger picture, not just learn the modules in Node, and I feel like courses are great at explaining WHY something works and in what situations it is best in. I believe this is why I've enjoyed The Odin Project so much even though they heavily push on reading documentation. They don't just send you the link to JavaScript.info and tell you to read the whole thing, they give you little bits and pieces from the website and other websites for you to learn that specific concept and in their article they teach you the bigger picture of why you're even learning said concept and why the resources they're linking are good resources.Now, this is not to say that MDN, JavaScript.info, W3Schools and other websites are bad resources. I just feel like if my friend tells me tomorrow, ""Hey I want to learn HTML"". I wouldn't just tell them to download VSCode and read W3Schools. I'd give them different options like freeCodeCamp, programming with mosh's video, udemy courses, etc, and then they can read MDN to refresh their memory or revise new concepts. Or I'd ask them what their preferred method of learning is and we go from there.At the end of the day, not everyone is going to feel comfortable learning the same way. Which is why we should keep that in mind and not tell the beginner, ""just dive in and read MDN when you get lost"". I feel like a lot of documentation out there isn't very beginner friendly, or doesn't go slow enough for that person to grasp the why's and how's of that technology.",11,0.87,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lbnhws/hot_take_documentation_shouldnt_be_your_main/,2025-06-15 00:35:30,2025-06-15 01:52:59

I really liked it and wanted to study higher mathematics.Now I’m studying Computer Science at university and aiming to become a software developer. My question is about the actual level of higher mathematics knowledge required for a programmer.Of course, math is essential, but the specific areas you need depend on your field. For example, machine learning and systems programming require deep knowledge of probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and discrete math.To create new algorithms or be an advanced developer, you definitely need higher math.However, here’s my problem: I struggle to memorize all the theory presented in lectures. I don’t remember all the integration or differentiation methods. When I face a mathematical problem, I usually can't solve it right away. I have to look up the method or algorithm, study some examples, and only then can I solve it — which takes time.So I’d like to ask developers who regularly deal with advanced mathematics: When you're faced with a math-heavy problem, do you immediately know which method to use and remember the formulas by heart? Or do you also have to look things up and review examples?Also, will I fail an interview for a systems programmer or ML developer if I don’t know all the higher math theory by heart?

Some years ago, after university, I had to start from beginning to change my work carrier and for the first time, I've approached to the coding world. I love it. I took a master in data science, then I continued to study, c# and unity for game developer. I was hired as data scientist but few months later, the project ended and I was moved in another segment in the same society, as solution architect, with something that really wasn't suit for me. So, I spent some months for a master in devops and I finally could ask to change another team, this time in a team of integration. My team works as middle ware, and I could learn a lot about microservices, api, Aws tools and such that we have as infrastructure. So, I decided to stop trying to learn from others and start study, again, in order to have a robust knowledge of the entire process, end to end. So, with the chance to see how some lambda function (Aws) was integrated into other tools, I asked to write a new one that was needed for a new application. Following all pipeline and integrate it into cloud watch. Was a good work (both cause I used cdk libraries, but mostly cause I saw how pipelines really work in production, as a player and not just spectator). But in the end, the more I learn, the more I find out new stuff, that probably should have been discovered ten years ago at the university. So, right now, I'm trying to study about spring boot and Java, nodejs, maven, camel and how to make whole works together, in order to write good api/web app. Now, I feel full of stuff I don't know, and in my future I would like to have the chance to work as software dev, solution architect or whatever, cause I feel like all these worlds overlap somehow, somewhere.That said, I kindly ask for some suggestions:1)where should I start?2)what should I prioritize? 3)im not gonna lie, I'm using a lot chatgpt or Claude to study, like asking focused questions, like usage, best practice, asking for exercises and dig down every time I have a doubt, but, because I always been a self taught in this world, I have no idea if there are books, documentations or whatever that can be exhaustive and valid.I know can be confusing, but I'm very confused right now.

1l69vmk,How to add a blog page to my website,Supreme_Hanuman69,learnprogramming,"First of all I'll give some context:Website is made using a template in HTML, CSS and JS. Its hosted on Vercel with a custom domain. Its not a static website and uses a server behind the scenes for stuff like ""serving"" the html files from a public folder and contact.html so that people that visit the website can send us messages (That's also why its not hosted on Github). It uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and other Javascript libraries for having the server capabilities. Now I have not really studied and worked on ExpressJS and all but I was able to vibe-code it (I know I'm sorry but its my dad that wanted the website really quick).Fast forward to present day and my dad wants a blog page in the website. Now I asked copilot in VSCode to do do it for me but turns out it got really complicated. I setup a database schema in supabase connected to vercel and then it started spewing out all these lines of code that didn't work at all and I got confused. (`POST /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog` etc)So what my dad wants is that he should be able to make posts preferably with images and thats it. When I first heard of it, I thought maybe he would also like people to be able to comment and like on posts as well. Well he has clarified that he just wants the first part only. Now the thing is how should I go about it. I have 2 choices:1. Use something like what copilot gave me (Use GET methods along with response and requests) (Gonna have to learn it from YT tutorials and docs since ""AI slop"")2. Create a simple posts.json file and loading the posts from that website using JS script. (Only issue would be how to add images in a json file; maybe base64 encoding would work; base64 is quite heavy though). And then create a Flutter app that allows my dad to create, edit and delete posts and when he clicks on submit, it would automatically get pushed onto my vercel repository in production.First approach seems better to make it look like a proper production application whereas the second approach is a just a make-shift thingWhich one do you think I should work on?

1l89tdd,Getting back into programming..,Intelligent_Term_970,learnprogramming,"I’ve been a programmer for most of my life. I started with PHP, which I worked with for around 10 years.Eventually, I wanted to level up. I began reading more and more about design patterns and techniques like generics and other advanced concepts. When the opportunity came along, I made the switch to Go. However, I never quite got used to the syntax—it felt a bit old-school, with very short and cryptic naming conventions. After more than a year, when I was offered a job working with C# I decided to switch again.Unfortunately, that company turned out to be a poor fit. They refused to adopt modern patterns, and the codebase was in a terrible state. And after six months, I moved on to another C# role, hoping for a better experience. But again, the codebase was a mess, and the work was split roughly 75% frontend and 25% backend.Since I had to work on the frontend, I started learning TypeScript. I really enjoyed many of the concepts and examples I came across while learning it, but sadly, the actual codebase I worked with didn’t reflect any of that what I learned and there was no room or time to improve that was already there.For the full picture: in addition to my 40-hour work week, I would often spend another 40 hours learning and building proof of concepts. You could say programming was my life.I started doubting if it wasn’t time to do something else and when another type of job came along I stepped off the programming wagon. I expected I would get my enjoyment in programming back in the hours that I used to make besides my work, but instead I just stopped programming all together.Now more then 2 years further I’m willing to pick it up in my sparetime again.But i don’t want to do course after course. I’m also not really sure what language I want to pick up. Not what to build.The main advantage of typescript is that I can write frontend and backend code with it. I could pick up c# or even try f# (always loved the functional syntax). I could go back to php? Or maybe try out rust or elixer? Just thinking about it makes me want to quit again? So maybe I’m not ready to pick it up again.I wonder if anyone has some advice to break out of this? Although I do enjoy my current job.

1l70xyf,Application first or concept first?,alex_sakuta,learnprogramming,"Modern programming languages, especially dynamic languages have a really good thing going for them which is there is a library for pretty much everything you want to do which is wrapper that makes it easy for you to do the thing without ever having to understand the core architecture of how something is happening.For example, talking about JS env: Need servers? Express. Need sockets? Socket.io. And so on.This makes it really easy tod develop application quickly and unfortunately that's all that an organisation would care for too.In my resume if someone sees a chat application, they don't care if I implemented the web socket architecture or I just used a library. They may ask that stuff in an interview and still not mind that I used a library.Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.I also learnt how to implement an event loop. But would any company care about these skills if I don't have any decent project? I don't think so.But, keeping my own subjective thinking and personal experiences aside, I had a doubt.If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?Like because I learnt Express, I had an easy time creating macros for implementing routes in my C HTTP server. I just imitated a syntax similar to that in C.On the other hand, had I never used Express, I don't think my abstraction of routes would be like the way Express has and don't know if it would have been this good which it is now.So, clearly the learning of the application helps the learning of architecture just as much as learning the architecture helps learning the application.With this, what do you suggest:- Learn application first, no matter how you do it.- Learn architecture first and then design your own and learn application through that instead of a simply using libs.- A mid ground, learn architecture, learn application using whatever tool is necessary and then if one wishes, one can design their architecture from scratch as well.",5,0.79,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l70xyf/application_first_or_concept_first/,2025-06-09 10:06:52,2025-06-15 01:52:59

I noticed that there is a lot of given code and concepts in raytracing in a weekend, as well as PBRT, and I am wondering if I should just read it, or if I should be programming alongside it. Or maybe I should read it first and then try to apply it? but then by then I have forgotten everything.I dont know but any help I very much appreciate.

While I have been in my current position I have made an excel macro in VBA that runs through an excel sheet and highlights cells by color, checking for data integrity. The logic is rudimentary, but it’s been very useful in helping the team catch and correct user errors. I am leaving the team in a month or so, and none of the team has a programming background. I have set up the macro to run as a one-click XLAM within excel. But I would like to have the modules as simply readable/editable for the team to hopefully be able to figure out on their own once I leave. Now I admit that this is probably the sole challenge on writing code, but I am looking for suggestions from the community that has much more experience than me. Code-focused questions-What should be my approach for readability?-Should I prefer to separate the aspects of the logic into separate modules or subroutines/functions?Tutorial-focused questions-Should I write a tutorial on Word with screenshots?-Should I screen record myself explaining the logic?-Is unreadability inevitable if they don’t have a coding background?Just looking for advice, any resources would be appreciated as well.

In the past year or so, most of my students have been software developers, and I have really enjoyed teaching you guys. And this has meant that I have shifted to focusing primarily on Software Developers. (Just so you understand the background) And I want to know what it is that you find most difficult working in an English-speaking environment?My observations so far have been: 1. If you have to explain something technically, then generally it is ok. But if you have to explain something technical to a non-technical person, it is a bit harder. 2. Talking in stand-ups is generally fine, but sometimes you find that you use the same words or phrases every time. 3. Asking questions and knowing when to ask questions is difficult. 4. Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges. By the time you understand something, the topic has moved on. 5. Humour is always a problem (in my opinion, it is not just a language thing but a cultural thing) 6. General conversations are sometimes the hardest to follow. 7. Phrasal verbs (phrasal verbs are everywhere with native speakers) 8. Giving feedback, how direct is too direct or was I too indirect? So... those are some of my observations. Do you have any others, anything specific? I want to be the best teacher I can be for my students.

I have a Econ degree (2020), and spent the last 5 years in finance-related roles. I've been teaching myself to code for the last 7 months (great timing, I know). At first I was just doing it for fun, but then it became one of the more meaningful parts of my life. I used to think I liked finance, but really I just liked saying ""stonks go up"". By contrast coding is predictable, controllable, you eventually can figure out where you f\*cked up, and how you can improve. It's a kind learning environment. And in that there is peace. But I feel like I was just about 2-3 years too late on that realization. A couple months ago, I was very confident I could make it as a professional developer. Now I don't know. There's a lot of fear-mongering and apocalyptic prophesying going on. Some say AI is going to wipe out junior dev jobs. Some say there will still be plenty of demand but you’ll need to be more senior-level faster. And junior postings are way down. Layoffs everywhere.How the heck are we supposed to know what to focus on, when everything's up in the air?I've done alot of research and experimenting with all these roles, some thoughts: * **Front-end** / **Web Design** \- S.O.L* **Full-stack** \- somewhat better, but very generalist skillset* **Back-end -** pretty good open vis-a-vis AI defenseability, good way to niche-up* **Cloud** / **DevOps** \- clearest path to employment, good balance of supply/demand* **MLE / MLOps** \- highest demand, but very low base pool, and I don’t have a stats/ML background* **Blockchain** \- thought about it given my finance background but very sketch * **Data Science / ML** \- did a bootcamp, not fan of stats Exploring all of these definitely set me back on the web stack, but I did finish The Odin Project, the first half of Full Stack Open (Core Course, 5 credits), and partially through a milion other courses on Scrimba, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev), Coursera, etc. I'm also considering a master’s to hedge my bets, hoping that by the time I come out the other end in 2-3 years, the markets will have settled. No idea if worth it, but on the other hand grinding projects feels pointless with the current freeze on junior hires. So my question is this. What path should I focus on as a self-taught dev with no degree, in this brutal market for junior devs? Should I target back-end, cloud, or something like MLOps? Is a master’s a smart move, or should I double down on projects and networking?

My nephew is a very talented musician and composer (just graduated a music degree with first class honours). He plays a number of “traditional” instruments, but increasingly uses an entire melange of software in his music-making: no one tool in particular, instead multiple ones, and he seems to be constantly experimenting with others. (Of the various things he told me about the only two I recognised by name were Ableton and Pro Tools.)Anyway, he mentioned to me the other day that he thought it would be useful if he learned a bit of programming. Not because he wants a fallback career as a developer, but simply because he thought it might be useful to his music making. I certainly think it’s a useful skill to have.Now I have my own personal views about what are good first programming languages (Lua, Python, Javascript), and what aren’t good places to start (C, C++, Rust). But ultimately what’s most important is learning something that he can actually be productive with in his domain.To be honest, I don’t even know what the possibilities here are. Scripting, automation, and macros? Extensions and plugins?Given how many tools he uses, obviously no one language is going to cover all bases.

1l91bzv,The best advice on how to get a job in this market,nysoxfan01,cscareerquestions,"95% of this subreddit is people complaining about the job market or AI. The remaining 5% of actual advice is straight up garbage and completely outdated. Thought I would help out by making a list of things that will greatly improve your job searchAs a background, I have 6 years of Software Engineering experience and have worked with people of many backgrounds. I have never worked at FAANG, went to a mediocre school with mediocre grades, never had an internships or anything like that. But I have also never been unemployed. This isn't for the .1% of people, this is for the common CS man (or woman). And if you were asking, I'm a U.S. citizen in the U.S. market. If you are neither of those this probably won't apply to you.With that out of the way here's what I have gathered from my experience:**1. Apply to local/hybrid jobs in non-tech hubs.** Your goal is to reduce competition as much as possible. When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio. You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist. A lot of them have barely any applicants. If they are desperate enough they will hire you. Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away**2. Make sure your resume is concise.** When I review resumes I hate ones that have tons of wordy bullet points that basically say nothing. Don't dilute your resume with crap. Most people have 1-2 important projects they have worked on at a company and a bunch of filler work. Just focus on the important stuff and make sure it is clear what you actually did. Also PLEASE do not use arbitrary percentages in your bullet points. I hate this advice so much just put what you actually worked on. It doesn't matter how the business benefitted we all know that is the point of work.**3. Similar to 2, make sure your technical skills are concise** If you put every tool or technology it looks like you have very little experience in lots of things. Focus on putting skills that are needed for the job you are applying to. Another easy approach is to take the skills you are best at (say React), and filter only for jobs with React. Then do the same thing with Angular etc.**4. If you don't have any experience (or limited) YOU NEED TO DO PROJECTS** You need some way to show that you have some sort of technical knowledge or drive. You don't need a github, but you should have projects that you can explain how they work. This is especially crucial for internships. My company just hired an intern that was the CEO/Cofounder of a startup. Her startup? Building websites with other students for various people. Sounds stupid, but it got her an internship.**5. Just straight up fucking lie** I don't want to endorse this, but I just want people to know who they are competing with when they send out 500 applications without a response. We hired someone who had experience as a software engineer. But they accidentally told me they were a QA at their last role. I checked their linked in and they were listed as a software engineer. So yeah, if you work in tech support, QA, product. Doesn't matter, you were a software engineer**6. Same as number 5** This is more reasonable in my opinion because recruiters are stupid. If you have React experience and applying to a job with Angular, congrats - you actually have Angular experience. Same with Java and C# etc. The important thing is you are able to actually pass an interview for this stuff. It is worth it to review core concepts and maybe do a few leetcode problems in that language. At the end of the day you need a job**7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest** When I was interviewing for a job I wanted they asked me a common interview question about a time I failed. So I told them a real story about how I messed up getting requirements and caused a delay in the release. I didn't get this job. The next job I applied to asked the same question, so I told the same story but rephrased it where product threw a bunch of requirements at me last minute and I had to work overtime to get things across the finish line. I did get this job. You get the idea**8. Do not negotiate** There's a lot of people on this sub that will scold you for not negotiating. But I have seen first hand peoples' offers get rescinded for negotiating, especially in this market. Just accept the damn offer once you get to this stage. Every job I've gotten when I negotiate I got $5k more on top of the initial offer which is not worth risking losing an offer over. I simply asked if there was any wiggle room and they gave me basically the same offer**9: For students: do not waste your time** Seriously, start applying/working on projects as early as you can. Grades hardly matter. I knew a dumb kid that had a 4.0. It didn't make a difference when it came to getting a job. He could have spent some of his time studying instead building a react app or something and gotten a 3.7 and been better off. Take as many easy classes as possible and focus on learning on your own time. Most CS classes I've taken taught be .01% of my current CS knowledge**10: Make sure everything is up to date, even when employed** Keep your resume up to date with your latest experience. Try to check LinkedIn/Indeed once a week or so. I've seens job boards get flooded with really good jobs one week, which all get removed the next. You never know when that next opportunity is going to be available so it's good to always be looking.",772,0.92,262,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l91bzv/the_best_advice_on_how_to_get_a_job_in_this_market/,2025-06-11 19:11:29,2025-06-15 01:53:00

1l8cllg,"My Startup's ""AI First"" Pivot Feels Like a Joke, and It's Burning Me Out. Is This the Future?",z1_sb,cscareerquestions,"I joined a startup about a year ago, fresh out of grad school. I was really excited. My role was to explore how we could use large language models and build AI systems to improve our content and automate workflows. I was mostly a backend engineer, creating APIs, and I loved it.A little while ago, our CEO suddenly decided our company needs to be ""AI first"". On the surface, that sounds great for someone in my role. But the execution is becoming a nightmare. Any complex technical challenge I bring up gets dismissed with a wave of his hand and a simple, ""Oh yeah just write a prompt and develop it fast"".We are now in a phase where we are actively breaking things that already work perfectly fine, just to rebuild them the ""AI way"". The logic seems to be that if it doesn't use a large language model, it's obsolete, which makes no sense.The worst part, however, is what this has done to my job. The CEO now expects every engineer to own the entire product process from start to finish. This means we are all now responsible for writing long product requirement documents, creating wireframes, coding the frontend, developing the backend APIs, and then deploying and integrating everything ourselves.I chose a career in engineering specifically because I did not enjoy product management. Now, it's a core part of my job. And when concerns are raised about the massive new workload and lack of experience in these areas, the response is just, ""Oh yeah just use ChatGPT to write the document"".My work feels less meaningful every day. I went from being a specialized engineer working on interesting AI problems to a generalist doing a bit of everything, without any real depth or focus. My passion for coding and building robust systems is fading. It feels like my actual engineering skills are being devalued in favor of someone who can just prompt an AI for a passable solution to everything.Is this what the future of tech work looks like?

How can you plan to make major life decisions like starting a family knowing you can lose your job at any time and potentially be unemployed for months. Many people are rightfully angry about it but blaming the wrong causes. It’s true that offshoring is caused by far lower salaries in other countries but we don’t look any deeper than that. We assume it’s a good thing because the US is a “rich” country and assume everyone else is extremely poor and desperate. We ignore that we have a huge cost of living crisis primarily driven by our insane housing costs no where higher than in Silicon Valley. The primary cause of our high housing costs are nationwide restrictive zoning laws that prevent the supply of housing from meeting the demand and making it extremely difficult and expensive to build anything. r/yimby has great discourse on this issue if you want to learn more. It’s impossible for Americans to compete because we would literally be homeless if we were paid equivalent salaries in the countries they are offshoring.

1lawdo8,Which New Grad offer to take: Entry-level SWE @ US Big Tech OR Tech lead @ Canadian startup?,happylogicgate,cscareerquestions,"I'll be graduating university in Canada next summer (I'm a Canadian citizen) and am thinking about which offer to take.I've done internships at both companies so am already familiar with my team + general work culture. Note all numbers below are in US dollars, not Canadian dollars.**Offer 1:*** Role: New Grad SWE @ Big Tech in USA* Compensation: 240K TC (180K base + 60K in RSUs)* Location: Bay Area, fully in-person* Pros: * Getting a big company name on my resume is good for career growth * I work on large-scale distributed systems, using Rust and Golang, which is really cool* Cons: * Higher cost of living than Canada (food + rent) * It's fully in-person in the Bay Area, so I'll be away from family and friends in Canada * Below average work-life balance (it's common to work until 6pm) * I have to be part of an on-call rotation, and it's fairly common to get multiple alerts everyday * RSUs are at a high valuation, and will only increase in value if AI continues to rapidly get better * RSUs are not liquid since it's a private company**Offer 2:*** Role: Tech Lead @ Tiny Startup in Canada* Compensation: 240K TC (240K base + no equity)* Location: Canada, fully remote* Pros: * I can live at home in Canada, free rent and healthy food (if I move out to live on my own, cost of living is cheaper) * Better work-life balance, since work is remote and on-call only happens during big feature releases a few times a year* Cons: * Company is tiny, so only person above me is the CEO, so there's very little room for long-term growth / pay raises * Company is not well-known, making it harder to switch to a higher paying job in the future * I work on same (good, but kinda boring) TypeScript tech stack I've been working on for years, so less career growthI'm tempted to choose the easier, less risky option of the Canadian startup.The compensation is what I expected to be making near the end of my career, not the beginning, so maybe I shouldn't worry about career growth as much? In Canada, 240K USD is a crazy amount, especially for a New Grad - it's about about how much Google & Apple pays for senior engineers.**Which offer should I choose?** I'd love to hear all of your opinions. Especially if you're a Canadian who has worked in the US before (and either stayed or come back to Canada after a few years).\---**Edit:** Someone in the comments said that my usage of big tech was too broad. To clarify, the company I was referring to is one of the leading LLM model companies in the US. There's very few, so take your guess.**Edit 2:** I'm obviously just gonna put ""Software Engineer"" on my resume if I accept the Canadian company offer, not ""Tech Lead"". I'm 100% not claiming I'm anywhere near as experienced as a senior software engineer. This is just the title the company gives me, which is why I put it in the post.**Edit 3:** The startup is more stable than the US company because they've existed for a decade without firing/laying off a single person. I guess they're more of a small business than a startup since they've been around for awhile.",64,0.65,157,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lawdo8/which_new_grad_offer_to_take_entrylevel_swe_us/,2025-06-14 01:10:59,2025-06-15 01:53:00

It was literally my childhood dream - I finally felt like a ""real hacker."" Then I jumped into the startup world as a backend dev and eventually shifted to managing their cloud infrastructure.Here's the thing - after 3 years across various IT fields while in college, I'm completely burned tf out. IT feels like endless chaos and bullshit. Both pentesting and DevOps have buried me under mountains of tasks and drama with devs and clients. The manual testing, red team engagements, and report writing are draining asf. My boss keeps pushing for more certifications.Don't even get me started on getting pinged at all hours because pipelines ""don't work"" - only to find out some dev forgot to do a proper build on their machine, the build failed, and they blamed the CI pipeline. Between the low pay at both companies and all this stress, I'm burned tf out.At this point, I genuinely despise cybersecurity, software development, and even the data science BS I'm learning at university. I've got multiple offers from banks and other solution companies in both fields with way better pay, but I feel paralyzed. I don't want to screw over the companies that gave me my first opportunities at such a young age. I want to leave on good terms, but I'm stuck.Honestly not sure what to do anymore.

I previously worked in sales, and decided I needed to pivot (to a field I was passionate about) about two years ago. Worked pretty hard to learn programming, got a BSCS at WGU (bleh, I know) and here I am. The tech stack is mostly a mix of very old Java applications and some newer React stuff. Seems like devs are kind of doing it all - front end, back end, testing, you name it! It's fun and I've been exposed to a lot off cool technologies. I've mostly been doing the typical entry level guy stuff - add a GUI option to automate this database change we get hit with a lot, learn our no/low code platform and help us convert legacy apps to it, help us change this PDF export, all that kind of stuff. A few apps we maintain are getting moved to the cloud over the next year, and I've expressed interest with the managers in helping with that. Overall, it seems really laid back and everyones being extremely helpful as I learn and giving me more than enough time (and space) to do everything. I'm in a LCOL area, and the job is hybrid (2 days a week in office), I get great health insurance, and I'm just really thankful to have a job! Honestly, I love it. My coworkers are great, everyones so chill, it's a laid back environment, an absolute dream to me coming out of my last job. That being said, pay is on the low end of the scale ($60,000) and I get it - I have no practical experience. I'm ok with starting here and taking a pay cut from my last role, but I do have ambition.

1lbe77i,Absolutely ridiculous job search outcome (positive),Seinhauser,cscareerquestions,"I waited a while before making this post because it didn't feel real at first, and felt like it could all be taken away. But it's been a short while so maybe I feel okay sharing now. Hope I don't jinx it.I was laid off in October of 2024 from a small consulting company. The company had been contracted at a \[big tech company\] for my first year there, and then work dried up so I ended up doing something else for the company. Though, \[big tech company\] legally requires that as a contractor, when describing work experience, you're not allowed to say you work for \[big tech company\]... you have to point out you are contracted by another company, at \[big tech company\]. In other words, my work experience leading up to my job hunt was:* \[big tech company\], contracted by \[consulting company \] (1 year)* \[consulting company\] (1 year)I have severe imposter syndrome, get stuck on Leetcode mediums, feel like I don't possess anything that really makes me special. I've **never** interviewed for a big company before, as I never imagined I could even qualify through technical screenings. I didn't do much job interview research either, other than the ""Blind 75"" lineup of Leetcode problems.I frequently see people saying doing X or being Y will ruin your chances of getting a job, but I went a step further and really made some major ""mistakes"" during my interviews. So here I was incredibly lucky that things worked out. So the point of this post is just to highlight the absurdity and randomness that can factor into your search. So just believe anything can happen, apply to anything, and be optimistic. Things I see around this sub that people say will hurt your odds, and I did ALL of them.* Two column resume layout* Not a ""top"" school, public (ranked 30-40)* Work at contracting companies* Told every interviewer that asked, that I was laid off* Late to an interview by 5 minutes* Less than average Leetcode skills (50 easy, 50 medium, 3 hard)But with each failed interview, I clearly knew where I was lacking, and took home lessons that I focused on hard for the next interview. For example, my first interview was with a FAANG company, and it was my first interview in YEARS, let alone my first interview with a big tech company. I was stuttering and stumbling over my words. The company is heavy on behavioral questions so I totally embarrassed myself. I started practicing my storytelling a lot.With the next, a medium-sized tech company, I was really enjoying the interview and things were going well. I scheduled each round 2+ weeks away to maximize my preparation time for each one. Just before the hiring manager round, I was told that another candidate accepted an offer and they were cancelling the rest of my interviews. Lesson learned: I should be prepared before any interview is scheduled, and schedule everything at my first availability.I ended up giving interviews for 6 medium-to-large companies, and received 2 offers. One from FAANG and one from a comparable company. It took me around 7 months – I just accepted an offer in April, and started working a month ago. Both offers were way better than anything I was making before, to the point where I felt relieved I didn't make it through the Amazon interview.I just want to remind everyone that luck is a major factor in the interview process. Good luck everyone, don't give up and remember anything can happen.",24,0.89,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lbe77i/absolutely_ridiculous_job_search_outcome_positive/,2025-06-14 17:31:38,2025-06-15 01:53:00
1laovc5,Job hopper - how bad it is?,OkPercentage1491,cscareerquestions,"I need some advice.I left a job where I was working for 10 months due to toxic leadership, it was literally making me sick. I started a new one at a company that I heard amazing things about, how everyone was great and how leaders were super supportive, I was genuinely excited.I started in January, onboarding was a bit messy but eventually I figured it out, I had my first oficial feedback session on 09.04, all positive, a few things to improve but the official document statement said that I was on track to complete my 6 months probation. Ever since that feedback I didn’t have any other official feedback, my manager and I talked about projects, I worked on improving what I had to improve, all our conversations were positive. There was going to be a offsite next week - well this is still happening, but I’m won’t be there - where my manager were telling me things and activities for the team. She doesn’t live at the same city that I do, so Tuesday (10.06) was the first time we’ve met in person, we talked about the offsite, she was very friendly and then, Wednesday, on our regular 1:1, not even like a separate meeting, she says that I did not completed it the requirements and therefore I was no longer at the company. I asked for examples of what was wrong, she didn’t tell me, I asked why she didn’t say it before, she had 02 months to provide more feedback saying what was not working and helping me in what I needed, I mean, is her job too, she invested time, money and energy to hire and train me but ,she didn’t say anything either. It was a stab in my back, it is astonishing how someone can be so cold. I honestly have no idea, I’m reliving all my steps and I can’t find something or a little somethings that led to this. I even thought that it could have been homophobia, I’m bi and since this is pride month, when we met I was wearing some pride apparel, but I think this is a stretch.Now I’m here, on my CV there is a 10 month job and now a 5 months job and I’m thinking I’ll never find a place again cause who would hire someone like this? I am really lost, do HR really care so much if you look like a job hopper?For context I have a little over 10 years experience in performance marketing/tech and jobs where I stayed almost 4 years but still, this looks so bad.

I was told I was required to only go in person once a month, that I could start working whenever if I completed 8 hours (so if I start at 9am, I would work until 7pm (2 hours for lunch)), and that my ONLY GOAL IS TO LEARN. When I started working, things were a bit different I am required to go twice a week (any that I choose tho) and I do have to work from 8 to 5. I just coped with it and started working accepting the new conditions, I was happy, I usually disconnect at 5pm and study German and do some certifications so I can improve at my job :) I had no clear, measurable goals but I didn’t mind it, after all, I am completely new to the labor market. I got assigned to basically help out a senior who didn’t quite give me much responsibility, I did some architectural initiatives and digital transformation little projects fitting for an intern job. But he didn’t give me a lot of them and mostly told me to help out with documentation, which I didn’t mind that much because after all it is necessary. Never had a bad feedback, I even presented all I worked on to my boss and she told me that all was rly good and if I was comfortable in the company which I responded to with a yes. HR decided to call me two weeks ago to tell me that I wasn’t gonna have my contract renewed because they asked my boss and she told them no because I lacked “motivation”, they were even impressed with me not knowing my boss had felt this. I felt like it was totally my fault but bit by bit I am thinking I am not the one that did everything wrong and that it is completely my fault. Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here?

1lb9rzr,[France] Is the heavy use of contractors in France common in English-speaking countries as well ?,SheSaidTechno,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone !In the French tech industry — especially in software engineering — companies relies massively on external contractors through infamous service companies called ESNs (between us, we call these companies ""les marchands de viande"" (translation : 'meat dealers')). But does this model exist to the same extent in the US, Canada, UK, Australia..., or do companies there prefer a more direct approach to hiring ?**Here’s how it typically works in France, and why it feels problematic :*** **Heavy use of ESNs (consulting companies)** : Most engineers work on long-term projects (sometimes several years) for client companies, but are officially employees of a consulting company* **Claimed flexibility** : Companies say it’s easier to end a contractor’s mission but the same is true for permanent employees on a trial period* **Supposed lighter HR workload** : In theory, ESNs handle hiring, but the client still interviews and evaluates candidates themselves* **""Temporary"" reinforcement :** Most missions last so long that consultants become de facto internal staff but without the benefits or recognitionIn reality, the drawbacks are significant :* **More expensive** over time than hiring internal staff* **Little to no training** from ESNs : consultants have to upskill on their own* **High job insecurity** : consultants can be removed or relocated with very little notice* **A general lack of respect** : Many ESNs treat software engineers like interchangeable resources rather than skilled professionals. Since a business developer gets a 2000€ bonus each time he places a consultant on a project, some business developers may not give a fuck whether the mission matches the consultant’s skills or career goals or if the project is far from the consultant's home. And if the mission fails put all the blame on the consultant. Btw, since ESN have to pay compensations to fire an employee, their ""secret"" technique to get rid of an someone is to repeatedly relocate consultants across the country to uninteresting projects, hoping the employee will eventually resign on their own. But I won't elaborate on all the bad practices of ESNs in this post, because I could write a whole book on this subject.* **And definitely the worst of all : LOWER SALARIES** compared to internal employees with similar skills. Half the money the consultant earns goes to the ESN.This system creates a kind of vicious circle :low pay —> less savings —> more pressure to accept poor conditions —> repeatAt the end, I don’t see who actually wins here aside from the ESN profiting from both sides.**The English-speaking countries model (as I understand it)*** Companies hire engineers as full-time employees, even for short-term needs — it's the 'hire quick, fire quick' approach* There's less protection, but also more autonomy and transparency* Workers can earn higher salaries because there’s no intermediary between them and the employerTo me, this seems healthier even if it’s more unstable.But maybe it's just an impression, so I’d really like to know : Is this accurate ?**To sum up, my questions for engineers in English-speaking countries :**1. Do companies rely heavily on contractors, or is direct hiring the norm ?2. Are there equivalents to the French-style ESN system ?3. Does the “hire quick, fire quick” approach actually make the work more efficient ?I’m asking all this out of curiosity and a bit of frustration. This is quite a hot topic in France. Here, the current system seems to serve the interests of consulting firms more than the people actually doing the work. So I wonder : is the “Anglo-American” model actually better, or does it simply have different drawbacks ? Because honestly, if the French model turns out to be significantly worse for building a career, I'm seriously considering moving abroad to have a decent quality of life.Looking forward to reading your perspectives.Thanks in advance!",19,0.79,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lb9rzr/france_is_the_heavy_use_of_contractors_in_france/,2025-06-14 14:18:20,2025-06-15 01:53:00

1l9oqc5,"Graduated 3 years ago, but I have been employed in min-wage jobs, is there any point to applying?",Valuable_Mall228,cscareerquestions,"I graduated 3 years ago, it's a bit of a personal story, and one that I'm honestly not sure how to share with an employer but here it is (the story can be skipped as I don't know if it's relevant to my situation, regardless of why, I haven't been employed in industry for 3 years):At around the time of my graduation date I stumbled across the Amber Heard Johnny Depp trial. Amber Heard really reminded me of my brother but I wasn't sure why. As she got diagnosed with NPD and BPD I looked into it and the covert narc description happened to completely match my brother.I had a lot of mental health challenges growing up but I managed to keep it together when it came to my education. Got A\* Maths, A\* Computer science A-levels, graduated CS with a First-Class Integrated Masters from a reputable university. But when I came across this piece of news my whole world flipped upside down. So many things started to make sense and I went through a wild emotional rollercoaster. Hadn't cried in 10 years since I was 13 but for at least 2 weeks I would be weeping 6hrs/day and I honestly didn't know what to make of my life. I had to get a job fast after graduating since I didn't want to live back home so I got hired at McDonalds. My mental health was fragile during this time and it took me 6 months to get a job in retail. Only a year after that had I actually started applying to CS jobs.As soon as my CV hit the market I started getting calls from recruiters, at least 2 calls/week. I started making some progress with some companies but a friend of mine from McDonalds hit me up and convinced me to start a business. It's a long story with him, but basically he came to the UK by selling his business for 40K pounds. He had a small thing where he bought bicycle parts in some dodgy auction and used them to make bicycles and sell them. He worked at McD to earn the rest of what he needed to pay off his tuition fee (he had to pay 21K/year as he was not from the EU/UK). I resonated with the idea of being self-employed and the guy seemed competent enough and I thought YOLO, why not.3-4 months into that whole process I realised I really craved some financial security and it'd be a waste not to use my degree. So I quit and started applying to jobs again. I got very close with a video game apprenticeship (was the 11th applicant out of 300 but they only had 10 positions). And I also got an interview for a job through a uni connection that went really well. I had been given a call and was told that I have the job! just have to be on the lookout for HR to contact me. No contact, I stayed in touch via email and eventually called and the hiring manager told me he doesn't know what's happening and the job seems to be in the air. He's signed everything and so has his boss he is just on lookout for the final business approval. He told me he'll contact me if anything changes, so I can only assume nothing changed.After this whole foray I was a little bit low and my friend sweeps in again to offer me to start our own thing. Great timing. Won't go into the details of that but we did a lot of work but were delayed by waiting for my passport to arrive from Romania to the UK as we needed ID to start the business bank account. Just when we were starting to do outreach and get some customers the guy started behaving very poorly towards me. Very passive aggressive, would tell me to do shit for him, etc. When I confronted him about it he called me sensitive, etc. I just couldn't deal with that kind of behaviour so we split up.It's been a while at this point since I actually graduated and I learned so many things about myself. I thought for a while maybe I don't want to do CS and I went on to try to be self-employed. It turns out I'm a little too fragile for that at the moment, I don't quite have enough self-determination for it and I've lived for 2.5 years in a constant state of anxiety (as my current workplace is quite toxic and demanding as well). I just need a little bit of breathing room and some financial stability to pull myself together enough to actually attempt something like that.This brings me to now, 3 years later, applying to jobs yet again but now I'm honestly worried since it seems like the market is not in a great place, and my gap is getting quite large.Is there any point in me applying to CS related jobs at the moment?

1l9x66t,Master's degree or new job?,ntzia13,cscareerquestions,"I'm a software engineer with 4 years of experience in telecom, C++ and Python, and I have a bachelor's degree in CS.My current personal dream/goal would be to live in South Korea, at least a few years. For this purpose, I considered looking for a job there, or getting a remote job that pays over  $65k a year(digital nomad visa requirement). I didn't have too much luck with either of these so far.So in the meantime, I decided to simply use the time to grow my career. My current job is kinda badly paid, no raises whatsoever, but besides that, I really like it, and I have become very efficient at doing my tasks, which leaves me with plenty of time to learn new things, and work on personal projects. I was also going to pursue a master's degree.But I've been contacted by a fintech company, and I'm at interview 4/4, going great so far. I am quite interested, because I know that finance is one of the best domains in terms of both learning high performance C++, optimization, multithreading(I'm a nerd for these) AND high salaries.

1lbeve4,What is going on with soft skills/communication,Commercial-Ask971,cscareerquestions,"Hello I am IT consultant specializing in data engineering. In this topic, I would like to know what effective communication or soft skillsmeans to you, how to practice it and how to present it. During each half or full year evaluation, my direct manager comes to me with feedback on what the client(s) and other colleagues (usually senior managers) have said about me - it is always along these lines: technically exceptional but should work on communication. I tried to ask what does it mean but got only vague answers.On my part, I am always nice and open to other people - at least thats what I think of myself, but sometimes I have to draw a thick line when, for example: someone entrusts me with a task that goes beyond my competence or scope of duties - think of setting up infrastructure, when its managed by client infra team and I got no permissions. Of course, I do not say ""no"" leaving the person alone with the problem, I suggest who can help and how to do it, sometimes I even engage people to help. I have the impression that any objection, which is not really an objection, and I really cannot do certain things myself, is perceived as my flaw. Of course, it doesn't work the other way around - sometimes people, like the product owner from the client's side, doesn't speak kindly to me, or uses micromanagement but it's fine, no one pays attention to it, arguing ""it is what it is, he was probably nervous"". If the situation were reversed, I would probably be removed from the project. Often, even despite previous suggestions that something might go wrong, my opinion is ignored until the thing happens and then there are complaints about it. Here I come to the conclusion that communication is simply taking everything upon yourself, nodding to everything (being a yes-man) and pretending that everything is going well, even when it isn't? I don't think so, that's why I'm asking you. I would be grateful for any feedback and materials regarding soft skills and communication.",7,0.89,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lbeve4/what_is_going_on_with_soft_skillscommunication/,2025-06-14 18:00:25,2025-06-15 01:53:00

I engaged with all 3 and confirmed they're all the same role, although each agency has given me a different salary expectation/range. I ended up following through with the one that paid the most, but should I have countered the other recruiters with the higher offer to try and get a bidding war started?

1laudso,MSCS: Need Brutally Honest Opinion,YMMVwithme,cscareerquestions,"Hey guys, here’s my situation. I’m a full stack software engineer at a midsize non-tech company (but still well known) with 4.5 YOE (1.5 YOE in data analysis before that, so I guess 6 YOE total). I’ve been cold applying for remote software engineering roles but I’m not really getting any bites. I know the remote market is insanely competitive right now, but I’d really like one and I’m only considering switching roles if the new one is remote.For some more background, I have an unrelated bachelors from an Ivy League school. I have a feeling that this is one of the main reasons I’m not getting much traction - I’m probably being filtered out immediately at a lot of places for not having a CS degree, especially in this market. I was getting a good chunk more interviews 2-3 years ago.Lately, I’ve been contemplating doing a MSCS to make up for that shortcoming. Last year, I got accepted into GT OMSCS but I decided to not attend after thinking heavily about the time commitment. It would’ve taken me about 3 years and I would’ve completely had to sacrifice my quality of life due to the programs rigor. I have a wife and now a baby on the way, and my wife and I are ready to expand our family even further in the short term future, so I just didn’t think it was worth the sacrifice. Plus, now it’s been a year so my offer of admission is no longer valid anyway.Here’s the thing. WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.All that said, do you think it’s worth it for me to do the WGU MSCS so that I can meet the CS degree requirement at a lot of places/avoid getting filtered out early in the process? The way that I’m thinking about it is that I can always take it off my resume if I feel it’s causing a negative impact on my profile. What do you guys think? Would it be beneficial to my profile or make it worse? At this point, it’s either WGU MSCS or nothing - I’m just at a point in my life where I’m done with higher education otherwise and want to focus on life itself, so I’m not considering any other masters programs.I do have 3 YOE working remotely due to COVID and I’ve reflected that on my resume, plus some promotions, so I don’t think it’s a track record issue.",6,0.71,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1laudso/mscs_need_brutally_honest_opinion/,2025-06-13 23:31:20,2025-06-15 01:53:00
1l9oh2t,"As an early engineer in a startup, I expected to become tech lead, but they are hiring an external. Should I push for it anyway?",L3GOLAS234,cscareerquestions,"Hello. I've been working for around 2.5 years in a startup as a senior backend engineer.When I started, we were 2 on the team, under the CTO. 1 person left. We hired someone terrible, and we didn't continue with him after a few months. I proposed to not replace this person with anyone because the workload was ok-ish just for me. I was the only backend engineer for more than one year, managing (successfully) around 1/3 third of the product (several microservices etc).During this period, the CTO was changed because of investors' wishes. A few months back, we hired a couple of more people for my team, but they are nowhere close to my productivity or domain knowledge, and are on-par or below my general technical knowledge. I get along with everyone, I have good communication skills, and I've gotten 2 raises during this time. This is why I was expecting to become a Tech lead when it was time to have one.Unfortunately, we (i was included in the call) are interviewing for an external technical lead. This has been extremely disappointing. When asking my CTO, he said that they wanted someone with experience in leading teams who could effectively help with the refactors that we need, and so on.I'm more than capable (or at least that's what i think) of planning and managing long projects and make them happen through incremental steps, but this new CTO has never let me do that because he always proposes more long-term, breaking refactorings. So we are kind of stuck in urgent things and bugs (that obviously should not happen on the first place) and not moving forward with the important topics.I have the impression that they (the CTO and the CEO) have already made the decision not to count on me to promote to teach lead, because otherwise they would have, at least, spoken with me about what I'm not good at or something.So Im wondering if it make sense to push for it anyway. For example, writing a detailed technical proposal of the refactors that we need, and having another conversation with my CTO. But one part of me thinks that this would be a waste of my time and would only lead to an uncomfortable conversation in which no one wins. What do you think? Any similar experience?

My BA in CS didn't teach me much about front end (react, graphql...) but I have had so much fun learning these things :)I feel like I've hit a learning plateau, though, and many people my age are pursuing masters degrees or attending other types of schools. I feel like traditional CS masters programs are pretty CS foundations focused (i.e algs, data, machine learning) and I don't see many that focus on user interfaces... I also stalked all of the senior engineers I work with, and none of them have masters. I advocated for myself in the workplace and get to work on the UI for internal tools which is fun.I currently live in SoCal and don't want to move for a full-on in-person program. Is it even worth it to get a masters? I've found some certificate programs and I believe my company will pay up to $700 per credit. If I were to look for more sr roles with my CS degree already, would a certificate help? When the time comes for me to jump for a sr role I would have at least 5+ years of experience.I just want to really be a front end engineer who really works on making beautiful UIs that are easy to use, accessible, and look great.

One is SRE at a company that is mid-sized, tech/AI oriented, enterprise, good recent funding, seems really stable, GlassDoor reviews seem positive, unlimited PTO (that reviews say was usually approved), has good benefits but would require relocating. Another is SWE at a smaller start-up ish, can't find any info online about their revenue and funding, almost no GlassDoor reviews, no unlimited PTO, 7 year old e-commerce company.Salary wise due to relocating they both kind of wind up being the same net for me.My brother who's worked as a Product Manager at Microsoft for a few years (but never worked in SWE) is telling me that the smaller company SWE position w slightly worse benefits is much better because the industry is so competitive right now that if you only have experience as an SRE it'll be hard to pivot to other roles in the future, and that it's a much better setup for my future career than an SRE role. He also said that it's better to work at a e-commerce marketplace company because the skills will be more transferrable and a lot of FAANG type companies will like that, whereas the enterprise AI company experience wouldn't be as direct.Another engineer I talked to said the job titles don't matter that much, I'll only be able to tell once I start the job and know exactly what I'm doing that I'll know how useful the learned skills are, best I can do is look at the job description.So I'm torn on what to do.

However my department is not ABET accredited.Only a few universities in Turkey have ABET accreditation and as far as i know most universities outside the united states also do not hold this accreditation.Would this be an obstacle for me to pursue graduate studies or build a career in software engineering in the US,Canada or Europe?",6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l7qixp/how_important_is_abet_accreditation/,2025-06-10 05:11:13,2025-06-15 01:53:00
1l6nzso,SWE -> Ai researcher with ethics focus,TheGhostOfBobStoops,cscareerquestions,"#Hey guys, I’m posting for a friend who doesn’t have a Reddit account with enough karma! Thank you I’m currently a software engineer at Microsoft with 5 years of industry experience(mobile developer for a major product). Over the past few years, I’ve developed a deep passion for philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I believe my long-term goal is to work as an AI ethics researcher, ideally contributing to both academic understanding and practical guidance for organizations building impactful systems. To pursue this, I’m considering enrolling in a Master’s in Philosophy to gain formal training in foundational and conceptual frameworks(philosophy of mind and ethics focus), with the eventual goal of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or a related interdisciplinary field that focuses on AI ethics. That said, I’m wondering if a single Philosophy master’s is the most efficient path—or if it might be worthwhile to simultaneously pursue a second Master’s in Machine Learning or Computer Science. I recognize this may extend the timeline, but I’m genuinely passionate about building a strong, cross-disciplinary foundation and want to make sure I’m well-prepared to contribute meaningfully in both technical and ethical domains. My key questions are: * Is a PhD necessary to break into impactful AI ethics research, or can a Master’s degree (or two) be sufficient?* Would pursuing two Master’s degrees in parallel (Philosophy + ML/CS) make sense, or would you recommend a more focused route?* Are there specific programs or schools you would recommend for someone with this interdisciplinary focus?* Finally, does this path tend to offer long-term job security and practical opportunities in industry at major labs? Thank you so much for your time and any advice you can share—I deeply appreciate it.",5,0.73,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l6nzso/swe_ai_researcher_with_ethics_focus/,2025-06-08 21:54:23,2025-06-15 01:53:00

I graduated in 2019, and then made a transition to computer science with a degree from WGU in 2023. During my tenure is when Ai and the tech layoffs started. I didn’t have an internship. I applied to over 2-3k applications with a potential mill degree and received 4 interviews over the course of 1+ years. My resume had been posted many times and after a while wasn’t much to tweak except my lack of experience. After a year, I got unmotivated and kept working 6-7 days a week to pay loans and bills. It’s currently June 2025. Seems to as murky as when I stopped applying. I haven’t touched any type of projects/coding in a year. What’s my next step?
