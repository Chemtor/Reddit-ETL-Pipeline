1kk0xxg,Last 2 months I have been humbled by the data engineering landscape,skatez101,dataengineering,"Hello All,For the past 6 years I have been working in the data analyst and data engineer role (My title is Senior Data Analyst ). I have been working with Snowflake writing stored procedures, spark using databricks, ADF for orchestration, SQL server, power BI & Tableau dashboards. All the data processing has been either monthly or quarterly. I was always under the impression that I was going to be quite employable when I try to switch at some point.But the past few months have taught me that there aren't many data analyst openings and the field doesn't pay squat and is mostly for freshers and the data engineering that I have been doing isn't really actual data engineering.All the openings I see require knowledge of Kafka, docker, kubernetes, microservices, airflow, mlops, API integration, CI/CD etc. This has left me stunned at the very least. I never knew that most of the companies required such a diverse set of skills and data engineering was more of SWE rather than what I have been doing. Seriously not sure what to think of the scenario I am in.",286,0.97,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kk0xxg/last_2_months_i_have_been_humbled_by_the_data/,2025-05-11 13:23:56,2025-05-14 01:40:18

1kimfzi,Do we hate our jobs for the same reasons?,tensor_operator,dataengineering,"I’m a newly minted Data Engineer, with what little experience I have, I’ve noticed quite a few glaring issues with my workplace, causing me to start hating my job. Here are a few:- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. - We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. I don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem.

1kkip1h,For those who have worked both in data engineering and software engineering....,thro0away12,dataengineering,"I am curious what was your role under each title, similarities and differences in knowledge and which you ultimately prefer and why?I know some people say DE is a subset of SWE, but I don't necessarily feel this way about my job. I see that there is a lot of debate about the DE role itself, so I'm not sure if there is a consensus of this role either. Basically, my DE job entails creating SQL tables, but more so than that a ton of my time just goes into trying to figure out what people want without any proper guidance or documentation. I don't interact with the stakeholders but I have colleagues who are supposed to translate to me what the stakeholders want. Except that they don't...they just tell me to complete a task with my only guiding documents being PDFs, data dictionaries, other documents related to the projects. Sometimes, my only guidance is previous projects, but when I use those as templates I'm told I can't rely on that since every project is different. This ends up just being a constant back and forth stream and when there is a level of concensus reached as to what exactly the project is supposed to accomplish, it finally becomes a clean table in SQL that is frequently used as the backend data source for a front-end application for stakeholders to use (I don't build this application). I have touched Python very rarely at my job. I am supposed to get a task where I should be doing more stuff in Python but I'm not sure if that's even going to happen. I'm kind of more a technically minded person. When my job requires me to find solutions by writing code and developing, I feel like I can tolerate my job more. I'm not finding my current responsibilities technical enough for my liking. The biggest gripe I have is that the person who should be helping guide me with business/stakeholder needs is frequently too busy to communicate properly with me and never tells me what exactly the project is, what the stakeholders want and keeps telling me to 'read documents' to figure it out, documents that have zero guidance as to the project. When things get delayed because I have to spend forever trying to figure out what exactly I should be doing, there's a lot of frustration directed at me. I personally think I'd be happier as a backend SWE, but I am uncertain and would love to hear from others what they preferred between DE and SWE and why. I would consider changing to a different DE role but with SQL being the only thing I use (I do have experience otherwise in Python and JavaScript, just not at my current job), I'm afraid I'm not going to be technically competitive enough for other DE roles either. I don't know what else to consider if I want to switch jobs. I've been told my skills may transfer to project/product management but that's not at all the direction I was thinking of taking my career in....",51,0.92,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kkip1h/for_those_who_have_worked_both_in_data/,2025-05-12 03:20:29,2025-05-14 01:40:18
1klpzaf,Do you rather hate or love using Python for writing your own ETL jobs?,CootNo4578,dataengineering,"Disclaimer: I am not a data engineer, I'm a total outsider. My background is 5 years of software engineering and 2 years of DevOps/SRE. These days the only times I get in contact with DE is when I am called out to look at an excessive error rate in some random ETL jobs. So my exposure to this is limited to when it does not work and that makes it biased.At my previous job, the entire data pipeline was written in Python. 80% of the time, catastrophic failures in ETL pipelines came from a third-party vendor deciding to change an important schema overnight or an internal team not paying enough attention to backward compatibility in APIs. And that will happen no matter what tech you build your data pipeline on.But Python does not make it easy to do lots of healthy things like ensuring data is validated or handling all errors correctly. And the interpreted, runtime-centric nature of Python makes it - in my experience - more difficult to debug when shit finally hits the fan. Sure static type linters exist, but the level of features type annotations provide in Python is not on the same level as what is provided by a statically typed language. And I've always seen dependency management as an issue with Python, especially when releasing to the cloud and trying to make sure it runs the same way everywhere.And yet, it's clearly the most popular option and has the most mature ecosystem. So people must love it.What are you guys' experience reaching to Python for writing your own ETL jobs? What makes it great? Have you found more success using something else entirely? Polars+Rust maybe? Go? A functional language?",38,0.86,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1klpzaf/do_you_rather_hate_or_love_using_python_for/,2025-05-13 16:12:38,2025-05-14 01:40:18

Their thinking behind this is that this gives the greatest flexibility when it comes to different asks by the business. For example if tomorrow the business wants to create another report, you are not locked down to the data types enforced in staging for the needs of the first use case. Personally I find this a bit of an odd decision but would like to hear your thoughts on this.

I’ve become particularly interested in working with data in cloud environments – in the past, I’ve worked with SQL databases and also had some exposure to OLAP systems. To prepare for this role, I’ve completed several courses and built a few non-commercial projects using cloud services such as Databricks, ADF, SQL DB, DevOps, etc.Right now, I’m applying for Cloud Data Engineer positions in Azure, especially those related to ETL/ELT. I’d like to understand what everyday work in commercial projects actually looks like, so I can better prepare for interviews and get a clearer sense of what employers mean when they talk about “commercial experience.” This post is mainly addressed to those who already work in such roles.Here are some optional guiding questions (feel free to use them or just describe things your way):* What does a typical workday look like for a data engineer working with ETL/ELT tools in the cloud (Azure/GCP/AWS – mainly Data Services like Databricks, Spark, Virtual Machines, ADF, ADLS, SQL Database, Synapse, etc.)?* What kind of tasks do you receive? How do you approach them and how much time do they usually take?* How would you classify tasks as easy, medium, or advanced in terms of difficulty – could you give examples?* Could you describe the context of your current project?* Do you often use documentation and AI? What is the attitude toward AI in your team and among your managers?* What do you do when you face a problem you can’t immediately solve? What does team communication look like in such cases?* Do you take part in designing the architecture and integrating services?* What does the lifecycle of a task look like?* How do you usually communicate – is it constant interaction or more asynchronous work, e.g. through Git?I hope I managed to express clearly what I’m looking for.

1kh1wtp,First time integrating ML predictions into a traditional DWH — is this architecture sound?,octolang_miseML,dataengineering,"I’m an ML Engineer working in a team where ML is new, and I’m collaborating with data engineers who are integrating model predictions into our data warehouse (DWH) for the first time.We have a traditional DWH setup with raw, staging, source core, analytics core, and reporting layers. The analytics core is where different data sources are joined and modeled before being exposed to reporting.Our project involves two text classification models that predict two kinds of categories based on article text and metadata. These articles are often edited, and we might need to track both article versions and historical model predictions, besides of course saving the latest predictions. The predictions are ultimately needed in the reporting layer.The data team proposed this workflow:1.Add a new reporting-ml layer to stage model-ready inputs.2.Run ML models on that data.3.Send predictions back into the raw layer, allowing them to flow up through staging, source core, and analytics core, so that versioning and lineage are handled by the existing DWH logic.This feels odd to me — pushing derived data (ML predictions) into the raw layer breaks the idea of it being “raw” external data. It also seems like unnecessary overhead to send predictions through all the layers just to reach reporting. Moreover, the suggestion seems to break the unidirectional flow of the current architecture. Finally, I feel some of these things like prediction versioning could or should be handled by a feature store or similar. Is this a good approach? What are the best practices for integrating ML predictions into traditional data warehouse architectures — especially when you need versioning and auditability?Would love advice or examples from folks who’ve done this.",6,0.76,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kh1wtp/first_time_integrating_ml_predictions_into_a/,2025-05-07 16:37:16,2025-05-14 01:40:18

1kkg2tv,Spark optimization for hadoop writer,Manyreason,dataengineering,"Hey there, Im a bit of a spark ui novice and I'm trying to understand what is creating the bottle neck in my current glue job. For this run, we were using a g.8x with 2 workers.This job took 1 hour 14, and 30 minutes of the job were between 2 jobs. A GlueParquetHadoopWriter and rdd at DynamicFrame.I am trying to optimize these two tasks so i can reduce the job run time.My current theory is that we convert our spark dataframe to a dynamic frame so that we can write partitions out to our glue tables. I think this step is the rdd at Dynamic Frame job, i think its shuffling(?) to a rdd.The second job i think is the writes to s3, this being the GlueParquetHadoopWriter. Currently if we run this job for multiple days, we have to write out partitions at the day level, which i think makes the writes take longer. Example if we run for \~2 months, we have to partition the data to day level then write it out to s3 (60\~ partitions).Im struggling to come up with solutions on how to increase the write speed, we need the data in this partition structure for downstream so we are pretty locked. Would writing out bulk and having another job pick the file up to repartition it be faster? My mind thinks this just means we would then pay for cold start costs twice and get no real benefit.Interested to hear ideas people have on diagnosing/speeding up these tasks!

1kkpf3o,Seeking Advice: Transitioning from Python Scripting to Building Data Pipelines,JazzlikeFly484,dataengineering,"Hello,I'm a student/employee at a governmental banking institution. My contract is due to end in November of this year at which point I'll graduate and be on the job market. My work so far has been scripting in Python to aggregate data and deliver it to my supervisor who does business specific analytics in Excel. I export data from SAP Business Objects and run a Python solution on it that does all of the cleaning, aggregations and delivers multiple csv files of which only two are actively used in Excel for dashboarding.We've had problems with documentation of the upstream data that had us waste a lot of time finding the right people to explain some of the things we needed to access to do what we do. So my supervisor wants us to have a suitable, structured way of documenting our work to contribute to the enhancement of the state of Data Cataloguing at our firm.On the other hand, I haven't felt satisfied in what I've been doing so far, 7 months into the work. My motivation has declined slowly and it's quite obvious that my relationship with my supervisor has suffered from it (lack of communication, not much work on the table, etc...). I would like to change this reality and give myself the opportunity to show that I could be more of use if I'm put to work on the technical aspects more so than following the trail of my supervisor on the business oriented work. I understand that I must ultimately be in service of the business goals but as explained above, doing Python scripting on excel and csv files then letting him do the dashboarding in Excel while I sit back and wait for another need to be done isn't very fulfilling on all levels (academically, I need to showcase how I used my technical expertise in DE. Professionally, I need to show that I worked on designing, implementing and maintaining robust data pipelines. The job market is hard enough as it is for the freshly graduated, not having any actual work under my belt on some of the widely used technologies in the field of DE)Eventually, the hope is to suggest a data pipeline to replace what we've been doing so far. Instead of exporting csv and excel from SAP Business Objects, loading in them in Python, doing transformations in Python, then exporting csv and excel files for the supervisor to load them using Power Query in Excel and do his dashboarding there I suggest the following: \- Exporting from SAP BO and immediately loading into an Object Storage System, I have experience with MinIO. \- Ingesting data from the files into PostgreSQL as a Data Warehouse. \- Using DBT+Python to do the Transformations & Quality Control (Is it possible to only use DBT to preprocess the data, i.e remove duplicate rows, clean up columns, build new columns? I do these in Python already) \- Using a different tool for BI (I worked with PowerBI & Metabase before) \- Finally, a Data Catalog to document everything we're doing. I have experience with Datahub but my company uses Informatica Axon and I don't have access to ingesting any metadata or adding any data sources.I appreciate anyone who read my lengthy post and suggested their opinion on what I should do and how I should go about this. It's a really good company to work at (from a salary and reputation pov) so having a few years here under my belt after graduating would help my career significantly but I need to be of use to them for this.",4,0.75,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kkpf3o/seeking_advice_transitioning_from_python/,2025-05-12 10:46:36,2025-05-14 01:40:18

As the current season hasn't ended (actually ended last Saturday), I wanted to be able to handle more recent updates by just rerunning the notebooks without affecting other season's data. That's why the current season is handled in a different folder, and newer seasons will have their own folders too.I'm a beginner in terms of databases and the methods I use reflect my current understanding.TLDR: I built a database of Women Super League players using data scraped from Fbref.

Because we already worked with csv-files for persistence, I want to do my current task using an embedded sqlite-database. But unlike the csv-file approach that I completed, there's a problem with database.The task is to make a small checkout for sales. The following models are neededProducttype Product ; has a Produkttype LineItem ; has a Product Sale ; has a List of LineItemsWhere in the version of my task, where I used csv-files, it just saved Sales and thats it, a database will now cause a problem.I have a Product that references a Typ, a LineItem will reference a Product, a Sale references a List of LineItems.But a Sale is a one time event. So the ""history"" of Sales saved in the database shouldn't be able to be changed afterwards. But with a normalized database, when I someday change the price of a product, all the sales will also change, because of using references.My thoughts of possible solutions1 - Data Historization I could copy all referenced data into an archive table, when an entity is about to be changed and change all referenced from the product to its archived version.2 - Product versioning Basically the same as 1 but I have only one table and an extra attribute ""Version"" and everytime I change something the Version goes up, and the GUI will only fetch the ones with the highest version, while Sales reference the versions they were created with.3 - Denormalization We were taught to normalize, but I also read that if needed, it's better to denormalize for simplicity instead of making everything super complicated to maybe save a bit of performance. By that I mean, I create a column for every attribute and save it directly in the Sales table. But that means this could in theory lead to infinite columns over a long enough time.So which option, or maybe a completely different one, is the goto method to solve this problem?

I looked through all the rules and terms before I took it, and there was not one direct mention of whether reading documentation or looking things up was fair game or not. From their other rules, it seemed to potentially imply that they only wanted one window/tab open, so I went into this test with no resources.Suffice it to say, it didn't go so well. It was in JavaScript, which I was learning at the time, and the most important question on the test relied heavily on JavaScript string methods, which I have never memorized (even Python or Java string methods, I'll generally look up).So my question: Does knowing string methods off the top of your head indicate that you are a good programmer? Since you have had so much experience programming that it's trivial to remember and use them?

The goal was to use the name as the key in a dictionary, with the corresponding phone number and email grouped as the value. It also needed to support adding, editing, and deleting contacts.I spent two days stuck on how to cleanly structure this. I figured out how to loop based on the number of contacts entered, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how to group the 2 pieces of information (phone number, email) in a nested way that made sense for a dictionary with the name as Key. After some Googling, I discovered that you could, in one line, create a dictionary with a nested dictionary inside of it. .update({x: {y: z}})Where x is the name, y is the phone number, and z is the email.I felt a bit guilty for not figuring that out on my own. I had tried using a separate dictionary for the values and updating the main contact dictionary with it, but the results were messy. Either older contacts got overwritten, or duplicated data would be printed.All of that to say, I’m wondering if this was one of those learning moments where I should’ve pushed through on my own a bit longer instead of looking it up.

I'm planning to self-study computer science from scratch with the goal of reaching a job-ready (junior-to-mid level) skillset. My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one. Here's my current plan: 1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture. 2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript). 3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects. 4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment. I'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources. ### My Questions:- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?I'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field.

From this process I have noticed that the current ""industry standard"" meet management software leaves a bit to be desired and is exorbitantly expensive. I have always had an interest in computers and coding and I want to advance my skills. **End Vision** I have heard it is good to have a goal project as you learn. In the end (end likely means a matter of years as this is a side project/hobby), I would like to create something similar (an alternative to) *Hy-Tek Meet Manager For Swimming*. It does not have to be fully featured just to learn. This program runs on a database and tracks swimmers, events, and entries. It also has more advanced features including implementation with timing consoles and the sort, but I am currently not concerned with this. **My Question**What might be some coding languages/applications I would want to learn to approach a program like this? I am assuming I would need some form of database back end with a gui on the front. Where should I start? I would prefer not to take true college classes or anything like that.

Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. Even in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.But now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.I feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. For those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.But every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role.

Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.Next day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing other candidates. Haven’t heard back since.

1klbjft,"PIP'd for not talking enough in meetings, apparently",cscqthrowaway16661,cscareerquestions,"I was hired at this company a few months ago, it's a larger startup with a few hundred employees, and I got in via the referral of a friend who works there, although he's in a different department. I was hired as a senior SWE but the impression I'm getting is that they basically wanted me to be a lead SWE instead. We have a principal on our team as well as a few juniors and midlevel, and essentially, they hired me not as an IC but I guess more of a manager of the juniors? The principal is too busy on multiple other teams and projects to really participate in our team, although he does sometimes.This all came to a head when a few weeks ago on the 1:1 the manager said I wasn't acting like I was the second in command so to speak, but I told them I felt hired as more of an IC and for the past few months before that, no one had communicated anything regarding managerial type work at all. Nevertheless, we agreed on some action items like me being more present in the Slack, doing more code reviews, mentoring the juniors (all of which I was doing already but I just started documenting them in a work log then), as well as creating tickets and assigning and delegating work, even if that means I do less overall IC work myself (but, isn't that what the managers and scrum masters are supposed to do? Why am I responsible for that part?). The 1:1 the week after that, they presented a PIP. The PIP itself is quite vague, it wants me to take more ""ownership"" and ""leadership"" of the project as I'm the only one on the team who can since the principal is so busy, part of which is talking more in meetings apparently. When I presented the action items I was already doing, they said it was a good start but I needed to do more, but they were very vague on what that actually meant, they couldn't really define it at all since it had nothing to do with concrete performance metrics like ""finished or didn't finish X tickets per sprint.""It said PIP on the document but I didn't sign anything and they didn't ask me to, they didn't even CC HR like a traditional PIP would be. It's a 30 day one so I have to improve in the next 4 weeks apparently but I honestly don't get what they even want from me and every time I ask, they can't tell me anything more concrete. Essentially I think they hired me as a senior SWE when they really wanted to hire a lead (or even an engineering manager), and now they're trying to make me do lead/principal level work for senior pay (I'd need probably another 50k for that to happen). It all seems so sudden, like only a couple weeks ago they tell me about these sudden new ""performance"" problems when the several months before since I joined, there had been no complaints in the 1:1s.So now I'm just injecting myself in the meetings and asking questions no matter how dumb they sound, and it seems like the manager is pleased but it's all just so dumb, they literally said that they don't know if I understand things when I'm not talking in the meetings; I'm not talking so I can listen to what the more experienced team members are saying (we have some outside contractors and the full time devs were hired to eventually replace them, but in domain knowledge, the contractors know more than we do, so I also think the manager is comparing us to them too).Edit: I think people here are assuming I'm not doing senior level ticket cutting and talking often to the principal on architecture and code choices, etc, I am, it's that they seem to want even more people management type work in that they want me to essentially manage the work of the juniors and check in with them every couple days which is fine and which is something I've been doing but somehow they want even more management out of me.",273,0.88,157,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1klbjft/pipd_for_not_talking_enough_in_meetings_apparently/,2025-05-13 02:59:04,2025-05-14 01:40:21

1kl0o4r,Quit job in a day: Did I dodged a bullet or just over-reacted,droid786,cscareerquestions,"Hi,So I just joined a job and then quit after a day, these are the following things happened from interview to the end of the first working day.Premise : It is a small startup(3 people: CEO, CTO(Non-technical, uses lovable to code), a month old web developer) which has raised $ 1.25 million.Interview Process- The CEO without introducing himself or the team, asked me - ""Tell me about yourself in few words"", then eventually he asked few other things, then salary expectations(which I told because I don't know what to say in these situations). Then he asked - When can you join - I told him, give me 2 weeks to think about it, the CEO said No, give me an early response. Then the CTO told him to atleast tell me about the company. Then he talked about the company. After it, I was desperate so I joined it.First day - They didn't even gave me any offer letter, just onboarded me on their payroll system, they didn't even gave me company laptops. So I started the day at 10 am, get every system access(github, backend) access around 11am-12 pm, they have already assigned me a ticket. Around 3 pm, the CTO asked me whether I am done, which I said No because they have hired me as an AI engineer position and their work/tickets assigned were for backend development. Then CEO came around 5 pm, started asking me whether I am done, then he further asked me around 7 pm- How much percentage I am done of the first ticket. I was really exhausted after 7:30 pm so I left, the ticket was still assigned. Also, second ticket was also assigned around nighttime to me.Meanwhile, at the same night, he called the other developer and asked him- How was my performance on the first day.I thought a bit at the same night, and then I told them I can't work there. All of my friends are saying that I should have stayed there, and I am behaving like an entitled Gen-Z and startups are run like this only and I should have collected atleast few paychecks. According to me, working there would have impacted my psyche negatively, and wasted my time which I could have utilised applying elsewhere.But am I over-reacting, am I a weak-willed person or was I correct in judging it.p.s - Office was in open areas of WeWork.",267,0.86,253,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kl0o4r/quit_job_in_a_day_did_i_dodged_a_bullet_or_just/,2025-05-12 18:54:10,2025-05-14 01:40:21

I am the best at building front ends, but apparently I'm not the best at figuring out wordle edge cases while people with half my experience stare me.If you are in college for CS, I cannot tell you strongly enough to change your major to business. You're going to put in thousands of applications even when you have a decade of experience and you will have to go through endless interview rounds. Even when you are in demand, you will still need to jump through these endless hoops where people ask you completely useless facts and then smirk at you when you don't figure out the specific edge cases in the worldle app the made you code.Please do not respond to this by saying ""well that's just because it takes 5 interviews to tell whose a good software engineer."" It doesn't.

If everybody had reasonable hiring processes *like they used to* I would not be as angry even if I were failing them, because at least then I could move on quickly.Edit 2: I am not asking to do away with coding interviews. I think they're dumb but people have been complaining about them for a decade so I understand why companies do them. I'm asking to do away with these ridiculous processes that are 5 rounds *on average* and go back to have 1) a screening call 2) an onsite, 3) and then a reference check, a process which ANY REASONABLE COMPANY should be able to evaluate an employee. Sure ask our coding questions in the onsite, but my god. I interview with startups, who fail thirty percent more often then regular businesses.

1klkljz,"US Devs: Check Your ""The Work Number"" Report",Candid-Progress-1184,cscareerquestions,"When writing your resume and negotiating pay, be mindful that Equifax operates a database called The Work Number that contains info on past employers, titles, pay, etc for a huge number of employees in the US. I recently discovered my report was wrong: it claimed I was a 'payroll specialist' rather than a 'computer systems engineer' at a previous employer because the person filling out the form put their own title instead of mine... About half my previous employers have entered data into it, and I have a feeling it might be integrated into modern HR tooling and ERP systems.Definitely check your report and make sure no one jacked up your previous title, pay, etc. Receiving a copy of any consumer credit report, including these ones, is free. My current employer tells them about every single one of my paychecks, so keep in mind future employers might literally be able to see when you got your raises too. If you're as cautious as I am, you probably want to make sure the titles listed on your resume at least bear a passing resemblance to the ones in the report so it doesn't set off alarm bells for HR folks who don't understand tech title equivalence. If you're considering overemployment, note that both roles could show up on the report.There are many other organizations that claim to provide info like this: I contacted the top 100 and no one else had any data on me, so I think The Work Number is far and away the most popular.It's possible to freeze your report just like any other credit report, but keep in mind this might look suspicious.Anyway, just be mindful that this stuff is out there and people have easy access to it. I think employers are technically supposed to tell you when the contents of a credit report are used against you, but it's impossible to enforce since they can just say nothing.

1kjikg5,Expectations in the Era of AI,Tron122344a,cscareerquestions,"I've been working as a Software Engineer for a little over 3 years now, and I want to emphasize that various AI tools have been incredibly beneficial for my overall productivity and speed in which I can complete tasks.However, at least in my position, I've noticed management becoming increasingly aware of how much faster AI can make my colleagues and I work. As a result, it seems like the amount of work expected to be completed has sharply increased—and ironically enough—the job has gotten more stressful.I used to be assigned several stories per sprint, and could finish them with ample time, all while learning something too. However recently it has felt like since management knows about how AI is, they load us up on our sprints, where I'm getting double the amount of tickets as I was before, and even junior developers are leading entire initiatives of our project, and they too have voiced feelings of intense pressure.As a result of this, I'm starting to feel like my love of programming and problem-solving is dwindling. Each ticket I hardly have the time to truly think about solutions and research and learn, because I'm expected to use AI to grind out the solution and move onto the next. This has made me feel like I'm burning out a bit, because instead of learning things I feel more like a prompt engineer at most and just gluing solutions together and moving onto the next ticket, with little time for anything else because the work volume has drastically increased.Was wondering if anyone else has had feelings similar to this?

It took me almost 9 months to get my first job because of how bad the market was (is) when I graduated. I got my current and first job because I was cheap (my starting pay was far below market rate for SE1 role), and the hiring manager was impressed with a systems programming and os architecture project I had on my resume and my github from one of my classes which was written in C. My job uses a techstack of syncfusion c# winform frontend and an old C backend that was originally written before I was even born.I've been spending my free time upskilling, mostly working with .net core & react, and python as I'd like to get a full stack or backend role with a more modern and common techstack. But problem is, every job I've applied to that uses anything remotely modern hasn't given me any call backs. The only jobs I have heard from are ones that I didn't even apply to that want the same thing as my current job does, a cheap junior that knows C.I'm guessing part of the reason why I'm not getting callbacks is not just because of how bad the market is, but because in a recruiters and hiring manager's mind, why take a chance on someone who currently works with something arachic, when you can just get someone who has actual job experience in what they use. How do I get out of being pigeonholed?

Things that would require me some time to understand, are at my fingertips. I can make a whole project required by my teacher and make it even better than is required, but with AI. Without it I’d have to spend like 4x time to learn things first, but when AI responds with ready code, I understand it, but it would take a lot of time for me to code it ‘that’ way.I enjoy it anyway and spend dozens of hours on projects with AI.

I’m currently trying to figure out what kind of environment I actually want to work in long term.In particular, how normal is it to see these patterns? I’ve noticed these either as an intern or through reviews online for other startups:* Long hours: e.g. 10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week. Sometimes explicitly stated as part of the culture, other times unstated but clearly expected - people work late, on weekends, etc.* Leadership doesn’t take accountability: when things go wrong, there's no clear ownership from the top. Just a vague sense of we all failed together.* Strict in-office requirement: 5+ days a week in-office, with little or no flexibility for WFH.* Constantly shifting direction or pivoting: roadmaps or priorities changing multiple times a month, with work frequently thrown away.* Unstable policies: things like compensation, time-off policies, or promised benefits being changed or walked back* No mentorship: you're expected to figure things out mostly on your own, even as a junior or new hire.I get that startups are fast-paced, ambiguous, and scrappy, that’s kind of the appeal in some ways. But when several of these things combine, it’s hard to tell if that’s just startup life or if it’s a genuinely unhealthy environment, especially when you're early in your career.So how many of these are just part of the deal when working at an early-stage company?

1kib4yw,Tips on applying to new jobs as junior dev with 1 YOE?,Accipitrim,cscareerquestions,"Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.**((This part is just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**I know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't ""crazy"" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave, but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.All of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.I still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\-----------------------------------------------------I know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",15,0.94,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kib4yw/tips_on_applying_to_new_jobs_as_junior_dev_with_1/,2025-05-09 05:41:09,2025-05-14 01:40:21

I maintain middleware backend web services for my large finance company's mobile apps (mobile BFF architecture) in TypeScript. I've gotten good at TS, can implement whatever's given to me, the job's stable and secure. I'm fortunate in many ways.The problem is... the architecture means I've got no experience with DBs. Not even ORMs. We don't really roll our own infra, rarely we'll change an IAC config file somewhere. No gRPC. No real system design skills to speak of. Node+TS on the backend is also a weird place to be in this market where companies want you to fit to a T, it's in the intersection of front and backend.We basically get together, talk about the future states of some parts of the mobile app, get the data from downstream services and just add business logic so that our REST endpoints have XYZ fields. It's gotten too easy, I don't feel like I'm growing and I'm worried about the skills I have vs those I *should* have on paper. The current market is also making it hard to switch jobs to get more breadth/depth.

1kjwsto,PhD or job?,Ciiceeroo,cscareerquestions,"Hi, I’m finishing up my masters in computer science and I’m seeking some advice on what i should choose:Software engineer role: 80k euro/year. 1 hour commute.PhD in NLP: 50k euro/year, 30 min commute.In the long run my dream job would be a research position at a company within ML/computer vision. Therefore a PhD may be neccesary. While i do enjoy NLP, it isnt my dream speciality, but it is adjacent to what i want to do.With the current job market being trash, i also realize how hard it is to get a job within a company, and am afraid that taking a PhD might just worsen my position in 3 years when im done as opposed to gaining experience. I applied to around 400 companies in 2025, and only got 4 interviews (also had 5 people reach out to me and thats where i got these 2 job opportunities).To summarize longterm goal in order: Job security, research role, salarySeeking any advice / perspectives.",6,0.76,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kjwsto/phd_or_job/,2025-05-11 09:08:55,2025-05-14 01:40:21

1khc1ru,"Feeling Stuck at 30 - No Experience, No Strong Portfolio, and Time Running Out.",ChatteurGha,cscareerquestions,"I’m at a pretty stressful crossroads and could really use some guidance. I recently turned 30 and am struggling with the reality that I don’t have professional experience in my field. Most of my work has been tied to school projects, so my portfolio isn’t as strong as I’d like.While I don’t consider myself the best or smartest (sometimes I feel the exact opposite), I’ve always been quick to understand things. I’m good at breaking down complex problems, and I’ve received praise for it my entire life. However, discipline has always been a challenge for me. I’ve managed to get by relying on my intellect while doing far less work than I should have. But recently, I’ve started implementing good routines and becoming productive every day.I’m an international student in the U.S., working toward my master’s in Math with a concentration in Computer Science, and my bachelor’s degree was also in CS. All I need to do to graduate is submit my thesis. The pressure is mounting because my time to stay in the country is running out unless I secure a job soon. I’m actually being forced to start using my OPT (limited work eligibility) time to submit my thesis by December and graduate.I feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to compete in the job market despite these challenges. For reference, I’m currently near Houston, Texas. So far, I’ve applied to fewer than 50 jobs. Most of the time, I don’t get responses - sometimes I get rejections - but I’ve never had an interview.For those who have been in similar situations - or those who’ve successfully transitioned into a career without much experience - how did you do it? Can I make my school projects look more compelling to employers? Will they even look at them? Do I have a chance?I know that if I’m given an opportunity in a work environment, I’ll reach a high-performance level very quickly. I just don’t know how to show this potential to employers. I also can’t seem to get my resume under two pages.Any advice on networking (which I’ve struggled with as an introvert with few close friends), skill-building, or navigating job searches efficiently would be incredibly helpful.Finally, thank you whoever you are for taking the time to read this. I’m crossing my fingers for something that gives me hope - that I haven’t completely wasted my life and opportunity here. In the meantime, I'm making small victories, like finally maintaining a steady routine of working on my thesis and working on my resume/linkedIn/applying for jobs full-time.",7,0.65,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1khc1ru/feeling_stuck_at_30_no_experience_no_strong/,2025-05-07 23:39:16,2025-05-14 01:40:21
1kgt98u,Am I on my way out of this organisation?,Anxious-Possibility,cscareerquestions,"Am I reading too much into this?\* The past week I've been removed from most projects and given work like writing api docs. It's good to sort out technical debt but given everything else below seems a bit sus.\* The company is not doing financially well, and my boss even told me. He said he had to get rid of temp employees, and he made it seem like it won't end there.\* The MD is in the meantime saying everything is doing well, we're fundraising, blah blah blah blah. I asked my boss about it and he didn't seem convinced that the MD is telling the truth. He didn't straight out say ""the MD is lying"" but his tone of voice said it.\* The MD announced 4 days a week RTO which is super annoying and may be a way to get people to quit rather than do redundancies. I asked my boss if it affects us because most of engineering is not based near the office. He doesn't know! The uncertainty sucks and seems like it'll be drawn out for quite a bit more. I'd rather just know either way tbh. I was thinking of taking an extended break from my job as I've been quite burnt out, so if anything if I'm made redundant it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

On paper, it sounds like a promotion, but in reality:It’s still not development work, which is what I actually want to be doing.The team is pretty demotivated, and the general vibe is low energy.There’s a 5-hour timezone difference, making collaboration and leadership more challenging.I’m also feeling super demotivated myself and have started interviewing elsewhere because I feel stuck and like I’m not growing anymore.I appreciate being considered for leadership, but I don’t think this is the right move for me, especially with everything else going on. How can I say no to this without raising red flags or burning bridges.Is there a chance to prove myself and get better oportunidades internally?Would it be better to just accept it temporarily while I job hunt, or is there a way to professionally decline without torpedoing my standing?",6,0.88,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1klqtq7/offered_a_team_lead_position/,2025-05-13 16:46:10,2025-05-14 01:40:21

1kh9s1s,Job choice,BearWithTopHat,cscareerquestions,"My current company is doing layoffs. I've been told by my direct boss I have a very low chance of being laid off based on my high performance and my recent promotion. Base: 110k Bonus: 20k. Fully remote with no chance of going back in.Because of the layoff announcement I started looking two weeks ago and got an offer at 150k. Bonus is up for debate, but supposedly around 10% of the base. Hybrid 3 days in office. The tech stack is different from my normal one, I've always worked heavy backend java, this would be full stack with C++. I'm fine learning a new stack and front end, and the pay seems good, assuming the bonus can be confirmed. But the 3 days in seems rough. I've never had the displeasure of going into an office before (5 YOE). Always fully remote. If my current job wasnt threatening layoffs I wouldn't consider this at all realistically. To be honest I'm dog shit at interviewing, and I hate leet code, and I almost never get responses from apps, this seemed like a fluke. Additional info: my current company has assigned us 3 new offshore teams, who have taken around 60% of our old workload. We've focused on new things, and have work flowing, but it seems like the goal is for the offshore teams to take more as time passes.Am I being stupid not just taking the confirmed job?
