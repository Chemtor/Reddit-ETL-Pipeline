Bootcamps, online resources, and community content have opened doors for so many people. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel that the role is being diluted.What once required a solid foundation in Computer Science—data structures, algorithms, systems design, software engineering principles—has increasingly become something you can “learn” in a few weeks. The job often gets reduced to moving data from point A to point B, orchestrating some tools, and calling it a day. And that’s fine on the surface—until you realize that many of these pipelines lack test coverage, versioning discipline, clear modularity, or even basic error handling.Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is exactly what democratization looks like, and it’s a good thing. But I do wonder: are we trading depth for speed?

I have a Databricks PySpark notebook that takes 20 minutes to run as opposed to one minute in on-prem Linux + Pandas. How can I speed it up?It's not a volume issue. The input is around 30k rows.

1k66f2e,"Are Delta tables a good option for high volume, real-time data?",StriderAR7,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I was doing a POC with Delta tables for a real-time data pipeline and started doubting if Delta even is a good fit for high-volume, real-time data ingestion. Here’s the scenario: - We're consuming data from multiple Kafka topics (about 5), each representing a different stage in an event lifecycle. - Data is ingested every 60 seconds with small micro-batches. (we cannot tweak the micro batch frequency much as near real-time data is a requirement)- We’re using Delta tables to store and upsert the data based on unique keys, and we’ve partitioned the table by date. While Delta provides great features like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel, I’m running into issues with table bloat. Despite only having a few days’ worth of data, the table size is growing rapidly, and optimization commands aren’t having the expected effect. From what I’ve read, Delta can handle real-time data well, but there are some challenges that I'm facing in particular:- File fragmentation: Delta writes new files every time there’s a change, which is result in many files and inefficient storage (around 100-110 files per partition - table partitioned by date). - Frequent Upserts: In this real-time system where data is constantly updated, Delta is ending up rewriting large portions of the table at high frequency, leading to excessive disk usage. - Performance: For very high-frequency writes, the merge process is becoming slow, and the table size is growing quickly without proper maintenance. To give some facts on the POC: The realtime data ingestion to delta ran for 24 hours full, the physical accumulated was 390 GB, the count of rows was 110 million.The main outcome of this POC for me was that there's a ton of storage overhead as the data size stacks up extremely fast!For reference, the overall objective for this setup is to be able to perform near real time analytics on this data and use the data for ML.Has anyone here worked with Delta tables for high-volume, real-time data pipelines?

Why don't they control data access too?,mjf-89,dataengineering,"Hi there, I've been thinking about the current generation of data catalogs like DataHub and OpenMetadata, and something doesn't add up for me. They do a great job tracking metadata, but stop short of doing what seems like the next obvious step, actually helping enforce data access policies.Imagine a unified catalog that isn't just a metadata registry, but also the gatekeeper to data itself:- Roles defined at the catalog level map directly to roles and grants on underlying sources through credential-vending.- Every access, by a user or a pipeline, goes through the catalog first, creating a clean audit trail.Iceberg’s REST catalog hints at this model: it stores table metadata and acts as a policy-enforcing access layer, managing credentials for the object storage underneath.Why not generalize this idea to all structured and unstructured data? Instead of just listing a MySQL table or an S3 bucket of PDFs, the catalog would also vend credentials to access them. Instead of relying on external systems for access control, the catalog becomes the control plane.This would massively improve governance, observability, and even simplify pipeline security models.Is there any OSS project trying to do this today?Are there reasons (technical or architectural) why projects like DataHub and OpenMetadata avoid owning the access control space?Would you find it valuable to have a catalog that actually controls access, not just documents it?",30,0.93,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k8jmbo/are_we_missing_the_point_of_data_catalogs_why/,2025-04-26 18:24:38,2025-04-30 01:38:26

1k6xfby,Query runs longer than your AWS bill. How do I improve it,YameteGPT,dataengineering,"Hey folks,So I have this query that joins two table, selects a few columns, runs a dense rank and then filters to keep only the rank 1s. Pretty simple right ?Here’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. So, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.Yes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. And it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. But the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details. Thanks.

1k93nf9,General guidance - Docker/dagster/postgres ETL build,VipeholmsCola,dataengineering,"HelloI need a sanity check.I am educated and work in an unrelated field to DE. My IT experience comes from a pure layman interest in the subject where I have spent some time dabbing in python building scrapers, setting up RDBs, building scripts to connect everything and then building extraction scripts to do analysis. Ive done some scripting at work to automate annoying tasks. That said, I still consider myself a beginner.At my workplace we are a bunch of consultants doing work mostly in excel, where we get lab data from external vendors. This lab data is then to be used in spatial analysis and comparison against regulatory limits. I have now identified 3-5 different ways this data is delivered to us, i.e. ways it could be ingested to a central DB. Its a combination of APIs, emails attachments, instrument readings, GPS outputs and more. Thus, Im going to try to get a very basic ETL pipeline going for at least one of these delivery points which is the easiest, an API.Because of the way our company has chosen to operate, because we dont really have a fuckton of data and the data we have can be managed in separate folders based on project/work, we have servers on premise. We also have some beefy computers used for computations in a server room. So i could easily set up more computers to have scripts running. My plan is to get a old computer up and running 24/7 in one of the racks. This computer will host docker+dagster connected to a postgres db. When this is set up il spend time building automated extraction scripts based on workplace needs. I chose dagster here because it seems to be free in our usecase, modular enought that i can work on one job at a time and its python friendly. Dagster also makes it possible for me to write loads to endpoint users who are not interested in writing sql against the db. Another important thing with the db on premise is that its going to be connected to GIS software, and i dont want to build a bunch of scripts to extract from it.Some of the questions i have:* If i run docker and dagster (dagster web service?) setup locally, could that cause any security issues?

1k7214y,Feedback on two rough draft architectures made by a noob.,wcneill,dataengineering,"I am a SWE with no DE experience. I have been tasked with architecting our storage and ETL pipelines. I took a month long online course leading up to my start date, and have done a ton of research and asked you guys a lot of questions (**thank you!!**). All of this study/research has led me to two rough draft architectures to present to my company. I was hoping to get some constructive feedback on them, if you all would do me the honor. Here's some context for the images below:1. Scale of data is many terabytes to a few petabytes uncompressed. Largely sensor data. 2. Data is initially generated and stored on an air-gapped network. 3. Data will be moved into a lab by detaching hard-drives. There, we will need to retain some raw data for regulatory purposes, and we will also want to perform ETL into an analytical database/warehouse. I have a lot of time to refine these before implementation time, and specific technologies are flexible. but next week I wan to present a *reasonable* view of the types of solutions we might use.

I worked for that company for almost 3 years and unfortunately, got close to no applicable experience. They had previously outsourced their data engineering so we faced constant roadblocks with security in trying to build out our pipelines and data stack. In short, most of our time was spent arguing with security for reasons we needed access to data/tools/etc to do our job.

I’ve only gotten 3 engineering interviews from hundreds of applications and I’ve made it to the final round during each, only to be rejected because of technical engineering questions/problems I didn’t know how to figure out. I am very discouraged and wondering if data engineering is the right field for me.

1kaggxl,How important is university reputation in this field?,Hoppingcrow_,dataengineering,"Hi y’all. A little background on my situation: I graduated with a BA last year and am planning on attending law school for my JD here in Canada in fall 2026. Getting into law school in Canada is really competitive, so as a backup plan, I’m considering starting an additional degree in data science in case law school doesn’t work out. My previous degree was almost completely free due to scholarships, and since I’m in the process of joining the military I can get a second degree subsidized. I already have a BA, so I would like to use elective credits from my previous degree toward a BSc if that’s the route I take. The only issue is that a lot of Canadian universities don’t allow you to transfer credits from previously earned degrees. Because of this, I’ve been looking into less prestigious but equally accredited school options. My concerns are mostly about co-op opportunities, networking, and how much school reputation influences your earning potential and career growth in this field. I know that law is pretty much a meritocracy in Canada, but the alumni connections made through your university can mean the difference between tens of thousands of dollars per year. Ideally, I want to go to a school that has strong co-op programs to gain experience, and would potentially want to do an honours thesis or project. I’ve spoken to some people in CS and they’ve recommended I just do a CE boot camp, or take a few coding classes at a community college and then pursue a MS in data science. I don’t like either of these suggestions because I feel that I wouldn’t have as strong a theoretical background as someone who completed a 4 year undergrad degree.

Quite a few topics were lost, as well as some of them apparently became corrupted and also got lost. One of them included a very nice discussion about local mountaineering and beautiful locations which a lot of people are saddened to lost since we discussed many trails. Somehow, people managed to collect data from various cached sources, computers, some screenshots, but mostly old google, bing caches while they worked and webarchive. Now it's all properly ordered in pdf document but the thing is the layouts often change and so does resolution but the general idea of how data is represented is the same. There's also some artifacts in data from webarchive for example - they have an element hovering over text and you can't see it, but if you ctrl-f to search for it it's there somehow, hidden under the image haha. No javascript in PDF, something else, probably colored, no idea.The ideas I had were (btw PDF is OCR'd already):&nbsp;- PDF to text and try to regex + LLM process it all somehow?- Somehow ""train"" (if train is a proper word here?) machine vision / machine learning for each separate layout so that it knows how to extract data&nbsp;But I also face issue that some posts are for example screenshoted in ""half"", e.g. page 360 has the text cut out and continue on page 361 with random stuff on top from the archival's page (e.g. webarchive or bing cache info). I would need to also truncate this, but that should be easy.&nbsp;- Or option 3 with those new LLMs that can somehow recognize images or work with PDF (idk how they do it) I could maybe have the LLM do the whole heavy load of processing? I could pick up one of better new models with big context length and remembrance, I just checked total character count, it's 8.588.362 characters or 2.147.090 tokens approximately, but I believe the data could be split and later manually combined or something?

Essentially, three different flat files get printed to this folder on a nightly bases that represent three different types of data (think: person, sales, products). Essentially this data could exist as three separate long tables with date as key. I'd like to establish a proper data warehouse, but am unsure of how to best handle the process of warehousing these flats. I have been interfacing with the data through Python Pandas so far, but the company has a SQL server...It would probably be best to place the warehouse as a database on the server, then pull/manipulate the data from there? But what is tripping me up is the order of operations to perform in the warehousing procedure. I don't believe I would be able to dump into SQL server without profiling the data first as number of columns and the type of data stored in the flat files may have changed throughout the years.I am essentially struggling with how to sequence the process of : network drive flats > sql server db: My concerns are:Best method to profile the data?Best way to store the metadata?Throw flats into SQL server and then query them from there to perform data transformations/validations? \-- It seems without knowing the meta data, I should perform this step in Pandas first before loading into SQL server? What is the best practice for that? perform operations on each flat file separately or combine first (e.g., should I clean the data during the loop or after combining tables)? \-- Right now, I am creating a list of flat files, using that list to create a dictionary of dataframes, and then using that dictionary to create a dataframe of dataframes to group and concatenate into 3 long tables -- am I convoluting this process?How to approach data cleaning/validation/and additional column calculations? e.g. -- Should I perform these procedures on each file separately before concatenating into a long table or perform these procedures after concatenation?-- Should I even concatenate into longs or keep them separate and define a relationship to their keys stored in a separate table?How many databases for this process? One for raws? One for staging? A third as the datawarehouse to be queried?When to stage and how much of the process to perform in RAM/behind the scenes before printing to a new table?Should I consider compressing the data at any point in the process?

1kawaj4,Tools for managing large amounts of templated SQL queries,aksandros,dataengineering,"My company uses DBT in the transform/silver layer of our quasi-medallion architecture. It's a very small DE team (I'm the second guy they hired) with a historic reliance on low-code tooling I'm helping to migrate us off for scalability reasons.Previously, we moved data into the report layer via the webhook notification generated by our DBT build process. It pinged a workflow in N8n which ran an ungainly web of many dozens of nodes containing copy-pasted and slightly-modified SQL statements executing in parallel whenever the build job finished.

I know this is a low-level question for this sub, just hoping to put this somewhere where data experts might have some ideas!My team performs on-site audits for a labor standards org. They involve many interviews, for which we take notes by hand on legal pads, and worksite walk-throughs, during which we take photos on our phone and make notes by hand. There are at least two team members taking notes and photos for the worksite walk through, and up to 4 team members interviewing different folks.We then come to the office and transfer all of these handwritten notes to one shared google document (a template, breaking each topic out individually). From there, I read through these notes (30-50 pages worth, per audit...we do about one audit a week) and write the report/track some data in other locations (google sheets, SalesForce- all manually transferred).This process is cumbersome and time-consuming. We have an opportunity to get a grant for tablets and software, if we can find a set up that may help with this. Do you have any ideas about how to make this process more efficient through the use of technology? Maybe tablets can convert handwritten notes to type?

1ka3a7b,Doubt about the coexistence of different partitioning methods,dagovengo,dataengineering,"Recently i've been reading ""Designing Data Intensive Applications"" and I came across a concept that made me a little confuse.In the section that discusses the diferent partition methods (Key Range, hash, etc) we are introduced to the concept of Secondary Indexes, in which a new mapping is created to help in the search for occurences of a particular value. The book gives two examples of data partitioning methods in this scenario:1. Partitioning Secondary Indexes By Document - The data in the distributed system is allocated to specific partition based on the key range defined to that partition (e.g.: partition 0 goes from 1-5000). 2. Paritioning Secodary Indexes By Term - The data in the distributed system is allocated to a specific partition base on the value of a term (e.g: all documents with **term:valueX** go to partition N).In both of the above methods a secondary index for a specific term is configured and for each value of this term a mapping like **term:value -> \[documentX1\_position, documentX2\_position\]** is created. My question is how does the primary index and secondary index coexist? The book states that Key Range and Hash partition in the primary index can be employed alongside with the methods mentioned above for the secondary index, but it's not making sense in my head.For instance, if a Hash partition is employed for the data system documents that have a hash that belongs in partition N hash range will be stored there, but what if partition N has a partitioning term (e.g: **color = red**) based method for a secondary index and the document doesn't belong there (e.g.: document has **color = blue**)? Wouldn't the hash based partition mess up the idead behind partitioning based on term value?I also thought about the possibility of the document hash being assigned based on the partition term value (e.g.: document\_hash = hash(document\[""color""\])), but then (if I'm not mistaken) we wouldn't have the advantages of uniform distribution of data between partitions that hash based partitioning brings to the table, because all of the hashes in the term partition would be the same (same values).Maybe I didn't understood it properly, but it's not making sense in my head.",3,0.81,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ka3a7b/doubt_about_the_coexistence_of_different/,2025-04-28 18:48:38,2025-04-30 01:38:26

I'm 20 rn and I started at like 12 or something just dabbling around with Python + some html css (they're not programming languages but you know, intro stuff). I've always been kind of off with my math back then and was horrible at it. I've always just approached the problems in my code with just intuitive problem solving. You know, things that might just work.These past months though, I've been getting really interested in math. So much so, that it has replaced my hobby of progamming (lol). What I noticed though was just how different I think about certain concepts. For example, functions. Back then, I kind of just thought of this as some wrapper of code that I can call whenever I wanted to. But getting to learn more about them in Calculus and how much I can manipulate them, it has also translated to my programming skills. Instead of just a wrapper for my code, I treat them now like actual items that take in parameters and spits out an output. Of course like, duh, but it really has changed my perspective and style on how I code now. Back then, it's more programming first then do the math to check. Now, it's math first, and let my code check if my math was correct. If it's correct, my code runs. If not, then math was wrong.I just wanted to share this insight with you guys who may be struggling to grasp some concepts in programming. Maybe, learning where these concepts came from might actually give you a deeper understanding of what they actually do.",332,0.97,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k5tzx5/learning_math_made_learning_programming_easier/,2025-04-23 08:21:38,2025-04-30 01:38:28

It's designed to teach you how to read the HTML and CSS specifications to keep yourself educated in the future, and understand how browser internals work so you can create beautiful, accessible, semantic, and performant web sites and applications.I think semantic HTML and CSS are seriously neglected skills by coders in the web development arena. In the course we also do multiple modern projects, and talk about how to get an LLM to produce the best quality HTML and CSS.If you manage to grab a seat, an honest review is much appreciated, but even if you don't I just hope it helps your career. And don't despair about AI! If you understand what you're doing, you can use an LLM properly, and become a fast producer of quality code.Here's the link, it's first-come, first-serve, and expires in 5 days: [https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-html-and-css/?couponCode=448BEC248CEC73F2AEA8](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-html-and-css/?couponCode=448BEC248CEC73F2AEA8)Happy HTML and CSS authoring,Tony Alicea",237,0.94,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k9y0pu/1000_free_seats_to_htmlcss_course/,2025-04-28 15:15:13,2025-04-30 01:38:28

For example if I have a function that’s supposed to take the factorial of a number, on paper I’ll write down how if there’s an input of 6, it should multiply 1 by 6 then go into a 2nd recursion layer to multiply 6 by 5, and so on.

I have literally sent hundreds of personalised applications (resume + cover letter) for most of them and got only like 8% of answers, most of them being automatic rejections. I initially applied for machine learning/computer vision (my major at school) openings, but since there is no way I ever get one of those, I've widely reduced the importance of what I'd like to do in order to send more applications.Even when I get to go to the technical tests, and perform (I have had platforms telling me things like you performed better than 95% of candidates), I still get rejected without getting to the interview phase, ""we've had a lot of competitive applicants bla bla bla"". The only interviews I got are from Belgian societies, refusing me even though they don't pay their interns. I mean, even for free (for them bc it would be a lot of money for me to get there), they wouldn't have me work for them ??? This is just crazy.I have already worked half-time for more than 4 years alongside my studies, meaning that I have at the very least 2 years of full-time professional software engineering and that seems to not count at all, I've even had interviewers telling it didn't count as experience and that I was a junior with less knowledge than a student who wouldn't have worked during his studies (I admit that I left the interview after hearing this bs)I tried many different things on my resume & letters to not get rejected by the automated TAS.

1k7u3nv,using AI to learn programming,CapnCoin,learnprogramming,"Edit: What I mean by the post is not that everyone is saying not to use AI at all. That is simply how I understood it so I made a post in case there might be others.I often see comments on posts, asking how to learn programming, saying not to use AI.Although I am definitely no professional programmer myself, I have done quit a lot of learning (python, c#, and lately c++). I have always heeded this advice and have steered far away from using AI to learn how to code. Until the last couple of weeks.... and I have completely changed my mind about the subject.I still think it is a bad idea to have AI write up some copy-paste code as this definitely is not the best way to go about learning. Struggling a little and trying to get the code working yourself is what will cement the knowledge. But what I have been doing is submitting my code snippets to the AI after getting it to work and prompting it to analyze my code and suggest possible improvements. I then try implementing the suggestions and repeat the process.I feel this has vastly upgraded my programming skills, learning to implement fail safes, better error handling, better edge case handling, and being overall more robust. Still by no means am I any form of 'great' programmer yet but using Ai in this way has helped me progress a lot faster.So, in my opinion there is no problem with using AI to help you learn, the problem is in how we decide to use it.

1k7lakx,[Need Advice] Struggling with Focus and Productivity After Years of Passionate Coding,hello_aaron,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I hope you’re all doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a severe lack of focus and productivity, and it’s been weighing on me for nearly a year. Let me share my story and explain where I’m at – I’d really appreciate any guidance or experiences you can share.Background: In 2021, I got my first desktop from my brother, and I was instantly hooked on computers. I spent hours exploring, learning, and diving into coding. I started with C, moved to C++, and fell in love with programming. It was exciting, and I was learning something new every day. In 2022, I joined a Computer Science Engineering program as a direct second-year student. This was the peak of my productivity. I was coding 10+ hours a day, building web development projects with Python and JavaScript, and even mastering the MERN stack. I was so focused that I’d code through the night, feeling like coding was my entire world. My hard work paid off – I became one of the top coders in my college, and my peers recognized my skills. I built a strong portfolio and improved my resume, aiming for a developer jobProblem: Things changed in my final year (2024). I started feeling depressed, demotivated, and lazy. I couldn’t focus on learning new skills or even maintaining my existing ones. While my peers were landing interviews and jobs, I struggled with aptitude tests (which I hadn’t prepared for, as I was so focused on coding). Sitting down to work on my laptop became a challenge – I just felt unmotivated. Despite this, I pushed through, and my past hard work paid off: I landed the highest-paying job at a major MNC in my college. I’m proud of this, but the problem persists. Now, with my degree wrapping up in the next 2-3 months, I want to use this time to improve myself, but I can’t focus on anything. I’ve lost the drive to learn new languages or build projects. Worse, I’m experiencing back pain from too much screen time, which makes me avoid my laptop altogether. I suspect I’m addicted to high-dopamine activities like gaming and YouTube Shorts, which make it impossible to start anything productive. My mind feels like it’s rejecting coding and my laptop for no clear reason.I’ve attempted every productivity strategy. I desperately want to be that person again who could code all day without distractions, but I feel stuck. This has been going on for almost a year, and I’m worried about starting my job in this unmotivated state. Has anyone else experienced this shift from being passionate and productive to feeling unmotivated and unable to focus? How did you overcome it?I’d love to hear your experiences, suggestions, or even just know I’m not alone in this.

I honestly don’t know how this doesn't qualify, since I’m trying to understand a conceptual difference.Anyway, here's my question.I got the structure of the `Memory` chip from GitHub. Everyone seems to be using the same implementation, and it works fine in simulation without any errors: CHIP Memory { IN in[16], load, address[15]; OUT out[16]; PARTS: DMux4Way(in=load, sel=address[13..14], a=loadram1, b=loadram2, c=loadscreen, d=loadkbd); Or(a=loadram1, b=loadram2, out=loadram); RAM16K(in=in, load=loadram, address=address[0..13], out=ramout); Screen(in=in, load=loadscreen, address=address[0..12], out=scrout); Keyboard(out=kbout); Mux4Way16(a=ramout, b=ramout, c=scrout, d=kbout, sel=address[13..14], out=out); }Now, based on this design, I expected the following code to read a value from the keyboard and store it into `RAM[1]`: (loop) @24577 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPHere's my reasoning:* `@24577` sets the A register to 24577.* That value is passed to the Memory chip as the address.* The most significant bits (bits 13 and 14) are both 1, so according to the HDL, the `Keyboard` chip should be selected.* So `out` should reflect the keyboard's output.* Then `D=M` loads the keyboard value into the D register.* `@1` sets A to 1, and `M=D` writes the value to RAM\[1\].Now, here’s my confusion: How is this different from the following? (loop) @24576 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPBoth 24576 and 24577 have the same top two bits (13 and 14 = 11), so shouldn't they both route to the keyboard? Why would one work differently from the other if the given chip structure is true?edit: in the code section some parts were typed as “u/…” instead of “@…” . I fixed them.

Explaining them is.Solving a question correctly is important, of course. But what really stands out is how clearly and naturally someone can walk others through their thought process. It’s not about over-narrating or reciting a rehearsed script. What makes a difference is:Framing your approach in simple, accessible terms Surfacing trade-offs before you're even asked Staying steady and unfazed when edge cases come up, as if you already thought about them Because of this, I gradually adjusted how I prepare for interviews, even casual ones. I still solve problems as usual, but now I also practice summarizing the solution in one or two clean sentences, basically a ""30-second version"", then being ready to dive deeper if needed.Sometimes, I’ll use a tool that offers multiple solution paths and points out which parts are worth verbalizing, not just coding. It’s helped me avoid slipping into the ""just code it"" mindset.Curious if others have similar experiences.

1k5y2ma,Big O notation and general misunderstanding,divad1196,learnprogramming,"Disclaimer: this post is also to vent.I got into a debate on something that I didn't think was so badly understood. The debate was with people claiming that ""big O notation is just counting the number of instructions"" and ""you must abstract away things like CPU"".These claims are formally incorrect and only apply for specific contexts. The big O (and little o) notation is a mathematical concept to explain how something grow. It is never mentionned ""instruction"" as this isn't a mathematical concept. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)The reason why we ""abstract"" the CPU, and other stuff, is because if 2 algorithms run on the same computer, we can expect them be impacted in the same way. ""All instruction take the same time"" (not all instruction take the same time, but the execution duration of an instruction is considered majored by a constant. A constant doesn't impact the growth, we can define this number to be `1`). In **simple** cases, the time is a function of the the number of instruction `n`, something like `duration(n) -> INSTRUCTION_DT * n` When you compare 2 univariate (""mono-variadic"") algorithms in the same context, you get things like `dt * n_1 > dt * n_2`. For `dt > 0`, you can simplify the comparison with `n_1 > n_2`.Similarly, when the number of instruction is fix on one side and vary on the other side, then it's easier to approximate a constant by `1`. The big O notation cares about the growth, there is none and that's all we care about, so replace a constant by 1 makes sense.Back to the initial point: we don't ""count the instruction"" or ""abstract"" something. We are trying to define how somethings grows.Now, the part where I vent.The debate started because I agreed with someone's example on an algorithm with a time complexity of `O(1/n)`. The example of code was `n => sleep(5000/n)`.The response I got was ""it's 1 instruction, so O(1)` and this is incorrect. `O(1)` in time complexity would mean: ""even if I change the value of N, the program will take the same time to finish"" whereas it is clear here that the bigger N is, the faster the program finishes.If I take the opposite example: `n => sleep(3600 * n)` and something like `Array(n).keys().reduce((a, x) => a + x))`Based on their response, the first one has a time complexity of `O(1)` and the second one `O(n)`. Based on that, the first one should be faster, which is never the case.Same thing with space complexity: does `malloc(sizeof(int) * 10)` has the same space complexity has `malloc(sizeof(int) * n)` ? No. The first one is `O(1)` because it doesn't grow, while the second one is `O(n)`The reason for misunderstanding the big O notation is IMO:- school simplify the context (which is okay)- people using it never got the context.Of course, that's quite a niche scenario to demonstrate the big O misconception. But it exposes an issue that I often see in IT: people often have a narrow/contextual understanding on things. This causes, for example, security issues. Yet, most people will prefer to stick to their believes than learning.Additional links (still wikipedia, but good enough)- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory (see ""Important Complexity Classes"")- DTIME complexity: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTIME",5,0.58,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k5y2ma/big_o_notation_and_general_misunderstanding/,2025-04-23 12:36:19,2025-04-30 01:38:28

I lose focus where what is suppose to happen or I cannot even built a code in my head that solves the most simple problem. I have a lot of self-doubt and I just cant deal with it anymore. I used to be the smart kid in school and a smart adult nowadays but when I compare myself to the other students in my course, I feel trashy and I feel like theres a big wall of missing understanding that keeps me away from reaching the potential and skills they did. I try many times to just pick everything up and learn it but every time I just fall to my knees, feeling simply overwhelmed.I dont want to use AI to write my programs, doing that led me to not practise enough honestly. I should also mention that I have Azbergers, so tho I think very logical, I am basically screaming internally everytime I see code because I cannot for the love of god visualize code in my head for some reason. Have you guys experienced similar things? Any suggestions how to improve?

1kashof,We hired 1 intern out of 10K applicants,azntechyuppie,cscareerquestions,"I work for a prominent growing AI startup that most people have heard of. I need to share something that blew my mind from our recent internship hiring round. Our goal was to hire 5 AI engineering and data science interns for the summer.We got freaking *10,000* applications for our summer internship program. TEN THOUSAND. After screening all that mess (using some AI tool I admit to sort / filter) we narrowed it down to around 200 people who seemed qualified enough for take-home coding challenges.Want to know the crazy part? Out of those 200 challenges, barely 10 people made it to the final interview round. And we ended up making just ONE offer when we wanted to hire 5 people.What was the dealbreaker? Almost nobody could explain their own damn code when we asked them about it. Like 99% of these candidates just vibe coded their way through the take-home challenge (let's be real - they used AI) without understanding what the hell they were submitting. I literally asked one candidate why they used a certain Python package and they had no idea what it did.On the on-site, we had to reject 9/10 candidates. Most of them when they got to the onsite just couldn't pass the bar.Part of the reason why we hired the one candidate that passed was because he showed some honesty. A few people in the hiring panel said that the candidate admitted that he had seen one or two of the questions on LeetCode / Interview Query. So they apparently asked him a different question and he was thoughtful about explaining the solution even though he missed getting one of them 100% right.So here's my PSA to anyone applying for tech jobs: Use AI all you want, but make sure you actually understand the code you're submitting. If you can't explain your approach or debug issues without AI holding your hand, you're gonna crash and burn in any decent technical interview. And you'll be absolutely useless on a real team. Otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time, including your own.And don't assume just because you're interviewing at an AI company that THEY WANT YOU TO USE AI FOR EVERYTHING!!!",2326,0.74,765,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kashof/we_hired_1_intern_out_of_10k_applicants/,2025-04-29 16:39:58,2025-04-30 01:38:29

1k9e9p6,Mourning My Tech Career. I’m Leaving for More Pay and Stability.,Hazjut,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR:After years of chasing a tech career that never paid or stabilized, I am leaving for a career that can support a family and offer real security. I still love tech, but I had to move on to survive.I thought tech would be the future I built my life on. It didn’t work out.I chased a tech career for years, but it never came together. Ironically, I made the equivalent of around $80k a year in the military before I even had a degree, and some years a bit more. After graduating, despite years of effort, I never made over $80k again. After unstable contracts, low pay, no benefits, and rising living costs, I found a different career starting around $140k total comp and quickly climbs toward $200k and beyond, offering real retirement options and meaning that tech never did for me.I started coding for fun at 16, back in 2006. It was not rare, but it was far less common than it is today. When college came, I should have taken on debt and jumped into tech earlier. But I saw loans like credit card debt, and my family did too. We did not understand grants or aid. I was the first in my family to pursue a degree. Instead, I joined the military to pay for college.While serving, I started taking tech seriously. I built projects, took classes early, and did well both academically and physically. I am a combat veteran. After leaving, I moved to a major west coast city, earned a degree from a respected state university, and started trying to build a tech career.I completed two internships at large tech companies, but after graduating around the time layoffs began sweeping the industry, I could not find work for about a year. When I finally broke in, I spent the next few years grinding through mostly contract roles, including development, support, and program management, at two FAANG companies. Most paid well under $80k, with no benefits. Even working over 40 hours a week, I was barely surviving. And it left me drained trying to find new work throughout those three years while I worked over 40 hours. I had eventually applied to thousands of jobs even though many were targeted applications. It was consuming my life with no benefit.Over the last few years, I interviewed for about 20 roles, but nothing stuck. Pay stagnated, inflation rose, contracts ended, interviews were canceled mid-process because of layoffs and outsourcing. I did not want to leave tech. But eventually, the cost of living made it impossible to stay. I am starting a family and I want to buy a home, and the path I was on in tech could not support either.I needed something meaningful I could rely on for career growth and stability. That is when I turned to law enforcement. It shares some overlap with the military in structure, though it is not the same. For me the constant deployments were the only thing I didn't enjoy, and this is the closest I could find that felt similar without needing to travel overseas constantly. It felt like a better fit for the life I needed to build.Now, I am starting my new career. In many major west coast cities, law enforcement compensation surprisingly matches or beats the tech roles I once chased. Retirement comes in your early 50s if you want it, without penalty. I plan to use my GI Bill for a master's degree and eventually specialize in areas like police forensics. It is already improving my quality of life.I am mourning the career and identity I once imagined. But I am hopeful about what lies ahead. This path will eventually give me the freedom, disposable income, and stability to return to tech on my own terms, whether that means building my own product, starting a company, or, if nothing else, creating open-source tools that still have real impact. It may not look like the dream I once had, but it might be a better one.For now, it is another opportunity for someone else who loves this field the way it demands. I am finally choosing a path that fits me, and I do not regret it.",994,0.88,283,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k9e9p6/mourning_my_tech_career_im_leaving_for_more_pay/,2025-04-27 20:55:59,2025-04-30 01:38:29

1k8mffu,Ok I'll admit it.. I was wrong about non-tech companies. I can DEFINITELY see the appeal now.,cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"I just want to put a disclaimer: I am not saying FAANG or Big Tech sucks. It has its pros, but it also has its cons. Same with non-tech companies. But looking back on my years in the industry.. I just want to reflect on my experience and post about it.When I was just starting out, I thought I had it all figured out. Like so many others in this sub, I had one goal drilled into my brain: FAANG or bust. I thought if I was not at a top tech company or at least something adjacent, I was failing. That prestige, that resume clout, that salary, it was all that mattered.Fast forward to today. I am at a FAANG-adjacent company, something people would brag about on LinkedIn, and honestly I am exhausted. I am not even talking about having a busy week tired. I am talking about chronic, soul-sucking, life-flattening exhaustion. Every day feels like running a marathon at a sprinter's pace. There is an endless barrage of Slack messages, Jira tickets, unexpected urgent meetings, and late-night pings that just need a quick review. Every quarter feels like another round of brutal performance reviews where you are judged against metrics that seem to move the second you get close to hitting them.Even my friends who made it into the actual FAANG companies are not living the dream. They are constantly worried about the next round of layoffs. They are stuck in environments where one minor mistake can tank their rating and put their career at risk. Some are taking anxiety medication now. Some do not even enjoy coding anymore, something that used to be their passion. It has been hard to watch.And then there are my other friends.The ones I used to quietly judge. The ones who went into banking tech, insurance companies, healthcare systems, government contractors. The so-called safe non-tech companies.When we catch up, the contrast is hard to ignore. They work 20 to 30 hours a week. They log off by 4 PM, laptops closed until the next morning. No emergency production issues in the middle of the night. No hyper-aggressive performance reviews. No constant fear about the next reorg or layoff. Their companies are profitable and stable and not reacting to every market fluctuation with mass job cuts.They are happy. Genuinely happy.They have hobbies. They go hiking. They build side projects for fun. They go to the gym without feeling guilty. They spend time with family, with friends, with themselves. They are not worried about falling behind because their companies are not built on a culture of constant comparison.When I look at them now, I see peace. A peace I forgot was even possible in this industry.I was so obsessed with winning early on that I did not realize how much I was sacrificing along the way. My health. My happiness.

1ka4cop,What is it that makes fresh grads so incredibly unhireable?,BusDriver341,cscareerquestions,"Are they really that incompetent/useless? How long does it actually take them to become productive? I remember back before covid when bootcamps were popping. A lot of them were advertising and boasting that their (bootcamp grads) were becoming productive in a few weeks, while it took university grads 1 year to become productive (based on market research). Does it actually take that long?I've also heard stories that a surprisingly large number of fresh grads can't even solve fizzbuzz.I find all of this stuff so puzzling. Say that you graduated with a degree in CS. Maybe you have one fullstack CRUD app to your name as a personal project, and maybe you did a team project in school where you used git and worked with a team of people where you made a technical toy project that required some problem solving, no fancy UI or anything like that.What is realistically that difference between this person and someone who has 2-3 years work experience as a developer that also have to learn a new tech stack? I can't really see why the new grad would necessarily be worse, or not given a chance. To me it mostly comes down to IQ, personal ability, personality, communication skills etc. Sure, in an application process its hard to give the ""new grad"" a chance. But if you give them an interview at least they can show their personality/how they think about things. I've also heard that everyone is saying that there's 1000 applicants for every job, that's why people with 0 experience get 0 interviews. But how is that even possible, and wouldn't it eventually even out? If there's 20k available jobs, and 20k available candidates, some jobs aren't being filled. I guess new grads are just so incredibly bad that the loss of hiring them is way bigger than not having a filled position?Also how does AI play into this? Is juniors just so bad that any senior just automatically does the job now with AI 10x as fast? So there's no need for juniors?",539,0.9,342,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ka4cop/what_is_it_that_makes_fresh_grads_so_incredibly/,2025-04-28 19:32:39,2025-04-30 01:38:29

1k6c2it,Actual career advice: Don’t argue with your manager (especially with feedback),mpaes98,cscareerquestions,"Wanted to share an anecdotal wisdom I’ve developed that I continue to see early career professionals do that hurts them; voicing disagreement with your manager will 99% of the time hurt you. Let’s say your manager corrects you over something that wasn’t your fault. In that case, trying to make an argument that you aren’t responsible for something is more likely to make you seem like you can’t take accountability.Or, in a feedback session, you get negative reviews from them on your performance for what seems like arbitrary reasons and you want to give an explanation/justification. In this case, there’s no explaining away what they’ve decided. You’re more likely to come off as insecure and argumentative for talking back.I’m not going to give a speech about how maybe you need to do self-reflection and practice humility; sometimes you’ll be in the right and you know you’re in the right. But career-wise, being right < manager being pleased.90% of the time, your manager has already made up his mind on how he feels about a situation.Part of your manager’s role is assessing your performance and giving feedback. So when you push back, not only are you expressing that you disagree with their opinion, you’re also coming across that you think you are better at their job than them (maybe you are?).I write this because I’m usually a self-advocate outside of work, but I’ve gotten to a point where I have to tell myself “it’s not worth it” quite a bit because of how important it is to not be a problem employee in this economy. The best recoveries I’ve had when I’m given feedback or told negative things (that I personally feel like are not my fault) is to not disagree or try to explain, it’s just thank them for the feedback and keep working.",297,0.89,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6c2it/actual_career_advice_dont_argue_with_your_manager/,2025-04-23 22:15:50,2025-04-30 01:38:29

1k9ytrw,"I know the market is rough, but I'm feeling stagnant despite having a good job, and I am torn on next steps",jocularplate,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I'm a 31M with about four years of software engineering experience. I spent my first year working as a consultant and have since been working as a fullstack engineer, with a heavy focus on backend engineering.Currently, I'm at a large tech company — maybe a step or two below FAANG — but it's a name most people would recognize. Lately, though, I've been feeling stagnant. I'm still classified as an entry-level engineer in terms of pay and title, even though I'm consistently performing at a level or two above that. (That's not just my opinion — both my manager and two technical mentors have told me this.)For example, as a Level 1 engineer, I'm technically supposed to be mostly taking tickets, relying on senior engineers for clarification, and developing technical depth in one main language. In reality, my day-to-day work involves starting and completing projects independently, defining requirements while working with outside stakeholders, implementing new technologies into our tools, and even managing a contractor. There’s a big gap between my responsibilities and my official title.Some extra context: since joining my current role, my company has gone through two rounds of layoffs, and my team has been moved under two different organizations (so I've had two different skip-level managers). Although no one has explicitly said it, I suspect that promotions are being slowed or avoided to cut costs, especially since the current job market makes it less likely that people will leave. Promotions *have* happened elsewhere in the company, but not on my team.That said, if I didn't enjoy my job, I would just risk it and leave. But the truth is, I actually like it. My boss is supportive, my work-life balance is solid, and the benefits are good. The only real issue is that my career growth — specifically my title and pay — feels stuck. Technically, I'm still learning and working on interesting problems, so in that sense I’m not stagnant.I'm looking for advice on what to do next. Stay patient and hope things change?

1k8gaf9,Protobuf vs custom binary protocol for hiring in the long term,Pyciko_,cscareerquestions,"Hello. I'm a programmer in a tech startup that develops IoT devices for on-water activities as well as a companion app for them. Due to the nature of our usage case, we sometimes have to operate in bad network conditions: the internet bandwidth may be small, the link between smart trackers and user's phones may be unstable.. etc.. A binary protocol is such a good fit for this situation: saves the bandwidth, allows to have a unification between TCP and Bluetooth comms, works great on low-ram IoT devices. My first look went into Protobuf of course, as it slowly shapes like a new ""JSON of binary world"". But when I started digging deeper, I discovered that it has multiple big downsides and I can easily fix them if I make my own proto (spoiler: I made it).1. The generated code is HUGE (especially in Dart which is used for frontend).2. It doesn't support classes inheritance. Inheritance can be bad in some cases, but if inheriting a class with some common fields halves the codebase size, I do want to have that option.3. Some features like Enums are replaced by strange stuff like int consts (again, Dart code looks even worse)4. That whole stuff with optionals and fallback defaults isn't reliable: if it's a backwards compatible protocol, the fields have to be explicitly nullable without any fallback values.5. You can just make a bitfield for null values at the start of the message, and by doing so, you can get rid of the field headers (id + type) entirely: the id doesn't exist because fields are sequential, the type is known in schema. If receiver schema is old and transmitter has sent some unknown fields, these fields are always at the end of the message, so you can just skip these bytes.And so what I did is I actually wrote a protocol myself, and tested it for a while. Now, even though I still love it, my mind keeps thinking about the following problem: if and when the time comes to hire more people, how do I explain this tech stack to them? Protobuf is a well-known thing, we can just put it as a requirement and be okay. But what about in-house solution? Also, if we need to add another programming language the our system, the protocol has to be implemented by someone.Now I'm doubting if I should continue working with our in-house protocol, or switch to Protobuf. My questions are:1. Is an average developer ready to learn custom binary protocols?2. In other companies using binary protocols, how popular is it to write a custom one and how do employees feel about using it?3. Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?",19,0.81,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k8gaf9/protobuf_vs_custom_binary_protocol_for_hiring_in/,2025-04-26 16:01:09,2025-04-30 01:38:29
1k7yw44,Reluctance to hire ex-FANG in a mid-sized area?,thefox13guy,cscareerquestions,"I've been a programmer professionally since the late 00s. I'm in Portland, which is just a mid-sized market, but still has plenty of tech jobs. I've worked at small startups as the first or second full time dev, some mid-sized companies, and FANG. I've been through a few acquisitions and survived many layoffs.Well, I was recently laid off for the first time from a mid-sized, B-tier tech company that I was having a great time at, so I am out there applying again. It was due to the typical offshoring trend and I was grateful to have survived a few rounds of layoffs and wasn't too worried. I've never had a hard time getting responses from local companies, and probably most of the time I would get interviews, and most interviews I would get an offer. But this time is different.I've applied for about two dozen companies (hybrid or onsite, haven't expanded to remote yet) and gotten almost no response. I think I am more than qualified for them and am perfectly fine with the compensation and all of that (ie, I wasn't just randomly blasting applications out there, I was picking things I genuinely wanted to do). 2-3 companies sent me a rejection based on my application, I've talked to 2-3 recruiters, and had one ""onsite"" interview. So let's just say I've gotten any response at all from about 25-30% of the companies I sent applications to. This is much lower than I'm used to.Here is the thing: I'm starting to wonder if having been at FANG and Big Tech (even though it was B-tier) most recently has hurt my chances. Just a few years ago I would've thought that having FANG would be a huge benefit for job hunting. And the 2-3 recruiters I've talked to seemed to like it, like it would make me a more marketable candidate.But after the one onsite interview, I started to question that for the first time. I was prepared for a technical interview with maybe some behavioral, but the interviewer asked me quite a bit about FANG. I was surprised and got the feeling they thought negatively of it, like asking me about certain projects and responding with, ""So, you're saying you just wrote some Java?"" with a tone that they were downplaying what I did there.Don't get me wrong. Everything at FANG wasn't very impressive. The whole thing is mostly a joke (esp. the LeetCode interviews and corporate Kool Aid) and FANG tends to be a grindhouse for new grads who otherwise have no other experience, not a bunch of math geniuses writing crazy algorithms. But prior to that interview I didn't stop to think if I should mention it in my work history; it seemed obvious that I should. Now I'm starting to wonder all sorts of things like maybe companies are gonna think I'll ask for hundreds of thousands, that I only know how to do ""Big Tech non-sense"", or that I'll be a hard to work with.Do any hiring managers or ex-FANG have any thoughts on this? Seeing as how I am just looking for a local tech job where I can get work done and enjoy my time with the team, maybe I should just remove it from my work history?",21,0.68,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k7yw44/reluctance_to_hire_exfang_in_a_midsized_area/,2025-04-25 23:22:26,2025-04-30 01:38:29

With the job market being this rough, many people end up taking jobs they aren't necessarily passionate about (stepping stones) but they can't just immediately leave to not be flagged as a job hopper. *BTW, I'm thankful for having a job. I know it's tough out there.* How can they make the most of these opportunities?For example, what if the job uses a completely different tech stack than what you've worked with throughout your career, or even worse, historically the market don't want this tech stack, or if the role is different (i.e. transitioning from backend to frontend heavy fullstack), or you're not interested in the domain (i.e. insurance)? If you plan to stay in this job for at least 3 years while waiting for the job market to improve (if it ever does), how can you make the most of the situation?In my experience, becoming a domain expert and the goto person in a part of the system it's what makes you grow within an organization. However, becoming an expert requires time and effort, and both of these have an opportunity cost.So knowing that time is finite and I can just study so much while keeping all my other adult responsibilities, should I focus on becoming an expert in this new tech stack and domain to take ownership and grow, in detriment of my original stack, knowing that my original stack is still evolving and requires ongoing study, and that I might never use this new stack again?",15,0.7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k990t6/how_to_make_the_most_of_a_stepping_stone_job/,2025-04-27 17:12:27,2025-04-30 01:38:29

I am currently 23 and I was hired last year at General Motors in Michigan in the TRACK program where I currently work as a test engineer mainly working with controls and very little software, I mainly do personal projects at home. My base salary is 86k with a 10% bonus per year that can change based off factors. I have a job offer at Honeywell for 104k base no bonus in Phoenix, AZ, as an Electrical Engineer 2 in military avionics. I was told its a mix of hardware and software for this role. My goal for my career is to get into software preferably at a tech company as I enjoy coding and know the pay is better. I work on side projects and plan on getting certifications and such to help appeal to those tech companies hopefully soon. I know I will prefer Phoenix in terms of location but I am unsure of what might be better for my career. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I want to move to game dev but I don’t know the first thing about it. I don’t love developing, I just kind of like it, but when I first started I think I really did love it and now I just feel like I’m on autopilot and I suck at what I do.

I am a very calm person who is easy to get along with, so I'm almost positive that it isn't my attitude causing this.He will also call me out publically in front of the team/ grill me on technical details in meetings (he does this to others, not just me). This is odd to me, because prior to the tech industry, I followed the standard of praise in public, punish in private. Not sure if this is normal or not.Generally speaking, I get the feeling that my manager just simply doesn't like me or want/ care about my success. I have not once felt like he was on my side, rather that he is a barrier that I would need to overcome to get to where I want to go.Despite this, I've heard from others that he is a good manager.

1k9m9x1,When to give resignation when job hopping?,man_im_rarted,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I'm a relatively new developer about to leave my first non-internship role for a significant pay increase. I currently work at a local Fortune 500 company's office making ~$85k/year, and have been here for almost a year. I've accepted an offer as an SDE-1 from one of the major tech giants for approximately double my current salary. The new offer is in the same city, so thankfully I don't have to handle moving logistics along with everything else here.I have received e-contracts that I've clicked ""sign"" on (not sure how binding these are?), and their background check is currently underway. I have *not* been introduced to my manager or gotten team match confirmation yet, but I've heard that this can often take until a week before your start date at this specific company. Technically the offer could still be rescinded, but I think that's fairly unlikely.My start date at the new company is June 9th, and I have a pre-planned europe trip the last half of May. I'm trying to decide between three options:1. Resign now: Give my full two weeks' notice, finish cleanly, then enjoy my vacation and an additional week completely job-free before starting the new position.2. Resign after vacation: Return from my trip and immediately submit my resignation, giving slightly less than two weeks for documentation and handover. This approach would also eliminate any risk of the offer being rescinded while I'm already unemployed.3. Sandwich notice period with vacation: Resign one week before vacation, and offer to work one more week after I get back. This would give them a long time to decide what to do, and would hopefully let the background check clear before I give them notice of my departure. The downside is mostly that this would feel kind of weird to me, but maybe it's more normal than I think?What would be the most professional approach in this situation? Any insights from those who have navigated similar transitions would be greatly appreciated.

Job market was rough for international students, and big tech wasn’t hiring, but I was fortunate enough to get a return offer from my internship at a mid-sized company. I was doing ML research and modelling work in a lab before my job but I’m now working in the ML Platform/MLOps team.Work involves building big data platforms, data drift monitoring, IAC, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, model deployment, Docker, load balancers, async programming, and building semantic search engines.Stack: Python, PySpark, AWS, Databricks, Docker, Pulumi, asyncio.Fully remote, good WLB, $118k base + $50k~$60k RSUs over 4 years with a bulk of it vested towards the end. Grateful to have something stable in this economy. But the compensation doesn’t increase much in the long run in my company compared to big tech and its always been my dream to work at a big tech like google.A few questions:1. ML work here in my company is mostly calling LLM APIs which I find boring. One of the main reasons why I switched to MLOps. If you are an MLE at a big tech how does your work look like? If I pivot, I’d want to focus on Information Retrieval/RecSys.2. I enjoy the engineering side more. Should I stay in ML Platform roles or move toward more traditional MLE roles?3. How’s ML Platform Engineering for long-term career growth? 4. Should I stay a year more and try for SDE 2 equivalent roles at FAANG/big tech?

When the pandemic ended, I eventually got to move to a different company and do Java development instead.My problem is, I only have 2+ years of professional experience with Java. I've been working for way longer than that but I'm treated more like a mid level developer because my only experience in Java is that long and nobody seems to care about my 4 years of experience in COBOL because to be quite honest, it's a really outdated language. I'm unable to break into the senior developer level in my company because I need more years of experience with Java.To make things worse, I have zero work experience in frameworks, APIs, microservices, cloud development, etc. The Java project I worked on didn't have those, or at least didn't have me do work in those. I never got to work on CI/CD or databases because that's not the task I got assigned to. I got to do side tasks like automation with Excel VBA macros but that doesn't seem to be as helpful for my resume as it sounds.Meanwhile, I see others younger than me get to be 5 years of experience, have experience with things like AWS, microservices, frameworks, RedHat, containers, etc.Did they just get lucky in their projects and I got unlucky?

1kaan9k,30 days into Network operations role -- Did I step into unsustainable chaos?,Fit_Personality_2191,cscareerquestions,"I started a new position 30 days ago at an MSP (Managed Service Provider) as a Network Operations Manager.My original understanding was that I'd lead infrastructure migration projects at a structured, strategic pace — taking ownership of planning, execution, and building operational discipline.I knew the environment might be somewhat messy — and I actually saw that as an opportunity to bring structure where it was needed.But instead, an existing senior team member (let's call him Mark) immediately flooded the process with urgency:– Meetings all day, often back-to-back– Little to no time to plan deeply, reflect, or organize properly– Constant interruptions and ad hoc requests — expectation to be hyper-responsive– No official timeline from leadership, but Mark imposed a fast-track timeline anywayMeanwhile, the CTO — who I technically report to — is largely absent:– Doesn’t respond to emails– Doesn’t return calls– Occasionally appears briefly (e.g., grabbing a sandwich at the airport) but otherwise offers no active guidanceI also hired two team members early on, originally planning to assign them to focused infrastructure projects.But with the current chaos, they are now being treated as generalists, expected to somehow cover a wide range of topics, including undocumented environments.Additionally, while I was never explicitly told it was a ""cloud-first MSP,"" the way the role was presented (focused on infrastructure modernization and migration leadership) led me to assume it was heavily cloud-oriented.In reality:– Only about 20% of the infrastructure is actually cloud-based.– Roughly 40% is legacy systems, many undocumented, requiring reverse engineering just to understand what's running.(For context, during the interview I asked for a website to learn more about the company, and was told they didn’t have one — in hindsight, that probably should have been a red flag.)The biggest problem:I was hired to bring structure, but the current rhythm is so accelerated that trying to implement thoughtful leadership would simply slow things down.In short:– I feel I’ve lost the leadership narrative I was hired for.– I’m being forced to play at their chaotic rhythm instead of leading with my own structure and pace.Mark himself is extremely intense:– Wakes up at 3–5 AM– Eats lunch by 9 AM– Spends afternoons studying for certifications — while pushing the team at full speedI was aiming for a leadership role where I could build, structure, and scale — not a permanent crisis-response role in a fragmented environment.Am I overreacting?Is this just what IT leadership looks like today?You're welcome to criticize me.I’d appreciate any references:– Is this 50%, 70%, 90% of IT leadership roles now?– Is this common across MSPs?– Or are there still companies where structured leadership and thoughtful execution are respected?\-- Does it make sense to stay 2 weeks more, or do you see a long term position worth enduring?Thanks for reading — I’m trying to calibrate my expectations.",5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kaan9k/30_days_into_network_operations_role_did_i_step/,2025-04-29 00:09:19,2025-04-30 01:38:29
1k9zj0o,Self taught dev seeking advice (Early career),Buhnanner,cscareerquestions,"Hey all,I am a self taught developer that managed to somewhat break into the industry back in late 2021 by getting hired at a local supply chain business for my Python skillset- this was a very amateur environment, as I was the only developer there, and cringe at some of the practices I was following looking back today (just for context). I spent 3 years there until getting hired into a very small startup position as a full stack dev last July.I am approaching my first year in this position and our senior developer is being poached by our biggest client. I am definitely seeing this as an opportunity to sort of usurp his throne and grow into a more senior developer mindset- even if my experience doesn't say I'm senior-ready.With the way the market is right now, I'd think the best play would be to really ride out the position I'm in at the moment especially considering I do not have formal education.I guess I am just seeking wise words/valuable resources to help me get more into this senior mindset.",6,0.8,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k9zj0o/self_taught_dev_seeking_advice_early_career/,2025-04-28 16:16:09,2025-04-30 01:38:29
1k88ff9,"2022 CS Grad with no interviews, now what?",SadShaco,cscareerquestions,"I'm hitting my three year mark on my graduation (Rutgers) next month with not one single interview for a full-time position. I took a little under a year off to reset mentally because the COVID era of school seriously took a part of me with it and I needed to catch my breath before I imploded. Since then I have applied to any/everything with no hope in sight. I did one year of some bs AI Training gig that made me a bit of money, dried up, and hasn't helped land me any opportunities. Watching my friends that I graduated with all succeed is only making the dread and self-hatred worse. It feels like I gave up the last spot on a ride that closed before I was mentally prepared to get on board. Being this far removed from school I'm not a walking algorithm library anymore and would be a deer in headlights in any technical interview. I've been taking online courses on several things like REACT, .NET fullstack, and databases, to learn useful skills but still feels so helpless since I don't have the time to grind leetcode like I used to. It's all so frustrating because I know how to program, I'm a good learner, and some part of me still wants this career so badly. But, I'm 25 now and hate how unworthy I feel solely because I'm a real person with struggles that got the best of me. Anyways, I don't know what kind of advice I'm expecting, unloading this was more of a therapeutic release because I feel ashamed when I talk about this with my friends.

1k61ljo,What are Experienced Devs in the Job Market Doing to get Noticed/Callbacks?,AmazinglyAudrey,cscareerquestions,"Been out of work since December due to a RIF event. 16 years of experience, experience across tech stacks, I've always been able to just pick up a new language and go. I'm putting in the work - applied to 160 jobs last month alone. Gonna top 200 this month. All of these are jobs that that were posted in the last 24 hours. I dedicate myself to job searching every weekday. I'm learning tech stacks that aren't on my resume (python, node, typescript, react). I've applied to senior positions (where I am professionally), mid-level, and even junior positions. I've applied to jobs that would give me a 20% paycut. Local jobs, remote jobs, hybrid jobs... (I don't have a car, so hoping if I can get my foot in the door, I can work out time to earn a paycheck and get a car). During the 5 months that I've been searching for a job, I've had one follow-up where someone said they were interested, and then ghosted. Other than that, it's been all rejections and no responses. I genuinely don't know what I'm doing wrong. I get that the industry is in crisis at the moment, largely due to the huge tax burden being a developer in the US causes now.Are y'all devs with more than 10 years experience also facing such huge challenges in finding a job? Are y'all using bots to apply or something? I'm out of ideas on what else to do and close to losing unemployment trying to stay afloat during this sucky time.

1k6nwhk,"Torn between SE, ES and ML",louleads,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR : I have built some projects in ES and SE and liked ES a bit more but find SE to have more opportunities even though it might become so boring and hellish. Didn't try building any ML projects but I think ML jobs will be highly demanded in the future due to the fast progress of AI and what people are saying online (maybe thats just hype).I can't decide between software engineering, embedded systems and machine learning. I like them all and have had experience with some of them but I know that I can't be a jack of all trades.For embedded systems, I have built 2 arduino projects back in high school (currently I'm in my second year of CS uni). First one was a basic project with some LEDs and some code to make the LEDs light in different ways. Second one was a car that follows a black line and avoids obstacles. I really enjoyed and loved it. Though I have no idea what the market is for ES.For software engineering, I have not made any full projects, just some basic terminal projects, like fizzbuzz and some python scripts that automated some tasks for me. I'm currently in the process of making my first uni project (a games library with search and user authentification functionalities). I'm also going to have an internship this summer as a web dev. I enjoyed the small projects a lot, but I don't know how I'll feel about this project by the time I finish it or about the web dev internship. However, I think I have the best chance at this since I'm from a third world country and I think finding jobs in SE would be easier (not easy, just easier).For machine learning, I haven't tried anything yet. I have planned a final project for my bachelors, which is going to be an AI customer support agent (a family member has a business and suggested I try making that tool for their business). I don't know anything about ML, but I know it requires a lot of math, and I've been a math nerd since high school (solved about 1000+ math problems in my last year of high school). I also think that ML will be a ""goldmine"" for those who choose it now because I keep seeing online that ML jobs will be in high demand in the future.I know I'm deciding what I want to do based on my feelings, but I want to choose something that I'm not gonna regret by the time I turn 30. For example, I like some aspects of software engineering, but I do know that many software engineers hate their jobs because of how shit the work environment is in many companies (too many meetings, coding the same shit everyday...etc).What should I base my decision on? Preference? Market state? Opportunities?And how should I know if I actually enjoy any of these (if I should choose based on passion)?I appreciate anybody who took the time to read this.",4,0.84,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6nwhk/torn_between_se_es_and_ml/,2025-04-24 09:22:39,2025-04-30 01:38:29
