1ox84x9,"Sanity check: am I crazy for feeling like my ""data engineering"" position is a dead end?",lostmyway573,dataengineering,"Obvious throwaway account is obvious.My job is a data engineer for a medium-ish sized company, been here for just over 4 years. This is my first ""data"" job, but I learned a good bit about SQL in previous roles. Our department / my team manages our BI data warehouse, and we have a couple of report developers as well. When I read and study about modern data engineering practices, or modern development practices / AI usage, I feel like I'm a caveman rubbing sticks together while watching flying cars go by me every day. I'm considering switching to a DevOps position in my company because I enjoy working with Linux and smaller applications, but also because I feel like this position is a complete dead end - I have no room to exert creativity or really learn anything on the job because of the reasons I'll detail below.Until about 2 years ago, our data warehouse was basically one large SQL database (MS SQL). Standard Kimball-style facts/dimensions, with a handful of other nonstandard tables scattered here and there. We also have a few separate databases that act as per-department ""sandboxes"" for business analysts to build their own stuff, but that's a whole separate story. The whole thing is powered by SSIS packages; OLTP data transformed to a star schema in most cases. Most of it appears to be developed by people who learned SSIS before SQL, because in almost every process, the business logic is baked into transformations instead of scripts or code. I expected this from a legacy setup, and shortly after I started working here it became known that we were going to be migrating to the cloud and away from this legacy stuff, so I thought it was a temporary problem that we'd be walking away from.How naive I was.Problem #1: We have virtually no documentation, other than the occasional comment within code if I'm lucky. We have no medallion architecture. We have no data dictionary. Pretty much all the knowledge of how a majority of our data interacts is tribal knowledge within my department and the business analysts who have been here for a long time. Even the business logic of our reports that go to the desks of the C-levels gets argued about sometimes because it's not written down anywhere. We've had no standard code practices (ever) so one process to the next could employ a totally different design approach.Problem #2: Enter the cloud migration phase. At first, this sounded like the lucky break I was hoping for - a chance to go hands-on with Snowflake and employ real data engineering tools and practices and rebuild a lot of the legacy stuff that we've dealt with since our company's inception. Sadly, that would have been way too easy... Orders came down from the top that we needed to get this done as a lift-and-shift, so we paid a consulting company to use machine learning to convert all of our SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory pipelines en masse. Since we don't have a data dictionary or any real documentation, we really had no way to offer test cases for validating data after the fact. We spent months manually validating table data against table data, row by row. Now we're completely vendor-locked with ADF, which is a massive pile of shit for doing surgical-level transformations like we do. Problem #2A: Architecture. Our entire architecture was decided by one person - a DBA who, by their own admission, has never been a developer of any sort, so they had no idea how complex some of our ETL processes were. Our main OLTP system is staying on-prem, and we're replicating its database up to Snowflake using a third-party tool as our source. Then our ADF processes transform the data and deposit it back to Snowflake in a separate location. I feel like we could have engineered a much simpler solution than this if we were given a chance, but this decision was made before my team was even involved. (OneLake? Dynamic Tables?)Problem #3: Project management, or the lack thereof. At this inception of this migration, the decision to use ADF was made without consulting anyone in my department, including our manager. Similarly, the decision to just convert all of our stuff was made without input from our department. We were also never given a chance to review any of our existing stuff to determine if anything was deprecated; we paid for all of it to be converted, debugged it, and half of it is defunct. Literal months of manpower wasted. Problem #4: Looking ahead. If I fast forward to the end of this migration phase and look at what my job is going to be on a daily basis, it boils down to wrestling with Azure Data Factory every day and dissecting tiny bits of business logic that are baked into transformations, with layers upon layers of unnecessary complexity, let alone the aforementioned lack of code standardization.This doesn't feel like data engineering, this feels like janitorial code cleanup as a result of poor project planning and no foresight. I'm very burned out and it feels hopeless to think there's any real data engineering future here. I recently picked up the Snowflake SnowPro Core certification in my downtime because I really enjoy working with the platform, and I've also been teaching myself a bit about devops in my spare time at home (built a homelab / NAS, stood up some containers, gonna be playing with K3S this weekend). The saving grace is my team of fellow developers. We've managed to weed out the turds over the past year, so the handful of us on the team all work really well together, collaborate often, and genuinely enjoy each other while being in the trenches. At the moment, I'm staying for the clowns and not the circus. Am I crazy, or is this a shitshow? Would anybody else stay here, or how would anyone else proceed in this situation? Any input is welcomed.edit: for clarity, current architecture boils down to: source OLTP > replicated to Snowflake via third-party tool > ADF for ETL/ELT > destination Snowflake",89,0.91,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox84x9/sanity_check_am_i_crazy_for_feeling_like_my_data/,2025-11-14 20:49:34,2025-11-20 01:39:39

1owxk6b,Why is transforming data still so expensive,Hofi2010,dataengineering,"In an enterprise setting we spend $100k+, in bigger orgs even $xM+ for transforming data at scale. To create the perfect data source for our business partners. Which often or most of the time is under utilized. To do this we use a data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake) or lakehouse (Databricks, ADF, …). The new platform made it easier to handle the data, but it comes with a cost. They are designed for big data (TB’s to PB’s of data), but arguably in most organization most data sources are a fraction of this size. Those solutions are also designed to lock you in with proprietary compute and data formats as they say necessary to provide the best performance. Whenever our Redshift Datawarehouse struggled to keep up AWS’s answer was, “oh your cluster head node is not keeping up with the demand you should upgrade to the next bigger instance type” problem solved and cost was doubled. But now with cheap object storage and open data formats like iceberg it should be possible to get the same performance than Snowflake, Redshift and Databricks at a fraction of the cost. But in order to transform your data you need compute and your data need to be ingested into the compute, transformed and written back in the transformed format to your datalake. The object storage and network speed between storage and compute is usually your bottleneck here. I made some experiments with different EC2 instances and duckdb (just saying I am not affiliated with the product). I had a 85GB timeseries data stream (iceberg) that needed to be pivoted and split into 100 individual tables. On a regular general purpose compute instance t3g.2xlarge that took about 6-7 hours to complete. Then I used i4g memory optioned instances with more memory and network bandwidth up 25 Gbps and it halfed the time. Then I found these new instances network optimized c8gn and they managed to do all 100 tables in 20 mins. Compare this to databricks (Databricks was reading from s3), which took 3 hours. Databricks cost for this transform was $9.38 and the EC2 instance did it for $1.70. So huge savings with a bit of engineering.Wanted to share this and wanted to hear some stories from others in their pursuit of cheaper data transformation options EDIT: just to clarify. I am not proposing get rid of data warehouse or lakehouse, just saying you can save by “outsourcing” compute for batch transformations to much cheaper compute options so you can keep your actual warehouse/lakehouse small.",66,0.9,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1owxk6b/why_is_transforming_data_still_so_expensive/,2025-11-14 14:13:07,2025-11-20 01:39:39

1p10z2v,Apache Iceberg and Databricks Delta Lake - benchmarked,niga_chan,dataengineering,"For every other data engineer or someone in higher hierarchy down the road comes to a choiuce of Apache Iceberg or Databricks Delta Lake, so we went ahead and benchmarked both systems. Just sharing our experience here.TL;DR Both formats have their perks: Apache Iceberg offers an open, flexible architecture with surprisingly fast query performance in some cases, while Databricks Delta Lake provides a tightly managed, all-in-one experience where most of the operational overhead is handled for you.Setup & MethodologyWe used the TPC-H 1 TB dataset  which is a dataset of about 8.66 billion rows across 8 tables to compare the two stacks end-to-end: ingestion and analytics.For the Iceberg setup: We ingested data from PostgreSQL into Apache Iceberg tables on S3, orchestrated through OLake’s high-throughput CDC pipeline using AWS Glue as catalog and EMR Spark for query.. Ingestion used 32 parallel threads with chunked, resumable snapshots, ensuring high throughput. On the query side, we tuned Spark similarly to Databricks (raised shuffle partitions to 128 and disabled vectorised reads due to Arrow buffer issues).For the Databricks Delta Lake setup: Data was loaded via the JDBC connector from PostgreSQL into Delta tables in 200k-row batches. Databricks’ managed runtime automatically applied file compaction and optimized writes. Queries were run using the same 22 TPC-H analytics queries for a fair comparison.This setup made sure we were comparing both ingestion performance and analytical query performance under realistic, production-style workloads.What We Found* We used OLake to ingest to Iceberg and was about 2x faster - 12 hours vs 25.7 hours on Databricks thanks to parallel chunked ingestion.* Iceberg ran the full TPC-H suite 18% faster than Databricks.* Cost: Infra cost was 61% lower on Iceberg + OLake (around $21.95 vs $50.71 for the same run).here are the overall result and our ideology on this-Databricks still wins on ease-of-use: you just click and go. Cluster setup, Spark tuning, and governance are all handled automatically. That’s great for teams that want a managed ecosystem and don’t want to deal with infrastructure.But if your team is comfortable managing a Glue/AWS stack and handling a bit more complexity, Iceberg + OLake’s open architecture wins on pure numbers  faster at scale, lower cost, and full engine flexibility (Spark, Trino, Flink) without vendor lock-in.read our article to know more on our steps followed and the overall benchmarks and the numbers around it curious to know what you people think.

1p18o83,"Unpopular opinion: Most ""Data Governance Frameworks"" are just bureaucracy. Here is a model that might actually work (federated/active)",NeverheardofAkro,dataengineering,"Lately I’ve been deep diving into data governance because our ""wild west"" data stack is finally catching up with us. I’ve read a ton of dry whitepapers and vendor guides, and I wanted to share a summary of a framework that actually makes sense for modern engineering teams (vs. the old-school ""lock everything down"" approach).I’m curious if anyone here has successfully moved from a centralized model to a federated one?The Core Problem: Most frameworks treat governance as a ""police function."" They create bottlenecks. The modern approach (often called ""Active Governance"") tries to embed governance into the daily workflow rather than making it a separate compliance task.Here is the breakdown of the framework components that seem essential:1.) The Operating Model (The ""Who"") You basically have three choices. From what I’ve seen, #3 is the only one that scales:- Centralized: One team controls everything. (Bottleneck city).- Decentralized: Every domain does whatever they want. (Chaos).- Federated/Hybrid: A central team sets the ""Standards"" (security, quality metrics), but the individual Domain Teams (Marketing, Finance) own the data and the definitions.2.) The Pillars (The ""What"") If you are building this from scratch, you need to solve for these three:- Transparency: Can people actually find the data? (Catalogs, lineage).- Quality: Is the data trustworthy? (Automated testing, not just manual checks).- Security: Who has access? (RBAC, masking PII).3.) The ""Left-Shift"" Approach This was a key takeaway for me: Governance needs to move ""left."" Instead of fixing data quality in the dashboard (downstream), we need to catch it at the source (upstream).- Legacy way: Data Steward fixes a report manually.- Modern way: The producer is alerted to a schema change or quality drop before the pipeline runs.The Tooling Landscape I've been looking at tools that support this ""Federated"" style. Obviously, you have the big clouds (Purview, etc.), but for the ""active"" metadata part, where the catalog actually talks to your stack (Snowflake, dbt, Slack), tools like Atlan or Castor seem to be pushing this methodology the hardest.Question for the power users of this sub: For those of you who have ""solved"" governance, did you start with the tool or the policy first? And how do you get engineers to care about tagging assets without forcing them?Thanks!",20,0.72,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p18o83/unpopular_opinion_most_data_governance_frameworks/,2025-11-19 14:10:12,2025-11-20 01:39:39

Not writing endless amount of repeated tedious code (or having AI write endless repeating tedious code for me). What I mean is all of the CTEs I need to write for each bucket/feature requested, so like CTE\_a\_category\_last\_month with a where clause on category and timeframe. My first thought was doing the buckets in Python would help but upon research everyone recommends to use SQL for pretty much everything up until machine learning.2. Run-time. Because of the sheer amount of features that were requested of me (400 for now, but they want to go more granular with categories so it's gonna be like 1000 more), the 400 take a while to run, about 15 minutes. Maybe 15 minutes isn't that bad? Idk but the non-technical people above me aren't happy with it.Pre-Context:I am not the one coming up with the asks, I am a junior, I have very little power or say or access. This means no writing to PROD, only reading, and I have to use PROD. Yes I can use AI but I am not looking for AI suggestions because I know how to use AI and I'm already using it. I want human input on the smartest most elegant solution.Also to preface I have a bunch of experience with SQL, but not so much experience with Python beyond building machine learning algorithms and doing basic imputation/re-expression, which is why I'm not sure what tool is better.Context-context:I work with transaction data. We have tables with account info, customer info, transaction code info, etc. I've already aggregated all of the basic data and features, runs pretty fast. But once I add the 400 buckets/features, it runs slow. For each transaction category and a bunch of time frames (ie. month buckets for the past two years, so you'll have a\_category\_last\_month, a\_category\_last\_last\_month, b\_category\_last\_month, etc) I need to do a bunch of heavy aggregations ie minimum amount spent on a single day during given month.Right now it's all done in SQL. I'm working on optimizing the query, but there is only so much I can do and I dread working on the new 1000 categories they want. What is the best way to go about my task? What would SQL handle better and be better/more elegant for code written vs Python? AI suggested to create a row for each feature instead of column for every single customer and then have Python pivot it, is this a good option?

1oxamdy,Monitoring: Where do I start?,General_Treat_924,dataengineering,"TLDRDBA here, in many years of career, my biggest drama to fight were always metrics or lack of.Places always had a bare minimum monitoring scripts/applications and always reactive. Meaning only if it’s broken, it alerts.I’m super lazy and I don’t want to be awake 3am to fix something that I knew was going to break hours, days ahead. So as a side gig, I always tried to create meaning metrics. Today my company relies a lot on a grafana+prometheus setup I created because the our application as a black box. Devs would rely on reading logs and hoping for the best to justify a behaviour that maybe was normal, maybe was always like that. So grafana just proved it right or wrong.Decisions are now made by people “watching grafana”. This metric here means this, this other means that. And both together means that.While it still a very small side project, now I have been given people to help me to leverage that to the entire pipeline, which is fairly complex from the business perspective, and time consuming, given I don’t have a deep knowledge of any of these tools and infrastructure behind it and I learn as I find challenges.I was just a DBA with a side project hahaa.Finally my question:Where do I start? I mean, I already started, but I wonder if I can make use of ML to create meaning alerts/metrics.

Were on managed Airflow (not US-hyperscaler) and i need to fetch data from a mariadb that is part of a external VPN. Were talking relatively small data, the entire DB has around 300GB. For accessing the VPN i received a openvpn profile and credentials. The Airflow workers themselves have access to public internet and are not locked inside a network.Now im looking for a clean and robust approach. As im the sole data person i prioritize low maintenance over performance. disclaimer: Im def reaching my knowledge limits with this problem as i still got blind spots regarding networking, please excuse dumb questions or naive thoughts. I see two solution directions: a) somehow keeping everything inside the Airflow instance: installing a openvpn client during DAG runtime (working with docker operator or kubernetespodoperator)? --> idek if i got the necessary privileges on the managed instance to make this work b) setting up a separate VM as a bridge in our cloud that has openvpn client+proxy and is being accessed via SSH from the airflow workers? On the VM i would whitelist the Airflow workers IP (which is static).a) feels like im looking for trouble, but i cant pinpoint as im new to both these operators.

1ozd7o5,Time for change,More-Freedom-7890,dataengineering,"**Introduction**i am based in Switzerland and have been working in the field of data & analytics as a consultant for a little over 5 years. I worked mostly within the SAP analytics ecosystem with some exposure to GCP. I did a bunch of e learning courses over the years and realized it is more or less a waste of time unless you actually get to apply that knowledge in a real project, better sooner than later.Technical skill-wise: mostly SQL, Python here and there and a lot of ABAP 3 years ago. The rest of the time just using GUIs (SAP users will know what i am talking about) **Expectations / Priorities:**1. I would like to switch from consultant to inhouse. 2. I would like to diversify my skill set and add some non-SAP tools and technologies to my skill set.3. I would like to strike a better balance between pure data engineering (as in coding, SQL, data analysis, data cleansing etc.) vs. other parts of the job: doing workshops, communication, collaborating with team members. Wouldnt mind gaining some managerial responsiblity either. Past 3 years i felt like a ""only"" data analyst, writing mostly SQL and analyzing data.4. Over the course of these 5 years i never really felt like i was part of a team working on a mission with a any degree of purpose whatsoever. Would like to have more of that in my life.5. I would like to stay located in Switzerland but open to work remotely.I applied to a decent amount of jobs and having a tough time to find an entry point with my starting position. I would be more than happy to prepare before starting a new position through online courses in case there it is expected to have knowledge around certains tools / products / technologies.I am also considering to do freelancing, but i am unsure how much of the above list would actually improve in that setting. Also i wouldnt really know where and how to start / get clients and would require some networking i suppose. I am reducing my working hours next year to introduce more flexibility to my daily life and foster my search for a more fulfilling job setup.

1ox5kta,Would using Azure Data Factory in this Context be Overkill?,Sea_Manufacturer2244,dataengineering,"I work for a small organization and we have built an ETL pipeline with Python and SQL for Power BI dashboards. Here is the current process:There are multiple python scripts connected to each other by importing in-memory dataframes. One script runs multiple complex SQL queries concurrently and there are other scripts for transforming the data and uploading to SQL server. The pipeline transfers 3 MB of data each time since it queries the most recent data and takes 2 to 3 minutes to execute each day.This is hard to automate because the databases require VPN which needs 2fa. So we have been working with the IT solutions team to automate the pipeline.The easiest way to automate this would be to deploy the code onto a VM and have it run on a schedule. However, the solutions team has proposed a different approach with Azure Data Factory:* ADF orchestrator invokes ""Copy Data"" activity via self-hosted IR via to the source DB* Data is copied into Azure Blob Storage* Function App executes transformations in the Python scripts* Self-hosted IR invokes ""Copy Data"" with Source as transformed data and the SQL Server as the sinkThe IT solutions deparment said this is the best approach because Microsoft supports PaaS over IaaS and there would be overhead of managing the VM.I am just wondering if this solution would be overkill because our pipeline is very small scale (only 3 MB of data transferred on each run) and we are not a large company.The other problem is that nobody on the team knows Azure. Even though the IT solutions team will implement everything, it will still need to be maintained. The team consists of a business analyst who only knows SQL and not Python, a co-op student who changes every 4 months and myself. I am just a student who has worked here on many co-op and part time roles (currently part time). The business analyst delegates all the major technical tasks to the co-op students so when I leave, the pipeline will be managed by another co-op student who will only be there for 4 months.Management currently support the ADF approach because it is Microsoft best practice. They believes that using a VM will not be best practice and they will need to hire another person to fix everything if it breaks. They also want to move to Fabric in the future for its AI/ML capabilities even though we can just build ML pipelines in Python.I am not sure if I am overthinking this or the ADF solution is truly overkill. I am fine with learning Azure technologies and not opposed to it but I want to build something that can be maintained.",6,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox5kta/would_using_azure_data_factory_in_this_context_be/,2025-11-14 19:10:54,2025-11-20 01:39:39
1ox4uvz,Need tips on a hybrid architecture for both real-time BI and ML,overwhelmed_and_shy,dataengineering,"Hello everyone,I’m a CTO of a small startup in South America (limited budget, of course) with a background in software development. While I have academic knowledge in Machine Learning, AI explicability, and related topics, I’ve never worked on a professional data team or project. In most academic projects, we work with ready-to-use datasets, so I’ve never had to think about creating datasets from scratch.We’re a 60-person company, with only 5 in tech, working in the accounting industry. We have four main applications, each with its own transactional Postgres database:- Backend: Serves a hybrid mobile/web app for customers and a back-office application for employees. It handles resources for customer enterprises and our in-house CRM.- Tasks: An internal task and process orchestration app (using Camunda).- CMS: A content system for website campaigns, offers, landing pages, etc.- Docs: An internal Wiki with markdown files documenting processes, laws, rules, etc.The databases are relatively small for now: Backend has 120 tables, Tasks has 50, and most tables have around 500k rows from 4 years of operation. We’ve plugged all of them into Metabase for BI reporting. We have some TVs around the office with real-time dashboards refreshing every 30s (for example for the sales team tracks daily goals and our fiscal team tracking new urgent due tasks). Employees also use detailed tables for their day-to-day needs, often filtering and exporting to Excel.We’ve hit some bumps in our performance and need advice on how to scale efficiently. Most BI reports go through a view in the Backend database that consolidates all customer data, which contains many joins (20+) and CTEs. This setup works well enough for now, but I’m starting to worry as we scale. On top of that, we have some needs to keep track tasks in our Camunda system that are late but only for delinquent customers, so I have to join the data from our Backend database. I've tried Trino/Presto for that but it had a really bad performance and now we are using a Postgres Foreign Data Wrapper and its working well so far... Joining data from our Camunda system with the Backend database to track late tasks, the query performance takes a big hit since it's going through the same consolidated view (it was either that or repeat the same joins over and over again). To address this, we’ve decided it’s time to create a Data Warehouse to offload these heavy queries from the databases. We’re using read replicas, indexes, etc., but I want to create a robust structure for us to grow.Additionally, we’re planning to integrate data from other sources like Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads, partner APIs (e.g., WhatsApp vendor), and PDF content (tax guides, fiscal documents, bank reports, etc.). We’d like to use this data for building ML models and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), etc.We’ve also been exploring the idea of a Data Lake to handle the raw, unstructured data. I’m leaning toward a medallion architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold layers) and pushing the ""Gold"" datasets into an OLAP database for BI consumption. The goal would be to also create ML-ready datasets in Parquet format.Cost is a big factor for us. Our current AWS bill is under USD 1K/month, which covers virtual machines, databases, cloud containers, etc. We’re open to exploring other cloud providers and potentially multi-cloud solutions, but cost-effectiveness is key.I’m studying a lot about this but am unsure of the best path forward, both in terms of architecture and systems to use. Has anyone dealt with a similar scenario, especially on a budget? Should we focus on building a Data Warehouse first, or would implementing a Data Lake be more beneficial for our use case? What tools or systems would you recommend for building a scalable, cost-efficient data pipeline? Any other advice or best practices for someone with an academic background but limited hands-on experience in data engineering?Thanks in advance for any tip",5,0.73,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox4uvz/need_tips_on_a_hybrid_architecture_for_both/,2025-11-14 18:44:04,2025-11-20 01:39:39

1p05nq4,Are there any benefits of duplicating data?,Beatsu,dataengineering,"At work we have a data source exposed through a Django API that another team is developing and maintaining. We need data from that data source, and right now instead of querying that Django API directly, we have a C# backend that manually models a lot of the same data as the Django API but with a slightly different structure/models, and then we have a cronjob that synchronizes the data from one database to the other using both APIs every 10 minutes. The cronjob took a week to implement. Last month, someone on my team spent 2 weeks simply updating the model in our backend because we needed some new data from the Django API and it didn't really fit in to our models. That also required a new synchronization cronjob to be created, and the old one broke. The tech lead for the team says that the benefit of this system is that if the service we are relying on goes down, we still have enough data to show important information. I've asked why we don't just create automated replicas in different clusters (we already have replica sets for everything that gets deployed), and he said that the world is just not that simple and that bugs would still propagate through all replicas.So am I just inexperienced, or should we be querying the main data source?",3,0.72,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p05nq4/are_there_any_benefits_of_duplicating_data/,2025-11-18 07:24:43,2025-11-20 01:39:39

After many iterations, this exploration eventually matured into what I now call Internet Object (IO).Key characteristics that came out of the design process:* schema-first by design (data and metadata clearly separated)* row-like nested structures (reduce repeated keys and structural noise)* predictable layout that is easier to stream or parse incrementally* richer type system for better validation and downstream consumption* human-readable but still structured enough for automation* about 40-50 percent fewer tokens than the equivalent JSON* compatible with JSON concepts, so developers are not learning from scratchThe article below is the first part of a multi-part series.

1ozmryz,Data acccess to external consumers,maxbranor,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I'm curious about how the data folk approaches one thing: if you expose Snowflake (or any other data platform's) data to people external from your organization, how do you do it? In a previous company I worked for, they used Snowflake to do the heavy lifting and allowed internal analysts to hit Snowflake directly (from golden layer on). But the datatables with data to be exposed to external people were copied everyday to AWS and the external people would get data from there (postgres) to avoid unpredictable loads and potential huge spikes in costs.In my current company, the backend is built such that the same APIs are used both by internals and externals - and they hit the operational databases. This means that if I want to allow internals to access Snowflake directly and make externals access processed data migrated back to Postgres/Mysql, the backend needs to basically rewrite the APIs (or at least have two subclasses of connectors: one for internal access, other for external access).I feel like preventing direct external access to the data platform is a good practice, but I'm wondering what the DE community thinks about it :)",2,0.6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ozmryz/data_acccess_to_external_consumers/,2025-11-17 17:41:04,2025-11-20 01:39:39

This setup has caused us nothing but headaches however. Sync stalling, a refresh taking ages, jobs not even starting, updates not working and recently I had to install it from scratch again to get it to run again and I'm still not sure why. It's really hard to debug/troubleshoot as well as the logs are not always as clear as you would like it to be. We've tried to use the cloud version as well but of these issues are existing there as well. Next to that cost predictability is important for us.Now we are looking for an alternative. We prefer to go for a solution that is low maintenance in terms of running it but with a degree of cost predictability. There are a lot of alternatives to airbyte as far as I can see but it's hard for us to figure out what fits us best.Our team is very small, only 1 person with know-how of infrastructure and 2 data engineers.Do you have advice for me on how to best choose the right tool/setup?

Don't start with Python.**Yeah, everyone says ""Python is easy"" and ""best for beginners"". The truth is, it's way too forgiving. I got used to writing code that worked without understanding what was actually happening under the hood. Then I jumped into Rust later and realized I basically had to relearn everything; memory, types, how the computer actually handles your code. If I could go back, I'd start with something a bit more challenging that actually teaches you the fundamentals.**2. Don't rely on AI chatbots.**I spent months having chatbots ""help"" me write code. Sure, it works, but I didn't actually learn anything. Struggle a bit, break things, debug it yourself. That's how real understanding happens.**3. Stop just following tutorials.**I wasted months cloning tutorials, thinking I was learning. Most of it didn't stick. The moment I started building tiny projects I actually cared about, things finally clicked. Even a dumb little project that scratches your own itch will teach you more than ten tutorials ever will.**4. Learn the tools, not just the language.**Knowing syntax isn't enough. Debugging, testing, version control, libraries, deployment... all that boring stuff actually matters. I ignored this at first, and it hurt me later when I tried to build real things.**5. Embrace being stuck.**If you're never confused, frustrated, or banging your head against a wall, you're not really learning.

The one skill I've always prided myself on is my adaptability. I pick things up pretty fast. The thing is, since I started this job, I feel like my stress and anxiety have been really high. It's not my boss, because honestly the work environment and my boss are absolutely amazing. They've been really supportive and encourage me to ask more questions, and they have told me that they know I'm new and will be slow, and with time and understanding I'll get faster, but I'm really paranoid that it's been 4 months and even though I'm a bit faster, I'm still pretty slow and for the past 3 months or so, I've been delivering tasks later than I'm supposed to, sometimes by a day or two, sometimes even longer. I feel like the stress is really clouding my thinking and it's causing me to feel really overwhelmed, and because I'm not able to get done within the working hours, I've been working off the clock too, and it feels like practically every waking hour I'm either worried about work or I'm working. Even my dreams are work related now. I feel like I'm not too bad yet, because I'm somehow still functioning, but I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a breakdown. The other day, I was really stressed out about not being able to complete work on time, and the team was testing the product, and found a bug in some code I had written a week ago. It was really minor, a change that I'd forgotten to push, but for some reason I started panicking a lot over it, and ended up leaving office early because I started to feel dizzy. Earlier this week, I was so stressed out while working from home that I straight up cried for almost an entire day. I've communicated the stress aspect with my boss a little bit, and he's been really understanding and kind, telling me that he understands that people don't function well under stress, asking why I'm feeling this way, if changing the scope of my work would help, and encouraging me to ask others for help more. He even told me I have an excellent work ethic, and that his only feedback for me so far is that I need to communicate more, rather than just giving status updates.The thing is, I don't know how to get out of my own head about this. I feel like I'm the slowest one at work, and everyone at work seems to know what they're doing. I feel like I am really far behind them in terms of skill, and it makes me even more worried about the fact that I'm slow. There isn't any external indication that they may fire me anytime soon, and I know that this is just a job and others will come along, but I just, don't know what to do. I barely have a life outside work, my parents are always worried when I call, because I barely talk to them, and when I do talk to them about how I'm doing, they're worried that I may be depressed or that the job is too much for me.

I then wire everything in a bash or PowerShell script and voila.Is the second way the ""standard"" or ""better"" way to do things, which I should default to?

If you don’t want to hear a rant, leave now. I’ve tried 30 times to make an MSIX package using the tool from an installer I made that works perfectly fucking fine. The process is completely unpredictable, the only thing I know with certainty is that it will fail. Well, one time I managed to make a working package but I was unable to reproduce it even when doing the exact same thing.The error logs. When I look at the error logs, it is like Greek. It makes no fucking sense. It will tell me I had a file name that was too long. Which file? No clue. What the filename was? Not provided. Utter horseshit. Another example: it tells me a file name somewhere in my 1.5GB of dependencies has an incorrect character. Which one? Who fucking knows. Horse shit.Meanwhile, you can download Advanced Installer to do the work for you. Oh wait, the professional license you need to make an MSIX installer is SIX HUNDRED fucking dollars; straight up evil. It’s like they know how fucking shit this process is and decided to take advantage of the pain. I honestly don’t know how anyone gets an app onto the Microsoft store. It seems impossible for a team of one, me, to do this. This process is so bureaucratic and bloated that you need about 20 different identifiers over your numerous files to all line up, just so you can say “yup, I made this.” Horse shit. Not to mention the signing process which is annoying as fuck.On the MSIX Packaging Tool, if your thing fails for whatever reason, you have to restart the process, meaning you have to uninstall your app, remove any extraneous files, restart your computer for good measure, and have a perfect working environment because it “watches” you install your app. What a great fucking idea. I’m sure nothing would interfere with that, ever.I’m angry. I’m pissed the fuck off. I have wasted so much time on this. I just want to submit something to the fucking Microsoft store. Why is that so fucking brutally hard? I have a perfectly working .exe installer and they could look at my source code for all I care. It’s so dumb.I’m tired.

If bots can easily pass as humans through all detection methods then my project is a non-starter. I know bots can do things like, be given spending money and then find a person to solve the captcha for them, but I'm just looking at what bots can do by themselves without any outside help.I'm finding some results through research, but none of it is what I would consider conclusive or scientific. Mostly I'm just finding people maybe making up stories, sharing anecdotes, that kinda thing. I'm not seeing a lot of demonstrations of bots beating captchas but then again if they were doing this I doubt I would see somebody uploading themselves doing it on youtube.I have some vague knowledge of how captchas work, and that a big part of why they work at all is because, at least in Google's case, they read a bunch of metadata such as speed, how you move your mouse, etc. But I'm very lacking in specifics and I'm open to learn more about them.From some demonstrations I've seen, it looks like if you show a captcha image test to an AI, it will correctly find the squares with the specific object. But then if the AI or an automated program tried to input those results, it would fail due to not passing the metadata stuff? Is that a correct assumption or can AI bypass these checks now? Wouldn't it be pretty trivial to beat this by just making a robot physically tap a phone screen?I'm not asking if captchas are 100% effective, because I know that's not possible. But even if they're 90% effective, for my purposes that would be good enough. Besides that I'm also open to implementing more ways to verify if someone is a bot, but I'm looking for methods that are quick and practical like how captchas are.

I based my Dissertation I did a software development project.For this project I basically attempted to mirror what the dev team at my place of work did. It was a Full Stack project:.Net C# BackendREACT frontendMVP Design PatternSQL Server ExpressORM (Microsoft Entity Framework Library) for interacting with the databaseThis burnt me out. Due to also working at a company that did not believe in work-life balance, I ended up rushing this project and the dissertation. Granted although not every feature was working perfectly, it did work. And yeah... I passed the module (and burnt out after a final month of finishing work at 5pm and coding or writing dissertation till 2am every day).Initially my tutor was very against me using this technology stack. As none of it was covered by the Open University. As well as pulling this off I was teaching myself C# from scratch, REACT from scratch and ORM from scratch (I shamefully admit, I had to ask chatGPT a few questions regarding that).Anyway, fast forward a year or so, and I am finally building a portfolio, as being in a more inf orientated job really does not suit me.So this week I started learning Flask. I actually have tried the very tutorials I have now completed previously and to be honest it confused the hell out of me. However... after my ordeal with C# and .Net, damn this just seems easy and straight forward. I would even say I am enjoying it.Anyway this weekend, I will be refactoring my Tic Tac Toe project to Flask and touching up the Vanilla HTML/CSS frontend I have already made (albeit zero functionality). And yeah.... I am going to need to start taking GitHub more seriously (ie a Readme file).I know this adds no value to any thing and is not even a question.

But it can be the case that the external API notification is okay, then the save to the db failed, and thus the API is already notified. If let's say there is a background job that periodically reruns the function, the API will be re-notified. Thus what I thought was to add a state Notifying such that before notification, and the state is not Notifying, then set the state to Notifying, then notify.

1ozndis,How can one train their brain to hold more simultaneous pieces of logic?,anabolicbob,learnprogramming,"I think that one of my biggest intellectual weaknesses is constructing a more complex chain of logic while at the same time remembering what has already been constructed and how they work together.While other areas have improved noticeably, such as the ability to break down problems into their smallest components or remember how the syntax works (using c++ BTW), I'm not sure my brain's ""multi-threading"" ability is improving significantly. Practically this means that even after coming up with the solution and battle plan, as soon as I get coding with a bunch of variables that need a class type from here with an instance from there calling something from another place, even trying to stay organized I can feel the spinning plates of data in my head get out of hand. My workaround is to comment the hell out of everything, for example ""// 'r' now contains a pointer to 'rects\_' from rect\_packer which has x, y, h, w, etc. data"" because even though it's so obvious at the time when I come back to it in a couple hours or a couple days I have to click through all the files again just to re-understand what is doing what. I've also thought perhaps I'm being to ""greedy"" with keeping stuff smooth in my head; afterall that's why we write stuff down so we don't have to be amazing at recall. To hopefully improve this ability I'm working on the Trachtenberg method and doing 3x3 digit multiplication which seriously over clocks my mental CPU but I can manage, however I'm not sure if there is something better I can do to improve the ""concurrent logic buffer"" size in my head.",7,1.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ozndis/how_can_one_train_their_brain_to_hold_more/,2025-11-17 18:02:48,2025-11-20 01:39:40

1p132gn,The 68000 BSET opcode does not allow the word extension,brianlhughes,learnprogramming,"I've been re-learning 68000 graphics programming using the Hatari emulator and the vasmm68k compiler and ran across a fairly disappointing limitation of the BSET instruction.The 320 x 200 ST video memory buffer is laid out in sets of 4 words to hold 16 pixels per set where the color palette index bit 3 of pixel 0 is the 1st word's most significant bit. Bit 2 of pixel 0 is in the 2nd word's most significant bit and so on. Pixel 1 is the OR of all the 2nd most significant bits of the 4 word set, kapish? The next 16 bits across are held in the next 4 word set in ram.Why didn't they simply place adjacent nibbles in memory to represent the pixel's palette index? Perhaps the decision was based on how the hardware draws the additional resolution modes where the number of words for the 4 color medium resolution mode is reduced to 2 and the highest resolution, monochrome is just one word. Interesting, they might have been able to support an 8 bit palette color index with 8 words allowing for a blocky 256 colors @ 160 x 100 resolution. So anyway I was happily coding along doing BSET.W D5,(A0)+ to set a specific bit in word 0 thinking I could automatically work word 1 next then move on to word 2 and so on and was puzzled when the compiler said, no my friend, that is not allowed!What? What's not allowed? I pulled up the BSET specs and sure enough, BSET only supports an opcode extension of byte or long. Drat! So now I have to do an ADDQ #2,A0 after each word manipulation.I'm still in awe of the 68000 instruction set though, what a thing of beauty....

I haven't yet decided on the language: JS or TS.So, it will be an API + UI project.Regarding the project itself, I've decided to do something like this. The system downloads and parses currency rates from various sources (primarily from national banks), exchange rates, and where possible, historical data (mostly daily data, not per-second). Then, via the API and web application, it can be viewed, analyzed, and downloaded. I chose such a project because that was truly useful and, in my opinion, fairly straightforward.

1owedzg,Even Andrew Ng is saying overhyped AI is causing harm and that CS degree will still be useful for decades to come,TonguePunchMyPoopBox,cscareerquestions,"Thought it’d be useful for those in this field who are worried about the impact of AI on their careers, especially new grads and prospective CS students, to read this post by Andrew Ng (prominent ML/DL expert who confounded Google Brian and Coursera) on the harm of overhyping AI.**TL;DR** Frontier model progress is incredible especially how much it can generalize compared to DL pre-LLM, but it’s still nowhere near general enough for majority of human tasks especially in CS careers where a human in the loop will still be required for custom solutions. So don’t bogged down by the hype.[Twitter post](https://xcancel.com/AndrewYNg/status/1989003741316673714)[Blog post](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-327/)Highlighting the most relevant bits:> Andrew Ng @AndrewYNg > I recently received an email titled “An 18-year-old’s dilemma: Too late to contribute to AI?” Its author, who gave me permission to share this, is preparing for college. He is worried that by the time he graduates, AI will be so good there’s no meaningful work left for him to do to contribute to humanity, and he will just live on Universal Basic Income (UBI). I wrote back to reassure him that there will still be plenty of work he can do for decades hence, and encouraged him to work hard and learn to build with AI. But this conversation struck me as an example of how harmful hype about AI is.> […]> Even though LLMs can handle a much more general set of tasks than previous iterations of AI technology, compared to what humans can do, they are still highly specialized. They’re much better at working with text than other modalities, still require lots of custom engineering to get it the right context for a particular application, and we have few tools — and only inefficient ones — for getting our systems to learn from feedback and repeated exposure to a specific task (such as screening resumés for a particular role).> […]> AI has stark limitations, and despite rapid improvements, it will remain limited compared to humans for a long time.> […]> Modern AI is a general purpose technology that is enabling many applications, but AI that can do any intellectual tasks that a human can (a popular definition for AGI) is still decades away or longer. This nuanced message that AI is general, but not that general, often is lost in the noise of today's media environment.> […]> Similarly, the progress of frontier models is amazing! But not so amazing that they’ll be able to do everything under the sun without a lot of customization. I know VC investors who are scared to invest in application-layer startups because they are worried that frontier AI model companies will quickly wipe out all of these businesses by improving their models. While some thin wrappers around LLMs no doubt will be replaced, there also remains a huge set of valuable applications that the current trajectory of progress of frontier models won’t displace for a long time.",962,0.96,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1owedzg/even_andrew_ng_is_saying_overhyped_ai_is_causing/,2025-11-13 22:00:01,2025-11-20 01:39:41

I didn't personally submit any applications—everything was handled by my HH. We applied to eight firms/quant funds in a targeted fashion. My HH's relationship with certain firms allowed me to bypass a few bureaucratic HR stages and get in front of hiring managers immediately.This was my first time on the market as a Senior and my interview experience mostly aligned with how I chose to prepare. The mix of questions I encountered was roughly 9:1 domain-specific C++ to LeetCode-style DSA. There were a bunch of questions on deep C++ features, trading-specific minutiae (exchange protocols, executing a low latency strategy on a particular exchange), lock-free algo knowledge, etc. Ironically, the rounds that tripped me up the most _were_ LeetCode-style questions, so I regret not doing more than the 10-15 questions I practiced but overall my preparation was accurate.I withdrew from the interview process at three firms since I received a solid offer from a firm I liked (on a desk/team I liked as well).

1p00x6d,My job is killing my motivation to work.,Ok-Cartographer-5544,cscareerquestions,"I work at a big tech company. I make good money. My hours are reasonable. But my work's expectations, feedback, and the nature of the work are crushing my motivation to do anything but the bare minimum.Why? I can put a ton of effort into troubleshooting some failure and fix it, just to get grilled in a meeting on the one little detail that I missed. I can work hard on a project just to get asked by my manager why it isn't done yet.Speaking of my manager, he is an anxious basket case who will randomly walk up during the day and ask me to drop everything that I'm doing to work on something ""urgent"". After finishing the ""urgent"" task, he'll ask me about the work that got postponed and why it's behind schedule. To make it even worse, he'll do it in the most condescending way, asking if I ""need help"", or trying to reassign my work to others. No, I don't need help. I need you to leave me alone so that I can do my work that I was already planning to do.As for the work itself? Very rarely do I get to build or design something interesting. The majority of the time, I'm digging through the shitheap trying to figure out what this service with 20k lines of code and no comments does. Or reading through internal documents that were written by someone with a 3rd grade vocabulary and not updated for the past decade.Very rarely do I heard any kind of positive feedback. Most often it is criticism. You could've done this faster. If I do it faster, it could've been cleaner. This despite the fact that our codebase is filled with garbage code that I had to dig through to get what we have today.I also don't really feel like I'm learning valuable skills.

1ozyr5h,How to NOT ask for a referral,cristinon,cscareerquestions,"I have gotten several hundred LinkedIn messages since my company posted a job a week ago. I’ve only been working there for a month and was in the same place as all of these people so I try and help as much as I can, but so many of the messages I’ve been getting are terrible. Here’s what I’ve identified to hopefully help some people improve their chance at getting a referral.Don’t say stuff like:“Hey cristinon, I’m really impressed by Company and would love to hear about how your team operates day-to-day. Could we chat sometime?”Super vague, unclear what you want. Ask a specific question if you are genuinely interested.“I’m curious how your team uses Tech and Tech in production, would love any insights you can share!”Again vague and I can’t tell you these specifics.“I’m very interested in the engineering culture at Company, could you tell me more?”The worst one this must be some kind of template because I get it so much. What am I supposed to tell you? Ask a specific question.“I’m exploring opportunities in software engineering at Company, are there any roles I could apply for?”Look on the careers page, some people even say this after mentioning they have applied to a certain job. I don’t work in HR idk.“Could you let me know if your team is hiring?”Again, idk ask HR or look on the website.“I will send you my résumé, please review it and let me know whenever you’re free.”I’ve gotten this word for word. I’m not your boss, or the hiring manager. Sounds too commanding.“I’ve heard great things about your team and Company, and I’d love to know how you got started there.”I applied just like you are, idk what I am supposed to say. Very vague.“Would love to hop on a 15-minute Zoom to hear about your experience.”Type whatever question you have I don’t have time for calls. It’s not my job to hire people.The fix for all of these is to directly ask a specific question. Make it easy for the person to reply and be nice and that’s all it takes.If any of these people had just asked something specific like “Can I get a referral?” I would have gladly tried to help. Instead I don’t know how to even reply so I don’t.TLDR:- keep your message short (few sentences)- be nice- don’t ask for calls- ask something easy to answer- be specific- understand what position the person you are messaging has- don’t give tons of vague compliments- don’t be overly formal",96,0.74,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ozyr5h/how_to_not_ask_for_a_referral/,2025-11-18 01:27:36,2025-11-20 01:39:41

Their bio even says the company has fewer than 30 employees.This can’t be legal, right?

Software/Web Dev here, 8 YOE.Long story short, I got blessed with good fortune and just landed in a company that provides generous benefits, including one where they will pay for any post-secondary education I pursue... as long as it's part-time (I have to continue working there while I pursue the degree).Thing is, I'm not sure what I should pursue to make it worthwhile. Seems like with Comp Sci careers you can advance perfectly fine without any post-secondary education. Would a part-time MBA actually move the needle for a software developer? Or a master’s in computer science? I don’t want to let this benefit go to waste, but time is a limited resource too, and I don’t want to sink a few years into something that barely impacts my career.FWIW I also am a boot camp grad, and with the decline in reputation of coding boot camps lately, I do wonder if it'll be worth it getting a ""legit"" comp sci degree to strengthen my credentials and protect my career prospects long-term.Would love to hear your thoughts, thanks in advance!\------**EDIT**: just to provide some additional context -> The company I worked at prior to this one was quite established. Not FAANG, but a major bank. My resume has some interesting projects. I'm not exactly drowning in recruiter linkedin messages everyday, but I also don’t have trouble landing interviews. Given that, would getting a formal CS degree still be worth it to “solidify” my legitimacy, or is it unnecessary at this point?**EDIT 2:** Something I mentioned in a reply that I’d like to hear more perspectives on:with AI making it easier for people to fake experience or inflate resumes, do you think companies might start relying more on formal degrees again as a credibility filter?

I left after a year because it was shit.- They had unreasonable expectations. My first task assigned on day 2 was to independently build an entire data analysis and prediction system from scratch. Literally just ""here's all the data we have, we want to do XYZ, go and figure it out and make it work, and have it ready in 3 months"" and no other guidance or requirements- It was highly stressful with bad WLB. Unpaid overtime was expected of everyone regularly, and people were asking and answering questions late into the evening most days, and on most weekends- They had a horrible open office environment with music playing in the background, people constantly talking about non-work-related things, people regularly shouting information from one side of the room to the other, and a table of customer support right in front of me taking phone calls all day- Mandatory 9-5 in office 5 days a week, no exceptions. A day out of the office for any reason is a day's pay deducted from your salary- Near-minimum wage salaryAfter I left (and before I left), I started applying for more jobs, expecting that it wouldn't take too long to find a new job, since my new CV was much much better than my old one.Anyway, long story short, after 3 years of applying to jobs (mostly software dev but not entirely), I had a total of zero offers.More recently, I decided that since I quite like driving, I'd start looking at driving jobs. HGV driving seems like something I'd like, but the training and licensing costs thousands so there's no way I can afford it. I also started looking at delivery driving, and here are the results of my job search.Software dev (approximate numbers): https://i.imgur.com/bYlxdC4.pngDelivery driving: https://i.imgur.com/VVUppoQ.pngSo... a slightly different experience. I applied, got a response the next day asking to confirm that yes, I can actually drive, and then had a call to arrange my start date where I would begin training. No CV needed to apply, no experience needed, no references needed, no interviews, and no other questions. Just ""can you drive"" and ""when can you start"". Oh and it pays 50% more than my 2022 software dev job.I now see that this is what it looks like for a job to be in demand. If tech was in demand, you'd apply, prove that you can write basic code, and then get an offer. And yet, somehow, people STILL think that tech is in high demand and there is a shortage of developers.",65,0.88,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ozm0ep/the_difference_between_my_job_searches_as_a/,2025-11-17 17:13:01,2025-11-20 01:39:41

1oywvcp,"Is switching ""back"" to senior software engineer a mistake?",bbonreddit,cscareerquestions,"I have been with my current employer for five and a half years and have held my current position, senior engineer, for two and a half years.For the past two years, I have effectively took the job of my team's technical lead after taking charge of our largest and longest-running project to date, which spanned nearly two years. I acted as the project lead and architect, while also implementing a significant portion of the actual code.After the project was successfully completed and delivered, I expected management to be receptive to promoting me. However, they sidestepped the question by moving me into a ""Software Architect"" role. I am expected to own the technical direction of the aforementioned project and guide other teams as well too. They will move me to report to my current second-line manager but this does not include a promotion.This is particularly disheartening because I pushed myself exceptionally hard over the past two years and that took a toll on my personal life.Consequently, I am now exploring opportunities outside my current company. My hesitation stems from three factors: First, the current job market is challenging. Second, although I have been performing as a technical lead, my official title does not reflect this experience. Third, while my base salary is market-average, my total compensation, which includes additional pay for on-call duties and RSUs comprising about 25% of my yearly income, is well above market expectations for my formal title.I was recently approached for a ""Senior Engineer"" position and successfully interviewed for the role. This opportunity would match my current base salary plus on-call compensation, but I would lose the 25% of my income tied to RSUs. The company itself is exciting, they are involved in problems that are high in scale and they have a nice buzz in their domain.Given this, am I making a mistake by considering this role, which involves switching ""back"" to a senior title and accepting less total compensation?EDIT:Thanks for the answers! Everybody seems to be somewhat of the opinion that I would be making a mistake.This opportunity also offers a major perk, the work environment.

I managed to break into one of the more quantitative, revenue-generating roles (think algorithmic trading or quant tech). I really enjoy the work, and my team generates a lot of revenue. However, because I’ve stayed at the same company, my compensation is poor compared to my peers. External hires at the same level earn roughly 30–50% more than I do.The logical move would be to switch to another bank or firm and eventually come back, but similar roles at other banks or hedge funds are either rare or extremely competitive. I’ve managed to secure higher-paying offers elsewhere, but they tend to be far less interesting—some are even back-office (e.g., trade booking or operations), which are far removed from revenue generation. I’ve also considered FAANG, but the roles I’ve been interviewed for are usually highly niche or very company-specific.In summary, I love the work I do and genuinely enjoy my job.

1ozvbrc,Anyone else in the midcareer doldrums?,revthem,cscareerquestions,"I've been a professional software engineer for about 12 years now. A couple of those years were spent in sales engineering but otherwise I've been committing code on a daily basis. I wouldn't say I have ever loved it but I've always enjoyed it. I got into the game late -- I started learning to program a few months before my 30th birthday -- but I never felt at a disadvantage. I've been able to roll with the punches and learn new techs throughout my career.The last few years have been different. I've had a few bad experiences at companies, including one where the CEO was lying about the company's finances. They missed payroll for my first two pay periods, and after about 6 months I got laid off. Since then, I've struggled to stay motivated and find a job in my area (cloud with a focus on Kubernetes, working almost exclusively in Go).I know part of my struggle is the market, but I also know part of it is that the optimistic utopianism that dominated the industry in my early career seems to have given way to a much darker culture that is very extractive and impersonal, even soul crushing at times. I find it very hard to stay motivated in the current climate. It's possible that this is just a reflection of the job market tilting in favor of employers, since the utopianism and benevolent paternalism of companies always kinda felt like BS anyway. But I'm not sure.I know AI has something to do with it, but I don't understand it enough to know what's coming down the pike. I'm not worried about chat bots writing code so much as I'm worried that handcrafted software will be replaced by AI. I would like to embark on a new phase of learning and figure out a new direction for my career, but I'm really stuck.

1ozrog3,"Stagnant in corporate, thriving in startups. Worried about the career tradeoff",Longjumping-Speed511,cscareerquestions,"I have a little over five years of experience at the same FAANG. I was promoted a few years ago and landed on a team with good WLB. In late 2023 that team was cut, but I managed to move internally and have been there since.That layoff pushed me to build my first startup between 2023 and 2025 while working full time. For a bootstrapped product it did well early on, but after 1.5 years and some unavoidable headwinds, I shut it down and we sold it for scraps. That experience made it clear how empty my FAANG job felt in comparison. Startup life was intense, exciting, and the complete opposite of cushy FAANG work.At the start of 2025, after shutting down the company, I tried to fill the void by interviewing aggressively, mostly at unicorns. I went through five full loops and 30+ rounds of leetcode and system design. I ended up with nothing, burned out, and unsure whether I even wanted the roles I was chasing.In the spring, a colleague asked me to help with their fintech startup after their CTO stepped away. I joined part time and have been with them for six months. It has been a great experience with 7k MAU, ~$15m in annual GMV, and we just raised. It feels like a natural step up from my first startup in terms of maturity and traction.My only concern is that all this fulfilling work I do on the side is essentially invisible. I cannot talk about much of it, and companies rarely care about it on a resume. Even my first startup’s early traction, $150k GMV in three months with 6k signups, never seemed to impress anyone - they don’t care or get it. Meanwhile, I feel stagnant in my FAANG job and I am not learning much, but the pay is hard to walk away from.Ultimately, I’m just tired of having two hands in two different pots all the time. I’m concerned about my career prospects. What do yall think?**TLDR:** Five years into FAANG, built one startup that I shut down, now part-time at a fintech that just raised $10m.

1oxdjf3,While do I always fail hiring manager screening round?,qrcode23,cscareerquestions,"Hey fellow dev,The job search has been rough these past couple of months. Ever since the H1B visa tax changes, I’ve seen an uptick in interview requests, but landing offers is still proving to be a real challenge. Many companies have packed interview calendars, which makes scheduling and momentum tough. Out of all the interviews I’ve done, I’ve only made it to one on-site so far. In one case, an interviewer even called in sick mid-interview, so I had to reschedule.One company had me go through three phone interviews. The recruiter later told me they’re considering down-leveling me because I don’t have experience with Java Spring—even though I’ve been solid on the technical side. They want one more phone round to “get more signal.”I’ve noticed a pattern: when the phone screen is purely technical, I tend to do well—about half the time I make it to the onsite. But I’ve never cleared a hiring manager screening round in my entire career. Ironically, I’ve passed hiring manager interviews during onsites, probably because they’ve already seen strong technical feedback by then.Over the past month, I’ve been working on STAR-formatting my past impact stories and aligning them with the usual “ideal corporate teammate” attributes. Still, I’m not sure if I’m hitting the mark.One recent hiring manager screen was especially tricky. It was a 30-minute video call. The first half was standard—what I’ve worked on, what technologies I’ve used. Then came the curveball: “Is there anything you don’t like about your current company or would want to change?” I figured dodging it would tank the interview, so I answered honestly. I said that if I were to start a company, I’d invest more in engineering processes and development environment, since I currently spend about 20% of my time firefighting. He followed up by asking what I’ve done about it. For the record, I had raised concerns with my manager (who brushed them off). I told the interviewer that I’ve been pushing for simplification in all aspect.I’ve seen this pattern before—where the interviewer asks what language I prefer for the next step in the interview process (I said Python), and it feels like a setup to give me false hope. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but these interviews are really tough when you’re not naturally social or charismatic.I guess I’m wondering: am I overthinking this? Or are hiring managers just extra picky right now? I’d love to hear how others have navigated this, especially if you’ve struggled with the same kind of behavioral hurdles.Thanks for reading.------------------------------------I've been employed a lot.

It's not anywhere in the direction I see myself going in (hopefully in data science / research, and maybe a decade down the line startups / found one myself), but the offer was too good to pass up - it's working as a backend developer at a team which provides a core company service - the backbone of all the company's features, really - and they deal in *huge* scales of data, even in comparision to other enterprise companies.I have zero experience in backend (and they know this). My current position was just a frontend angular dev and before that an automatiom engineer.Honestly, if the position would have been the same role anywhere else, I wouldn't have taken it. But i think this is a great opportunity to improve myself and rapidly learn from the best, enough to delay my studies even by another year.Do you think this is a mistake?",5,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ozsoav/im_delaying_my_msc_by_another_year_again_in_order/,2025-11-17 21:17:42,2025-11-20 01:39:41
1ozm1lk,"Given this compensation structure in the UK tech sector, what negotiation strategies would you recommend?",TodayAnalyze,cscareerquestions,"I’m in the UK and recently went through a negotiation that left me a bit confused about how to interpret everything.I applied for a role and originally put 80k as my expected salary. They came back with a verbal offer of 90k, which was already above what I wrote down.Since I had previously turned down another offer around 86k because the commute would have forced me to wake up extremely early, and I know similar roles sometimes land in the 90 to 100k range, I tried to negotiate. I mentioned that I had other pipelines in that range.HR told me they would run the numbers internally and get back to me. The next day they emailed saying they had some “exciting numbers approved” for my offer and wanted to discuss them. That wording made me think something might have changed.On the call they told me the offer was still 90k. The reason they gave was not that the band was capped, but that the hiring manager did not want to get into a bidding war. I asked whether 95k could be considered, especially because the bonus figures on levels. fyi do not match what they verbally mentioned. The written offer I have now received is still 90k. HR also said they would check in with me again in a couple of days to see how I feel about the offer.Now I am unsure what to think. I turned down the previous 86k offer for lifestyle reasons and I do like this new role more, but the negotiation process felt a bit odd and I am not fully sure whether I should accept.Has anyone experienced something similar? Is it normal for HR to phrase internal approvals so positively even when the number stays the same? And would you take the 90k in this situation?",5,0.86,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ozm1lk/given_this_compensation_structure_in_the_uk_tech/,2025-11-17 17:14:12,2025-11-20 01:39:41
1oz7lye,Embedded Software Developer : Project Ideas,NoPickle6910,cscareerquestions,"Hello, I am a third year computer science student, my only internship I have is a test developer position I did on an appliance team at a decent company. Through this position I learned what area I want to focus on : I am targeting roles within embedded systems and OS development, specifically those emphasizing low-level hardware/software integration. (I want to be able to have a hardware product that I will be able to touch).Now that I kind of have a vague idea of what I want to be I was wondering if anyone could give me some recommended projects in this field that I can work on that will at least make me a better candidate for internships in these positions. Currently, I have been working with some Arduino, esp32, and thats the extent of which I've done things (I realize this is not much which is why I want recommendations). In terms of os, only took a course on it.I did do an interview with amd for a firmware developer intern position but didn't get the job. I want to be a better candidate (not only for amd but any other similar companies).Also would be great if you could tell me what to prioritize on.",3,0.72,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oz7lye/embedded_software_developer_project_ideas/,2025-11-17 05:02:03,2025-11-20 01:39:41
1oykrcv,I'm doing well in my dev job. How can I do better?,elsa-mom8,cscareerquestions,"Hey! The title might sound a bit odd, but I’ll explain.I've posted here before about having a really hard time in my previous job. it was my first role after completing a conversion degree in software. I stayed in that job for 11 months and really struggled to find my footing.I’ve now been in my new job for just over 3 months, and love it. I passed probation, got really positive feedback from my manager, and I feel much more confident overall. I’m picking up the codebase quickly, completing tasks fast, passing PRs consistently, and getting more and more comfortable debugging and navigating everything.But here’s the thing, a lot of what I do involves following existing patterns or adapting code from similar features, which I know is normal in larger codebases. Sometimes I just feel like I'm bluffing a little by doing this? I guess maybe thats just a case of imposter syndrome. I’m not struggling like I used to, which feels a bit strange since in my last role I felt like I was constantly trying to catch up and learning how to do everything but I was so lost. Now that I’m more stable, I want to use that headspace to keep improving and deepen my knowledge.I think I am finding it weird that in my last job I was struggling so much that I had SO much additional learning to do to help me improve, but now I don’t need to do that so much since I'm not actually struggling. So my question is: If you're a more senior dev, what helped you grow when you were past the newbie phase, but still junior? Are there books, projects, videos, habits or even technical topics you'd recommend diving into?Thanks in advance, I really appreciate any advice!",4,0.84,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oykrcv/im_doing_well_in_my_dev_job_how_can_i_do_better/,2025-11-16 12:41:24,2025-11-20 01:39:41
1oxhbqk,Will my backend internship pigeonhole me to backend roles?,Imaginary_Name_3709,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone! I’m a student in Canada with 8 months of experience in backend development in c# at my internship.Tbh I don’t think I like c# or backend. I realized I like seeing what I make and I want to work with product designers. So I wanted to get into mobile dev but my internship offers are all backend roles, so I will probably be taking another backend internship in c#.I don’t want to do backend as my ft and want to shift to iOS and android development but I’m afraid that because of my prev internship experience I won’t be really desired in the industry. I want to make myself a strong candidate because all my dream companies are competitive and prestigious. Since I’m a Canadian aiming to go to US, I really need to make self standout and make them want to hire me over a local. Like why would they want to hire me, a Canadian over American? Why me over ppl who had mobile development internships before?",6,0.75,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oxhbqk/will_my_backend_internship_pigeonhole_me_to/,2025-11-15 03:32:25,2025-11-20 01:39:41
1ow81hu,How to make big useful projects and not useless projects,shade_blade,cscareerquestions,"I don't know what to do, I don't know how to come up with big giant project ideas that will have big impact. I feel like it's pointless to make a project anymore unless it's going to get a lot of people using it, like I could make a Docker project or pay money I don't have for a server but if nobody wants to use the project then recruiters will always see it as a dumb toy project? I have to make something where every part of it has impact or metrics or it doesn't count (so it doesn't matter if I implement some CI/CD pipeline unless I can point to a dollar amount it saved or something like that)I'm having trouble looking for project ideas like that that demonstrate real effort (so they don't look like dumb toy projects thrown together in a day or whatever). All the stuff I keep seeing is mostly stuff that doesn't seem like it would help me at all. I don't think using AI in 50 different ways in an app nobody ever uses is going to make recruiters think highly of me. It's feeling like the requirements are so high for a ""real project""? I have to pay for a server (free server = ""toy project"" because no real company uses free servers), I have to make real money somehow and build something so big it needs a CI/CD pipeline (so big that it makes sense I'm doing that instead of just manually uploading the new builds). And then every single part needs to have big impact and metrics to put on a resume so somehow my CI/CD implementation needs to be so good it generates money in of itself somehow?I'm also trying to actively stop myself from getting distracted by the ""fun"" projects I wasted my time on for so long but I sometimes get pulled back in, making ""fun"" stuff is not helping me so those projects are all useless wastes of time. Maybe I need people to give me more harsh words enough to push me to delete the entire project so I can't waste even more time on them. I already deleted the github but I can't bring myself to delete the folder yet.Maybe I should give up on software development entirely? People are getting hired somehow but I can't get any positive response at all so that is a pretty obvious sign my qualifications are garbage? People out there are having these good ideas and making these big massively successful projects while I can't even come up with the idea, maybe I'm just not smart or creative enough to get a job?",2,0.6,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ow81hu/how_to_make_big_useful_projects_and_not_useless/,2025-11-13 17:59:36,2025-11-20 01:39:41
