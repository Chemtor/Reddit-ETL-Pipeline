1nbnucq,I am a DE who is happy and likes their work. AMA,MikeDoesEverything,dataengineering,"In contrast to the vast number of posts which are basically either:* Announcing they are quitting* Complaining they can't get a job* Complaining they can't do their current job* ""I heard DE is dead. Source: me. Zero years experience in DE or any job for that matter. 25 years experience in TikTok. I am 21 years old""* Needing projects* Begging for ""tips"" how to pass the forbidden word which rhymes with schminterview (this one always gets a chuckle)* Also begging for ""tips"" on how to do their job (I put tips in inverted commas because what they want is a full blown solution to something they can't do)* AI generated posts (whilst I largely think the mods do a great job, the number of blatant AI posts in here is painful to read)I thought a nice change of pace was required. So here it is - I'm a DE who is happy and is actually writing this post using my own brain.About me: I am self taught and have been a DE for just under 5 years ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lmi2lg/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/)). Spend most of my time doing quite interesting (to me) work where I have a data focussed, technical role building a data platform. I earn a decent amount of money with which I'm happy with.My work conditions are decent with an understanding and supportive manager. Have to work weekends? Here's some very generous overtime. Requested time off? No problem - go and enjoy your holiday and see you when you back with no questions asked. They treat me like a person, I turn up every day and put in the extra work when they need me to. Don't get me wrong, I'm the most cynical person ever although my last two managers have changed my mind completely.I dictate my own workload and have loads of freedom. If something needs fixing, I will go ahead and fix it. Opinions during technical discussions are always considered and rarely swatted away. I get a lot of self satisfaction from turning out work and am a healthy mix of proud (when something is well built and works) and not so proud (something which really shouldn't exist but has to). My job security is higher than most because I don't work in the US or in a high risk industry which means slightly less money although a lot less stress.Regularly get approached for new opportunities of both contract and FTE although have no plans on leaving any time soon because I like my current everything. Yes, more money would be nice although the amount of ""arsehole pay"" I would need to cope working with, well, potential arseholes is quite high at the moment.Before I get asked any predictable questions, some observations:* Most, if not all, people who have worked in IT and have never done another job are genuinely spoilt. Much higher salaries, flexibility, and number of opportunities than most fields along with a lower barrier to entry, infinite learning resources, and possibility of building whatever you want from home with almost no restrictions. My previous job required 4 years of education to get an actual entry level position, which is on-site only, and I was extremely lucky to have not needed a PhD. I got my first job in DE with £40-60 of courses and a used, crusty Dell Optiplex from Ebay. The ""bad job market"" everybody is experiencing is probably better than most jobs best job market.* If you are using AI to fucking write REDDIT POSTS then you don't have imposter syndrome because you're a literal imposter. If you don't even have the confidence to use your own words on a social media platform, then you should use this as an opportunity because arranging your thoughts or developing your communication style is something you clearly need practice with. AI is making you worse to the point you are literally deferring what words you want to use to a computer. Let that sink in for a sec how idiotic this is. Yes, I am shaming you.* If you can't get a job and are instead reading this post, then seriously get off the internet and stick some time into getting better. You don't need more courses. You don't need guidance. You don't need a fucking mentor. You need discipline, motivation, and drive. Real talk: if you find yourself giving up there are two choices. You either take a break and find it within you to keep going or you can just do something else.* If you want to keep going: then keep going. Somebody doing 10 hours a week and are ""talented"" will get outworked by the person doing 60+ hours a week who is ""average"". Time in the seat is a very important thing and there are no shortcuts for time spent learning. The more time you spend learning new things and improving, the quicker you'll reach your goal. What might take somebody 12 months might take you 6. What might take you 6 somebody might learn in 3. Ignore everybody else's journey and focus on yours.* If you want to stop: there's no shame in realising DE isn't for you. There's no shame in realising ANY career isn't for you. We're all good at something, friends. Life doesn't always have to be a struggle.AMAEDIT: Jesus, already seeing AI replies. If I suspect you are replying with an AI, you're giving me the permission to roast the fuck out of you.",384,0.96,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nbnucq/i_am_a_de_who_is_happy_and_likes_their_work_ama/,2025-09-08 13:32:09,2025-09-13 01:19:56
1n9s0o6,How did you get really good with SQL?,LongCalligrapher2544,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I’m currently working as a Data Analyst, and while I do use SQL daily, I recently realized that my level might only be somewhere around mid-level, not advanced. In my current role, most of the queries I write aren’t very complex, so I don’t get much practice with advanced SQL concepts.Since I’d like to eventually move into a Data Engineer role, I know that becoming strong in SQL is a must. I really want to improve and get to a level where I can comfortably handle complex queries, performance tuning, and best practices.For those of you who are already Data Engineers:-How did you go from “okay at SQL” to “good/advanced”?-What specific practices, resources, or projects helped you level up?-Any advice for someone who wants to get out of the “comfortable/simple queries” zone and be prepared for more challenging use cases?Thanks a lot in advance and happy Saturday",225,0.97,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n9s0o6/how_did_you_get_really_good_with_sql/,2025-09-06 06:03:51,2025-09-13 01:19:56
1navs38,"After 8 years, I'm thinking of callling it quits",Fonduemeup,dataengineering,"**After working as a DA for 1 year, DS/MLE for 3 years, and DE for 4, my outlook on this field (and life in general, sadly) has never been bleaker.** Every position I've been in has had its own frustrations in some way: team is overworked, too much red tape, lack of leadership, lack of organization/strategy, hostile stakeholders, etc...And just recently, **management laid off some of our team because they ""think we should be able to use AI to be more productive"".** I feel like I have been searching for that mystical ""dream job"" for years, and yet it seems that I am further away from obtaining it as ever before. With AI having already made so much progress, I'm starting to think that this dream job I have been looking for may no longer even exist. Even though I've enjoyed my job at times in the past, **at this point, I think I'm done with this career.** I have lost all the passion that I originally had 8 years ago, and I don't foresee it ever returning. What will I do next? Who knows. I have a few months of savings that will keep me afloat before I figure that out, and if money starts running out, my backup plan is to become a surf instructor in Fiji (or something along those lines). Before the layoffs, my team was already using AI, and, while it's been increasingly useful, the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation. We've been pretty good on staying up-to-date with AI trends - we hopped on Cursor back in February and have been using Claude Code since April. However, our codebase is way too convoluted for consistent results, and we lack proper documentation for AI agents to implement major changes. After several failed attempts to solve these issues, I find Claude Code only useful for small, localized features or fixes. Until LLMs can extrapolate code to understand the underlying business context, or write code that is fully aware of end-to-end system dependencies, my team will continue to face these problems. **My favorite part about working in data has always been when I get to solve challenging problems through code, but this has completely disappeared from my day-to-day work**. Writing complex logic is a fun challenge, and it's very rewarding when you finally build a working solution. Unfortunately, this is one of the few things AI is much more efficient than me at doing, so I barely do it anymore. Instead, I'm basically supervising a junior engineer (Claude) that does the work while I handle the administrative / PM duties. Meanwhile, I'm even more busy than before since we are all picking up the extra workload from our teammates that were let go. As AI capabilities continue to improve, this part of my job will surely become a larger amount of my time, and I simply can't see myself doing it any more than I already am. I had a short stint as a manager a couple years ago, and while it wasn't for me, it was at least rewarding to help actual people. Instructing a LLM was interesting and fun at first, but the novelty wore off several months ago, and I now find it to be irritating above anything else. Most of my experience comes from startups and mid-sized companies, but it really hit me yesterday when talking to my friend who is a DS at a FAANG. She has been dealing with her own frustrations at work, and although her situation is very different than mine, she voiced the same negative sentiments that I had been feeling. I am now thinking that my feelings are more widespread than I thought. Or maybe I have just had bad luck.",216,0.93,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1navs38/after_8_years_im_thinking_of_callling_it_quits/,2025-09-07 15:13:59,2025-09-13 01:19:56

1nedwpe,"Am I just temporarily burnt out, or not cut out for DE long-term?",CoolmanWilkins,dataengineering,"I've been doing data things for awhile now, full-time for \~6 years since graduating, as a full data engineer for \`4 years. It seems every job I reach a point every year or two where motivation drops and I just don't care anymore. Performance begins to drop. When the going gets real hard I go get another job, I have climbed up to a senior role now. Fortunately this employment history of two years per organization seems to be acceptable.Problem is I am here again. Have been interviewing for roles and trying to get excited again about new projects. Interviewing for some lead roles and already have an offer to lead migration from DBT to a streaming setup. But I wonder if I'm setting myself up for failure. I do enjoy technical challenges but I do sort of feel like I am only using one side of my brain as a data engineer.Am I just burnt out and maybe need a break? I feel like even with a break the same thing would eventually come back. I don't currently have a stressful job, for example I work about 30 hours a week maybe I need to find value from other parts of life.I am also looking at going back to school for a master's to pick up some skills that would allow me to maybe work on more interesting projects (don't have the CS or engineering undergrad background, would maybe be cool to explore other technical subjects) Not thinking I'd suddenly become a game developer but I love to tinker and maybe having more fundamentals would allow me to get a personal project off the ground to the point where that could be a full-time job. I would love to have more product-focused SWE skills versus just being able to migrate DBT models to Databricks.

1nayp2m,"Got hired as Jr DE, but now running the whole team alone burned out and doubting my path",OkSatisfaction7486,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, sorry if my English isn’t very good.**TL;DR:** I’m a fresh graduate in Actuarial Science. Got a Jr. Data Engineer role, but the Senior DE quit right before I joined now I’m the only DE. Everything is a mess (broken pipelines, legacy code, poor management, no guidance, layoffs). On top of that, they expect huge changes, endless requirements, and bad deadlines, with constant meetings leaving no time to work. I’m learning a lot, but I’m burned out and doubting if I should stay or return to actuarial work.I just graduated in May with a degree in Actuarial Science. And over here it’s common to have an internship while still studying during the semester, so almost everyone graduates with around two years of experience. During my internships, I worked on pension and macroeconomics analysis. Later, I had the opportunity to join a BI team at a fintech. There, I helped improve semantic models, fix dashboards with slow refresh times, and implement better practices. After that, I got another internship offer for the Data Engineering team, which was basically a one person team. I decided to give it a shot, and it turned out to be a good experience: I used Azure for the first time, learned some Scala, Airflow, and PySpark.Fast forward to one month before graduation: an international manufacturer contacted me for a Jr DE position. I doubted if I could fit in, since my technical skills weren’t as strong as CS graduates. After three interviews (one with the Senior DE, where we had an amazing conversation), I got the job offer. I was skeptical, but I accepted it because the Senior DE convinced me it was a great opportunity. I even turned down another offer from an insurance company.To my surprise, during onboarding they told me the Senior DE had just quit the Friday before, leaving me as the only DE. After some thought, I accepted. But I wasn’t ready for what I found:* No documentation* Broken pipelines* Tons of legacy code from outsourcing during the pandemic* Broken dashboards and angry users* A messy data lake with no organization* A passive-aggressive data steward whenever I try to improve workflows* A team using Scrum (my first time) with POs who don’t know what they need* A project manager who flames us whenever something goes wrong* A “data scientist” who is really used as an analytics engineerRight now, I’m doing my best: learning best practices, writing documentation, and even working extra hours. But it feels like I’m always just fixing problems. There’s one dashboard that breaks almost every day, pipelines that constantly need re-runs, and new business rules popping up all the time. On top of that, leadership keeps pushing for “big changes” with impossible deadlines, constant requirements, and back-to-back meetings that leave me with almost no time to actually focus on building things.After a 1:1 with my manager, he admitted the company’s vision changes almost daily. The CTO once told me about the importance of building a data driven mindset, but just three days later, layoffs happened and the CTO himself was gone.

1n9rpok,Signs you shouldn’t use a streaming framework?,itamarwe,dataengineering,"I hope we can agree that streaming data pipelines (Flink, Spark Streaming) are tougher to build and maintain (DLQ, backfills, out-of-order and late events). Yet we often default to them, even when our data isn’t truly streaming.After seeing how data pipelines are actually built across many organizations, here are 3 signs that tell me streaming might not be the right choice:1. Either the source or the destination isn’t streaming - e.g., reading from a batch-based API or writing only batched aggregations.2. Recent data isn’t more valuable than historical data - e.g., financial data where accuracy matters more than freshness.3. Events arrive out of order (with plenty of late arrivals) - e.g., mobile devices sending cached events once they reconnect.In these cases, a simpler batch-based approach works better for me: fewer moving parts, lower cost, and often just as effective.How do you decide when to use streaming frameworks?",31,0.93,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n9rpok/signs_you_shouldnt_use_a_streaming_framework/,2025-09-06 05:45:26,2025-09-13 01:19:56

Note that I did suggest a threshold or margin to flag discrepancies but they refused. The sourced data is incorrect to begin with because of inconsistent data values and now thats being used to validate the pipeline.That doesn’t seem right to me, since the whole purpose of cleaning is to fix inconsistencies and remove bad data — so the totals will naturally differ by some margin.Is this a common practice, or is there a better way I can frame the validation I’ve already done to show it’s solid.

1nadpir,"Introducing Minarrow — Apache Arrow implementation for HPC, Native Streaming, and Embedded Systems",peterxsyd,dataengineering,"# Dear Data Engineers,I’ve recently built a production-grade, from-scratch implementation of the ***Apache Arrow*** data standard in **Rust**—shaped to to strike a new balance between ***simplicity***, ***power***, and ***ergonomics***.I’d love to share it with you and get your thoughts, particularly if you:* Work in the *(more hardcore end) of the* **data engineering** space* Us**e Rust for data pipeline**s, or the Arrow data format for systems / engine / embedded work* Build **distributed** or **embedded** software that benefits from Arrow’s memory layout and wire protocols just as much as the columnar analytics it's typically known for.# Why did I build it?***Apache Arrow*** (and `arrow-rs`) are very powerful and have reshaped the data ecosystem through zero-copy memory sharing, lean buffer specs, and a rich interoperability story. When building certain types of high-performance data systems in Rust, though (e.g., distributed data, embedded), I found myself running into friction.# Pain points:* **Engineering Velocity:** The general-purpose design is great for the ecosystem, but I encountered long compile times *(30+ seconds).** **Heavy Abstraction:** Deep trait layers and hierarchies made some otherwise simple tasks more involved—like printing a buffer or quickly seeing types in the IDE.* **Type Landscape:** Many logical Arrow types share the same physical representation. Completeness is important, but in my work I’ve valued a clearer, more consolidated type model. In shaping Minarrow, I leaned on the principle often attributed to Einstein: *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler"".* This ethos has filtered through the conventions used in the library.* **Composability:** I often wanted to “opt up” and down abstraction levels depending on the situation—e.g. from a raw buffer to an Arrow Array—without friction.So I set out to build something tuned for engineering workloads that plugs naturally into everyday Rust use cases without getting in the way. The result is an Arrow-*Compatible* implementation from the ground up.# Introducing: MinarrowArrow minimalism meets Rust polyglot data systems engineering.# Highlights:* Custom `Vec64` allocator: 64-byte aligned, SIMD-compatible. No setup required. Benchmarks indicate alloc parity with standard `Vec`.* Six base types (`IntegerArray`, `FloatArray`, `CategoricalArray`, `StringArray`, `BooleanArray`, `DatetimeArray`), slotting into many modern use cases (HFC, embedded work, streaming ) etc.* Arrow-compatible, with some simplifications: * Logical Arrow types collapsed via generics (e.g. DATE32, DATE64 → `DatetimeArray`). * Dictionary encoding represented as `CategoricalArray`.* Unified, ergonomic accessors: `myarr.num().i64()` with IDE support, no downcasting.* Arrow Schema support, chunked data, zero-copy views, schema metadata included.* Zero dependencies beyond `num-traits` *(and optional Rayon).*# Performance and ergonomics* **1.5s clean build,** <**0.15s rebuilds*** **Very fast runtime** *(See laptop benchmarks in repo)** **Tokio-native IPC:** async IPC Table and Parquet readers/writers via sibling crate *Lightstream** **Zero-copy MMAP r**eader *(\~100m row reads in \~4ms on my consumer laptop)** **Automatic 64-byte alignment** *(avoiding SIMD penalties and runtime checks)** `.to_polars()` and `.to_arrow()` built-in* Rayon parallelism* **Full FFI** via Arrow C Data Interface* **Extensive documentation**# Trade-offs:* **No nested types** *(List, Struct)* or other exotic Arrow types at this stage* **Full connector ecosystem** requires \`.to\_arrow()\` bridge to Apache Arrow *(compile-time cost: 30–60s)* . *Note: IPC and Parquet are directly supported in Lightstream.*# Outcome:* **Fast, lean, and clean** – rapid iteration velocity* **Compatible**: Uses Arrow memory layout and ecosystem-pluggable* **Composable**: use only what’s necessary* **Performance** **without penalty** (compile times! Obviously Arrow itself is an *outstanding ecosystem*).# Where Minarrow fits:* **Ultra-performance data pipelines*** **Embedded system and** **polyglot** **apps*** **SIMD compute*** **Live streaming*** **HPC** and low-latency workloads* MIT Licensed# Open-Source sister-crates:* **Lightstream**: Native streaming with Tokio, for building custom wire formats and minimising memory copies. Includes SIMD-friendly async readers and writers, enabling direct SIMD-accelerated processing from a memory-mapped file.* **Simd-Kernels**: 100+ SIMD and standard kernels for statistical analysis, string processing, and more, with an extensive set of univariate distributions.* You can find these on crates-io or my GitHub.Rust is still developing in the Data Engineering ecosystem, but if your work touches high-performance data pipelines, Arrow interoperability, or low-latency data systems, hopefully this will resonate.Would love your feedback.Thanks,PB **Github**: [https://github.com/pbower/minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow)",14,0.83,7,https://docs.rs/minarrow/latest/minarrow/index.html,2025-09-06 23:12:26,2025-09-13 01:19:56

I know that bucketing and Z-ordering are two popular techniques for improving join performance by reducing data shuffling, but I'm trying to understand which is the better choice in practice.Based on my research, here’s a quick summary of my understanding:* **Bucketing** uses a hash function on the join key to pre-sort data into a fixed number of buckets. It's great for equality joins but can lead to small files if not managed well. It also doesn't work with Delta Lake, as I understand.* **Z-Ordering** uses a space-filling curve to cluster similar data together, which helps with data skipping and, by extension, joins. It’s more flexible, works with multiple columns, and helps with file sizing via the `OPTIMIZE` command.My main use case is joining these two tables on a single high-cardinality `customer_id` column.Given this, I have a few questions for the community:1. For a simple, high-cardinality equality join, is Z-ordering as effective as bucketing?2. Are there scenarios where bucketing would still outperform Z-ordering, even if you have to manage the small file problem?3. What are some of the key practical considerations you've run into when choosing between these two methods for large-scale joins?I'm looking for real-world experiences and insights beyond the documentation.

1ndafth,Where Should I Store Airflow DAGs and PySpark Notebooks in an Azure Databricks + Airflow Pipeline?,dizzzzzzy,dataengineering,"Hi r/dataengineering,I'm building a data warehouse on Azure Databricks with Airflow for orchestration and need advice on where to store two types of Python files: Airflow DAGs (ingest and orchestration) and PySpark notebooks for transformations (e.g., Bronze → Silver → Gold). My goal is to keep things cohesive and easy to manage, especially for changes like adding a new column (e.g., last\_name to a client table).Current setup:* DAGs: Stored in a Git repo (Azure DevOps) and synced to Airflow.* PySpark notebooks: Stored in Databricks Workspace, synced to Git via Databricks Repos.* Configs: Stored in Delta Lake tables in Databricks.This feels a bit fragmented since I'm managing code in two environments (Git for DAGs, Databricks for notebooks). For example, adding a new column requires updating a notebook in Databricks and sometimes a DAG in Git.How should I organize these Python files for a streamlined workflow? Should I keep both DAGs and notebooks in a single Git repo for consistency? Or is there a better approach (e.g., DBFS, Azure Blob Storage)? Any advice on managing changes across both file types would be super helpful.

Embeddable file uploaders exist, but they don’t solve what I’m running into:1. Pick up new files from cloud storage (SFTP, etc).2.

Pick columns from multiple sheets. AI could help with a lot of this.3. Load into cloud storage, CRM, ERP, etc.Right now, it’s all custom scripts that engineers maintain. Manual and custom per each client/partner. Scripts break when file schema changes. I want something easy to use so business teams can manage it.

1ne6jki,Postgres/MySQL migration to Snowflake,maxbranor,dataengineering,"Hello folks, I'm a data engineer at a tech company in Norway. We have terabytes of operational data, coming mostly from IoT devices (all internal, nothing 3rd-party dependent). Analytics and Operational departments consume this data which is - mostly - stored in Postgres and MySQL databases in AWS. Tale as old as time: what served really well for the past years, now is starting to slow down (queries that timeout, band-aid solutions made by the developer team to speed up queries, complex management of resources in AWS, etc). Given that the company is doing quite well and we are expanding our client base a lot, there's a need to have a more modern (or at least better-performant) architecture to serve our data needs. Since no one was really familiar with modern data platforms, they hired only me (I'll be responsible for devising our modernization strategy and mapping the needed skillset for further hires - which I hope happens soon :D ) My strategy is to pick one (or a few) use cases and showcase the value that having our data in Snowflake would bring to the company. Thus, I'm working on a PoC migration strategy (Important note: the management is already convinced that migration is probably a good idea - so this is more a discussion on strategy). My current plan is to migrate a few of our staging postgres/mysql datatables to s3 as parquet files (using aws dms), and then copy those into Snowflake. Given that I'm the only data engineer atm, I choose Snowflake due to my familiarity with it and due to its simplicity (also the reason I'm not thinking on dealing with Iceberg in external stages and decided to go for Snowflake native format)My comments / questions are \- Any pitfalls that I should be aware when performing a data migration via AWS DMS? \- Our postgres/mysql datatabases are actually being updated constantly via en event-driven architecture. How much of a problem can that be for the migration process? (The updating is not necessarily only append-operations, but often older rows are modified) \- Given the point above: does it make much of a difference to use provided instances or serverless for DMS? \- General advice on how to organize my parquet files system for bullet-proofing for full-scale migration in the future? (Or should I not think about it atm?)

For context, the base data on which we want to visualize metrics is about \~5TB of metrics data daily, with 2+ years of data. The goal is to visualize to daily fidelity, with a high level of slice and dice.So far my process has been to precompute aggregable metrics across all queryable dimensions (imagine group by date, country, category, etc), and then point something like Snowflake or Trino at it to aggregate over those aggregated partials based on the specific filters. The issue is this is still a lot of data, and sometimes these query engines are still slow (couple seconds per query), which is annoying from a user standpoint when using a dashboard.I'm wondering if it makes sense to pre-aggregate all OLAP combinations but in a more key-value oriented way, and then use Postgres hstore or Cassandra or something to just do single-record lookups.

1ndssey,WGU B.S. and M.S Data Analytics (with Data Engineering specialization) for a late-career pivot to data engineering,Aware_Actuator4939,dataengineering,"I'm interested in making a pivot to data engineering. Like the author of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kp2puy/am_i_too_old/), I'm in my 60s and plan to work until I'm 75 or so. Unlike that person, I have a background in technical support, IT services, and data processing. From 2007 to 2018, I worked as a data operator for a company that does data processing for financial services and health benefits businesses. I taught myself Python, Ruby, and PowerShell and used them to troubleshoot and repair problems with the data processing pipelines. From 2018 to 2023, I did email and chat tech support for Google Maps Platform APIs. Like literally millions of other people, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate course and started researching data careers. I think that I would prefer data engineering over data science or data analytics, but from my research, I concluded that I would need a master's degree to get into data engineering, while it would be possible to get a data analytics job with a community college degree and a good data portfolio.In 2023, I started taking classes for a computer information technology associate's degree at my local community college. Earlier this year, though, I discovered online university WGU (Western Governors University) has bachelor's and master's degrees in data analytics. The bachelor's degree has a much better focus on data analytics than my community college degrees. The WGU data analytics [master's degree](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-masters-program.html) (MSDA) has a specialization in data engineering, which reawakened my interest in the field. I've been preparing to start at WGU to earn the [bachelor's in data analytics](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-bachelors-program.html) (BSDA), then enroll in the master's degree with data engineering specialization. Last month, WGU rolled out four degree programs in [Cloud and Network Engineering](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cloud-network-engineering-bachelors-program.html) (General, AWS, Azure, and Cisco specializations). Since then, I've been trying to decide if I would be better off earning one of those degrees (instead of the BSDA) to prepare for the MSDA.Some of the courses in the **BS in Data Analytics (BSDA)**:* Data Management (using SQL) (3 courses)* Python programming (3 courses), R programming (1 course)* Data Wrangling* Data Visualization* Big Data Foundations* Cloud Foundations* Machine Learning, Machine Learning DevOps (1 course each)* Network and Security - Foundations (only 1 course)Some of the courses in the **BS in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure Specialization) (BSCNE)**:* Network and Security - Foundations (same course as above)* Networks (CompTIA Network+)* Network and Security Applications (CompTIA Security+)* Network Analytics and Troubleshooting* Python for IT Automation* AI for IT Automation and Security* Cloud Platform Solutions* Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure and Orchestration* Cloud and Network Security ModelsBesides Network+ and Security+, I would earn CompTIA A+ and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Azure Administrator, and Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions certifications in the BSCNE degree. The BSDA degree would give me AWS Cloud Practitioner and a couple of other certifications.If you've gotten this far - thank you! Thank you very much! Also, I have questions:1. Would the master's in Data Analytics (Data Engineering specialization) from **WGU** be worth it for a data engineering job seeker?2. If so, which WGU bachelor's degree would be better preparation for the data engineering MSDA and a later data engineering role - the bachelor's in Data Analysis, or the bachelor's in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure or AWS)?",2,0.63,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ndssey/wgu_bs_and_ms_data_analytics_with_data/,2025-09-10 22:52:09,2025-09-13 01:19:56

The workflow is simple:1. R writes the data to a memory-mapped binary file.2. Python reads the data and processes it (even running models).3. Results are written back to another memory-mapped file, instantly accessible by R.*Key advantages over reticulate:** :high_voltage: Performance: As shown in my benchmark, for \~1.5 GB of data, PyRMap is significantly faster than reticulate – reducing data transfer times by 40%* :broom: Clean & maintainable code: Data is passed via shared memory, making the R and Python code more organized and decoupled (check example 8 from here - [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example\_8\_reticulate\_comparation](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example_8_reticulate_comparation)).

I wasn't a guy.Now I'm really enjoying coding and wondering if it's a specific type of person that can be a coder? Or does coding change your brain to make you better at it.Do people that code experience a change in their mind? Problem solving? Analytical skills? Perspective on life?Did those traits make good programmers? Or do good programmers develop those traits?,674,0.95,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nbo1b5/does_programming_change_your_brain/,2025-09-08 13:40:25,2025-09-13 01:19:57
1ncdtru,First week as junior dev feels like a disaster — is this normal?,Revolutionary_Pop474,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone,I just started my first ever job as a junior dev last week (fresh out of school), and honestly it already feels like a disaster. I’m starting to question myself a bit.My first day was Monday, and by Friday I was already in home office. Same today too and Monday too. The only office days are Wednesday and Thursday, which feels a bit sad because I’m brand new and immediately working from home with barely any guidance is to much.I never really got a proper introduction to the project, the systems, or how tickets are normally solved. My very first ticket was basically: “Yo, look in our system, I have a ticket for you, try to solve it. If you have questions, ask me…” That’s it. No walkthrough, no explanation of where to start. I asked how they usually approach tickets or where to even find the relevant code, but I still felt pretty lost.To be fair, I did get a decent intro into the running software itself, so I kind of understand the product. But that’s where it ended. Meanwhile, I see other people who started just a month before me sitting next to their team lead getting tons of explanations and support.Somehow I managed to solve 3 tickets (a mix of with and without help), but most of the time I have nothing to do. I’m just sitting here, bored, not knowing what I should be learning or focusing on.I’ve tried to be proactive and ask what I could look into:Yesterday I asked if there were patterns or frameworks I should study. The response was just: “Take a look at EF and how we make the models"" EF and setting up a config for models isnt that hard so I understood it quite fast.Today I asked again and just got sent some tickets to read through “to see if I understand what the customer wants.” which is so overwhelming.Another coworker told me to check out their validation logic cause I will be working with this part of the project, but there are a ton of files with different rules and it’s overwhelming to dig into alone at home.So now I’m just sitting here wondering: am I doing something wrong? Is it normal to feel this lost and useless in the first week? Or did I pick the wrong career path entirely?It’s super frustrating because I want to learn and contribute, but right now it feels like I’m just drifting.Has anyone else been in this situation? Is this just how the start usually feels, or is this a red flag?",541,0.95,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ncdtru/first_week_as_junior_dev_feels_like_a_disaster_is/,2025-09-09 09:00:47,2025-09-13 01:19:57
1nen2n6,"“My class forces us to use AI like a crutch, and it feels like real coding doesn’t matter anymore”",Juandhjdi,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, I need to vent a little and maybe get some perspective.I am taking a **Distributed Systems class** where we are graded like a **""battle royale""** . The Rules:We are given a problem to solve 10 - 20 min, the first team to finish gets the max grade, the second team gets one unit less, the third team another unit less and so on, if you don't finish in time you get 0. Here's the problem: I feel I have a solid foundation in python and sockets, but is not enough when everyone else is just using AI( Ctrl c + Ctrl v). As long as the code runs you get the grade. Meanwhile I try to understand things deeply and write my own solutions, but is hard to do it on your own when you only get 15-20 min, I freeze under pressure, even though I can solve the problems on my own if I had more time. This makes me feel like I am bad a programming because I can't solve something under time pressure, and that programing is not worth it anymore, I am trying to do my best, but it never seems enough, or am I looking at this the wrong way. Honestly I feel this grading system sucks since we are not encouraged to fail, debug or even learn how our code works, speed is the only thing that matters and that means pasting everything AI throws, I'm seriously considering dropping from that class and take it next semester with other teacher. I could be wrong of course I just want some guidance as to what to do next, Is this grading system fine?",313,0.94,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nen2n6/my_class_forces_us_to_use_ai_like_a_crutch_and_it/,2025-09-11 22:50:34,2025-09-13 01:19:57
1ndxgh9,ThePrimeagen‬ is not a good teach. boot.dev's Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go course,Viscel2al,learnprogramming,"\*EDIT: Title should be ""not a good **teacher""**I hate to say it but ThePrimeagen is not a good teacher.I just completed boot.dev's ""Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go"" course taught by ThePrimeagen on YouTube. What I did was to first attempt the course myself, and only when I got stuck did I refer and watch the same chapter and lesson he was at on the video.In the video, Prime is taking the entire course in one go, and he was doing it on stream, and I think that was the biggest reason his lesson was not good. He is a content creator, so when he codes, he is saying ""yayayayaya"", or ""boom boom"", and rarely ever explaning what he is doing. There are times when he does, but since this is a course, I did have the expectation he would explain what he is doing. He's basically DrDisrespect with that 'stache and mannerism if you what I mean.I would attribute this to because he was streaming it. I can tell his viewers are seasoned developers because they would comment about things and he replies. In that sense, Prime wasn't doing a course, he was just programming and talking to other developers of the same level, hence the lack of verbose explanations.Secondly, while Prime did create this course, what he does in the video is also somewhat different from the course. When programming, there are defintely different ways to do things for sure. But if I go into a lecture and the lecturer doesn't use the textbook that the lesson was built upon, I would be confused too. Especially since I attempted code myself, and only looked at his videos afterwards. Like how he would convert his functions to handle \[\]byte instead of string.The reason why I'm saying is because I took 3 of Lane's course: ""Learn Go"", ""Build a Blog Aggregator in Go"" and ""Build an AI Agent in Python"". In those videos, Lane explains each line of code he is doing and why. And he also shows us what happens when he doesn't know what to do, i.e. asking Boots etc. His lessons really explains everything well and I can highly recommend courses he designs.In Prime's word, I have a skill issue and I'm taking the L. I accept that because if I didn't have a skill issue, I wouldn't be on a learning platform at all. Now the course itself definitely taught me a lot more about HTTP protocols, but after watching 3 other courses by Lane, I was quite dissapointed by the quality of this guided project video that I had to make this post. Maybe Lane will remake this video with him guiding it but I highly doubt so, he's a busy guy and I'm looking forward to the next course he is making.",294,0.9,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ndxgh9/theprimeagen_is_not_a_good_teach_bootdevs_learn/,2025-09-11 02:37:32,2025-09-13 01:19:57

Then I bought the Codecademy course to get the basics again, which I started yesterday (will also do The Odin Project and FreeCampCode courses). I decided to end that trial to focus on myself and learn JavaScript again, then React and Node js. My biggest problem is I don't really know when to use what I learnt. I also think that I don't know how to translate the problem to smaller problems and solve then one by one. I feel super dumb when I'm stuck on a ticket for hours, and that my colleague solve it in like 20 minutes.After giving you some context, my question is : when programming, how do you manage to know which key notion to use to translate the solution into code ?

1nef7i8,"Decided to do a program ""school"" called 42, and now I'm way over my head.",GoddessxTessa,learnprogramming,"It's day 4 of the very intense boot camp program school. I knew going into it, it wasn't going to be like an ordinary school where you are the student and you have the teacher you. Which I was fine with. I knew the whole point was to go in person and ask your peers for help and help them as you work through projects. We're given a project book with an example that we must recreate to pass. My problem is the materials they give us explain absolutely nothing and make it seem so complicated. The ""teachers"" can't tell you anything about anything you have to figure it out yourself. I have some background in computer science and basic knowledge of knowing to code frontend with like python, and html. I passed all my exams with high grades and I'm very studious. But right now with how everything is done in this school I'm feeling overwhelmed and way in over my head. I'm sat at the school for at least 12hrs everyday when possible since the campus is open 24/7 and you set your own schedule, just have to be on time for exams. Yet I've never felt quite so dumb in my life. I could really use help about now because I'm drowning and understand nothing. Edit: It's the next day and I'm grateful for everyone's advice on my situation. I was definitely feeling stressed and not having a good day yesterday with nothing going quite right. But it's a new day and reading everyone's advice has helped me put things into perspective and calm down. So thank you everyone.I'm honestly not even going to think about the exam that's today. I'm going to look into vscode like everyone recommended and definitely try to pick at as many brains as possible. I have messaged about English versions of the pdf files that have the projects for us to do, since I struggle with my second language still. My life motto is ""one day or day one?"" So let's keep going. Thank you everyone. Edit2: I have entered the exam and failed within the first 10 minutes because I couldn't login into the exam (if you've done the 42 piscine you'll know what I mean). But I'm not in despair or anything because I stay afterwards and talked to my peers and figured out where I went wrong and what my mistake was. (It was a really small mistake of not subscribing to the event. I registered for the exam, but I didn't subscribe to the event as well prior to the exam beginning.)I know this isn't the subreddit for 42 (I'm already on that one too). But I do genuinely appreciate everyone's advice, tips and tricks. So I would still love to learn from anyone and everyone (treat me like a 5 year old and let me ask a million why and how questions :face_with_tears_of_joy:), that does include my peers at 42. After failing the exam and see who also failed, helped me see who was more on my level and that definitely gave me a lot more confidence to interact with my peers more. Now I need to figure out how to keep on doing the piscine and not sacrifice my health, because I don't think being glued to a chair for 12hrs is the most healthy thing, nor staring at a screen (I come home with horrible migraines by the end of the day). I want to learn without trying to drown. By the end of the day my brain is fried and I immediately crash out as soon as my head hits my pillow. So please do keep giving me advice, whether it's coding related, how to interact with my peers better (I really struggle with it), caring for myself during the time period, absolutely anything.

Like 'this' pointer is only being able to refer to the instance because the reference to an instance is baked into machine code.A) i found out 'this' pointer just passed to each function as invisible argument. Other OOP languages may work differently.M) I thought that OS is something different than machine code that regular peasants programs useA) It's same regular machine code, but It's more privileged.

1nd2su6,Should I still use UTC for personal log times?,FitPlantain4281,learnprogramming,"So I'm working on an app that essentially allows you to log things you do throughout the day. So if I wake up at 7 AM and do Yoga on September 2, then later I look at the logs for September 2, I will see that I did in fact do Yoga at 7 AM.I'm really struggling with timezones, mainly because I have it in my head that times should always be stored in UTC, and it's a headache to get working.The standard advice is to store it in UTC and then convert to the users timezone when retrieving it, but this doesn't work here since I always want to see the log time relative to the timezone I was in at that time, not the one I'm in now (so if I was in California on September 2 when I did Yoga, then later I look at the log while I'm in New York, I still want to see that I did it at 7 AM, not that I did it 10 AM Eastern.)So the solution I came up with is to store started\_at and ended\_at in UTC, and also store the timezone offsets for wherever the user was at that time, that way I can always display the correct time for the logs. However, this seems really inefficient from a database indexing perspective. 99% of the log queries on the app are for a specific calendar day according to the users location on that day. Which means looking up logs for a specific day goes from the built in database timestamp magic, to having to query every log in a 3 day range, calculate the times adjusted for the saved timezone offset of that record, and then check if the date matches. So I also added a relative\_start\_date and relative\_end\_date to every log, which always stores whatever calendar date the log was started and finished on according to the user's timezone at that time. This way queries can easily be searched by date.The system kind of works, but I keep second guessing if it's really the best way. It feels like a lot of work and a lot of somewhat overlapping fields (started\_at, ended\_at, relative\_start\_date, relative\_end\_date, start\_time\_zone\_offset, end\_time\_zone\_offset) just to keep track of the time. It almost feels like it would be easier to just store the calendar date and then store start\_time and end\_time as seconds from midnight (and maybe an optional end\_calendar\_date for cases when the log spans two days), but I have it in my head that this is wrong and times should always be in stored in UTC.What do you guys think?

However, I also believe that with how good the runtimes are currently at optimising JS/TS code, performance won't be a huge issue.

Same for Golang.Ultimately, I want to develop it in C, but as someone currently looking for jobs and hopes that this project may get some good attraction, I'm worried that choosing C may become a problem.

1nekzmk,A linguist in search of computer tools to get a specific job done. Maybe learning programming is not even necessary.,daliborhrelja,learnprogramming,"Dear all,I'm a linguist interested in some obscure things. I need something simple that gets the job done with the lowest learning curve. Anyway, what I need is the ability to:1) import data - let's say, all the words from a dictionary of a certain language in a column.2) I would like to be able to remove predefined letters or letter strings/combinations from this database of all words.3) after the letters are removed, get a list of all leftover letter strings/combinations (2 or 3 letters combinations, not more than that).4) sort the list by how many times a string is repeated in the database.5) possibly compare the top 100 combinations in multiple languages (I would do steps 1-4 for a couple languages or just import a new column and set the premade steps 2-4 to work on it) to see if they overlap. Some of the steps may get mixed up. \---Do I really need to learn to code to do this? Instinctually, this appears to be relatively simple and could be done even without learning how to code. But correct me if I am wrong. So far, AI has shown a bit of misdemeanor and not given me or people I know a flat out answer when the question was something very similar to what I am looking for and I would like to, therefore, skip using AI for this task. That said, I would like to learn to program enough to be able to do what is described above and get back to working with language as fast as possible.

When I was 19, I dropped out of mechanical engineering, so I have taken a TON of math classes (through Diff Eq, calcs 1-3, linear algebra).

I've read a few discussions about which degree people should go into from an interest POV, but I'm asking purely from a practical employability POV. Some people have noted that WGU's SE degree might not be as mathematically rigorous as others, but it is ABET-accredited, which seemed to be the differentiator for Mechanical Engineers when I worked as an intern (non-ABET were essentially looked at as a liability).My questions are: \- Does one degree have better job prospects in this market? \- SE doesn't require much math; is it looked at in a different light because of that? \- If I stay in SE, should I list my completed math classes in the education section of my resume? Will that be a differentiator?I'm enjoying SE, but if I can graduate earlier, that would also be great, and if they are relatively equivalent or if SE is somewhat worse, my only argument for staying in SE is that I'll be taking more classes and therefore possibly will learn more.

I can solve a problem (in due time), with some help of either colleagues, internet, or LLMs, but I reckon there are people (mostly on youtube) that are like a few levels above me, like 11-12/10, I can't follow their reasoning most of the time. Also some people's ability to read a problem for the first time, and immediately come up with the optimal solution, is astonishing, while I have to iterate multiple times, and not without errors.So I guess, my question is more for the people with some experience on their side, either in corporate or in startups, or for big personal projects. How do you become a better programmer and a better problem solver?I'm not looking only for answers like ""Read X book from Y"" (although they are appreciated), but I am looking for what changed your approach in programming, problem solving, that made you go from ""I am able to read some code, write normal/trivial functions"" to ""I can start from an idea and turn it into a functional program, with all its libraries/dependancies developed from scratch"".",3,0.64,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nbx2fv/how_do_i_become_a_better_programmer/,2025-09-08 19:18:58,2025-09-13 01:19:57

The questions are scoped appropriately they won't ask you to design all of AWS, but they will test if you can think beyond just writing code.**SDE3 and Above (Senior):** Expect 1-2 system design rounds, and they get serious. The Bar Raiser might throw you a curveball system design question too. At this level, they're evaluating if you can own and architect significant portions of Amazon's infrastructure.**Phone Screen vs Onsite:** Here's something people don't realize system design can appear in phone screens for SDE2+ roles. It's not just an onsite thing anymore. One engineer told me they got a 30-minute system design question during their phone screen, which caught them completely off guard.# The Interview FormatHere's exactly how those 45-60 minutes typically break down:**Minutes 0-5: The Setup** The interviewer presents the problem, and here's the thing it's intentionally vague. They might say something like ""Design a system to handle package tracking for Amazon deliveries."" That's it. No requirements, no scale, nothing.**Minutes 5-15: Requirements Gathering** This is where most candidates mess up. They jump straight into drawing boxes and arrows. Don't do that. Ask questions. Lots of them.Real questions you should ask:* ""What's the scale we're talking about? Thousands of packages or millions?""* ""Do we need real-time updates or is eventual consistency okay?""* ""What's our budget constraint?"" (Yes, Amazon cares about cost)* ""Are we building this from scratch or can we use existing AWS services?""One SDE3 shared that their interviewer specifically noted they were impressed when asked about cost implications. That's pure Amazon thinking right there frugality is one of their leadership principles, and it should show in your design.**Minutes 15-35: High-Level Design** Now you start drawing. But here's what's different about Amazon they want to see you think about their ecosystem. If you're designing a notification system and don't mention SNS or SQS, you're missing the mark. They expect you to know basic AWS services.You'll sketch out your components:* Data flow* Major system components* Database choices (and why)* API design* How components communicate**Minutes 35-50: Deep Dive** The interviewer will pick one component and drill down. ""Tell me more about how you'd handle the database."" or ""What happens when this service gets 10x the traffic?""This is where the interview gets interesting. They might suddenly change requirements. ""Oh, I forgot to mention, we need to support 10 million packages per day."" How does your design hold up? Can you adapt without starting over?**Minutes 50-55: Trade-offs and Wrap-up**They'll ask about trade-offs in your design. Not specific product names, but concepts like: ""Why did you choose NoSQL over a relational database?"" ""What are the downsides of your approach?"" ""How would you handle data consistency with your chosen architecture?"" ""What would you monitor to ensure this system is healthy?# What Amazon Actually AsksWhile other companies might ask you to design generic systems, Amazon focuses on their actual operational challenges. Here's what they really ask about:**Real Examples from Recent Interviews:*** Design a distributed inventory management system* Design a monitoring platform for internal microservices* Design a package routing optimization system* Design a fraud detection pipeline for returns* Design a CDN for Amazon's static content* Design a warehouse robot coordination systemNotice a pattern? These are all Amazon-specific problems. They're operational, practical, and tied to real business needs.One engineer interviewing for SDE3 was asked to ""Design a system to track and optimize delivery driver routes in real-time."" The interviewer wanted to see:* How they'd handle GPS data from thousands of drivers* Cost optimization* Real-time rerouting capabilities* Integration with existing Amazon systemsAnother candidate for SDE2 got: ""Design a simple notification system for order updates."" This isn't some generic problem it's something Amazon handles millions of times daily.# How Leadership Principles Show UpAmazon evaluates your system design through their Leadership Principles lens:* **Customer focus:** Your design should prioritize user experience. Fast response times, reliable service, good error handling.* **Cost awareness:** Don't over-engineer. If you're using 100 servers when 10 would work, they'll notice.* **Scalability:** Your design should handle growth. They'll often ask ""What if traffic increases 10x?""* **Technical depth:** Be ready to explain details. If you mention a database, know why you chose it over alternatives.**The Bar Raiser's Perspective**The Bar Raiser ensures new hires improve the team's overall quality. They're trained to be objective and look for:* Clear technical reasoning* Ability to handle changing requirements* How you make trade-offs* Whether you can explain complex ideas simplyThey have veto power but rarely use it. Their main job is ensuring the interview process is fair and thorough.# Common Mistakes to AvoidBased on what I've heard from both successful and unsuccessful candidates:**1. Over-engineering**Keep your design appropriate for the stated requirements. If the problem is US-only, don't design for global deployment.**2. Ignoring Cost** Amazon runs on thin margins. If your solution requires 1000 servers when 100 would do, that's a red flag. Always think about cost optimization.**3. Not Knowing AWS Basics**You don't need to be an AWS expert, but knowing S3, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, and Lambda is expected for SDE2+. Building a custom solution when an AWS service already exists shows you didn't do your homework.**4. Forgetting About Operations** How do you monitor your system? What metrics do you track? How do you handle deployments? Amazon thinks about Day 2 operations, not just Day 1 launch.**5. Not Asking Clarifying Questions** As Amazon's own interview prep states: ""Expect at least one question on software systems design"" and ""Your interviewer will ask questions related to your design, and you should ask questions to complete and validate your design."" The ambiguity is intentional they want to see how you handle it.# Preparation TipsHere's how to actually prepare for the Amazon system design interview:**Study AWS Services** You don't need to know everything, but understand:* S3 (object storage)* DynamoDB (NoSQL)* RDS (relational databases)* SQS/SNS (messaging)* Lambda (serverless)* CloudFront (CDN)* ElastiCache (caching)**Practice Amazon-Specific Scenarios** Instead of generic problems, practice:* E-commerce systems (shopping cart, inventory)* Logistics (routing, tracking)* Internal tools (monitoring, deployment)* Cost optimization problems**Read Amazon Engineering Blogs** Amazon's engineering blog has real architecture deep-dives. Reading how they actually built Prime Video's architecture is more valuable than memorizing generic patterns.**Mock Interviews with Constraints** Practice with realistic constraints:* ""System must handle 100,000 daily active users""* ""Data must be retained for 90 days""* ""API response time under 200 ms""**Learn to Handle Curveballs** Practice having requirements change mid-design. If someone says ""actually, make that 100x the scale,"" can you adapt without panicking?# Your Game PlanLook, the Amazon system design interview is challenging, but it's not impossible. The key is understanding what they're actually looking for: engineers who can build practical, cost-effective systems that scale.Here's your action plan:1. Learn basic AWS services (spend a weekend on this)2. Practice 5-10 Amazon-specific design problems3. Always include cost in your discussions4. Think about operations and monitoring5. Be ready to adapt when requirements change# The Real Questions They're AskingAfter talking to engineers and collecting real interview experiences, my team and I realized there's a huge gap between what people study and what Amazon actually asks. We've been collecting actual system design questions from recent Amazon interviews complete with the specific constraints and requirements the interviewers used.We built [leetwho.com](http://leetwho.com/) to share these real questions. It's not another tutorial site it's actual problems from actual interviews, organized by company and level. When Amazon shifts their focus (like their recent emphasis on ML system design), we know within weeks because our contributors are actively interviewing.If you want to practice with what Amazon actually asks instead of generic problems, check out our collection. We keep it updated with the latest patterns and questions.Remember, the Amazon system design interview isn't about having perfect answers. It's about showing you can think like an Amazon engineer: customer-focused, cost-conscious, and capable of building systems that actually work at scale.Good luck with your interview.

1ndiw92,Working at a startup taught me more in 3 years than 10+ years at larger companies. I wish I did it sooner.,d_wilson123,cscareerquestions,"It has been a career bucket list item to work at a startup that is just getting off the ground. I joined as a staff engineer on a central platform team with one other engineer. Eventually the team grew to 4 engineers. As startups tend to do the financials struggled and the team was let go. However with everything I learned I could confidently speak about almost all parts of platform engineering with hands-on confidence I did 1 interview which resulted in 1 offer. [Note: It was a company I had previously worked for and knew lots of people. This isn't a brag about getting a job in a struggling market so this context is important.] Here is some of my experiences.Working at large companies things tend to be somewhat figured out. A typical question I would get when interviewing new engineers for roles on the team was about what the most difficult part of the job is. My honest answer was always there was me and another engineer. If we didn't know the answer that means you have to figure it out because no one else at the company knows. These are some of the parts of the job I always knew about but lacked working hands-on:**DNS** - At every company I worked for DNS was managed by another team, typically SREs. I knew about various record types and all that and I knew how to dig a DNS record but here we had to setup the R53 ourselves, purchase the domains ourselves, setup the subdomains ourselves and setup all the record ourselves. We had to figure out how to manage this in a sustainable way so DNS isn't spread across a bunch of AWS accounts and do that in a secure fashion.**CICD** - Of course every engineer oftentimes interfaces with CICD. My experience was typically extending some scripts someone else wrote to do most of the hard stuff. The cluster was owned and operated by someone else. But we had to figure out what CICD to use, how to integrate it into our pipelines, how to build our services, how to house containers, how to deploy the services. There was no service builder helper to extend it had to start from scratch.**App Startup** - The companies I worked for already had app startup figured out. There was some framework you'd implement which would give you logging, metrics and some form of observability for free out of the box. But we had to figure out how to get these apps running and build out this framework ourselves. This even included selecting which language to use for our platform, how to structure the project and coding standards.**Infrastructure** - Every place loves to interview you on scalability but I've personally always found it somewhat abstracted away from me as the developer. My job was to crunch the code to make my container and it was someone else's job to scale it up or at least provide a convenient way to do so - usually some core tech team. At the very least usually stuff before it hits your code is owned and operated by someone else. Now again we leveraged AWS so lots of it is batteries included. The API Gateways scale, if we're using serverless it scales, if we're using a managed database it scales. But not everything was managed. So we typically had to write out the entire infrastructure diagrams ourselves and find scale points. This allowed me to walk into system design interviews not just spewing out memorization about various scaling techniques I actually had to live and breathe it for a long time. Questions about trade offs and decisions were now extremely easy to talk about because these were things I actually had to solve personally.**IAC** - I lacked a lot of Terraform know-how going into the job. So even simple questions which I now know as Terraform 101 such as ""How do I save this state file from my ephemeral CICD node?"" were complete unknowns. We had to figure out basically everything Terraform from scratch. Companies I've worked for in the past usually didn't expose Terraform to me directly. They were hybrid bare metal and public cloud options. So we had some form of IAC but it was always proprietary to the company, usually owned and managed by someone else and typically pared down. So this gave me direct exposure to how to describe my infrastructure as code including things like I said about how to save state files, how to tag my resources, how to manage int/dev/stage/prod environments and all of that. My previous experience was just writing some YAML and it was someone else's job to interpret all of that.**Observability** - Like I said previously usually this is something included in the app framework of the company. But this gave me experience setting up Grafana (our tool of choice), pumping or replicating logs to it, setting up collectors for metrics, setting up alerting and all the dashboarding. The alerting and dashboarding I'm sure most people have had experience with but usually for logging and metrics I'd just have to inject something into my application and it ""just worked"" without having to think about it too terribly much.This is a long winded post and not a question at all but more a bit of advice. If you are given the opportunity to work at a very early stage start up I highly recommend it. My end result was the same as most early start ups - I got let go. However I feel it made me a much more employable engineer that now can talk about times I actually built a lot of components that go into a backend platform. I don't need to talk about these things in the abstract, which of course is still important to understand, but I can speak to them in the concrete now. It was a fantastic growing and learning experience for me, personally.",283,0.92,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ndiw92/working_at_a_startup_taught_me_more_in_3_years/,2025-09-10 16:25:03,2025-09-13 01:19:58

1ncqxhi,Opinions wanted - Was my candidate cheating?,paynoattn,cscareerquestions,"**Original text:** Was interviewing a candidate today, she is from India (not my choice) - EDIT: SEE BELOW FOR WHAT I MEANT HERE. She has solid experience 5 years. We're trying to fill a full stack .net and angular role (once again, not my choice). We had three sessions - get to know you, framework and language knowledge, and then LC easy (13 - Roman numeral to integer) with screen sharing. She seems really stiff and nervous, but literally answers every question 100% accurately.For the knowledge section it would usually take her a couple stabs and seconds of silence to get to the right / correct answer.Me: ""What is the best data structure for storing 10 million records in memory?"" Her: ""A list or array but for that many records I think you should use a dictionary."" Me: ""How would you handle a sql query that takes 30 seconds to return?"" Her: ""blah blah blah, pagination, blah blah blah."" (in a follow up questions she finally got to indexes"" Me: ""What's SOLID"" Her: \*literally lists of the entire acronym correctly with what it means\*I'm really skeptical at this point she either has notes, or is using chatgpt on another monitor. I'm personally fine with this, because I find it pretty easy to sus out and honestly only do this section because it's required by our HR department (I told them I wanted to do a single 2 hour long session with two LCs and a live project collaboration and skip the knowledge check and they were like ""no, that's not how we do it."" >(ভ⤙ ভ "")<).Then we get to the LC. I share her a fiddle with the LC and tell her can use Visual Studio, or VS Code, or the fiddle - up to her. I tell her getting the solution isn't the important part - being able to explain her logic and thought process is. She then stumbles around with Visual Studio for like 3 minutes trying to create a solution, then switches to VS code - copies the fiddle into a FUCKING JAVASCRIPT FILE AND PROCEEDS TO RAW DOG THE C# WITHOUT SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING IN A JAVASCRIPT FILE. IN COMPLETE AWKWARD SILENCE TOO lol. I am floored. Is this cheating? Is she that nervous?But the problem with the cheating scenario is I can see her working through the problem like I would. I.e. first create a method to iterate the string and break it into chars, then a method where she used a switch to get the int value, then she put the check for the previous char is less than in a static method, etc.At the end, once again in complete fucking silence, she just dumps her javascript c# bastard child into the fiddle, runs it and gets the correct answer. I am so speechless at this. I ask her to explain her solution, which she does a decent job at and explains the business logic pretty well, then we drop from the interview.I use this same LC easy for pretty much every interview, and I literally have never seen such unhinged behavior in my life. My gut is telling me she just hates interviewing, but is secretly an interviewing chad and has done a TON of prep - but I also am out of the interviewee game - I haven't interviewed for a position since before COVID. Tell me, fellow gamers, is the cheating tech that good that it will tell you specifically how to fake reasoning out a solution? Or is it also giving nervousness / awkardness to you guys?**Edit**: I am leaving the original post body as to not receive criticism of secrecy. In my statement about the interviewee, I say ""*she is from India (not my choice)*"". What I meant by this is to say, I have no control over this decision - and to show that simplistic suggestions as ""just interview in person,"" won't work. Yes my company has an office in India that they could interview at, but there is nobody on my team or my boss' team that could do that for us. All five of my team leads are in N / S America. We do have employees on my team there, but they are all mid level. This is a senior role. I have in the past asked for support from other teams for this, but have been either ignored or told there isn't resources to support it.I personally fully support companies hiring everywhere in the world and employees being able to work everywhere in the world, at a good salary with no exploitation and nobody losing their jobs to accomplish this. Some of the best engineers I have ever worked with are Indian, both from collaborating across the world or as H1B on the path to green card and citizenship in the US. :India: :red_heart:Also, for this role, we cannot hire anywhere but in India as it is part of our companies expense budget for India. We are filling an open role from somebody who was already in India when I became manager of the team, who left some time ago. I can't go more into detail due to HR/Compliance reasons.I could have explained all of this above, yes, but I was already writing a really long post and wanted to just get to the point without detracting from it with a long winded explanation nobody could have wanted. Well here is the long winded explanation several have asked for.If you felt my comments about the interviewees ethnicity or national origin were offensive or mean - I apologize.Also for those that are wondering why I said (*once again, not my choice*) for .net / angular - yeah I fucking hate that shit.

1nc4tl7,Is this good advice for a recent grad who didn't do internships?,btzmacin,cscareerquestions,"I'm a senior engineer (12 YOE), and a friend of the family's kid is a recent grad who, naturally, hasn't been able to land a job, given he didn't do any internships before graduating. His dad asked me if there was anything I could do and I cringed, but told him to have the kid text me and I'd see what I could do to get him on track, but not to expect miracles.My plan for advising him is to set expectations: not having any experience on his resume exiting college will make it impossible to land any engineering role in the current job market. He probably needs to run a 3-year-long marathon to get where he wants to be.I think his only shot is going to be a tech-adjacent role, probably helpdesk or support, but maybe a business analyst or junior product/project manager role if he is incredibly lucky. Of course, he needs to continue applying to junior engineer openings on the off chance they give him an interview, for the experience of interviewing alone.Even making these concessions, he needs to wrap his mind around 6 months to a year of applying everyday with nothing to show for it. If his parents need him to contribute to the household, a McJob will be necessary to make ends meet.While applying, I'd have him come up with a product. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, disruptive, profitable, or even revenue-generating. What's important is that he build it from zero, and that the result is usable by some audience. To build the product, I'd advise him to leverage AI the same way we used to leverage stackoverflow. Once he ships an MVP, he can include it on his resume, but he needs to continue to iterate on it.If he lands a eng-adjacent role, he needs to stay there for 2 years at least to avoid being labeled as a job-hopper. Keep working on the side project, or kick off a new one. Automate tasks at work with and without AI.Did I miss anything, or is anything above way off base? I don't want to scare the kid, but at the same time, this market is horrendous for seniors...I can't imagine having nothing but coursework on my resume right now.",67,0.88,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nc4tl7/is_this_good_advice_for_a_recent_grad_who_didnt/,2025-09-09 00:35:08,2025-09-13 01:19:58

1nakc3f,Struggling to fit in in big tech - advice for hitting high performer goals?,Icy-Cat-2658,cscareerquestions,"This isn’t a CS career question, but this subreddit is full of smart minds (please suggest another sub if there’s somewhere else to take this)! I’m about 10 years into my engineering career; self-taught and came into Disney as a senior mobile engineer, then left after five years to join a big tech. I came into big tech at a pretty high level role for an IC, which sometimes gets into my head that I have imposter syndrome.Any job I’ve ever had in tech, I’ve been a high performer. I got promoted at Disney after three months, highly unlikely because I’m any more skilled than anyone else (I’m definitely not), but probably I spent a weekend on a high-impact side project that was fun and had cross-functional impact, and I’m a good communicator. I sort of coasted there, but big tech has been a gut punch.I’m 6 months into my role at big tech and was rated as an underperformer. Given that I came in at a high level, I have no doubt the expectations were high, but I think I’m doing my best. I say yes to a lot (often a curse), take on whatever is asked of me, and try to push through learning complex systems and very frequent uncertainty of what I should be doing every day. I work with smart and very helpful people, but when I hit a technical glitch (often), rarely does anyone on my team have any solution that works, and I end up spending time finding more resources or trying to self-solve until I get it.This is the first time I’ve ever been anything but a star performer. I think I’m letting work for such a prestigious company get to me, but I also think I’m trusting colleagues to tell me where to focus each day and not delivering quickly at all because the systems are complex, ridden with issues, and while people try to help me, I don’t genuinely feel like I’m getting a lot of help or even know what questions to ask until I hit a problem.Has anyone else ever dealt with this?

1ncgjvi,"First dev job, struggling with unmaintainable React code",spurkle,cscareerquestions,"I’m an early-career frontend developer, and I’ve been at my first job (a startup) for about 10 months now.First, I was assigned to work on a product that had quite a few bad practices - not type-safe, over a thousand TypeScript/linter errors, and a huge 10k+ LOC table component. With a lot of effort from me and my teammate, we managed to make it somewhat decent and easier to work with.Apparently because I did a good job, I was thrown into another project that was built in-house, and honestly, I’m feeling extremely frustrated because it’s the same story all over again - the codebase is even harder to work with. Some examples:* Massive 2k+ LOC React components* Misuse of Context API for basically everything* Features tightly coupled, imagine component with 10+ useEffects, sockets, table column definitions, 10 level deep ternary operators, and subtle differences depending on ""mode"" - reused like 20 times throughout the app, used to display completely different entities.* Testing and modularization are basically nonexistent* Unclear dependencies (Entity info modal depends on a 2k LOC Loads context and on a common state that is consumed by chat modal, which depends on a 2k LOC NewLoads context, etc...)* This project is built on NextJS + It has a separate node backend. Why? Good question.Honestly, it’s just incredibly bad.I also position myself as a full-stack developer, so I took some tasks on the backend side - same story:* 8k+ LOC controllers mixing validation, service, and repository logic* Error handling? `res.status(500).json({ msg: ""Internal server error"" })` \- lol* Not using prepared statements (hello SQLi)* No pagination in a logistics app* Why assign some common processed data into a shared variable, when you can just copy and paste the processing part.* Copy-pasted logic with zero abstraction* Lots of inconsistencies (e.g., phone field required in some places, optional in others)* No tests and probably untestable - ZERO classes in a 100k LOC codebaseSo, honestly, I am extremely frustrated. It feels like everything I learned about writing maintainable code is being wasted.I’m considering leaving for a healthier codebase, but since this is my first job and I don’t have a formal CS degree, I’m worried about how it’ll look. I want to grow my skills, especially in maintainable React development, but I don’t want to feel stuck in this mess forever.So my questions:1. Is it reasonable to leave a first job after 10 months because the code is unmaintainable?2. How do I frame this experience positively in interviews?3. Any tips for surviving in such a codebase?

1nfcosg,Cultural differences in job search,RecognitionSignal425,cscareerquestions,"Hey all, I've been grinding through tech interviews and I've noticed some stark cultural differences. Disclaimer: this isn't about bias—it's just my personal observations and what I've heard from others in the industry. Not saying one way is better or worse, but it's definitely shaped how I prep.From my experience, interviewers who grew up in the US (or 'completely Westernized') tend to keep things chill and conversational. They'll ask about your background, chat about past projects, and throw in questions that simulate problem-solving discussions. Often helpful with hints if you get stuck, and the vibe/culture fit is crucial. On the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more ""pass/fail"" mentality—either your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. I think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly.

1nfcktr,Not sure if new grad is going so well so far - does anyone have any advice?,Rich-Put4159,cscareerquestions,"I started working at Amazon as a new grad SWE mid-July, and I'm not sure if it's going so well. The tasks I had been given to work on had been one script for a data transfer I did finish, then fixes for two bugs that I haven't been able to figure out at all so far. The other engineer that started the same day as me had been working on different things, but seemed to do a lot more so far. I had been letting other engineers on my team know where I'm getting stuck, they would give me recommendations that I tried implementing, then I try using those and they don't work. It's pretty much been that cycle for those two bugs that I tried working on (namely the latter since the former was lower priority). When I met with my manager last month, he didn't have any concerns with my performance so far, but I imagine that that wouldn't mean much. I feel like I'm starting to question whether I have what it takes for the job in a way, and I feel kind of bad about myself compared to other people that always seem to know what to do.I know PIP culture is a big thing here, so I feel like I should probably start studying up on LeetCode/System Design for if I need to start applying again.

1ne0zxa,.NET dev (5+ yrs) to Dynamics 365 – is it worth it?,theploop,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I could use some advice.I’ve been working as a .NET web developer for a little over 5 years now, mostly on enterprise and government-type projects. I’d say I’m mid-level, maybe senior depending on the team. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck in my career. Moving toward a team lead role in .NET seems to require switching jobs, grinding harder technically, and pushing myself in ways I can’t really do right now for personal reasons.A friend suggested I look into Dynamics 365. His reasoning was that it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication — which are actually strengths of mine. Plus, having a solid dev background might give me an edge compared to people who started directly in Dynamics.I did a bit of research and it seems like the Dynamics market is growing and there’s a clearer career path (especially with certifications). I get that certs alone aren’t enough without real experience, but at least the path feels more structured than in my current track. I’ve also heard people say Dynamics can be “boring” or “not real programming,” but honestly, I’m fine with that — stability and problem-solving are more important to me now.For context, I’m currently in a financially good job, so I’m not desperate to switch. But I don’t want to stay stagnant either.So my questions are:• Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?• What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?• Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?Would love to hear from people who are already in the field or made a similar switch.",6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ne0zxa/net_dev_5_yrs_to_dynamics_365_is_it_worth_it/,2025-09-11 05:55:36,2025-09-13 01:19:58

I've indicated that I'm very interested in the position, however I'm worried I may have been a bit too eager in showing my interest as the salary of the position wasn't disclosed, would require that I change from full-remote to hybrid, and the company is generally known for giving lackluster at best raises/promotions. I'm already on the lower end of the payscale for my current role, so I have a feeling they're going to try lowballing me on the salary extra hard for the new position by just offering like a 15% bump (for reference the low end of the band for the new role in my area on glassdoor/indeed is more like a 40-50% bump compared to my current salary), which I feel wouldn't be worth it at all when taking into account the additional responsibilities, costs of commuting, and degraded work/life balance. Assuming that the company does lowball me and isn't willing to budge, how would you guys recommend I handle things? Respectfully decline the position despite previously showing great interest in it and take this as a sign to start looking for a new position, or just grit my teeth and accept the lowball offer and try to leverage the new title to get a new job somewhere offering a salary and benefits more in line with what appears to be industry standard after 3-6 months in the new role?",6,0.88,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nbxa13/how_to_handle_a_potentially_disappointing/,2025-09-08 19:26:55,2025-09-13 01:19:58

1ncy4bs,What do I do?,HI8OI,cscareerquestions,"I recently joined an unpaid internship position at a startup because I was desperate for relevant experience to add to my resume since I didn't have any.The CEO and founders are SUPERRRRRR infatuated with using AI to code and vibe coding with Cursor or other AI agent IDE. They want us to code and ship hella fast because they think we could accomplish that using all those AI tools.Now when I'm looking at the codebase, I don't know WTF is going on. EVERYONE at the company is using AI to write their code which created a huge spaghetti mess of code and a junkyard of files.Now I'm pondering: should I leave and look for a better job or internship or should I tough it out for 3 months. I'm scared that if I leave I won't be able to find another opportunity to fill in that experience.I'm just a recent grad with no internship or relevant experience so I don't know what's the norm in the industry right now. I don't even have an experience section in my resume so I know I'm cooked:skull:",2,0.67,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ncy4bs/what_do_i_do/,2025-09-09 23:08:20,2025-09-13 01:19:58
