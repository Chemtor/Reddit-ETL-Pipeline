1n7fu2f,Confirm my suspicion about data modeling,DryRelationship1330,dataengineering,"As a consultant, I see a lot of mid-market and enterprise DWs in varying states of (mis)management.When I ask DW/BI/Data Leaders about Inmon/Kimball, Linstedt/Data Vault, constraints as enforcement of rules, rigorous fact-dim modeling, SCD2, or even domain-specific models like OPC-UA or OMOP… the quality of answers has dropped off a cliff. 10 years ago, these prompts would kick off lively debates on formal practices and techniques (ie. the good ole fact-qualifier matrix).Now? More often I see a mess of staging and store tables dumped into Snowflake, plus some catalog layers bolted on later to help make sense of it....usually driven by “the business asked for report\_x.”I hear less argument about the integration of data to comport with the Subjects of the Firm and more about ETL jobs breaking and devs not using the right formatting for PySpark tasks.I’ve come to a conclusion: the era of Data Modeling might be gone.

1navs38,"After 8 years, I'm thinking of callling it quits",Fonduemeup,dataengineering,"**After working as a DA for 1 year, DS/MLE for 3 years, and DE for 4, my outlook on this field (and life in general, sadly) has never been bleaker.** Every position I've been in has had its own frustrations in some way: team is overworked, too much red tape, lack of leadership, lack of organization/strategy, hostile stakeholders, etc...And just recently, **management laid off some of our team because they ""think we should be able to use AI to be more productive"".** I feel like I have been searching for that mystical ""dream job"" for years, and yet it seems that I am further away from obtaining it as ever before. With AI having already made so much progress, I'm starting to think that this dream job I have been looking for may no longer even exist. Even though I've enjoyed my job at times in the past, **at this point, I think I'm done with this career.** I have lost all the passion that I originally had 8 years ago, and I don't foresee it ever returning. What will I do next? Who knows. I have a few months of savings that will keep me afloat before I figure that out, and if money starts running out, my backup plan is to become a surf instructor in Fiji (or something along those lines). Before the layoffs, my team was already using AI, and, while it's been increasingly useful, the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation. We've been pretty good on staying up-to-date with AI trends - we hopped on Cursor back in February and have been using Claude Code since April. However, our codebase is way too convoluted for consistent results, and we lack proper documentation for AI agents to implement major changes. After several failed attempts to solve these issues, I find Claude Code only useful for small, localized features or fixes. Until LLMs can extrapolate code to understand the underlying business context, or write code that is fully aware of end-to-end system dependencies, my team will continue to face these problems. **My favorite part about working in data has always been when I get to solve challenging problems through code, but this has completely disappeared from my day-to-day work**. Writing complex logic is a fun challenge, and it's very rewarding when you finally build a working solution. Unfortunately, this is one of the few things AI is much more efficient than me at doing, so I barely do it anymore. Instead, I'm basically supervising a junior engineer (Claude) that does the work while I handle the administrative / PM duties. Meanwhile, I'm even more busy than before since we are all picking up the extra workload from our teammates that were let go. As AI capabilities continue to improve, this part of my job will surely become a larger amount of my time, and I simply can't see myself doing it any more than I already am. I had a short stint as a manager a couple years ago, and while it wasn't for me, it was at least rewarding to help actual people. Instructing a LLM was interesting and fun at first, but the novelty wore off several months ago, and I now find it to be irritating above anything else. Most of my experience comes from startups and mid-sized companies, but it really hit me yesterday when talking to my friend who is a DS at a FAANG. She has been dealing with her own frustrations at work, and although her situation is very different than mine, she voiced the same negative sentiments that I had been feeling. I am now thinking that my feelings are more widespread than I thought.

The goal is to provide a central place for analysts and other stakeholders to access and work with reports and data.Fabric looks promising as an all-in-one solution, but we’ve run into a challenge: many of the features are still marked as Preview, and in some cases they don’t work as reliably as we’d like.That got us thinking: should we fully commit to Fabric, or consider switching parts of the stack to open source projects? With open source, we’d likely have to combine multiple tools to reach a similar level of functionality. On the plus side, that would give us:⁠- flexible server scaling based on demand- potentially lower costs- more flexibility in how we handle different workloadsOn the other hand, Fabric provides a more integrated ecosystem, less overhead in managing different tools, and tight integration with the Microsoft stack.Any insights would be super helpful as we’re evaluating the best long-term direction. :)",72,0.96,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n6lf8r/microsoft_fabric_vs_open_source_alternatives_for/,2025-09-02 14:44:25,2025-09-08 01:38:28

1n81kxy,I built a Python tool to create a semantic layer over SQL for LLMs using a Knowledge Graph. Is this a useful approach?,Key_Salamander234,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,So I've been diving into AI for the past few months (this is actually my first real project) and got a bit frustrated with how ""dumb"" LLMs can be when it comes to navigating complex SQL databases. Standard text-to-SQL is cool, but it often misses the business context buried in weirdly named columns or implicit relationships.My idea was to build a semantic layer on top of a SQL database (PostgreSQL in my case) using a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j. The goal is to give an LLM a ""map"" of the database it can actually understand.\*\*Here's the core concept:\*\*Instead of just tables and columns, the Python framework builds a graph with rich nodes and relationships:\* \*\*Node Types:\*\* We have \`Database\`, \`Schema\`, \`Table\`, and \`Column\` nodes. Pretty standard stuff.\* \*\*Properties are Key:\*\* This is where it gets interesting. Each \`Column\` node isn't just a name. I use GPT-4 to synthesize properties like:\* \`business\_description\`: ""Stores the final approval date for a sales order.""\* \`stereotype\`: \`TIMESTAMP\`, \`PRIMARY\_KEY\`, \`STATUS\_FLAG\`, etc.\* \`confidence\_score\`: How sure the LLM is about its analysis.\* \*\*Rich Relationships:\*\* This is the core of the semantic layer. The graph doesn't just have \`HAS\_COLUMN\` relationships. It also creates:\* \`EXPLICIT\_FK\_TO\`: For actual foreign keys, a direct, machine-readable link.\* \*\*\`IMPLICIT\_RELATION\_TO\`\*\*: This is the fun part. It finds columns that are logically related but have no FK constraint. For example, it can figure out that \`users.email\_address\` is semantically equivalent to \`employees.contact\_email\`. It does this by embedding the descriptions and doing a vector similarity search in Neo4j to find candidates, then uses the LLM to verify.The final KG is basically a ""human-readable"" version of the database schema that an LLM agent could query to understand context before trying to write a complex SQL query. For instance, before joining tables, the agent could ask the graph: ""What columns are semantically related to \`customer\_id\`?""Since I'm new to this, my main question for you all is: \*\*is this actually a useful approach in the real world?\*\* Does something like this already exist and I just reinvented the wheel?I'm trying to figure out if this idea has legs or if I'm over-engineering a problem that's already been solved.

1n9culi,The Anatomy of a S3-Native Distributed Query Engine,heisenberg_zzh,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering,I'm the co-founder of Databend, an open source Snowflake alternative, and I wanted to share a bit of our journey building a SQL query engine that's designed to live on cloud storage like S3. This isn't a sales pitch—just an honest, educational walkthrough of the ""why"" behind our architecture. If you've ever been curious about what happens inside a query engine or why your queries on data lakes sometimes feel slow, I hope this sheds some light.**The Dream: A Database on S3**Like many of you, we love S3. It's cheap, it's huge, and it's durable. The dream is to just point a SQL engine at it and go, without managing a complex, traditional data warehouse. But there's a catch: S3 is a network service, and the network is *slow*.A single data request to S3 might take 50-200 milliseconds. In that tiny slice of time, your CPU could have executed millions of instructions. If your query engine just sits there and waits for the data to arrive, you're essentially paying for expensive CPUs to do nothing. This latency is the single biggest monster you have to slay when building a database on S3.**Why We Built a New Query Executor**When we started, we naturally looked at classic database designs. They're brilliant pieces of engineering, but they were born in a world of fast, local disks.1. **The ""Pull"" Model (aka the ""Volcano"" model):** Think of this like a game of telephone. The final step of your query plan (e.g., `SUM()`) asks the step before it for a row, which asks the step before it, and so on, all the way down to the data source. It's simple and has a nice, natural flow. **But on S3, it's a performance disaster.** When the first operator in the chain asks S3 for data, the *entire assembly line* of operators grinds to a halt. Your CPUs are idle, just waiting for data to arrive, while you're burning money on compute you can't use.2. **The ""Push"" Model (Vectorized Execution):** This is more like a factory assembly line. The data source pushes batches of data to the first worker, which processes it and pushes it to the next. It's fantastic for raw CPU performance. **But on S3, it's a memory bomb.** S3 can send data in unpredictable bursts. A fast data-scanning step can easily flood a slower step (like a complex `JOIN`), causing data to pile up in memory until the system crashes.**From SQL to an Execution Plan**So, how does a simple SQL string like `SELECT * FROM ...` turn into a plan that our workers can run? It's a multi-stage process, a bit like a chef turning a recipe into a detailed kitchen workflow.1. **Parsing:** First, we parse the raw SQL text into a structured format called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is just a tree that represents the query's grammar, making it understandable for the machine.2. **Logical Plan:** Next, we convert the AST into a *logical plan*. This describes the *what* of the query—the sequence of high-level operations needed, like ""scan this table,"" then ""filter these rows,"" then ""aggregate the results."" It's still abstract and doesn't care about how the data is stored or how many machines we have.3. **Physical Plan:** This is where the magic happens. Our query optimizer takes the logical plan and transforms it into a *physical plan*. It looks at table statistics, data layout, and available resources to decide the most efficient *how*. For example, it decides whether to use a Hash Join or a Merge Join, how to distribute work across nodes, and in what order to join tables.4. **Executor Graph:** Finally, this physical plan is used to generate the actual graph of `Processor` actors that our scheduler will run. Each step in the physical plan becomes one or more workers in our asynchronous assembly line.This whole process ensures that by the time we start executing, we have a cost-optimized, concrete plan ready to go.**A New Plan: Building for the Cloud**The core idea was simple: **a worker should never block waiting for the network.** While it's waiting for S3, it should be able to do other useful work. This is the principle of asynchronous processing.We designed a system in Rust based on a few key concepts:* **Workers as Independent ""Actors"":** Each part of the query plan—a `Filter`, `Join`, `Aggregate`—is an independent worker. Think of it as a specialist on an assembly line with a simple job and its own state.* **A Central ""Scheduler"" as the Factory Manager:** Instead of talking to each other, workers report their status to a central scheduler. A worker can raise its hand and say: * ""I'm ready for data!"" * ""I have a batch of data and I'm ready to do some computation."" * ""I'm about to ask S3 for data, which will take a while. You can check back on me later."" * ""Whoa, I'm getting overwhelmed! My output buffer is full! Tell the upstream workers to pause.""* **Backpressure as the Safety Valve:** That last status is crucial. It's called **backpressure**, and it's the system's safety valve. It prevents the memory bomb. If a `JOIN` worker gets overwhelmed, it tells the scheduler, which then tells the `Scan` worker to stop fetching data from S3 for a moment. This allows the system to self-regulate and remain stable.* **IO Concurrency is Key to Hiding Latency:** Because asking for data is non-blocking, we can ask S3 for hundreds of different data chunks *all at once*. The scheduler then efficiently processes them as they arrive. This allows us to saturate the network connection and hide the latency of any single request, dramatically improving throughput.**How This Scales to Handle Complex SQL**This architecture allows us to scale in two ways:1. **Multi-threading (Scaling Up):** For a single, large query, we can duplicate parts of the query pipeline. For example, we can have multiple `Scan` and `Partial Aggregate` workers running in parallel on different CPU cores, each processing a different part of the data. A final `Merge` step combines their results.2. **Distributed Execution (Scaling Out):** To scale across multiple machines, we treat the network as just another connection between workers. A special `Exchange` worker on one machine can send data to another `Exchange` worker on a different machine. To the rest of the query plan, it's completely transparent. This lets us use the same logic for a single-node query and a 100-node distributed query.**A Few Hard-Won Lessons*** **Stability over raw speed:** Building in robust backpressure from day one was the single most important decision for system stability.* **Separate your concerns:** We run I/O-heavy tasks (like waiting for the network) and CPU-heavy tasks (like decompressing data) on separate thread pools. This ensures that a long computation doesn't stop the engine from handling new data arriving from S3.* **Observability is everything:** When you have thousands of tiny tasks running in parallel, you need great tooling to see what's going on, like query profiles, flamegraphs, and distributed tracing logs to find where the bottlenecks are and why a query is slow.I hope this was a helpful, non-hyped look into what it takes to build a modern, cloud-native query engine. The concepts of asynchronous processing and backpressure are becoming more and more relevant for all kinds of data systems, not just databases.I'm happy to answer any questions about our architecture or the trade-offs we made!

The elements (columns) of the database will vary and increase with time, so I'm thinking a NoSQL engine is best. The data definitely will change, a lot at first, but incrementally afterwards. I anticipate a lot of querying afterwards. Performance is not really an issue, a query could run for 30 minutes and that's okay.Data will be hosted in the cloud. I do not want a solution that is very bespoke, I would prefer a well-established and used DB engine.What database would you recommend?

1n9rpok,Signs you shouldn’t use a streaming framework?,itamarwe,dataengineering,"I hope we can agree that streaming data pipelines (Flink, Spark Streaming) are tougher to build and maintain (DLQ, backfills, out-of-order and late events). Yet we often default to them, even when our data isn’t truly streaming.After seeing how data pipelines are actually built across many organizations, here are 3 signs that tell me streaming might not be the right choice:1. Either the source or the destination isn’t streaming - e.g., reading from a batch-based API or writing only batched aggregations.2. Recent data isn’t more valuable than historical data - e.g., financial data where accuracy matters more than freshness.3. Events arrive out of order (with plenty of late arrivals) - e.g., mobile devices sending cached events once they reconnect.In these cases, a simpler batch-based approach works better for me: fewer moving parts, lower cost, and often just as effective.How do you decide when to use streaming frameworks?",29,0.94,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n9rpok/signs_you_shouldnt_use_a_streaming_framework/,2025-09-06 05:45:26,2025-09-08 01:38:28

1nayp2m,"Got hired as Jr DE, but now running the whole team alone burned out and doubting my path",OkSatisfaction7486,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, sorry if my English isn’t very good.**TL;DR:** I’m a fresh graduate in Actuarial Science. Got a Jr. Data Engineer role, but the Senior DE quit right before I joined now I’m the only DE. Everything is a mess (broken pipelines, legacy code, poor management, no guidance, layoffs). On top of that, they expect huge changes, endless requirements, and bad deadlines, with constant meetings leaving no time to work. I’m learning a lot, but I’m burned out and doubting if I should stay or return to actuarial work.I just graduated in May with a degree in Actuarial Science. And over here it’s common to have an internship while still studying during the semester, so almost everyone graduates with around two years of experience. During my internships, I worked on pension and macroeconomics analysis. Later, I had the opportunity to join a BI team at a fintech. There, I helped improve semantic models, fix dashboards with slow refresh times, and implement better practices. After that, I got another internship offer for the Data Engineering team, which was basically a one person team. I decided to give it a shot, and it turned out to be a good experience: I used Azure for the first time, learned some Scala, Airflow, and PySpark.Fast forward to one month before graduation: an international manufacturer contacted me for a Jr DE position. I doubted if I could fit in, since my technical skills weren’t as strong as CS graduates. After three interviews (one with the Senior DE, where we had an amazing conversation), I got the job offer. I was skeptical, but I accepted it because the Senior DE convinced me it was a great opportunity. I even turned down another offer from an insurance company.To my surprise, during onboarding they told me the Senior DE had just quit the Friday before, leaving me as the only DE. After some thought, I accepted. But I wasn’t ready for what I found:* No documentation* Broken pipelines* Tons of legacy code from outsourcing during the pandemic* Broken dashboards and angry users* A messy data lake with no organization* A passive-aggressive data steward whenever I try to improve workflows* A team using Scrum (my first time) with POs who don’t know what they need* A project manager who flames us whenever something goes wrong* A “data scientist” who is really used as an analytics engineerRight now, I’m doing my best: learning best practices, writing documentation, and even working extra hours. But it feels like I’m always just fixing problems. There’s one dashboard that breaks almost every day, pipelines that constantly need re-runs, and new business rules popping up all the time. On top of that, leadership keeps pushing for “big changes” with impossible deadlines, constant requirements, and back-to-back meetings that leave me with almost no time to actually focus on building things.After a 1:1 with my manager, he admitted the company’s vision changes almost daily. The CTO once told me about the importance of building a data driven mindset, but just three days later, layoffs happened and the CTO himself was gone. Now I have no guidance, I don’t know where we’re heading, and I’m doubting my skills.**What would you do in my position?

1nadpir,"Introducing Minarrow — Apache Arrow implementation for HPC, Native Streaming, and Embedded Systems",peterxsyd,dataengineering,"# Dear Data Engineers,I’ve recently built a production-grade, from-scratch implementation of the ***Apache Arrow*** data standard in **Rust**—shaped to to strike a new balance between ***simplicity***, ***power***, and ***ergonomics***.I’d love to share it with you and get your thoughts, particularly if you:* Work in the *(more hardcore end) of the* **data engineering** space* Us**e Rust for data pipeline**s, or the Arrow data format for systems / engine / embedded work* Build **distributed** or **embedded** software that benefits from Arrow’s memory layout and wire protocols just as much as the columnar analytics it's typically known for.# Why did I build it?***Apache Arrow*** (and `arrow-rs`) are very powerful and have reshaped the data ecosystem through zero-copy memory sharing, lean buffer specs, and a rich interoperability story. When building certain types of high-performance data systems in Rust, though (e.g., distributed data, embedded), I found myself running into friction.# Pain points:* **Engineering Velocity:** The general-purpose design is great for the ecosystem, but I encountered long compile times *(30+ seconds).** **Heavy Abstraction:** Deep trait layers and hierarchies made some otherwise simple tasks more involved—like printing a buffer or quickly seeing types in the IDE.* **Type Landscape:** Many logical Arrow types share the same physical representation. Completeness is important, but in my work I’ve valued a clearer, more consolidated type model. In shaping Minarrow, I leaned on the principle often attributed to Einstein: *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler"".* This ethos has filtered through the conventions used in the library.* **Composability:** I often wanted to “opt up” and down abstraction levels depending on the situation—e.g. from a raw buffer to an Arrow Array—without friction.So I set out to build something tuned for engineering workloads that plugs naturally into everyday Rust use cases without getting in the way. The result is an Arrow-*Compatible* implementation from the ground up.# Introducing: MinarrowArrow minimalism meets Rust polyglot data systems engineering.# Highlights:* Custom `Vec64` allocator: 64-byte aligned, SIMD-compatible. No setup required. Benchmarks indicate alloc parity with standard `Vec`.* Six base types (`IntegerArray`, `FloatArray`, `CategoricalArray`, `StringArray`, `BooleanArray`, `DatetimeArray`), slotting into many modern use cases (HFC, embedded work, streaming ) etc.* Arrow-compatible, with some simplifications: * Logical Arrow types collapsed via generics (e.g. DATE32, DATE64 → `DatetimeArray`). * Dictionary encoding represented as `CategoricalArray`.* Unified, ergonomic accessors: `myarr.num().i64()` with IDE support, no downcasting.* Arrow Schema support, chunked data, zero-copy views, schema metadata included.* Zero dependencies beyond `num-traits` *(and optional Rayon).*# Performance and ergonomics* **1.5s clean build,** <**0.15s rebuilds*** **Very fast runtime** *(See laptop benchmarks in repo)** **Tokio-native IPC:** async IPC Table and Parquet readers/writers via sibling crate *Lightstream** **Zero-copy MMAP r**eader *(\~100m row reads in \~4ms on my consumer laptop)** **Automatic 64-byte alignment** *(avoiding SIMD penalties and runtime checks)** `.to_polars()` and `.to_arrow()` built-in* Rayon parallelism* **Full FFI** via Arrow C Data Interface* **Extensive documentation**# Trade-offs:* **No nested types** *(List, Struct)* or other exotic Arrow types at this stage* **Full connector ecosystem** requires \`.to\_arrow()\` bridge to Apache Arrow *(compile-time cost: 30–60s)* . *Note: IPC and Parquet are directly supported in Lightstream.*# Outcome:* **Fast, lean, and clean** – rapid iteration velocity* **Compatible**: Uses Arrow memory layout and ecosystem-pluggable* **Composable**: use only what’s necessary* **Performance** **without penalty** (compile times! Obviously Arrow itself is an *outstanding ecosystem*).# Where Minarrow fits:* **Ultra-performance data pipelines*** **Embedded system and** **polyglot** **apps*** **SIMD compute*** **Live streaming*** **HPC** and low-latency workloads* MIT Licensed# Open-Source sister-crates:* **Lightstream**: Native streaming with Tokio, for building custom wire formats and minimising memory copies. Includes SIMD-friendly async readers and writers, enabling direct SIMD-accelerated processing from a memory-mapped file.* **Simd-Kernels**: 100+ SIMD and standard kernels for statistical analysis, string processing, and more, with an extensive set of univariate distributions.* You can find these on crates-io or my GitHub.Rust is still developing in the Data Engineering ecosystem, but if your work touches high-performance data pipelines, Arrow interoperability, or low-latency data systems, hopefully this will resonate.Would love your feedback.Thanks,PB **Github**: [https://github.com/pbower/minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow)",15,0.86,7,https://docs.rs/minarrow/latest/minarrow/index.html,2025-09-06 23:12:26,2025-09-08 01:38:28

1nam4eo,Completed a Data Cleaning Pipeline — Work Colleague Wants Validation by Comparing Against Uncleaned Data,competitivebeean,dataengineering,"I just wrapped up building a data cleaning pipeline. For validation, I’ve already checked things like row counts, null values, duplicates, and distributions to make sure the transformations are consistent and nothing important was lost.However, it has to be peer reviewed by a frontend developer who suggested that the “best” validation test is to compare the calculated metrics (like column totals) against the uncleaned/preprocessed dataset. Note that I did suggest a threshold or margin to flag discrepancies but they refused. The sourced data is incorrect to begin with because of inconsistent data values and now thats being used to validate the pipeline.That doesn’t seem right to me, since the whole purpose of cleaning is to fix inconsistencies and remove bad data — so the totals will naturally differ by some margin.Is this a common practice, or is there a better way I can frame the validation I’ve already done to show it’s solid.

1n9vqxt,Lessons learned building a scalable pipeline for multi-source web data extraction & analytics,ransixi,dataengineering,"Hey folks :waving_hand:We’ve been working on a project that involves aggregating **structured + unstructured data** from multiple platforms — think e-commerce marketplaces, real estate listings, and social media content — and turning it into actionable insights.Our biggest challenge was **designing a pipeline that could handle messy, dynamic data sources at scale**. Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):**1. Data ingestion**- Mix of **official APIs**, **custom scrapers**, and **file uploads (Excel/CSV)**.- APIs are great… until rate limits kick in.- Scrapers constantly broke due to DOM changes, so we moved towards a modular crawler architecture.**2. Transformation & storage**- For small data, Pandas was fine; for large-scale, we shifted to a Spark-based ETL flow.- Building a schema that supports both **structured fields** and **text blobs** was trickier than expected.- We store intermediate results to S3, then feed them into a Postgres + Elasticsearch hybrid.**3. Analysis & reporting**- Downstream consumers wanted dashboards and visualizations, so we auto-generate reports from aggregated metrics.- For trend detection, we rely on a mix of TF-IDF, sentiment scoring, and lightweight ML models.Key takeaways:- **Schema evolution** is the silent killer — plan for breaking changes early.- Invest in **pipeline observability** (we use OpenTelemetry) to debug failures faster.- Scaling ETL isn’t about size, it’s about **variance** — the more sources, the messier it gets.Curious if anyone here has tackled **multi-platform ETL** before:- Do you centralize all raw data first, or process at the edge?- How do you manage scraper reliability at scale?- Any tips on schema evolution when source structures are constantly changing?",10,0.82,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n9vqxt/lessons_learned_building_a_scalable_pipeline_for/,2025-09-06 10:01:03,2025-09-08 01:38:28

1n7i1o6,Pokemon VGC Smogon Dashboard - My First Data Eng Project!,Luximus3333333,dataengineering,"Hey all!Just wanted to share my first data engineering project - an online dashboard that extracts monthly vgc meta data from smogon and consolidates it displaying up to the Top 100 pokemon each month (or all time).The dashboard shows the % used for each of the top pokemon, as well as their top item choice, nature, spread, and 4 most used moves. You can also search a pokemon to see the most used build for it. If it is not found in the current months meta report, it will default to the most recent month where it is found (E.g Charizard wasnt in the data set for August, but would show in July).This is my first project where I tried to an create and implement ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) into a useable dashboard for myself and anyone else that is interested. I've also uploaded the project to github if anyone is interested in taking a look. I have set an automation timer to pull the dataset for each month on the 3rd of the month - hoping it works for September!Please take a look and let me know of any feedback, hope this helps some new or experienced VGC players :)[https://vgcpokemonstats.streamlit.app/](https://vgcpokemonstats.streamlit.app/) [https://github.com/luxyoga/vgcpokemonstats](https://github.com/luxyoga/vgcpokemonstats)TL:DR - Data engineering (ETL) project where I scraped monthly datasets from Smogon to create a dashboard for Top Meta Pokemon (up to top 100) each month and their most used items, moveset, abilities, nature etc.https://preview.redd.it/pz6hr8zwxymf1.png?width=2896&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6b5b6ca15f64665fb72dc98acd4d03d665a7b6",3,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n7i1o6/pokemon_vgc_smogon_dashboard_my_first_data_eng/,2025-09-03 15:34:03,2025-09-08 01:38:28

This is basically an e-commerce store from where users can rent DVDs of their favorite movies and tv shows. Think of it like a real-world product that we are developing. \- It will have a frontend \- It will have a backend \- It will have databases \- It will have data warehouses for analytics \- It will have admin dashboard for data visualization \- It will have microservices like ML, Notification services, user behavior tracking Each component of this product will be a project in itself, this will help us in learning and implementing solutions in context of a real world product hence we will be able to understand all the things that are missed while learning new technologies. We will also get an understanding the development journey of any real world project and we will be able to create projects with professionalism.The first component of this project is complete and I want to share this with you all.The most important component of this project is the Data. The data component is divided into 2 parts:- **Content Metadata** and **Transactional Data.** The content data is the metadata of the movies and tv shows which will be rendered on the front end. All the data related to transactions and user navigation will be handled in the Transactional Data part.As content data is going to be document based hence we will be use NoSQL database for this. In our case we are using **MongoDB.** In this part of the project we have created the modules which contain the methods to fetch and load the initial bulk data of movies, tv shows and credits in our MongoDB that will be rendered on the frontend. The modules are reusable, hence using this we will be automating the pipeline. I have attached the workflow image of the project yet.

I’d love your brutal feedback on whether this is useful in your workflows.The approach builds on the Pathway framework (a stream data processing engine with Python wrappers). What we’ve used here are pre-built components already deployed in production by engineering teams.On top of that, we’ve just released the Pathway MCP Server, which makes it simple to expose your live ETL outputs and analytics to client apps and downstream services.Circling back to the example, here’s how you can set this up step by step:* Capture your data streams as Pathway tables (with CDC built in).

I’m guessing some formal education will help solidify the concepts I’ve only kind of pieced together on my own.That said, since it’s impossible to know *all* of CS before starting a project, do you ever feel like you end up abstracting concepts the wrong way because you don’t have the formal background yet? I usually just read articles and keep Googling until I get a working understanding of what I need, but sometimes I worry that I’m learning things “wrong.”",23,0.87,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1n6dzmw/worried_im_learning_programming_the_wrong_way/,2025-09-02 08:28:46,2025-09-08 01:38:29
1n72k6y,Feeling overwhelmed getting back into programming,Kozuki_10,learnprogramming,"I wanted to share this here in case anyone has tips or advice on how to get back into programming. A bit of background: Back in 2020 I enrolled in a 2-year online university program for web development. We started from the basics like logic, algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode and then moved on to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and React. On the side, I also learned a bit of Python, mostly basic backend and some data analysis but nothing past tutorials. In 2022 I stopped coding for several reasons mainly due to family issues and low self-esteem. I even fumbled a trial opportunity at a company because I couldn’t finish the final project, I felt like I wasn't good enough to do a good job compared to the other ppl in the program; so I just dropped programming altogether and didn't really touch it for years. Now in 2025 I feel like I’m in a better mental state than a few years ago, but I feel kinda lost on where to start, specially with AI advancing so quickly, I sometimes doubt whether I'll be able to get a job out of it. On top of that, I don’t know where to start since I’ve forgotten so much. Should I go back to basics, or jump straight into a project and learn as I go checking documentation? I'm also afraid I will rely on AI too much and not learn much at all.",21,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1n72k6y/feeling_overwhelmed_getting_back_into_programming/,2025-09-03 02:06:42,2025-09-08 01:38:29

And that worries me",DVerdux20,learnprogramming,"This is kind of a complex one, so context: I'm in my 13th semester in software engineering, about to graduate if everything goes well. I thought I always was good at this, but since last semester, I feel everyone around me talk about things I don't understand, yet my classmates act like I should understand them now. The protect for that semester was to build an online app of our choosing in teams of 5. At the start with the theory and project planning, I was really contributing to the work, but the instant we had to actually start coding, I became nearly useless. They wanted to mount a git repository, which they shared to me so we all had it locally with our own branches. But I straight up told them I had never done that and ask for help. They just told me to check the readme.I spent almost 2 weeks trying to follow the instructions, but it was useless, and at that point, my teammates didn't even understand what I was struggling with. I had to ask the teacher directly for help, and he had to guide me step by step to actually set it up.With that guidance, I noticed the amount of things I missed. I didn't have it clear what a repository even was (and I still don't tbh), I thought things like node.js and java script were programs that I had to install, I never used cli in my life, dependencies still confuse me, I have never use docker, and many, many more. My experience programming was reduced to using Eclipse IDE and occasionally Visual Studio Community. Everything else that my classmates were talking about and using were completely alien to me. I talked with some classmates at the time that weren't my teammates, and all their advice and instructions were falling deaf to me. To the point that one of them straight up asked me: ""What the hell are you even doing here, and how the fuck did you even get this far?""They even asked me what does anybody need to program in java, and I said confidently ""Eclipse IDE"". Their faces were filled with both worry and contained laughter. All this time, the only things that I worked with were theory, and coding the instructions in a java file. I don't seem to have learned anything else that I should've by now. There's such a gap where I can't ask for help in ways they understand, and they can't comprehend what could I be having troubles with. I'm doing my residencies now, continuing the work on a project with a teacher as my guide that apparently thinks I can do a good job, and I feel I'm hitting the same roadblock.

It actually released about 2 years ago, but I've been adding new content to it, and due to feature creep and edge cases being added continuously that were not planned for at the start of the project, it's led to a huge amount of band-aids, hard-coding, god classes, tightly coupled dependencies, and code split between classes that may have originally had a single, clear responsibility, but have become Frankenstein monsters over time.I've cleaned up tiny pieces of code here and there, but I'm at a point where changes are becoming absurdly difficult to implement. I'm wondering if there are any free tools that would be able to help me refactor my codebase.Some of the features that come to mind as things that would be helpful (which I'm hoping extensions for Visual Studio exist for):* Being able to move a method or variable from one class to another, automatically updating all references. * Additionally, tools that identify tendencies of certain classes to reference each other and make recommendations based on that to address tight coupling.* A tool that makes it easy to compare several classes and their methods at once, perhaps with a way to color code them based on what other classes they reference and to categorize them (such as ""this method is in the right place,"" ""this method might be in a bad place,"" ""these functions do similar things but are spread across different classes instead of being in a single dedicated class."")* Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thing (I'm aware this has extremely high potential for causing more issues and is almost certainly something that cannot be solved automatically.)",6,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1n7tqwg/refactoring_a_large_solo_project/,2025-09-03 22:58:23,2025-09-08 01:38:29

I studied basic Data Structures and Algos in the 9th grade back in school in India in Java. I had a lot of visual learning because we had a really good teacher who animated algorithms, and explained it really well. I understood the basics so well back then, and I was able to write a lot of basic code and felt like I had a lot of interest toward the subject.

The only thing I really kept up with was math. Right after I graduated, I felt shitty about just barely passing what I thought I had interest in. I moved to the US, and enrolled in a UX UI Bootcamp at UC Berkeley and liked what I studied. Learnt some front end development and got a job at a startup, just to get laid off a few months later. After that, I really fell off the bandwagon and never studied. I feel rusty. It's been 2 years since I got laid off, but I am gaining an interest again to learn.

1n6ygyc,Starting my third year next month as a Software Engineering Student.. advice?,thelilecho,learnprogramming,"Hey all, I am a second year student right now, and my next semester is coming up quick. The closer it gets the more worried I get about where I should be at the moment. I feel as though I may be behind others or that I don’t put enough work in. I love technology and knew this is what I wanted from a very young age but I think it is the time management that gets me. I spend about 6-8 hours at work 5 days a week, and then do schoolwork for about 2/3-5 hours a day. I also try to balance having a social life because as of last year I barely went out with friends or even had any. I keep wondering if that is just a sacrifice I need to make in order to have more time to learn code and other skills for my degree. to give more information: As of right now, I am taking DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms). Other classes I have taken that retain to my degree so far are: - Front-End Web Development- Network and Security foundations- Scripting and Programming foundations- Intro to Python- Version Control- IT leadership foundations - Web development foundations I have remade a resume that has my updated skills and classes, but when it comes to a portfolio and projects, should I already have multiple? What is the normal amount of experience and skills that I need in order to land an internship. What all do I need to have learned or do I need to put in the extra work to learn more. I see posts saying acronyms and terms that I have yet to learn and feel like there is gaps when it comes to me attempting a software project. Should I put more time aside in order to catch up? I know people say the more serious you are the more work you’ll put in so how far do I need to take that in this situation? And just to add, I do not care to put whatever time aside that I need to, in order to be successful. I’m just having a hard time seeing exactly how much time I do need to be devoting to this and if it is a necessary thing to do, or if more skills and knowledge will come to me as the school years go on.",4,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1n6ygyc/starting_my_third_year_next_month_as_a_software/,2025-09-02 23:02:00,2025-09-08 01:38:29

1n8il9w,How come no one is talking seriously about replacing management with AI?,throwaway09234023322,cscareerquestions,"Every time I see people mention it, it always seems like a joke. However, when you think about it, it makes more sense than replacing ICs. Think about it, why do we have so many layers of management in an organization? It's because one person realistically can't keep track of so many people reporting information to them, so instead they have managers report to them all the way up the chain...This is where AI comes in. Instead of ICs reporting to managers, they just all report to the AI. Hell, the AI doesn't even need to be reported to because it already knows what everyone has been doing due to monitoring everyone's computers. All the CEO or board of directors needs to do is ask for updates from the AI. They can get very detailed information or high level overviews. No more time wasted on useless 1 on 1s, you just ask the AI how you could do better or the AI will automatically give you feedback or put you on PIP if needed based on a standard set of criteria, so no bias.That solves one problem that is faced by large organizations, but how about another one? Think about all the time spent in meetings between managers to only come up with stupid decisions because normally the loudest voice will just win out and it isn't always the smartest. Instead, the AI can interact directly with the SMEs to assess all the information available and make the most informed decisions. Think of the time savings!In conclusion, I think we are headed for a time where mid management will no longer exist.

1n8zdbs,I made a terrible mistake,ragesex,cscareerquestions,"I left my old job a few weeks ago because I was frustrated with the lack of growth and the salary not even keeping up with inflation. I jumped into what looked like a safer and more stable position. The onboarding was smooth and everyone was friendly but then reality hit me on day one.The department I joined is basically one guy and now me. The entire workflow is a storm of spreadsheets and manual emails. I realized almost immediately that the whole thing could be automated with a few scripts and dashboards. What currently takes a week could be done in a couple of hours. Which means the existence of the department itself is hanging by a thread.Here is the catch. To actually automate I would need direct access to the system and that access has to go through my boss. Doing it on my own is impossible without going through him, and going through him means making myself a direct threat to his role and survival.On top of that, in just two days of onboarding I was already dumped with actual work, despite only having the most superficial understanding of their processes and tools. The approach was basically “just figure it out.” There is no documentation at all, and to make it worse the processes themselves are arbitrary. One client gets handled one way, another client gets handled completely differently, with no clear rules or references for why things change. It feels random, improvised, and fragile.To make things worse the company has its own AI and digital transformation division. If they ever notice what is really going on, they could easily absorb or eliminate this function. Which leaves me in a place where my job is both fragile and painfully boring.Now I feel stuck. If I leave too soon my résumé will show a disastrous short stay and I will look unreliable. If I stay I risk wasting my time in something that feels pointless and might get axed anyway. Right now my plan is to keep my head down for a while and later reframe the story as “I improved and automated processes and then decided to move toward project or team management because there was no further path in that role.”I know a lot of people here have been through bad career moves.

I was just given my first big project and am working with another mid-level engineer who has been here for about 2 years. We are both working under a PE who is leading the project. We have distributed the work and at the start I was wrapping up some bug fixes that my manager asked me to complete. The other mid-level im working with is a really nice guy and he is really motivated which I like. The problem is he is almost too motivated to the point that he has just started coding like crazy and in the first week did some of the work on my plate. I've seen him push code on the weekends at like midnight. One time I asked him if he works onthe weekends and he says sometimes he's bored at home and watches tv and code. I politely let him know that we should work together and I dont want him to feel like he did everything. So he backed off some of my stuff a bit. But throughout the project, it seems he is going 150% towards any little changes that need to be added. If we need to add a change, he has just added it. Since he has been here for 2 years, he knows which people to go to outside of us 3 for questions and a few times I heard he had a few meetings with people to discuss things, so i asked him to keep me included as well and to give me any resources of people in case I had questions. He has done better of doing that but a few times forgot to send me some useful stuff. I was gone for a couple days and in those days he made some major changes. Again I think it's great, but now it feels like the whole code is practically his (maybe 70% of it) and the PE has noticed and even in meetings will talk more to him and say (let's call my co-worker mike for the example) ""Mike can you write a note and make that change"". Barely has directed me. I feel like I have to step in and say ""ill make this change"" or make it clear that ill do the change. I feel like anything I have discovered ill reach out to him and let him know but I can tell that when it comes to visibility it looks like he's doing 90%. He has done more but I think it's more like 60%-70%. I dont think Mike really is doing this to be spiteful or anything I just think he's one of those people who is just really motivated and just starts and doesnt stop. Again, i think that's great and it definetely has kept me in my feet but I also feel like im getting pushed out. I should say that I got laid off from my last job before I got this job and i think a reason for it was because I was slightly a more passive engineer and I feel like this could be held against me that Mike did 70% of the work and it may look like I was lazy on this project.

He said the work is good and the company pays well, and I really liked working with him so I decided to apply because I'd like to work with him again and I've been looking for something with better pay anyway.I started the process with a interview with HR, than interview with the director of the company in my country, then technical interview with one of the people in the team, another interview with one of the main managers but now from the US. A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer. I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a ""welcome to team"" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. I waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were ""waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer"", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes ""Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you"". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying ""hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?"". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). So... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a ""misstep"" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. Now... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like ""oh actually, forget that"" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already...

I’m about 10 years into my engineering career; self-taught and came into Disney as a senior mobile engineer, then left after five years to join a big tech. I came into big tech at a pretty high level role for an IC, which sometimes gets into my head that I have imposter syndrome.Any job I’ve ever had in tech, I’ve been a high performer. I got promoted at Disney after three months, highly unlikely because I’m any more skilled than anyone else (I’m definitely not), but probably I spent a weekend on a high-impact side project that was fun and had cross-functional impact, and I’m a good communicator. I sort of coasted there, but big tech has been a gut punch.I’m 6 months into my role at big tech and was rated as an underperformer. Given that I came in at a high level, I have no doubt the expectations were high, but I think I’m doing my best. I say yes to a lot (often a curse), take on whatever is asked of me, and try to push through learning complex systems and very frequent uncertainty of what I should be doing every day. I work with smart and very helpful people, but when I hit a technical glitch (often), rarely does anyone on my team have any solution that works, and I end up spending time finding more resources or trying to self-solve until I get it.This is the first time I’ve ever been anything but a star performer. I think I’m letting work for such a prestigious company get to me, but I also think I’m trusting colleagues to tell me where to focus each day and not delivering quickly at all because the systems are complex, ridden with issues, and while people try to help me, I don’t genuinely feel like I’m getting a lot of help or even know what questions to ask until I hit a problem.Has anyone else ever dealt with this?

1n991uc,2.5 years employed with 3 months of agile related experience. What can I really say?,Ok_Practice_6702,cscareerquestions,"Many of the questions are very complex and detailed at interviews because they think my dates of employment consist of experience, when mostly we were just building our own projects and watching Udemy courses as all the new projects that were supposed to be coming were ones where the client backed out, or went with another firm because we didn't have anyone with 8 years experience on staff. Me and several others got on projects that lasted 2-4 weeks because our managers mislead our clients into thinking we were senior level and we told them we weren't when we started working and weren't as efficient as they expected us to be. So, there are questions like explain how you used JIRA to collaborate and work more effectively as a team or a time where you used Spring Boot to increase productivity and enhance a service. I've used both those tools, but coming up with such details of how I improved a legacy system with spring boot or more than just describing how JIRA works, I don't really have anything else to say. It's just that I've been mostly working on coding skills and creating some services with the limitations of what I can do in a short time as only one person, and I can't give them the answers they want. Am I supposed to lie and repeat other people's answers I find on the internet or is there a way to actually get this level of agile experience without working on an agile team first for long enough. One of those projects over the 3 months was a 2 month project where most of the time we were not doing anything because the client poorly planned the teams and 7 of us on a team that really only needed about 2 people with only a few services and very few bugs coming through on them. Are there any teams that are actually designing something new or re-creating services requiring actual coding skills instead of just fixing minor bugs that take about 5 minutes or migrating from something like Maven to Gradle?

Creating boring tasks every day is simply exhausting for me. I do not change jobs because in almost every software house you do the same thing, and I also don’t want to go through 10 steps of recruitment.I would gladly work on something innovative, even for less money. The problem is that such positions are only for people with 15+ years of experience, even if the work does not really require it. Either those people were smarter at convincing recruiters, or because of huge competition companies can now hire very experienced developers for the same salary as mid-level ones.I think I would probably fit well in a startup. I could even work 16 hours a day, but I would expect an interesting project and a fair salary.If not innovative projects, then at least some competition for monopolies (like Adobe, or browsers based on engines other than Chromium or Firefox). But it is also very hard to get into such projects.It looks like if I do not find a job for similar money (basically scraps, but still a bit more than McDonald’s and with home office), in another industry, then I will not have a happy career as a developer, even if I have enough skills.Of course, I could try to create my own product and become a founder. But then you need money for marketing — because even if the software is open source, without promotion nobody will hear about it, and there will be no money. This means hunger, and then going back to software houses to build CRUDs again.And this is exactly how I feel: like a chained dog that never goes for a walk, only sits tied up and howls at night.

The answer I got is ""do some (more) research"" LOL.I'm an intern, on week 2 - this week - today, I was given this absolutely questionable codebase, the BE server returns from boolean to string to array to json value, you never know what value type it will return and it's a nightmare to navigate because there is no documentation, there is nothing, the only way you gonna know is to print the result out. There is a log system, EVERYTHING is log in ONE PLACE, the tiniest thing is also logged, 1 request = a massive file containing every single log possible.Furthermore, each request goes through 2 BE, 1 is the BE server and the other is a low-code platform server BE, and ts suck nuts, because this low-code platform has a request limit and the server is running on an unstable docker image so when either of these thing crashes, you don't know which thing crashed because the person who coded this before me thought it was a good idea to return EVERY SINGLE ERRORS MESSAGE AS ONE and there is no try-catch block.Oh yeah, btw, I'm just an intern but I control the entire live production server of this project, this project doesn't have a development environment, I was tasked to research the dev environment + on top of maintaining abomination codebase + on top of developing new feature, I can literally use \`rm -rf\` this entire server.So, today I was asked to fix a core function of the BE server, this BE server was created solely for this function. I was able to mitigate it by creating more sessions but this approach was rejected because all sessions have been approved by the client superiors and there is no way to change it and I CAN'T CHANGE THE FUNCTION to fix this because the function is ""working correctly"" based on the customer requirements by my lead, mind you guys although I am alone on this project, I do not received any documentations not even the customer/client requirements.Oh and this job is below minimum wage in my country, I made triple being at mcdonald After the synopsis, I have a few questions or I need advices:1.

I started doing this when she would nitpick my pull requests endlesslyFor example, I had a storybook instance where I was displaying all the components. She would constantly tell me to change stories, add stories, change how storybook works, etc. Her comments were vague, like ""make it match design"". Neither me nor the lead designer could tell what she was talking about. When confronted about how it ""doesn't match design"", she'd kinda react like ""I'm not telling :face_with_hand_over_mouth:"", so I guess I concluded that she was just wasting my time on purposeSo, I posted in the public channel, which then caused her to come into the thread and act very inappropriately. So much so, I got texts from people (privately) who work there like ""wow what did you do to piss her off???"". At the end, she said to get into a huddle with her, but my skip joined before me. I got in and my skip basically said ""dw we got it figured out"" and I looked at my PR and it was approvedFor a while, she backed off. However, recently I was given a big task to replace every button component across every app with the one from the component library (the project I mentioned before). I did all this, then she left a comment how she didn't like how the button worked. She left no details. She blocked the review and basically said ""button is awkward, go back to the drawing board"". I felt this was solely done to delay me. The button was literally just applying styles to a library (@headlessui/react)I went back and found the PR where I implemented the one decision she complained about. Not only was it documented in the PR itself, but it had unit tests, comments, and live documentation detailing how it works. It was merged two weeks ago, and she approved it. At this point, I noticed even my coworkers were coming to my defense and calling her unreasonable in the PRI sent this to my skip and mentioned that I really think I'm being set up for failure here. I showed this PR, but also showed that every PR I submitted was nitpicked endlessly by her while approved by others much quicker. I also showed that she seemed to *only* do this with me, as she approved other team mates PRs quicklyAt this point I'm really lost as to what to do. There is no HR department at my company. There's no team I can transfer to. I'm considering asking my skip to do *anything* to just get me off of her team even if it means becoming a backend engineer at this point.

During my Bachelor's, I had learned Java and OOPS concepts through self-instruction and online resources. After that, I have 6 years of experience in an IT Consulting firm - my job title said ""Consultant."" I mostly worked on application support in production (incident management and bug fixes) for client projects, primarily on the backend which for the most part, involved a Java-based low code integration development platform and Oracle DB/SQL on the database side. Occasionally, I would use Core Java as and when needed. I also got familiar with version control and CICD concepts.While working on this job, I had been parallelly doing a lot of self learning on fundamental CS topics like Data Structures, Algorithm design and analysis. I eventually left to pursue a Master's in Computer Science from where I recently graduated. I have been practicing Leetcode and System Design. My goal is to get an SWE job.**My question: Does my earlier 6 years of experience in application support count as relevant experience for SWE roles?

1n7ld7l,I no longer know what job title I best fit and would love some help.,Choice_Supermarket_4,cscareerquestions,"I've had a very eclectic, non-traditional career path, but now I'm at the point where I no longer know how to market myself. I've been interested in and learning how to write code since I was a teenager (currently in my mid thirties.) I've always done little dumb projects for myself, especially after reading Automate the Boring Stuff a while back. I've picked up a lot of skills in a variety of tech adjacent things along the way: python (django and flask too), javascript, react, typescript, postgres, nosql, a ton of different AWS services (and less experience but still some with both GCP and Azure), cybersecurity, devops, and more.I'm currently doing freelance full stack development in Typescript and Python, building an MVP of a web app for a client. I've been doing freelance dev work since being laid off last year, and off and on for the last decade. I like the freedom, but I'd really prefer to work at an early stage startup again (as long as their funded properly), but I don't know how to properly communicate all of my different skills. When I apply to jobs, I almost never hear back from places when I play for engineering roles, and I think it's due to not having many actual software engineer titles. Usually, If I'm applying to jobs and not hearing back, I fall back to applying to customer service roles. One of my managers will eventually realize I've got a ton of technical skills (usually because I'll build some tool or automate something), and I'll get promoted, but not usually to a dedicated tech team (with the exception of my last role, going to the data engineering team.) As an example, at my last job, I started as a technical support analyst and within a month has been given access to their github, prod db, and AWS (early stage startup that wasn't handling edge cases in customer order data, but also wasn't fixing it, so I did.) That snowballed to me building a bunch of internal tools for the customer service team that were previously only able to be handled by the backend engineers, and eventually becoming a data engineer. At another job, I was hired as a customer service rep and saw how tedious a monthly compliance report was to create, so I built an ETL pipeline in python (without knowing it at the time) that turned a 3 day ordeal into a 20 minute gut check. I'm great at root cause analysis, designing a fix, and implementing it (with consent from the appropriate teams). I've never come across a topic/skill that I can't quickly learn, but also have no issue asking questions on things I'm confused about. I'm good at seeing gaps that aren't being addressed that directly effect the QoL of individual workers and love helping make my co-workers lives easier. I also have severe ADHD, which hasn't been great for interviews. I've only ever had one live coding interview go well, the rest I start to make increasingly dumb mistakes and then go totally blank. I excel at take home tests, but even when I move along in the interviews on those, I end up losing out to someone with a more traditional background. Does anyone have any ideas on how I should market myself to stand out?",4,0.71,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n7ld7l/i_no_longer_know_what_job_title_i_best_fit_and/,2025-09-03 17:35:12,2025-09-08 01:38:30
