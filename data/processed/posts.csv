1of3kqp,Modern SQL engines draw fractals faster than Python?!?,Psychological-Motor6,dataengineering,"Just out of curiosity, I setup a simple benchmark that calculates a Mandelbrot fractal in plain SQL using DataFusion and DuckDB – no loops, no UDFs, no procedural code. I honestly expected it to crawl.

1ok4yug,Can we ban corporate “blog” posts and self promotion links,Firm_Bit,dataengineering,Every other submission is an ad disguised as a blog post or a self promotion post disguised as a question.

1ofi6l7,How you deal with a lazy colleague,ButterscotchIcy359,dataengineering,"I’m dealing with a colleague who’s honestly becoming a pain to work with. He’s in his mid-career as a data engineer, and he acts like he knows everything already. The problem is, he’s incredibly lazy when it comes to actually doing the work.He avoids writing code whenever he can, only picks the easy or low-effort tasks, and leaves the more complex or critical problems for others to handle. When it comes to operational stuff — like closing tickets, doing optimization work, or cleaning up pipelines — he either delays it forever or does it half-heartedly.What’s frustrating is that he talks like he’s the most experienced guy on the team, but his output and initiative don’t reflect that at all. The rest of us end up picking up the slack, and it’s starting to affect team morale and delivery.Has anyone else dealt with a “know-it-all but lazy” type like this?

1ogirla,Rant: Managing expectations,Agreeable_Bake_783,dataengineering,"Hey,I have to rant a bit, since i've seen way too much posts in this reddit who are all like ""What certifications should i do?"" or ""what tools should i learn?"" or something about personal big data projects. What annoys me are not the posts themselves, but the culture and the companies making believe that all this is necessary. So i feel like people need to manage their expectations. In themselves and in the companies they work for. The following are OPINIONS of mine that help me to check in with myself.1. You are not the company and the company is not you. If they want you to use a new tool, they need to provide PAID time for you to learn the tool.2. Don't do personal projects (unless you REALLY enjoy it). It just takes time you could have spend doing literally anything else. Personal projects will not prepare you for the real thing because the data isn't as messy, the business is not as annoying and you want have to deal with coworkers breaking production pipelines. 3. Nobody cares about certifications. If I have to do a certification, I want to be paid for it and not pay for it.4. Life over work. Always.5. Don't beat yourself up, if you don't know something. It's fine. Try it out and fail. Try again. (During work hours of course)Don't get me wrong, i read stuff in my offtime as well and i am in this reddit. But i only as long I enjoy it.

These are roles that were once US-based, and are now being reallocated to low cost regions.My company's CEO has even quietly set a target of having a minimum of 35% of the jobs in each department located in a low-cost region of the world, and is aggressively pushing to move more and more positions to low cost regions through layoffs, restructuring, and natural turnover/attrition. I've heard from several peers that their companies seem to be quietly reallocating many of their positions, as well, and it's leaving me uncertain about the future of this industry in a high-cost region like North America.The macro-economic research does still seem to suggest that technical data roles (like a DE or analytics engineer) are still stable and projected to stay in-demand in North America, but ""from the ground"" I'm only seeing reallocations to low-cost regions en mass.Curious if anybody else is noticing this at their company, in their networks, on their feeds, etc.?I'm considering the long term feasibility of staying in this profession as executives, boards, and PE owners just get greedier and greedier, so just wanting to see what others are observing in the market.Edit: removed my quick off the cuff list of low cost countries because debating the definition and criteria for “low cost” wasn’t really the point lol",60,0.88,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oieor6/are_de_jobs_moving/,2025-10-28 16:50:57,2025-10-31 01:39:13

I deployed a local Git server, maintain and own the DB instance that hosts our DWH, re-implemented and redesigned Python dashboards because the old implementation was slow and useless, deployed some infrastructure for data engineering workloads, developed cli frameworks to cut-off manual work and code redundancy, and harmonized inconsistent sources to produce accurate insights (they used to just dump Excel files and DB tables into SSIS, which generated wrong numbers) all locally.Last Thursday, we got a request with a deadline on Sunday, even though Friday and Saturday are our weekend (I’m in Egypt, and my team is currently working from home to deliver it, for free).At first, I didn’t mind because I wanted to deliver and learn, but now I’m getting frustrated. I barely have time to rest, let alone learn new things that could actually help me grow (technically or financially).Unpaid overtime is normalized here, and changing companies locally won’t fix that. So I’ve started thinking about moving to Europe, but I’m not sure I’m ready for such a competitive market since everything we do is on-prem and I’ve never touched cloud platforms.Another issue: I feel like the only technical person in the office. When I talk about software design, abstraction, or maintainability, nobody really gets it. They just think I’m “going fancy,” which leaves me on-call. One time, I recommended loading all our sources into a 3rd normal form schema as a single source of truth, because the same piece of information was scattered across multiple systems and needed tracking, enforcement, and auditing before hitting our Kimball DWH. They looked at me like I was a nerd trying to create extra work.I’m honestly feeling trapped.Should I keep grinding, or start planning my exit to a better environment (like Europe or remote)?Any advice from people who’ve been through this?Edit:The management decided to compensate us with additional annual leave, and I found out that our senior engineer has been negotiating with management for a salary raise for the entire department after these rough days.

1oj1itv,How to convince a switch from SSIS to python Airflow?,GehDichWaschen,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,TLDR: The team prefers SSIS over Airflow, I want to convince them to accept the switch as a long term goal.I am a Senior Data Engineer and I started at an SME earlier this year.Previously I used a lot of Cloud Services, like AWS BatchJob for the ETL of an Kubernetes application, EC2 with airflow in docker-compose, developed API endpoints for a frontend Application using sqlalchemy at a big company, worked TDD in Scrum etc.Here, I found the current setup of the ETL pipeline to be a massive library of SSIS Packages basically getting data from an on prem ERP to a Reporting Model.There are no tests, there are many small-small hacky ways inside SSIS to get what you want out of the data. The is no style guide or Review Process. In general it's lacking the usual oversight you would have in a \*\*searchable\*\* code project as well as the capability to run tests on the system and databases. git is not really used at all. Documentation is hardly maintainedEverything is being worked on in the Visual Studio UI, which is buggy at best and simply crashing at worst (around twice per day).I work in a 2-person team and our Job it is to manage the SSIS ETL, Tabular Model and all PowerBI Reports throughout the company. The two of us are the entire reporting team.I replaced a long-time employee that has been in the company for around 15 years and didn't know any code and left minimal documentation. Generally my colleague (data scientist) does documentation only in his personal notebook which he shares sporadically on request.Since my start I introduced JIRA for our processes with a clear task board (it was a mess before) and bi-weekly sprints. Also a Wiki which I filled with hundreds of pages by now. I am currently introducing another tool, so at least we don't have to use buggy VS to manage the tabular model and can use git there as well.I am transforming all our PBI reports into .pbip files, so we can work with git there, too (We have like 100 reports).Also, I built an entire prod Airflow Environment on an on-prem Windows server to be able to query APIs (not possible in SSIS) and run some basic statistical analysis (""AI-capabilities""). The Airflow repo is fully tested, has Exception Handling, feature and hotfix branches, dev, prod etc. and can be used locally as well as on remote.But I am the only one currently maintaining it. My colleague does not want to change to Airflow, because ""the other one is working"". Fact is, I am losing a lot of time managing SSIS in VS while getting a lower quality system.Plus, if we ever want to hire an additional colleague, he will probably face the same issues as I do (no docs, massive monolith, no search function, etc.) and will probably not get a good hire.My boss is non-technical, so he is not of much help. We are also not in IT, so every time the SQL Server bugs, we need to run to the IT department to fix our ETL Job, which can take days.So, how can I convince my colleague to eventually switch to Airflow?It doesn't need to be today, but I want this to be a committed long term goal.Writing this, I feel I have committed so much to this company already and would really like to give them a chance (preference of industry and location)Thank you all for reading, maybe you have some insight how to handle this.

1ohga81,Migrating to DBT,Glittering_Beat_1121,dataengineering,"Hi!As part of a client I’m working with, I was planning to migrate quite an old data platform to what many would consider a modern data stack (dagster/airlfow + DBT + data lakehouse). Their current data estate is quite outdated (e.g. single step function manually triggered, 40+ state machines running lambda scripts to manipulate data. Also they’re on Redshit and connect to Qlik for BI. I don’t think they’re willing to change those two), and as I just recently joined, they’re asking me to modernise it. The modern data stack mentioned above is what I believe would work best and also what I’m most comfortable with. Now the question is, as DBT has been acquired by Fivetran a few weeks ago, how would you tackle the migration to a completely new modern data stack? Would DBT still be your choice even if not as “open” as it was before and the uncertainty around maintenance of dbt-core? Or would you go with something else? I’m not aware of any other tool like DBT that does such a good job in transformation.Am I unnecessarily worrying and should I still go with proposing DBT?

I always wanted to work in a data engineering project and recently i got an opportunity to work on a project which seem to be exciting with GenAI & Python stuff. My role here is to develop python scripts to integrate multiple sources and LLM outputs and package everything into a solution. I designed a config driven ETL code using python and wrote multiple classes to package everything into a single codebase. I used LLM chats to optimise my code. Due to very tight deadlines I had to rush the development without realising the whole thing would turn into a nightmare. I have tried my best to follow the coding standards but the client is very upset about few parts of the design. A couple of days ago, I had a code review meeting with my client team where I had to walk through my code and answer questions inorder to get the approval for QA. The client team had an architect level manager who had already gone through the repository and had a lot of valid questions about the design flaws in the code. I felt very embarrassed during the meeting and it was a very awkward conversation. Everytime he had pointed out something wrong, I had no answers to it and there was silence for about half a minute before I say "" Ok I can implement that"". I know it is my fault that I didn't have enough knowledge about designing data systems but I'm worried more about tarnishing my companies' reputation by providing a low quality deliverable.

1of9pi5,Implementing data contracts as code,Nightwyrm,dataengineering,"As part of a wider move towards data products as well as building better controls into our pipelines, we’re looking at how we can implement data contracts as code. I’ve done a number of proof of concepts across various options and currently the Open Data Contract Specification alongside datacontract-cli is looking good. However, while I see how it can work well with “frozen” contracts, I start getting lost on how to allow schema evolution. Our typical scenarios for Python-based data ingestion pipelines are all batch-based, consisting of files being pushed to us or our pulling from database tables. Our ingestion pattern is to take the producer dataset, write it to parquet for performant operations, and then validate it with schema and quality checks. The write to parquet (with PyArrow’s ParquetWriter) should include the contract schema to enforce the agreed or known datatypes. However, with dynamic schema evolution, you ideally need to capture the schema of the dataset to be able to compare it to your current contract state to alert for breaking changes etc. Contract-first formats like ODCS take a bit of work to define, plus you may have zero-padded numbers defined as varchar in the source data you want to preserve, so inferring that schema for comparison becomes challenging. I’ve gone down quite a rabbit hole now and am likely overcooking it, but my current thinking is to write all dataset fields to parquet as string, validate the data formats are as expected, and then subsequent pipeline steps can be more flexible with inferred schemas.

1oglc5s,DE Gatekeeping and Training,lilde1297,dataengineering,"Background: the enterprise DE in my org manages the big data environment. He uses nifi for orchestration and snowflake for the data warehouse. As far as how his environment is actually put together and communicating all I know is that he uses zookeeper for his nifi cluster and it’s on the cloud (Azure). There is no one who knows anything more than that. No one in IT. Not his boss. Not his one employee. No one knows and his reason is that he doesn’t trust anyone and they aren’t good enough, not even his employee.The discussion. Have you dealt with such a person? How has your org dealt with people gatekeeping like this? From my perspective this is a massive problem and basically means that this guy is a massive walking pile of technical debt. If he leaves then the clean up and troubleshooting to figure out what he did would be immense. On top of that he now has suggested taking over smaller DE processes from other outside IT as a play to “centralize” data engineering work. He won’t let them migrate their stuff to his environment as again he doesn’t rust them to be good enough and doesn’t want to teach them how to use his environment. So he is just safe guarding his job really and taking away others jobs in my opinion. I also recently got some people in IT to approve me setting up Airflow outside of IT and to do data engineering (which I was already doing but just with cron). He has thrown some shots at me but I ignored him because I’m trying to set something up for other people to use to and document it so that it can be maintained should I leave.TLDR have you dealt with people gatekeeping knowledge and what happened to them?",7,0.89,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oglc5s/de_gatekeeping_and_training/,2025-10-26 14:00:01,2025-10-31 01:39:13

1ok4d97,How to build a standalone ETL app for non-technical users?,FinnTropy,dataengineering,"I'm trying to build a standalone CRM app that retrieves JSON data (subscribers, emails, DMs, chats, products, sales, events, etc.) from multiple REST API endpoints, normalizes the data, and loads it into a DuckDB database file on the user's computer. Then, the user could ask natural language questions about the CRM data using the Claude AI desktop app or a similar tool, via a connection to the DuckDB MCP server. These REST APIs require the user to be connected (using a session cookie or, in some cases, an API token) to the service and make potentially 1,000 to 100,000 API calls to retrieve all the necessary details. To keep the data current, an automated scheduler is necessary. * I've built a Go program that performs the complete ETL and tested it, packaging it as a macOS application; however, maintaining database changes manually is complicated. I've reviewed various Go ORM packages that could add significant complexity to this project. * I've built a Python DLT library-based ETL script that does a better job normalizing the JSON objects into database tables, but I haven't found a way to package it yet into a standalone macOS app. * I've built several Chrome extensions that can extract data and save it as CSV or JSON files, but I haven't figured out how to write DuckDB files directly from Chrome. Ideally, the standalone app would be just a ""drag to Applications folder, click to open, and leave running,"" but there are so many onboarding steps to ensure correct configuration, MCP server setup, Claude MCP config setup, etc., that non-technical users will get confused after step #5.

1oif45q,Migrating from Spreadsheets to PostgreSQL,oihv,dataengineering,"Hello everyone, I'm doing a part time as a customer service for an online class. I basically manage the students, their related informations, sessions bought, etc. Also relates it to the class that they are enrolled in. At the moment, all this information is stored in a monolithic sheets (well I did divide atleast the student data and the class, connect them by id).But, I'm a CS student, and I just studied dbms last semester, this whole premise sounds like a perfect case to implement what I learn and design a relational database!So, I'm here to crosscheck my plan. I plan this with gpt.. btw, because I can't afford to spend too much time working on this side project, and I'm not going to be paid for this extra work either, but then I believe this will help me a ton at my work, and I will also learn a bunch after designing the schema and seeing in real time how the database grows.So the plan is use a local instance of postgreSQL with a frontend like NocoDB for spreadsheets like interface. So then I have the fallback of using NocoDB to edit my data, or when I can, and I will try to, always use SQL, or atleast make my own interface to manage the data.Here's some considerations why I should move to this approach:1. The monolithic sheets, one spreadsheets have too much column (phone number, name, classes bought, class id, classes left, last class date, note, complains, (sales related data like age, gender, city, learning objective). And just yesterday, I had a call with my manager, and she says that I should also includes payment information, and 2 types of complains, and I was staring at the long list of the data in the spreadsheets..2. I have a pain point of syncing two different sheets. So my company uses other service of spreadsheets (not google) and there is coworker that can't access this site from their country. So, I, again, need to update both of this spreadsheet, and the issue is my company have trust issue with google, so I would also need to filter some data before putting it into the google spreadsheet, from the company one. Too much hassle.What I hope to achievr from migrating to sql, is that I can just sync them both to my local instance of SQL instead of from one to the other.cons of this approach (that i know of):This infrastructure will then depends on me, and I think I would need a no-code solution in the future if there will be other coworker in my position. Other approach being considered: Just refactore the sheets that mimics relational db (students, classes, enrolls_in, teaches_in, payment, complains)But then having to filter and sync across the other sheets will still be an issue.I've read a post somewhere about a teacher that tried to do this kind of thing, basically a student management system. And then it just became a burden for him, needing him to maintain an ecosystem without being paid for it.But from what I see, this approach seems need little maintenance and effort to keep up, so only the initial setup will be hard. But feel free to prove me wrong!That's about it, I hope you all can give me insights whether or not this journey I'm about to take will be fruitful.

I've filtered their fact tables down to show only active jobs on our floor, and most of our reporting centers around that data. I built a Go ETL program that pulls data from Oracle and pushes it to Postgres every hour (currently moving about 1k rows per pull). My next step was to use dbt to build out proper dimensions and new fact tables.**Why the Migration?**The company moved their on-premise Oracle database to Azure, which has tanked our Power BI and Excel report performance. On top of that, the database account they gave us for reporting doesn't have access to materialized views, can't create indexes, or schedule anything. We're basically locked into querying views-on-top-of-views with no optimization options.**Where I'm Stuck**I've hit a few walls that are keeping me from moving forward:1. **Development environment**: The dbt plugin is deprecated in IntelliJ, and the VS Code version is pretty rough. SqlMesh doesn't really solve this either. What tools do you all use for writing this kind of code?2. **Historical tracking**: The ERP uses object versions and business keys built by concatenating two fields with a `^` separator. This makes incremental syncing really difficult. I'm not sure how to handle this cleanly.3. **Dimension table design**: Since I'm filtering to only active jobs to keep row volume down, my dimension tables grow and shrink. That means I have to truncate them on each run instead of maintaining a proper slowly changing dimension. I know it's not ideal, but I'm not sure what the better approach would be here.Your advice would be appreicated.

1ofequj,Python Data Ingestion patterns/suggestions.,Salt_Fox905,dataengineering,"Hello everyone,I am a beginner data engineer (~1 yoe in DE), we have built a python ingestion framework that does the following:1. Fetches data in chunks from RDS table2. Loads dataframes to Snowflake tables using put stream to SF stage and COPY INTO.Config for each source table in RDS, target table in Snowflake, filters to apply etc are maintained in a snowflake table which is fetched before each Ingestion Job.These ingestion jobs need to run on a schedule, therefore we created cronjobs on an on-prem VM (yes, 1 VM) that triggers the python ingestion script (daily, weekly, monthly for different source tables).We are moving to EKS by containerizing the ingestion code and using Kubernetes Cronjobs to achieve the same behaviour as earlier (cronjobs in VM). There are other options like Glue, Spark etc but client wants EKS, so we went with it. Our team is also pretty new, so we lack experience to say ""Hey, instead of EKS, use this"". The ingestion module is just a bunch of python scripts with some classes and functions. How much can performance be improved if I follow a worker pattern where workers pull from a job queue (AWS SQS?) and do just plain extract and load from rds to snowflake. The workers can be deployed as a kubernetes deployment with scalable replicas of workers. A master pod/deployment can handle orchestration of job queue (adding, removing, tracking ingestion jobs).I beleive this approach can scale well compared to Cronjobs approach where each pod that handles ingestion job can only have access to finite resources enforced by resources.limits.cpu and mem.Please give me your suggestions regarding the current approach and new design idea.

1ofbeax,Enforced and versioned data product schemas for data flow from provider to consumer domain in Apache Iceberg?,fabkosta,dataengineering,"Recently I have been contemplating the idea of a ""data ontology"" on top of Apache Iceberg. The idea is that within a domain you can change data schema in any way you intend using default Apache Iceberg functionality. However, when you publish a data product such that it can be consumed by other data domains then the schema of your data product is frozen, and there is some technical enforcement of the data schema such that the upstream provider domain cannot simply break the schema of the data product thus causing trouble for the downstream consumer domain. Whenever a schema change of the data product is required then the upstream provider domain must go through an official change request with version control etc. that must be accepted by the downstream consumer domain.Obviously, building the full product would be highly complicated with all the bells and whistles attached. But building a small PoC to showcase could be achievable in a realistic timeframe.Now, I have been wondering:1. What do you generally think of such an idea? Am I onto something here? Would there be demand for this? Would Apache Iceberg be the right tech for that?2. I could not find this idea implemented anywhere. There are things that come close (like Starburst's data catalogue) but nothing that seems to actually technically enforce schema change for data products. From what I've seen most products seem to either operate at a lower level (e.g. table level or file level), or they seem to not actually enforce data product schemas but just describe their schemas.

So for example, I have for job A 100 batch files, each containing x datasets, are ordered which means the first batch has the first datapoints and the last contains the last - the order has important factor. Each batch contains y rows of data in every dataset where each dataset can have a different shape. The last file in the batch might contain less than y rows. Another job, job B can have less or more batch files, will still have x datasets but the split of rows per batch (the amount of data per batch) might be different than y. I've tried a combo of kerchunk, zarr, and dask but keep on having issues with the different shapes, I've lost data between batches - only the first batch data is found or many shapes issues.What solution do you recommend for efficiently doing data analysis?

1oj5rw1,What job profile do you think would cover all these skills?,Steel9999,dataengineering,"Hi everyone;I need help from the community to classify my current position.I used to work for a small company for several years that was acquired recently by a large company, and the problem is that this large company does not know how to classify my position in their job profile grid. As a result, I find myself in a generic “data engineer” category, and my package is assessed accordingly, even though data engineering is only a part of my job and my profile is much broader than that.Before, when I was at my small company, my package evolved comfortably each year as I expanded my skills and we relied less and less on external subcontractors to manage the data aspects that I did not master well. Now, even though I continue to improve my skills and expertise, I find myself stuck with a fixed package because my new company is unaware of the breadth of my expertise...Specifically, on my local industrial site, I do the following:* Manage all the data ingestion pipeline (cleaning, transformation, uploading to the database, management of feedback loops, automatic alerts, etc.)* Manage a very large Postgresql database (maintenance, backup, upgrades, performance optimization, etc.) with multiple schema and broad variaty of data embedded* Create new database structures (new schemas, tables, functions, etc.)* Build custom data exploitation platforms and implement various business visualisations* Use data for modelling/prediction with machine learning techniques* Manage our cloud services (access, upgrades, costs, etc.) and the cloud architectures required for data pipelines, database, BI,… (on AWS: EC2, lambda, SQS, RDS, dynamoDB, Sagemaker, Quicksight,…)I added these functions over the years. I was originally hired to do just ""data analysis"" and industrial statistics (I'm basically a statistician and I have 25 years of experience in the industry), but I'm quite good at teaching myself new things. For example, I am able to read documentation and several books on a subject, practice, correct my errors and then apply this new knowledge in my work. I have always progressed like this: ir is my main professional strength and what my small company valued most.I do not claim to be as skilled an expert as a specialist in these various fields, but I am sufficiently proficient to have been able to handle everything fully autonomously for several years. **What job profile do you think would cover all these skills?** **=>** *I would like to propose a job profile that would allow my new large company to benchmark my profile* and realize that my package can still evolve and that I am saving them a lot of money (external consultants or new hires, I also do a lot of custom development, which saves us from having to purchase professional software solutions).Personally, I don't want to change companies because I know it will be difficult to find another position that is as broad and intellectually so interesting, especially since I don't claim to know EVERY aspect of these different professions (for example, I now know AWS very well because I work on this platform on a day to day basis, but I know very little about Azure or Google Cloud; I know machine learning fairly well, but I know very little about deep learning, which I have hardly ever practised, etc.). But it's really frustrating to feel like you're working really hard, tackling successfully technical challenges where our external consultants have proven to be less effective, spending hundreds of hours (often on my own time) to strengthen my skills without any recognition and package increase perspective...Thanks for your help!",1,0.55,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oj5rw1/what_job_profile_do_you_think_would_cover_all/,2025-10-29 14:18:18,2025-10-31 01:39:13

1of2nm4,Writing artifacts on a complex fact for data quality / explainability?,rotr0102,dataengineering,"Some fact tables are fairly straightforward, others can be very complicated. I'm working on a extremely complicated composite metric fact table, the output metric is computed queries/combinations/logic from \~15 different business process fact tables. From a quality standpoint I am very concerned about transparency and explainability of this final metric. So, in addition to the metric value, I'm also considering writing to the fact the values which were used to create the desired metric, with their vintage and other characteristics. So, for example if the metric M=A+B+C-D-E+F-G+H-I; then I would not only store each value, but also the point in time it was pulled from source \[some of these values are very volatile and are essentially sub queries with logic/filters\]. For example: A\_Value = xx, B\_Value = yyy, C\_value = zzzz, A\_TimeStamp = 10/24/25 3:56AM, B\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 1:11AM, C\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 6:47AM.You can see here that M was created using data from very different points of time, and in this case the data can change a lot within a few hours. \[data is not only being changed by a 24x7 global business, but also by system batch processing on schedule\] If someone else uses the same formula, but data from later points in time they might get a different result (and yes, we would ideally wish A,B,C... to be from the same point in time). Is this a design pattern being used? Is there a better way? Is there resources I can use to learn more about this? Again, I wouldn't use this in all designs, only those of sufficient complexity to create better visibility as to ""why the value is what it is"" (when others might disagree and argue because they used the same formula with data from different points in time or filters). \*\* note: I'm considering techniques to ensure all formula components are from the same ""time"" (aka: using time travel in Snowflake, or similar techniques) - but for this question, I'm only concerned about the data modeling to capture/record artifacts used for data quality / explainability.

In Azure DevOps I go to Clone -> Open VS Code to develop notebook locally in VS Code. Now, all notebooks in Fabric and repo are stored as .py files. Normally, developers often prefer working interactively in `.ipynb` (Jupyter/VS Code), not in .py.And now I don't really know how to handle this scenario. In VS Code in Explorer pane I see all the Fabric items, including notebooks. I would like to develop this notebook which i see in the repo.

1ojcrji,Need advice on choosing a new title for my role,dRuEFFECT,dataengineering,"Principal Data Architect - this is the title my director and I originally threw out there, but I'd like some opinions from any of you. I've heard architect is a dying title and don't want to back myself into a corner for future opportunities. We also floated Principal BI Engineer or Principal Data Engineer, but I hardly feel that implementing Stitch and Fivetran for ELT justifies a data engineer title and don't feel my background would line up with that for future opportunities. It may be a moot point if I ever try going for a Director of Analytics role in the future, but not sure if that will ever happen as I've never had direct reports and don't like office politics. I do enjoy being an individual contributor, data governance, and working directly with stakeholders to solve their unique needs on data and reporting. Just trying to better understand what I should call myself, what I should focus on, and where I should try to go to next.Background and context below.I have 14 years experience behind me, with previous roles as Reporting Analyst, Senior Pricing Analyst, Business Analytics Manager, and currently Senior Data Analytics Manager. With leadership and personnel changes in my current company and team, after 3 years of being here my responsibilities have shifted and leadership is open to changing my title, but I'm not sure what direction I should take it.Back in college I set out to be a Mechanical Engineer; I loved physics, but was failing Calc 2 and panicked and regrettably changed my major to their Business program. When I started my career, I took to Excel and VBA macros naturally because my physics brain just likes to build things. Then someone taught me the first 3 lines of SQL and everything took off from there.In my former role as Business Analytics Manager I was an analytics team of 1 for 4 years where I rebuilt everything from the ground. Implemented Stitch for ELT, built standardized data models with materialized views in Redshift, and built dashboards in Periscope (R.I.P.).I got burnt out as a team of 1 and moved to my current company so I can be a part of a larger team, at first I was hired into the Marketing Department just focusing on standardizing data models and reporting under Marketing, but soon after started supporting Finance and Merchandising as well. We had a Senior Data Architect I worked closely with, as well as a Data Scientist; both of these individuals left and were never backfilled so I'm back to where I started managing all of it, although we've dropped all projects the data scientist was running. I now fall under IT instead of Marketing, and I report to a Director of Analytics who reports to the CTO. We also have 3 offshore analyst resources for dashboard building and ad hoc requests, but they primarily focus on website analytics with GA4.I'm currently in the process of onboarding Fivetran for the bulk of our data going into BigQuery, and we just signed on with Tableau to consolidate dashboards and various spreadsheets. I will be rebuilding views to utilize the new data pipelines and rebuilding existing dashboards, much like my last company.What I love most about my work is writing SQL, building complex but clean views to normalize/standardize data to make it intuitive for downstream reporting and dashboard building. I loved building dashboards in Periscope because it was 100% SQL driven, most other BI tools I've found limiting by comparison. I know some python, but working in that environment doesn't come naturally to me and I'm way more comfortable writing everything directly in SQL, building dynamic dashboards, and piping my data into spreadsheets in a format the stakeholders like.I've never truly considered myself an 'analyst' as I don't feel comfortable providing analysis and recommendations, my brain thinks of a thousand different variables as to why that assumption could be misleading. Instead, I like working with the people asking the questions and understanding the nuances of the data being asked about in order to write targeted queries, and let those subject matter experts derive their own conclusions. And while I've always been intrigued by the deeper complexities of data engineering functions and capabilities, there are an endless number of tools and platforms out there that I haven't been exposed to and know little about so I'd feel like a fraud trying to call myself an engineer. At the end of the day I work in data with a mechanical engineering brain rather than a traditional software engineering type, and still struggle to understand what path I should be taking in the future.",1,0.57,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ojcrji/need_advice_on_choosing_a_new_title_for_my_role/,2025-10-29 18:39:31,2025-10-31 01:39:13

1oj5ilf,The reality is different – From JSON/XML to relational DB automatically,Exact_Cherry_9137,dataengineering,"I would like to share a story about my current experience and the difficulties I am encountering—or rather, about how my expectations are different from reality.﻿I am a data engineer who has been working in the field of data processing for 25 years now. I believe I have a certain familiarity with these topics, and I have noticed the lack of some tools that would have saved me a lot of time.﻿And that’s how I created a tool (but that’s not the point) that essentially, by taking JSON or XML as input, automatically transforms them into a relational database. It also adapts automatically to changes, always preserving backward compatibility with previously loaded data.﻿At the moment, the tool works with databases like PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Oracle. In the future, I hope to support more (but actually, it could work for all databases, considering that one of these three could be used as a data source after running the tool).﻿Let me get to the point: in my mind, I thought this tool could be a breakthrough, and a similar product (which I won’t mention here to avoid giving it promotion) actually received an award from Snowflake in 2025 because it was considered very innovative. Basically, that tool does much of what mine does, but mine still has some better features.﻿Nowadays, JSON data is everywhere, and that has been the “fuel” that kept me going while developing it.A bit against the trend, my tool does not use AI—maybe this is penalizing it, but I want to be genuine and not hide behind this topic just to get more attention. It is also very respectful of privacy, making it suitable for those dealing with personal or sensitive data (basically, part of the process runs on the customer’s premises, and the result can be sent out to get the final product ready to be executed on their own database).﻿The ultimate idea is to create a SaaS so that anyone who needs it can access the tool. At the moment, however, I don't have the financial resources to cover the costs of productization, legal fees, patents, and all the necessary expenses. That’s why I thought about offering myself as a consultant providing the transformation service, so that once I receive the input data, clients can start viewing their information in a relational database formatThe difficulties I am facing are surprising me. There are people who consider themselves experts and say that this tool doesn't make sense, preferring to write code themselves to extract the necessary information by reading the data directly from JSON—using, in my opinion, syntaxes that are not easy even for those who know only SQL.﻿I am now wondering if there truly are people out there with expert knowledge of these topics (which are definitely niche), because I believe that not having to write a single line of code, being able to get a relational database ready for querying with simple queries, tables that are automatically linked in the same way (parent/child fields), and being able to create reports and dashboards in just a few minutes, is truly an added value that today can be found in only a few tools.﻿I’ll conclude by saying that the estimated minimum ROI, in terms of time—and therefore money—saved for a developer is at least 10x.I am so confident in my solution that I would also love to hear the opinion of those who face this type of situation daily.Thank you to everyone who has read this post and is willing to share their thoughts.",0,0.5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oj5ilf/the_reality_is_different_from_jsonxml_to/,2025-10-29 14:08:13,2025-10-31 01:39:13

1oeonrp,"I'm a MS student in my last year, should I go back to my old company or should I go with a new I interned for over the summer?",DataByte7389,dataengineering,"Background: I’m finishing up my last year in my M.S. program studying a mixture of Data Analytics and Information Systems. Before grad school, I spent a little over 4 years working remotely at a med-tech startup (around 500 people) in product management. It was a great learning experience but also very stressful. They constantly overloaded me, interfered with my school schedule (when I was working part-time in undergrad), worked late into the night constantly, and broke promises around pay and promotions.I eventually left when I started my master’s, mainly for my own sanity and so I could focus on my health, school, and my relationship. I made sure to leave on good terms since I still really like the company and the products they are creating. It’s a small, niche industry, so I wanted to keep that bridge intact.This past summer, I interned at a manufacturing company that works in the AI/data center space. My role started as Systems Analyst but turned into more of a Data Engineering internship by the end of it. I learned a lot, but the culture was rough on my team. They didn’t really want an intern, and it was a pretty cold and dry environment with them being too busy to interact with me the whole summer. I very much had to figure out a lot of things on my own since I had to use tools and create projects I never had experience with ever. To add, this was just an issue with the team I was on, other interns had a great time on different teams. It made me consistently miss the energy and connection I had with my old coworkers at the startup, which is something I think I value a lot on a team.-Decision-The manufacturing company gave me a full-time offer for after graduation. It is a Sr Engineer role with a total comp of 145k (Yearly Breakdown: $105k base + 10% bonus + around 30k in stock). It’s stable, the benefits are great, and they even mentioned I might rotate through different engineering areas to choose a spot I like. But most likely due to company necessity I will end up in the same team (Data Engineering) I was with before since they are spread extremely thin. I am nervous about the role since they are asking me to do projects that I have little to no experience doing with little support just like the internship. It makes me afraid (A bit of imposter syndrome?) that I will not succeed in the role since I come from a more business / analytics background. But recently I also got contacted by my old company, who’s entering a big growth phase, and they asked if I’d consider coming back to the product team after graduation. They’ve made promises that they’ve reduced a lot of the work and the emergency late nights by creating a new team to manage them. I would focus more on actual product management and problem solving if I came back. They implied they would consider hiring me remotely again but are pushing for me to instead relocate to their HQ (based in Seattle when I am currently on the east coast). I’ve not received an offer yet as we are going back and forth still but I am familiar with the salary range based off of my co-workers. Estimated Breakdown: 80-97k Base + 10-15% Bonus + 12.5k in RSUs. Part of me wants to go back because I really loved the people and the work. But I’m scared of ending up in the same stressful situations again along with all the promises that were broken before and if they can keep them. Also scared that I won’t have much growth since they do not promote often in PM. On the other hand, the new company is stable and pays well with clear expectations but doesn’t excite me the same way as well with other fears about the position and team.How should I proceed? Also another thing I’m thinking about is long term on which role will let me best pursue other growth opportunities and not plateau early in my career. Any advice would be appreciated even if its outside the scope of my question.",0,0.5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oeonrp/im_a_ms_student_in_my_last_year_should_i_go_back/,2025-10-24 04:38:18,2025-10-31 01:39:13

1oghzxt,I'm currently learning with AI and I feel like I'm a fraud.,JoeyJoeJoeJrShab,learnprogramming,"I keep seeing posts that contain a sentence similar to this. Let me give some generic advice: try doing it without AI.In the olden times, it was not uncommon for learners to have a project that did not work, and they could not figure out why. Now, thanks to AI, learners have a project that does work, and they can't figure out why.AI is not always bad or evil, but likewise, it definitely isn't always helpful. Learning requires reading, trying, making mistakes, getting confused, reading more, trying more, and repeating. Start small -- there's a reason ""hello world"" is a common first task -- the actual coding is ridiculously simple, but it proves that your have done all of the necessary work to get your environment properly running. Once you've got that working, you can move on to something more complicated.I've seen a lot of people who, with the help of AI, start with a much bigger project. AI helps them get that bigger project running, but they don't fully understand what was done to reach that point, which means they're not able to successfully make changes or fixes to that project.There's nothing wrong with googling. There's nothing wrong with asking AI a question. But your best bet is to spend some time thinking and trying on your own before using either tool. My advice to anyone learning with AI: don't let AI read or write your code. If you're going to ask AI questions, do so in English. Use AI to help you find the terminology that you don't yet know, and once you've learned the right words, spend some time reading about what they mean.",251,0.86,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oghzxt/im_currently_learning_with_ai_and_i_feel_like_im/,2025-10-26 11:12:23,2025-10-31 01:39:14

It's possible to find the object constructor and every function call reference in a repository without being a command-line wiz.The most mentally taxing code for me to read are Python libraries that heavily uses decorators to transform inputs. Some stuff in the native functools lib or data science packages seem like they could increase obfuscation in the future.```@np.vectorize(otypes=[float])def divide(x): return 6 / xdivide([1, 2, 3])Output: array([6., 3., 2.])```Java.

I need to inspect where this object is being constructed.* The instance of MyServiceClient being passed to CallAction, where is it being passed?* I can't find a CallAction constructor call anywhere, so I don't know where MyServiceClient is coming from.* Maybe I can figure it by searching the codebase for all the methods that return a MyServiceClient.* There are multiple methods that return MyServiceClient, and none of them are called anywhere in the codebase.* I have no clue where this Factory is being passed either.* I don't know where Factory is being created.

1ohla28,"How do you ""turn on"" HTTPS in an application? Basic Theory",Few-Pressure-7331,learnprogramming,"This is what I understand. I kind of need some basic explanation to know where to look for things when I want to get deeper into this. TCP and UDP are part of the **transport layer** in the tcp/ip stack and all layers up to that one are implemented by the **os kernel**. So my application won't have to implement it, it would use **system calls**.For a web application a **client** and my **server** will communicate. The client will open a **tcp connection** with the correct **socket** ( ip : port 80 or 443 ) of my server. The client is e.g. the browser.So now we have client and server with an open **tcp connection**. **HTTP** is a protocol in the **application layer** in the tcp/ip stack so it has to be implemented by an application. In a nutshell, http is basically just a standard for how the string of text sent over the tcp connection is structured to be valid.The **webserver** thats being communicated with is an application, so it implements the HTTP protocol. It can either serve static files or call programs or scripts and give the **request data** as a parameter. The application can then produce an answer. No matter if static or dynamic content is served, pretty much the webserver responds to the request it receivedSo that's my basic understanding at I think its correct. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here already.TLS is also an application layer protocol, so it has to be implemented by an application. I heard of libraries like OpenSSL implementing them.But where do I **turn on HTTPS** now? Since the server has to be able to serve static content or forward requests to an application or a script, I'd guess in the server? But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.",91,0.92,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ohla28/how_do_you_turn_on_https_in_an_application_basic/,2025-10-27 17:48:46,2025-10-31 01:39:14

After all there's no reason to change it now or ever.Won't unit tests be overkill for this?What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.Finally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class?

Instead, directly start developing and learn what you need on the way.For example, instead of doing a web developement course, decide on building some website, then ask ChatGPT how to do it. ChatGPT is the best learning resource right now. Note down the steps and watch YouTube videos to learn just what's required for the development of the website, for each step. Keep developing and you'll learn along the way. Similarly, instead of doing a DSA course, just start solving LeetCode and learn as you do. You can look for explanatory videos for specific problems along the way.""I find that to be an interesting perspective. I would like to know what others think about it. I've completed about 40% of the course and it's a long one. Should I give it a stop?He also told me that software development/engineering is currently the easiest way to get into the industry.

But if I was in a professional environment, I take it that other people would be working on other features, so by the time I merge back in, the codebase would have changed somewhat.So I’ve read, when you start every day, you pull from master into your branch to update the local codebase.

1ojc4as,Is there any benefits to limiting the recourses you learn from?,Defiant-Ad588,learnprogramming,"So I asked myself this question when I first watched a podcast with John Carmack. He was explaining how he learned programming from the very small selection of books his library offered, but mostly from NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS. On top of that he was programming games in assembly!When it comes to problem sets, I find that I learn best without the help of ai. But I ask this question in regards to googling as well because this is something I'm very indecisive about. I'll give an example, the other day I was working on a CS50 problem set and I ended up spending too much time trying to make over complicated for loops to compare each char in an array of strings. Then, when I finally googled it, I found out there was a function in a library that did it for me. Maybe this isn't the best anecdote because I could've read the documentation on the library before hand, but I hope you get my point. I also think ai is so much more looked down upon than googling, but I think both can reinforce the same bad habits, I.e when things get difficult you end up relying on something else. I understand that it wasn't the limited resources that made John Carmack into John Carmack. However, I personally think a scarcity in resources indirectly makes you remember things better. ""Why would I need to remember the syntax differences in declaring a function in JS vs Python if the answers are a couple clicks away."" I'm genuinely curious to hear what your opinions are on this. What would be ways to balance this?

1ok6ywa,My experience switching to a split keyboard while learning to code,COOLGAMER88_YT,learnprogramming,"So I finally caved and tried a split keyboard (NocFree lite, wireless version). Been two weeks and my wrists already feel a lot less strained during long coding sessions. My posture is getting better and the compact 60% design also frees up desk space which is nice when I am juggling multiple devices. The layout took a few days to click especially the right side and some Fn combos but now it feels pretty natural. Typing is quiet, smooth and the little thumb keys are actually useful (again took some getting used to). Wireless mostly works but if I type really fast, sometimes it stumbles and makes me backspace a few times. I also miss a proper battery indicator but I guess its not that bad a thing. Beyond comfort, the customization options are a real productivity boost. I’ve been using Vial to set up extra layers and remap keys. I can even remap keys to control the mouse which is quite handy for my workflow (like scrolling or navigating code without leaving the keyboard). Hot-swappable switches mean I can tweak the typing feel over time without having to replace the whole board so I like the long-term use I’ll get out of it. Overall it has been a small change that’s actually improved my learning speed. Sharing it here for anyone curious about split boards.

1oflqd0,Difficulty focusing on one language.,DesperateOriginal827,learnprogramming,"Over the last few years, I’ve been teaching myself programming. I’m currently 32 and I wouldn’t say I’m “good” at any specific language. During these past few years, I’ve always jumped between multiple languages (C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc). I have basic knowledge in the languages listed, but I wouldn’t say enough to build something worth while.I do try and stick to one language, but then I’d usually get bored, see a new shiny thing, and jump towards that. Then most of the time, I’ll do a complete 360 and return to the language I initially started with. I’ve been doing this for years and always struggled just to stick to 1 language. And it feels like I’ve shot myself in the foot by not specialising in a single language to become efficient in it. I think the reason why I struggle focusing on a single language, is (in my honest opinion) ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with it, but a few friends who have it, have said it’s a common thing to hyper focus on something, then jump to something else (they work in tech themselves). And the other reason, is that I do find all languages interesting and want to learn as much as possible (which I know isn’t ideal when starting out).I do believe that my interests change quite a lot too, which is most likely another factor. Whether that’ll be attempting to make a small game, website, desktop app, etc. I’ve found it hard just to pick one language and run with it, ignoring the rest until I’ve built up good knowledge of different algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc.As an example, my current job, they use C#/.NET for the backend services, and now my brain wants to learn C# again. But then I’m telling myself, “what’s the point, as you’d only focus on it for a few weeks/months, then your focus will change when a new shiny thing is discovered, or you get bored.”Has anyone else done the same in the past? If so, how did you combat it?

I was hoping I could get some thoughts from people who've been where I have and pushed through it.When I started, the company made it clear that they expected nothing from me, which I found a bit strange and it made me feel like my work didn't matter from the start. I was given my first project and I completed it in a month, I told my supervisor this and his reaction seemed more annoyed than pleased, and he said he would have to find something else for me to do if I don't slow down. He also explained that I had completed it much quicker than they expected (~3/4 months ahead of schedule). This made me feel great at the time; looking back, I fear they were just underestimating me.I tried to take some initiative. I taught myself to write cleaner code, did some reading, tried to push the idea behind my first project further and add some extra features while I had no other projects or tasks lined up.I eventually asked my supervisor for some more work and he put me onto doing bug fixes. I was happy at the time because it was helping me learn much more about the codebase, about the products they sell and I was making a difference, but 3 months later and there still wasn't any more projects lined up. I spoke to a couple of my friends also away on internships and they seem to be busy, with multiple projects waiting and with deadlines. It hurts even more when I see other members of staff working on projects I feel I would me more than capable of assisting them with and when I offer to help, they turn me away.There have been monthly stand-ups where they joke about forgetting I'm there, I haven't had a single code review in the 5 months and when I ask management, they say they've been very busy. This makes me feel even more demoralized because if they're busy, why can't they get me to help?Additionally, I just feel like I don't deserve to be there and like I'm expendable. My manager constantly jokes about how stupid people from my university are and I do try and laugh it off but it keeps making me feel even worse about being there. I even recall cases where they've been annoyed about me asking for help!I've contemplated trying to leave in favour of another intenrship, but I don't think it's possible to find another at this time in the year and I can't imagine me leaving 8 months early would look good on my resume.

Which I did....Long story short, I watched a YouTube tutorial, bought a domain + hosting, updated the name servers, installed WordPress, bought a ThemeForest theme, and used elementor to build him a site. Took me about a week..... He was mind-blown when I showed him the final result :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:Just after that, something clicked.. I actually enjoyed doing all that. So I started learning HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp, and honestly, I’m finding it fun and kind of addictive....Now I’m wondering if I should take this seriously and maybe change careers down the road. But I need some guidance from people who’ve been there or know the field...Should I go for frontend, backend, or full stack?What’s the best way to learn and practice at the same time?Any must to use resources or roadmaps for someone starting fresh plz ?Any advice or feedback would be super appreciated. :folded_hands:",5,0.7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oh4lw8/truck_driver_turned_web_dev_enthusiast/,2025-10-27 03:49:28,2025-10-31 01:39:14

1ofmi5n,Learning to code in university,Signal-Building735,learnprogramming,"Lately, I’ve been realizing something about my journey in university — especially now that I’m in my second year. I’m not struggling with the subjects themselves. I’m struggling with caring about them the way the system expects me to.Every time exams approach, I don’t feel scared, anxious, or even motivated. I just feel… detached. Because my goal isn’t to chase marks — it’s to understand, to learn, to build. What excites me isn’t memorizing for a grade, it’s learning cutting, learning something that actually connects with my future.But the problem is that sometimes, the environment around you drains you before you even start. You see people studying hard to get top marks, while you’re there trying your best to understand — but there’s nothing to truly understand. You try to find meaning in what you study, but most teachers themselves aren’t motivated, and it kills your spark a little every day.Living in Algeria doesn’t make it easier — the system feels heavy, exhausting, and uninspiring. You go to university, follow the hours, come back home drained, and even on your “rest days,” you don’t really rest. You just survive.And sometimes I ask myself: do students in other countries feel the same? Are they also fighting to keep their curiosity alive in a system that wants to turn everyone into the same mold?I’m not saying I hate studying. I actually love learning. I just wish learning wasn’t reduced to chasing numbers on a piece of paper.So yeah, I’m excited to cut — to start my own path, to learn differently, to build something that feels alive.

My courses are completely online and asynchronous, which is great.

The course is IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I'm pretty nervous about it, as a lot of students have said it's the most difficult course they've taken throughout their studies. My understanding of programming/coding is extremely rudimentary at best, ranging from the MySpace days of editing HTML to a basic SQL class I took a few months back. That's about it. Our textbook for the course is Systems Analysis & Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML, 6th ed. I also just purchased a book called Head First Object Oriented Analysis & Design by Brett McLaughlin, which I have heard is great for a visual representation of the basics. Aside from actual books, does anyone have any online tutorials or videos that may be helpful for getting started here? From the very beginning of understanding the underlying concepts. The simpler, the better. I don't even know what UML is, other than that it stands for Unified Modeling Language. No idea what that means!

1ojg0gi,How do you learn to analyze the design of code in tutorials/learn to implement ideas from scratch?,tree332,learnprogramming,"in concept art, there is a term called 'kitbashing' where people use assets to make a collage to build their project off of, whether it is using a 3d render to paint over for a 2d illustration or using kits of generalized parts such as screws or technical looking parts of machinery.This is likely a stupid analogy, but I have viewed this to be similar to using tutorials. So far, when I am designing a program from scratch, I make a diagram where I roughly describe and draw out features, then I try to write down potential places I could find an example of the feature. usually it starts with generally describing the feature in google ""How to draw a line between two objects in godot"" for example, then I start looking up classes in the godot library I can use and watching tutorials of feature implementation that is somewhat similar.But I often get stuck trying to then understand the code in the tutorial and studying whether the method used in the tutorial is the most efficient way for my project, or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation.But as a programming beginner, I also don't really understand the design of a library. I may roughly understand the description of a function such as vector2 get\_point\_position(index:int) for example returning the position of a point, but I may not understand the underlying design, such as how I still don't understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it's the 2d line itself that is an array containing points. Initially I thought there was some holy grail book of software architecture & programming library design that if I read, I would have a rough idea of how to outline the implementation of any project, I wouldn't awkwardly type in a rough description of my feature into google but I would rather have a label for the type of data structure and algorithm the feature uses and knew exactly where to look in the library documentation, or if developing from complete scratch.I've went through CS50, reviewed the programming fundamentals of addresses, pointers, OOP principles, intermediate programming in java implementing binary searches and linked lists etc, but my implementation skills still really suck, even after making a design diagram and pseudocode, I never know where to look in order to translate my pseudocode into a specific function in a library or a class from scratch. It feels like I am somewhat a native speaker in 'design', but I barely know my alphabet in terms of implementation.",2,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ojg0gi/how_do_you_learn_to_analyze_the_design_of_code_in/,2025-10-29 20:42:28,2025-10-31 01:39:14

Exceptionally talented guy....the kind of person who solves technical problems others can’t even phrase properly. But ever since the news of layoffs started spreading internally, he’s been living in constant panic.He literally jumps at every phone notification. His heart starts racing every time his phone buzzes, thinking it might be that email. The ""you’ve been impacted"" one.He barely sleeps..maybe 2 or 3 hours a night.He told me people who got laid off earlier received their emails after midnight or early morning, so now he stays awake in constant fear of that notification. Imagine being that scared of an email.He keeps saying ""I'm sure I'll be next. They like people who talk a lot. I just…..work.""And the sad part...he’s really good at his job. But his manager once told him that his communication skills are a little off and he needs to work on that. He was okay with this initially and agreed to work on it but with the constant state of fear and overthinking he thinks this could be one of the deciding factor.There are some new hires in his team..they’re young, confident, articulate..and he feels invisible next to them and assumes he’s automatically at risk.It’s heartbreaking to see someone who’s great at what they do be this mentally wrecked by uncertainty. The kind of fear that turns your phone into an anxiety trigger.These corporates don’t talk enough about what layoffs or even the fear of layoffs do to people mentally. It’s brutal.

1oemgrv,Reality of CS Students in this Subreddit,Fwellimort,cscareerquestions,"I have over the past few years tried to help 6 CS students more directly through Discord, etc. All of whom claimed to be grinding, etc and so forth. Here has been my thoughts on what I noticed of college students and new grads.PS: I have over a dozen of students who had DMed for help, etc as well but those have always been casual reddit chats since I don't care anymore.My thoughts on the job market:1. Job market for new grads and interns this year looks significantly better than the past 2 years.2. Offshoring is a reality which cannot be ignored. Companies are growing talent abroad now and a lot of layoffs have had their jobs moved to offshore. Unlike the past, offshore infra and talent is there. Covid 'proved' remote work works and 'offshore' == 'remote work'. Talent does not magically get better or worse depending on where the individual is located. And paying top dollar in Canada means entirely different from paying dollar in US.3. There's just too many CS majors and CS curriculums overall have become easier so schools can make more money. And there's so many CS adjacent majors sprouting left and right on top like Information Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational X, Computer Science + X, Information Systems, Informatics, Software Engineering, Business Information Management, etc.And then there's the fact a lot of Math, Physics, Statistics, Actuarial Science, etc students are minoring in CS as well. And Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, etc students all applying to CS jobs as well.The supply of candidates is essentially infinite relative to demand for new grads.4. Resumes all look similar end of day due to Chatgpt. And honestly, what can you expect out of students. These are students, not working professionals. Truth is, the most differentiating factor is school name on a resume before any work experience. That said, at the same time, the talent and quality of new grads have significantly deteriorated. The median talent is on the floor (if there even is a floor). And a lot of them seems to be due to:1. Schools dumbing down curriculums + grade inflation (easier to graduate).2. Students doing bare minimum in school and just studying for the job interviews. Hence you see students here with 2.0 GPAs showing off the interviews they have gotten.3. CS is now really mainstream unlike in the way past in which programming was thought to be for nerds.4. Modern devices have abstracted away so much that students did not have to grow up having to deal with all sorts of bugs, frustrations, etc on the Internet.5. Chatgpt. It does homework, vibe coding, etc. Why bother spending the hours?6. There is a whole industry to min-maxing CS related job interviews. And the quality is really high as well. And a lot of information which in the past might have needed weeks of research is readily available within minutes now.7. TikTok brainwashing towards the world of instant gratifications. Students just don't want to deal with long frustrating grinds that go nowhere, etc.8. A lot of students going in claim to be 'passionate' in CS but really they are just majoring in it for the money or lifestyle they heard on TikTok, Youtube, etc. Now, I think 'passionate' is cringe but .. these students are all just really doing the bare minimum. \--------Why am I saying this? Well.. while I do know Youtube is a bait, my direct experience with 6 CS students in this subreddit have largely been the same as the ones I found on Youtube.In fact, I would argue the ones on Youtube look like god talent relative to most of the 6 CS students here in this subreddit I interacted on Discord.What Youtube videos you might ask? This is from Coding Jesus Youtube channel which is extremely baity and really there for him to advertise his own site but...[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM\_3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM_3yM)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s\_ztBwg7Vls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ztBwg7Vls)Let me just say ... most of the 6 CS students in this subreddit over the years I interacted on Discord... makes those candidates look like top talent.I have come to believe that we seriously need more gatekeeping in this field. Completely agree with Coding Jesus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA) On the hiring side, most students are flat out garbage. But the problem is **student resumes despite how well done at aggregate will always look similar before actual work experience**. Hence on the company side, the only way to filter is largely by school names at aggregate. And trust me when I say this, most students at ""top schools"" nowadays are flat out garbage as well. The difference being AT LEAST the students at top schools tend to be good at Leetcode. At least that bare minimum is done.The worst part of all this is actual talent cannot be differentiated either from the rest as well. And with so much cheaters everywhere, it's just impossible to tell who is actually good from others. It has been frustrating and a huge waste of time trying to help some students here in this subreddit only to learn that they ddn't even bother to do the bare minimum. I'm sorry but if you cannot do a basic easy-medium Leetcode question and are screaming for how the world is unfair and what not claiming you have been grinding and doing everything... then you are not fit for this field. Get out.It's been a huge waste of my time and a huge eye opening over the years how bad most CS students are lately when it comes to CS. And the best part? Every one of them at the start talked as if they thought differently of themselves. But ya.. just me rambling. Just wanted to share this. Also, good luck college students with the job market. I know it's rough. My only real advice to you is .... well, look into C++ if you are serious about software engineering and want to differentiate yourself from others. Totally agree with this recruiter as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA)Note: I still am helping one of them and plan to for the next few years (been helping for two years now).

Such RIF (cloaked as 'resignation') is not reported as a layoff. * Amazon is just a canary in the coalmine.

In the time I’ve been here my shares have gone 10x, and the business is exploding and has become the runaway leader in its sector. A highly profitable IPO looks to be in the cards in the next few years. I have gotten refresher equity over the years, such that my TC is reasonable for 13 YOE. If they were to just 2x again on IPO, I’d be looking at a healthy 8-figure payout after taxes. But of course, that is paper money and is in no way guaranteed (though my insider knowledge has me pretty bullish). The only two major downsides are as follows: I’ve been enduring a brutal 3 hour/day 3 day/week commute with kids at home. And two, I haven’t been able to purchase all my options. Only about 2/3. The pop in valuation coincided with having kids and I just couldn’t justify buying the options at the time, nor was I quite as bullish then. I’d need 3x more than I have in liquid savings to buy out the rest of the options due to taxes, and with every valuation pop that gets harder. I lose these unexercised options if I leave (classic golden handcuffs)I recently interviewed at a smaller, but still unicorn-level startup in the same sector. Its office is only 20 minutes away and has flexible hybrid hours. The offer is to lead a team at a >25% cash bump with a ~10% drop in equity depending on how you math some of the parameters. Overall a >15% TC upgrade at current valuations. It’s a paper career upgrade, but my biggest concern is trading out favorable pre-ISO RSU paper money where I am for paper equity in an as-of-yet less successful startup.There’s a quality of life question that’s near and dear to my heart, but if the trade ends up being multiple 7 figures a couple years from now, I’d kick myself forever.

Their big CRM/ERP system went down shortly after the previous dev left, and I was fortunate enough to get the whole thing running again. So they hired me on as CTO and I was thrilled for the upgrade at the time. But I am looking for a change of pace and want to work on new challenges in a different space altogether. I had a few interviews earlier this year and they all mentioned that they liked my resume but were worried that my actual dev skills would be diminished, as they assume because of my C-suite title that I must not be doing much actual dev work. I explained that if anything, my skills have gotten sharper, as I am still the only dev working here and have to handle the bulk of the IT issues in addition to my dev and CTO responsibilities. So I have a few questions for you all:1. Would you think a CTO is not capable of proper dev work anymore?2.

1ojthn5,"Fired after a month, no warning, need recourse",seanonamonday,cscareerquestions,"Graduated this May in CS. Did a bootcamp placement program which led to this startup role as an ""AI Dev."" They labelled it as a senior role (despite me being a new grad) and emphasized using tools like Cursor and Chat as part of the workflow, which the company paid for. This was my first post-grad job.Got pulled aside this morning and was told ""today's your last day here,"" out of nowhere. The reasoning they gave was along the lines of not meeting ""velocity,"" despite no expectations or timelines explicitly being put into place. It was a solo project with little guidance, and I required access to tools I wasn't initially provided and had to ask for, which definitely slowed the pace. There were no warnings and no PIP. They inferred that I wasn't meeting the expectations for the position and the pay.Was told to leave immediately. It was right after I completed my first major deliverable. I was genuinely shocked, as at the beginning my boss was very pleased with my work and liked to show it off; I'd worked extra on nights and weekends in response to my boss's messages to get the project done whilst also tackling my online masters. There seemed to be conflicting expectations between moving fast vs initial code quality between two of my authorities, and I often had difficulty getting timely support or permissions from the dev team.I'd love some advice moving forwards. I just relocated across the country for this job and have pretty limited savings and a year's lease to pay. The company offered a release agreement with small severance.I'm also not the first person to be let go from this role; another person was let go under a month ago for similar vague reasoning he also wasn't aware of. In any case, how might I proceed from here?

1ohpta3,Everything about this startup called Corgi feels off and suspicious,Remarkable-Ad3804,cscareerquestions,"Last week I came across a post from an employee at **Corgi** on LinkedIn (his job title was literally *“AI Insurance @ Corgi”*, lmao) looking for “cracked engineers.” I InMailed him sharing my interest and he replied with a calendar link to schedule a meeting before the so-called *work trial* at their office.Today I joined the meeting five minutes early to respect his time since he works at a startup and I figured that matters. Apparently they don’t think the same way. Minutes passed, no one joined. I waited for **20 minutes** and just when I was about to leave he finally joined. No apology for being late, no acknowledgment, and honestly he didn’t even seem to care about the call. He wasn’t paying attention, barely looked at me, and was probably scrolling on his phone the whole time.I had a few doubts about the startup, mainly what their *work culture* is like and what I should expect from this so-called “work trial.” When I tried to make conversation and ask about these things, he gave one-line answers and told me to email my GitHub and portfolio links (which I had already shared along with my resume a week ago). The meeting lasted barely **four minutes**.Now here’s where it gets weird:1. I couldn’t find a single solid resource about what this startup actually does or builds. Their website is just a plain landing page with almost no info.2. They claim to be backed by a bunch of VCs, but after checking the official portfolios of those firms, I couldn’t find *Corgi* listed anywhere except for one out of the six they mention.3. Their work culture looks sketchy. I saw posts where they proudly mentioned gifting mattresses to employees so they can “stay in the office 24/7.”For a startup that floods LinkedIn with posts about hiring “engineers” (basically glorified 24/7 slaves), this entire interaction felt really off and suspicious.Has anyone else heard of or interacted with this startup?

1ohv2b8,Graduated a year ago and can't land anything. Looking for guidance,use-after-free,cscareerquestions,"Hi All! Apologies for writing another one of those posts. But I am genuinely looking from some honest career advice because I feel so lost and defeated.I graduated a year ago from a T20 university. I unfortunately graduated with 0 work experience, aside from being a TA for a few semesters. I was only a CSE major my last two years of college and I couldn't land an internship in that summer between themRecently, I had an interview for an internship position for a large company that I was able to secure through a referral. Shortly after the interview, one of the engineers on the panel told me that they want to move forward with me but that I should hold tight for the official offer letter for a couple weeks as they are amidst a hiring freeze. I felt a huge sense of relief and excitement that I was finally going to land a position after months of despair. Fast forward a month later, I get an email from the recruiter that the position is no longer being filled. Needless to say, I felt absolutely crushed.This is especially demoralizing because I have never been this close to landing a position as I rarely get interviews. I get rejected or ghosted for pretty much every application I send out. I feel like recruiters are avoiding me like the plague. I suspect it is because they are prioritizing this year's batch of new grads for junior positions. This is making me feel like my window to get my foot in the door has closed.I have even applied to some IT, QA, and analyst positions but it seems like even those are hard to get these days, especially without certs. I have also been searching for internships but finding one that is also open to grads is extremely rare.Aside from applying, I have been LeetCoding, building projects, and filling in knowledge gaps using things like The Odin Project to learn full-stack development skills. I also recently finished a volunteering gig as a ""web developer"" but all I did was help build a site using a low-code website builder.I am getting the feeling that my family is getting tired of me freeloading, and I am running out of cash. So I am now trying to reassess my options and I am hoping to get some advice/anecdotes from people on here.Way I see it, I have the following options:1. Continue on the job search grind. But until when? I am running on fumes and I am getting very depressed from doing this, with little results to show. Maybe focus on non-SWE IT and analyst roles, but again finding a truly entry-level position that doesn’t require certs or experience is pretty rare.2. Go get a master's degree in CS. The ROI on this one is not clear at the moment and I am already in a decent amount of student debt from undergrad. But this does reset the clock and make me eligible for an internships again, and I will work really fucking hard to secure one. However, I am worried about my prospects, since I had a so and so GPA (3.4) and no research or work experience. I am also currently broke so funding the degree will be difficult, especially without all the recent funding cuts.3. Apply to the military as an officer. Stable employment but I still have to get in and I hear it's challenging for those outside of the military. Besides, this is not a very appealing option due to recent events and I will most likely not be doing any software engineering.4. Look for a non-tech job. I know that this will challenging as other job markets are also struggling. It hurts me to think that all my hard work on my CS degree will mean nothing and it feels like once I accept a non-tech related position, my chances of making it into this industry will officially become 0.

The environment is cutthroat, deadlines are unrealistic, and the infrastructure we depend on is poor. My manager is honestly quite incompetent there’s no real support or guidance.

I fully accept my mistake, but I can’t stop worrying about how this will reflect on me. With deadlines approaching, I’m terrified this will affect my performance review or even put me on a PIP.What’s making it worse is the exhaustion.

1oiio7v,How to make myself more competitive with projects? Impossible?,shade_blade,cscareerquestions,"I've kind of been losing my mind every day I'm not getting anything. It's about 99% of my applications that lead to nothing so it feels like I'm not competitive at all, it feels like I'm just wasting my life away. I've been spending pretty much all day every day applying or working on unpresentable projects but neither of those feel like they are doing anything. Even in the rare case I get a call or something I feel like my experience and projects aren't competitive either? I ask myself ""what do I have that puts me ahead of someone with X years of experience"" and I just have nothing at all.My experience is kind of a lost cause, I don't have good metrics for any of them and they were pretty subpar (last few years were working with stuff that isn't really CS related but I can't remove them or else it looks like I have a massive job gap and the system will reject me instantly.I don't have any ideas for projects I should be making that are exciting or will get me a job at all? I've been making a chess engine thing this past month but it doesn't feel like a real project so in effect it was a waste of time? I don't really have any exciting stories about how I solved a problem that no other person has ever solved anything like it, because it's just implementing various algorithms other people have already made and there is no difficulty to doing that? In terms of metrics it is pretty garbage, it can only search about 10k positions per second while a ""good"" chess engine can do several million per second easily.I don't know how to make something that isn't some random toy project, currently all my side projects are games where being a toy project is part of the point and there's only 1 class project that isn't a game and it probably doesn't count either as it has nothing in the way of metrics either. I don't really have motivation to try to make a banking website or something like that, because I know it isn't real so it will never have any real purpose and companies will see it as not fulfilling its purpose so it doesn't count?

I have been thinking about the possibility of receiving an offer for Hybrid work and genuinely I cannot decide if it would be worth it... going over some pros/cons:Pros: \- \*Big pay increase (140k All salary-> \~250k TC) \* Unsure about pay change after tax.. RSUs in Canada are taxed insanely \- Huge name on my resume \- Chance to learn some of the best software practices and learn from very smart peopleCons: \- Will likely have no WLB (from what I read online.. Stripe has the full PIP and stack rank culture) \- I feel like I am pretty much guaranteed to get burnt out within 1-2years \- Stock packages given as RSUs in Canada, which are taxed at 50% IIRC ... the increase in comp may not be as big as it would seem? \--- I would love some opinions.

1of0yyo,I may need to pivot ASAP. I need work life balance for future family planning.,crescentmoon101,cscareerquestions,"I was recently laid off and have applied to hundreds of jobs in the last couple of weeks. I have gotten very few responses, just a couple of local short-term contract jobs with no PTO (got ghosted for those roles too). I'm super early in my job search, so I know it might just take time to hear back from some companies.When I was laid off, I was trying to conceive with my husband for a couple of months, so this was a really bad time for me to lose my job. I have 3.5 years of experience working with mostly Vue and TypeScript. I did learn React at bootcamp and have been diving back into studying it since I know it's in higher demand. The thing is, I don't think I can mentally handle the grind in this field. When I first started out, I was hungry, driven, ambitious, and excited to code. I was extremely lucky to land a job 2 months after graduating from bootcamp, and tech was a lot easier to break into. Now I'm in my 30s, I want kids, and I don't have as much motivation to hustle.As much as I love coding, I don't love the concept of having to grind constantly when I want to focus on family building and family life. Just the process of getting through dev interviews feels insane right now. Grinding leetcode, memorizing a ton of system design questions, doing tons of projects to practice different technologies, going through several rounds of interviews, only to possibly get rejected at the last stage? And then maybe having to do it ALL over again if you get laid off a year or 2 later? I've been studying my ass off the past few weeks and it got me thinking, if I'm finding this super exhausting now with no kids, how the hell am I gonna do this again if I were to get laid off again with a toddler or 2? Yes I would of course have support from my husband, but I don't know if it's realistic for me personally to constantly be trying to hustle at work, hustle while being laid off, and be a parent to young children. I keep seeing posts from people who have been laid off multiple times in a year and the idea of having to go through the interview process more than once in a year sounds horrible.

1oenghg,Should I accept an RSU award with a 12-month non-compete,Valuable_Agent2905,cscareerquestions,"I recently received an RSU award from my company as recognition for strong performance this year. The catch is that it comes with a 12-month non-compete agreement, and I noticed that one of the FAANG companies is listed as a competitor.I’m currently planning to stay at my company for now, but my goal is to target FAANG roles (maybe within next 6 months or a year). I’m concerned that signing this might limit my future opportunities or complicate things if I decide to move.On the other hand, if I don’t accept the RSU, I’m worried it might raise red flags internally — like I’m being seen as a flight risk, which could hurt me during performance reviews or layoffs.So I’m torn, Should I accept the RSU and just deal with the non-compete later if it becomes an issue?Or should I reject it, and if so, how do I explain that professionally without making it sound like I’m planning to leave?Would love to hear how others have handled similar situations or what you’d do in my place.Edit:I’m in Illinois right now, but open to moving to the West Coast since that’s where most of the FAANG jobs are.",13,0.72,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oenghg/should_i_accept_an_rsu_award_with_a_12month/,2025-10-24 03:32:29,2025-10-31 01:39:15

1ogw7xp,"My brother (a non-dev) has an idea for a service he wants me to build, but I don't even have the first clue of what would be a fair way to charge for the work. Please help.",GreatestJakeEVR,cscareerquestions,"*Edit - Please Read!!*I'm sure grateful to all of you who took the time to speak with me about this, but guys, please, enough advice about my brother lol.I know it's a huge post and the lead gets a bit buried, but I need advice on how people value software services and how our industry tends to monitize services of this sort. It's so I can understand what things are proper for someone in my position to ask and what things I should give him. I don't just want us both to ""feel"" like we are being fair to each other, I need ways to go about valuing this stuff so we can both be comfortable with the deal we make lol. I don't need advice about going into business with my bro cuz both of us would just give the other what they want rather than let them believe they were getting screwed over. We are both much more likely to give too much away to avoid an issue than do the opposite. So having a way to put a value on this stuff and compare it to how businesses usually handle stuff like this would go a long way to ensuring we are both happy with the deal t years down the road.*Edit end*Before I explain what's going on let me start by saying my brother is probably the least greedy, most trustworthy person on this planet. So I'm not worried that he'll try to screw me over, its that I don't have any idea what would be a fair way to charge for something of this nature since it'll basically be entirely my creation from the ground up that is using the data he is supplying. So general advice on books to read or websites to go for advice on the best practices for deciding the monetary value of certain work or current industry practices for different types of work would also be welcome.# So here's what's happening:My brother has an idea for a service he wants to offer to the clients in his day job. Basically its a really confusing field and he wants to charge subscription access to his clients for a website that basically presents all this data for the client in plain English. This is a big deal because there are TONS of these JSON collections of rules and trust me, trying to figure it out from badly named JSON files with confusingly named key : value pairs is insanity. Presumably this info must have existed at one point, but that's kind of the thing: the whole system is so big and convoluted and there's no easily accessible source of info about it.The reason he contacted me is cuz he wants a program that can take these complicated collections of rules and make sense of them then put them on the internet somewhere so people can access a plain English description of the interactions and uses of them. # What's the issue?The issue is that I have a crazy amount of extremely varied experience I have that is allowing me to work on this solo and make something that will actually be a decent software. I've been so interested in data science and ML that I went back for my second bachelor's degree because of it I was certified in TensorFlow years ago, and have been using ChatGPT since before it was the the all-accessible great-god-genie that it is today. You used to have to apply for it by submitting how you planned to use it back when it was still in its infant stages.Anyway its a ton of school,, internship, job, and hobby work that I've done that's put me in a position where I know I can solo build this entire thing for sure. I've already created a model that ""seems"" to be able to pull this off. (I have no idea if its correct cuz its not my field, but my bro says the ones I showed him appear to be mostly correct. Obviously its gonna take a good bit of fine tuning, but I'm not worried in the least that this is going to work out.)So basically I'm going to be 100% making all the decisions of how to design and code and use the models, code and organize all the data collection and storage on the backend, and code all the website design, and do the hosting, testing, CI/CD etc. Every bit of the software that powers this whole endeavor is going to be made by me.# So what the F'ing F is fair for me to ask for as compensation?I don't like the idea of just charging an hourly wage and having to give up something that is all my work. But also I have no intentions or desire to screw my brother on this either. I'm only getting this opportunity cuz he knows me and has the insight to know this is something that his clients would be very happy to have.Also the amount of hours I'll put in is not equal to the amount of work that I'm getting done. A lot of the work is going to be done in the background as my software goes through all this data and creates useful output that's then organized in a way that it can all be dumped in a database and easily retrieved through a site made with Django.Oh and there's multiple clients each with their own sets of rules and things so finding a way to make my database schema universal (or as close to universal as possible) between clients is going to go a long way to prevent me from having to hardcode all of these for each client by hand. The idea is if he picks up another client, we can just dump the data to my system and it will parse it, decode it, and add it all to the database (and through the magic of Django, create a whole bunch of webpages using that data that don't have to be coded by hand).So please, if you have experience working on anything like this or working for a company deciding what to charge clients or know any ways I could learn about that I could really use the info.I've always worked for someone else at an hourly wage, so I have no idea how what to do otherwise. I just don't feel like being paid an hourly wage to work on this is fair. And I'd have no idea how to even figure out how much of a percentage to ask for if I want to split the profits from the subscription sales.",12,0.63,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogw7xp/my_brother_a_nondev_has_an_idea_for_a_service_he/,2025-10-26 21:16:17,2025-10-31 01:39:15

Just sharing my thoughts and if anyone has anything to offer it is welcomed. Working with Java, total experience now is 4+ years. Short version:* Changed role accepting a pay reduction of 7% in new company.* 5 months in I got a 2,27% raise.* I got my MSc in CS.* 1year+2months later I accepted to talk about a role in new company just to get an assessment of what could my value be in the marketplace.* Without even trying hard I got an offer that comes with an increase in seniority and 25% in compensation.* It is too good to pass but I am feeling bad about leaving my team, it is not their fault. Longer version:* I quit last July due to conflicts with new tech lead manager in team. I didn't want to be a bad employee so I left. He didn't even care. * Got an offer in 2 weeks for a total of 7% less yearly compensation of my previous role and NOTE for a fintech company.* I was expecting a 2-times per year salary re-negotiation but policy changed.* I got a 2,26% salary increase last January.* I was promised a better raise this year.* I worked my ass off to evolve more. Almost finished my MSc in CS.* I accepted to talk about a new offer ONCE and without even trying they accessed my skill was worth a 25% increase in salary and a seniority role - I get to mentor entry/juniors.* It is 100% better choice for me to leave, but feeling remorse cause my current team which are great people will get destroyed. Some more notes for the company:1. Year closed with 50% profit increase.2. New offices in new city3. New AI team and hired like 20 ( I am assuming expensive ) AI engineers over they year.4. Developer left team in January, I got his workload - no salary increase, never got a replacement.5. Team got 3 new projects in September.6. Core developer was owed 200 hours of overtime and eventually instead of paying they gave him a 4 day work week for the next few months..... SAD?SUMMARY; Τo me it feels like in this company my worth is less and it gets depicted in salary. Company will try to match offer only because they are in dire position. I don't think this much of a raise would be ever considered. This means they don't value me as they should or my worth is less here and I will be better of switching anyway.

1ojln3d,Imposter syndrome or genuinely just suck?,GaslightingGreenbean,cscareerquestions,"Hello all, me again!So….I’m like a little over a year in as a dev in my stack. I won’t lie, I relied heavily on ai to get my work done for the past year. This sprint I realized that for tasks I consider to be really complex, it’s even faster if I take baby steps and reason through it while using ai to fill any knowledge gaps or bridge my memory. But man… today I watched a senior do in an hour what I couldn’t do in five hours. And it wasn’t even his story, it was mine. He just reasoned through it and based off my explanations actually gave me a working solution to something that was really stressing me out. Like this was a story that our team considered max complexity points wise, but I’m still. Then I heard my manager talking about how I should be doing all my points and each point is like only a certain number of hours and how I should still have hours left over. I’m like, how can I know ahead of time how many hours a task will take me if I find things out mid sprint?And I’m like man… watching people do so effortlessly what takes me ages is honestly kinda painful. Like I almost shed a tear today because I was like “bro this is too much I can’t do this and the deadlines soon…” and I’m honestly tired of feeling stressed and angry over development work. And even if I end up with a working solution, it isn’t “clean”, like it isn’t up to par and my tech lead might just be like “redo this.” I get juniors have a learning curve. I get that. But it’s been a year. I had my old tech lead say 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you at this point” because I did a story incorrectly and he caught it near the end of the sprint. He always said I struggled or asked about simple things and give poor feedback to my manager on how I need to much help often. I can’t remember what’s inside an object and how that object matches to this list with this key blah blah my brain just for some reason cannot reason through it like other people can.It’s gotten to the point where not only am I not taking a portion of the sprint for stories and a portion for whatever else like my manager expects, but I’m working at night, on weekends, I even sometimes would log in on a pto day to ask a question, and I’d often struggle to the point where it would feel like I get nothing doneI just don’t know what’s going on or how to move forward with this. I never wanted to stay a dev, I always wanted to move to the business side, but I’m a dev now so I have to at least do the best I can in this role. I know I won’t stay a dev, but since I’m a dev now, what is going on here? Like, I just don’t understand what’s happening with me? Imposter syndrome or just not competent to do the work?Btw: I usually never cause carry over or defects, 95% of my stories are accepted.

1oiyzjl,"Made What I’d Consider My First Big Mistake While Working, How Bad Is It?",JtReso,cscareerquestions,"One of my first tasks ever was creating a script that moves folders around when a column of data (let's say C) changes. The manager who gave me the job told me that there was a rule that won't ever be broken at our company. That is column C will always be set to A or B and that we can use that logic to determine where to move folders to. Like an idiot I checked exactly A or B and didn't have any other checks. My manager was let go somewhere down the line and I completely forgot about this script. Not too long ago an office worker complained that they cannot find some of our files from their PC but they can through our site. So it turns out when you set column C to something other than A or B all of our projects that rely on the data still work (because I add a unique identifier file in each that we use to search instead of path thankfully) but internal office workers can't see it directly anymore because they were moved. Someone in leadership made the decision to expand the options for column C. Without my manager here to identify that went against the systems he had us design, they just went with it. So what happens is if a row of data has certain settings and column C is changed to something other than A or B, an automation triggers the script that moves ALL related folders to an unrelated folder (that is not always the same as the last record). One instance was like 10 folders but another was like 10,000 folders. I.T. was able to move things back fairly quickly because we keep a history of movement but one guy was really mad because he thought one of the developers deleted some of our stuff. Dude was essentially yelling at me already when we didn't even fully know the cause yet. I at first didn't think it was related to us but after doing my research and finding the script, I realized it was me specifically so he was kind of right. I told them and fixed it of course. How bad is this? I feel pretty bad because checking just A or B and not having a specific fallback and other checks to make is pretty egregious. I also am not a fan of getting yelled at. I also don't like the idea of defending myself by telling them to wait until we know for sure, and then confirming they were partially right.

A little background is I was enlisted for 6 years, got my bachelors in business then transitioned out into a BDR role. That company was a mess but I was recruited via linkedin to do back-end work for our sales team at a data center. First year was great! Networked well and learned a lot, then our teams got split into specific roles for different tasks. During this time I was asking heavily for SOP's since we already didn't have many and our scope of work was actually still expanding since data centers are booming with AI. Was promised some but never happened.Got a new manager that's been there for years and shes buddy buddy with our boss. Thought I was doing great, been on the team for almost a year and started showing a lot of improvement in July until now. 1 on 1s were shorter. Got some feedback on things I needed to correct but it was happening less and less. Out of the blue I get hit with this PIP last week. Still dont have SOP's but told im making too many mistakes. I currently have the second most cases managed but told my ""numbers are low"". No proof of the numbers and no verified measure of success for our team. HR asks me not to record the PIP but I did on my phone for my defense. I show all the improvement and the fact I do just as much as everyone else (its really not that intensive of a job we only get a few cases a week and I try to grab my fair share). But even with all my proof and documentation, the 8 mistakes I've made in the last few months apparently warrant a PIP (same mistakes my team members have and STILL are making currently). Manager is now OOO but pip gives vague KPI's which amount to ""make less mistakes and do more work"". No numbers no percentages just ""do better"".I know holidays are a terrible time to job search and I feel like linkedin doesn't even work anymore. I'm really nervous for what I'm going to do here. Any advice is appreciated.\[Side note\] \- I'm the only guy on my team \- I've documented a lot of the short comings of other teams and our systems (Ex: SOP's not having been updated since 2023, multi day delays in replies) \- Old manager says somebody on their team got hired that they want to throw out but they cant and his bosses boss came down on everyone hard about being able to get rid of people.

1ojyeap,Worried current job is limiting future prospects,ElectricTeddyBear,cscareerquestions,"I have been in my current position for about a year, and it's my first job out of college. I am the only 'dev' on the team. I don't have a senior, but there are a couple people doing dev works on different teams in the same building. Most of my work has felt like toy projects. I have mainly been responsible for tool development and data processing. Some examples: maintaining and making new tables for our database (there's talk of redesigning the whole db), writing a basic script people run to keep files standardized, porting our data processing scripts to another group's system, making tableaus and designing KPIs for random manager requests, and my latest is modifying one of our main C# programs to accommodate another group (and whatever other changes have built up over time).It all sounds well and good, but my concern is that I don't have any oversight and that everything seems to fall in the toy project category. None of the code I've written has been complicated, and there have been libraries for everything. I don't have a senior to call me an idiot and ask why I did things a certain way - the only metric I have is whether the tool I made works and whether I did it fast enough for people not to ask again. The point of this post is to ask what I should do to mitigate that. What can I do to move into a pure dev role after this (I'm a test engineer and have that workload on top of my dev stuff). I'm worried that I'm 'poisoning the well' by getting light dev experience without any guide. I am worried that I will essentially still be entry level as long as I stay here.

1oicqyf,"Senior Developer offer, but my dev experience is actually Jr/Mid. What should I do?",Chengue-Morales,cscareerquestions,"I've been working at my company for almost 10 years, and I'm a senior in a role that's a mix of Product Owner and Developer. The thing is, my seniority in this role is more due to my time working in support and consulting, where I worked for 6 years with the product before moving to my current position. I only started programming about 3 years ago, without a degree in the field, and dividing my time with the PO part of the job.I wanted to experience a full-time developer position in a larger scope than my current one, and I started sending out resumes for internal positions. Incredibly, I got an offer for a senior developer position for a completely different product within the same company, in an industry I have zero knowledge of. I applied for other mid-level positions, but this was the first one I received an offer for.The selection process was easy and quick, and I think the people didn't realize that my actual developer experience is quite short. I think they saw I had a senior tier and skipped technical questions about the stack and previous technical experiences, focusing instead on behavior and logic.I know it will sound like imposter syndrome, but sometimes it's not just a syndrome, right? I'm terrified of accepting the position and ending up fired if I can't deliver what they ask for in the first few months. Financially, I should receive about a 30% increase if I accept.Has anyone been in a similar situation or knows of stories of similar situations? I usually learn quickly, but I know that seniority in development isn't earned overnight. I'm even considering scheduling a meeting with the manager to explain the situation and try to align expectations, possibly reducing the seniority/salary initially to reduce the risk of dismissal, but I know that might seem like a red flag to the manager.

I've been there ~1.5 years now, and at the beginning, I really enjoyed it. Everyone on my team is kind, my manager is very supportive, and while WLB was rough, I thought I could manage it. I could care less about the work that I'm doing too, but that's probably the case for most people anyway. In the beginning, I was performing well and received a promotion at the 1 year mark, but since then, it feels like my performance has quickly gone downhill. I've had several meetings with my manager discussing my potential and how to improve my metrics. Received advice from senior eng on how to work faster. Watched projects get passed to new hires since I'm no longer reliable. I completely agree with the negative feedback I've received. I wouldn't even be surprised if I get fired during my next performance review.And it's not that the work's become too difficult after the promotion either (I'm doing similar work as before). It's just that everyday I work feels like a little part of me is suffocating. It's gotten so bad that I've been daydreaming about when I worked retail jobs on night shifts during college (legitimately think that was more enjoyable for me than this job). I don't know if I'm just not built for a corporate job. The tight deadlines, horrible WLB, constant comparisons with coworkers, etc. All of it has been causing me so much stress, and my health has gone to hell this year because of it I think.

Do I try to push through this feeling to keep my job or should I start job hunting?3. Should I try to switch career fields if I do look for new employment? 4.

The point is— should I have been upset or annoyed at all?There’s been a few instances over the past 5 years where I stayed up at night thinking of people’s actions and comments. I feel like nearly all of the comments and actions were justified, so I think I’m just too emotional and sensitive. I shared some of these with friends, and they all say I’m not being too sensitive, but I also almost never hear them complaining about anything like this (their complaints are usually of the shape “my managers putting me on a dead end project” or “my manager is not acknowledging my contributions”)Curious how people would react in any of the circumstances:* When I was a junior with 2 yoe, I wrote a cl and sent it to someone I’ve been working with, and he scheduled a 1:1 to talk about it. During the meeting, he gave some helpful (but maybe controversial? My tl didn’t agree with the final shape of the cl) advice, but at the same time he was laughing at my code and asking why I did this, and that Im surely smarter than him because I graduated from Caltech. I think I didn’t have a good reason beside it made sense to me. * I switched companies after just over 2.5 years. After about 10 months , my manager told me that my growth trajectory isn’t as good as , and that I’d benefit from more local mentorship (the brain of the project is in hongkong, as was my manager. I’m based in the us)* A manager some levels above me mentioned that he’d rather work with smart assholes than people who are nice but slightly incompetent. (Though to be clear, we’re not hiring either)* My manager is also an IC (he only manages me), and he was the main reviewer for a cl I worked on. Another coworker left a comment and I tried to talk to my manager about these comments first. He cut me off both times. The first time was me saying oh “triggers are a good idea”, and he replied. “Yeah yeah, I saw his comment”. The second time was “are you available at 2:30? I…” “I have a meeting then”. I ask dumb questions so it’s pretty normal to get cut off, but what really annoyed me was securing our 1:1 the next day, he ask what triggers are.(I told this interaction to another younger coworker, and his response was I shouldn’t be emotional at work and that I should talk to my manager, which I did do weeks ago.)",6,0.6,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogrt0k/how_do_you_avoid_being_emotional_at_work/,2025-10-26 18:19:50,2025-10-31 01:39:15
1ogreua,"Recently graduated, feeling like a complete fraud. Where do I even start to improve?",allnamest4k3n,cscareerquestions,"Hey,I graduated from an OK university in Europe with a 3.1 GPA, so not good but not bad either. However, as I have started applying for jobs and from reading discussions on CS related forums (such as here), I have started feeling like a complete fraud. I feel like I know a little bit about a lot, but when I read posts on here I'm seeing terms I have never in my life seen before, and they are thrown around as if it were common knowledge.I feel like my lack of real skills is making it impossible for me to find a junior position; recruiters look at my CV and just discard it because there is nothing about it that stands out in any positive ways.But I do *love* CS and programming, so I'm committed to making this work somehow. I think I need to seriously improve on my core CS skills, but also programming skills, probably by going deep on some specific stack or framework.But man, I have *no clue* where to begin. It feels as if there is an ocean of things that I need to learn before I can even be considered as a serious junior candidate. I dont even know where to begin. I'm currently learning more about infrastructure (self-hosting really) by developing some fairly basic LLM wrappers to make job searching and application easier, and so I'm learning about hosting apps via Docker on remote servers, as well as setting up proper CI/CD pipelines. But even then, this is a miniscule thing and—I dont think—of any interest to any employers. There's also the AI BS, making it feel mega inefficient to do anything by hand (and actually trying to learn), as opposed to just vibing some slop out.I dont know, what do I even do? I'm thinking of doing my masters in CS come next year if I cant find anything, but I dont really have any particular interest in CS research and it would just amount to kicking the can down the road. I'm also fine like really doubling down on trying to improve core CS skills if that is what's missing to get a job, but I dont think an employer gives a damn about me knowing my DS&As.What do I do?",7,0.68,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogreua/recently_graduated_feeling_like_a_complete_fraud/,2025-10-26 18:04:28,2025-10-31 01:39:15
