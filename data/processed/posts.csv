1nh9mnk,"[Experience] Amazon Data Engineer Inter view (L5, 2025)",Ok-Code3908,dataengineering,"Hey all, I just finished my Amazon Data Engineer Inter view loop recently (and got the offer ). Since I noticed a lot of outdated info online, thought I’d share how the process looked for me and what concepts are worth preparing. Hopefully this helps someone grinding through prep.**Process Overview** **Recruiter Screen (30 min)** Role fit + background discussion. One or two simple SQL/Python checks.**Technical Phone Screens (75 min each)** Mostly SQL and Python/ETL. Not just solving, but also follow-ups on query optimization and edge cases. Each screen also tested one Leadership Principle (LP) (mine were Dive Deep and Deliver Results).**Onsite / Virtual Loop (3–5 rounds, 60 min each)** SQL Deep Dive → joins, windows, Top-K, rolling averages. Coding / ETL Design → handling messy/late data, retries, streaming vs batch. Data Modeling → fact/dim schema, partitions, SCDs, trade-offs in Redshift/S3/Spark. Manager + Bar Raiser → critical rounds. Heavy mix of technical judgment + LPs. These carry a lot of weight in the final decision.LPs are central across all rounds. Prep STAR stories for Dive Deep, Deliver Results, Insist on Highest Standards, Are Right A Lot, Customer Obsession.**Concepts / Questions to Prepare** **SQL** Window functions (ROW\_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD). Complex joins, CTEs, subqueries. Aggregations + grouping, rolling averages, time-based calcs. Growth/churn queries (YoY, MoM).**Python / ETL** Flattening nested JSON/lists. Real-time sliding window averages. Deduplication by key + timestamp. Batch pipeline design with late data handling.**Data Modeling** Orders/transactions schema with fact/dim and SCD for Prime status. Clickstream/session schema with partitions. Star vs snowflake schema, warehouse trade-offs.**Leadership Principles (LPs)** Dive Deep: Debugging a broken pipeline under pressure. Deliver Results: Handling a P0 deadline. Highest Standards: Raising quality standards despite deadlines. Invent & Simplify: Automating repetitive workflows.**My Takeaways** Amazon DE evaluations are 50% technical and 50% LPs. SQL/Python prep is not enough — LP storytelling is equally important. Manager + Bar Raiser rounds are the toughest and usually decide the outcome.That’s my experience. If you’re preparing, don’t underestimate the LP side of it — it’s just as important as SQL/Python.

1nhykbt,Am I the only one who seriously hates Pandas?,yourAvgSE,dataengineering,"I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert in Python DE. It's actually something I recently started because most of my experience was in Scala.But I've had to use Pandas sporadically in the past 5 years and recently at my current company some of the engineers/DS have been selecting Pandas for some projects/quick scriptsAnd I just hate it, tbh. I'm trying to get rid of it wherever I see it/Have the chance to.Performance-wise, I don't think it is crazy. If you're dealing with BigData, you should be using other frameworks to handle the load, and if you're not, I think that regular Python (especially now that we're at 3.13 and a lot of FP features have been added to it) is already very efficient.Usage-Wise, this is where I hate it.It's needlessly complex and overengineered. Honestly, when working with Spark or Beam, the API is super easy to understand and it's also very easy to get the basic block/model of the framework and how to build upon it. Pandas DataFrame on the other hand is so ridiculously complex that I feel I'm constantly reading about it without grasping how it works. Maybe that's on me, but I just don't feel it is intuitive. The basic functionality is super barebones, so you have to configure/transform a bunch of things.Today I was working on migrating/scaling what should have been a quick app to fetch some JSON data from an API and instead of just being a simple parsing of a python dict and writing a JSON file with sanitized data, I had to do like 5 transforms to: normalize the json, get rid of invalid json values like NaN, make it so that every line actually represents one row, re-set missing columns for schema consistency, rename columns to get rid of invalid dot notation.It just felt like so much work, I ended up scraping Pandas altogether and just building a function to recursively traverse and sanitize a dict and it worked just as well.I know at the end of the day it's probably just me not being super sharp on Pandas theory, but it just feels like a bloat at this point",266,0.87,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nhykbt/am_i_the_only_one_who_seriously_hates_pandas/,2025-09-15 21:21:08,2025-09-18 01:24:11
1nfxgze,How I Built a Hash Join 2x Faster Than DuckDB with 400 Lines of Code,Motor_Crew7918,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering I recently open-sourced a high-performance Hash Join implementation in C++ called flash\_hash\_join. In my benchmarks, it shows exceptional performance in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios, running up to **2x faster** than DuckDB, one of the top-tier vectorized engines out there.**GitHub Repo:** [**https://github.com/conanhujinming/flash\_hash\_join**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconanhujinming%2Fflash_hash_join)This post isn't a simple tutorial. I want to do a deep dive into the optimization techniques I used to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the CPU, along with the lessons I learned along the way. The core philosophy is simple: align software behavior with the physical characteristics of the hardware.# Macro-Architecture: Unpartitioned vs. Radix-PartitionedThe first major decision in designing a parallel hash join is how to organize data for concurrent processing.The industry-standard approach is the **Radix-Partitioned Hash Join**. It uses the high-order bits of a key's hash to pre-partition data into independent buckets, which are then processed in parallel by different threads. It's a ""divide and conquer"" strategy that avoids locking. DuckDB uses this architecture.However, a fantastic paper from TUM in SIGMOD 2021 showed that on modern multi-core CPUs, a well-designed **Unpartitioned** concurrent hash table can often outperform its Radix-Partitioned counterpart.The reason is that Radix Partitioning has its own overhead:1. **Materialization Cost**: It requires an extra pass over the data to compute hashes and write tuples into various partition buffers, consuming significant memory bandwidth.2. **Skew Vulnerability**: A non-ideal hash function or skewed data can lead to some partitions becoming much larger than others, creating a bottleneck and ruining load balancing.I implemented and tested both approaches, and my results confirmed the paper's findings: **the Unpartitioned design was indeed faster**. It eliminates the partitioning pass, allowing all threads to directly build and probe a single shared, thread-safe hash table, leading to higher overall CPU and memory efficiency.# Micro-Implementation: A Hash Table Built for SpeedWith the Unpartitioned architecture chosen, the next challenge was to design an extremely fast, thread-safe hash table. My implementation is a fusion of the following techniques:**1. The Core Algorithm: Linear Probing** This is the foundation of performance. Unlike chaining, which resolves collisions by chasing pointers, linear probing stores all data in a single, contiguous array. On a collision, it simply checks the next adjacent slot. This memory access pattern is incredibly cache-friendly and maximizes the benefits of CPU prefetching.**2. Concurrency: Shard Locks + CAS** To allow safe concurrent access, a single global lock would serialize execution. My solution is **Shard Locking** (or Striped Locking). Instead of one big lock, I create an array of many smaller locks (e.g., 2048). A thread selects a lock based on the key's hash: lock\_array\[hash(key) % 2048\]. Contention only occurs when threads happen to touch keys that hash to the same lock, enabling massive concurrency.**3. Memory Management: The Arena Allocator** The build-side hash table in a join has a critical property: **it's append-only**. Once the build phase is done, it becomes a read-only structure. This allows for an extremely efficient memory allocation strategy: the **Arena Allocator**. I request a huge block of memory from the OS once, and subsequent allocations are nearly free—just a simple pointer bump. This completely eliminates malloc overhead and memory fragmentation.**4. The Key Optimization: 8-bit Tag Array** A potential issue with linear probing is that even after finding a matching hash, you still need to perform a full (e.g., 64-bit) key comparison to be sure. To mitigate this, I use a parallel tag array of uint8\_ts. When inserting, I store the low 8 bits of the hash in the tag array. During probing, the check becomes a two-step process: first, check the cheap 1-byte tag. Only if the tag matches do I proceed with the expensive full key comparison. Since a single cache line can hold 64 tags, this step filters out the vast majority of non-matching slots at incredible speed.**5. Hiding Latency: Software Prefetching** The probe phase is characterized by random memory access, a primary source of cache misses. To combat this, I use **Software Prefetching**. The idea is to ""tell"" the CPU to start loading data that will be needed in the near future. As I process key i in a batch, I issue a prefetch instruction for the memory location that key i+N (where N is a prefetch distance like 4 or 8) is likely to access: \_mm\_prefetch((void\*)&table\[hash(keys\[i+N\])\], \_MM\_HINT\_T0); While the CPU is busy with the current key, the memory controller works in the background to pull the future data into the cache. By the time we get to key i+N, the data is often already there, effectively hiding main memory latency.**6. The Final Kick: Hardware-Accelerated Hashing** Instead of a generic library like xxhash, I used a function that leverages hardware instructions: uint64_t hash32(uint32_t key, uint32_t seed) { uint64_t k = 0x8648DBDB; uint32_t crc = _mm_crc32_u32(seed, key); return crc * ((k << 32) + 1); }The \_mm\_crc32\_u32 is an **Intel SSE4.2 hardware instruction**. It's absurdly fast, executing in just a few clock cycles. While its collision properties are theoretically slightly worse than xxhash, for the purposes of a hash join, the raw speed advantage is overwhelming.# The Road Not Taken: Optimizations That Didn't WorkNot all good ideas survive contact with a benchmark. Here are a few ""great"" optimizations that I ended up abandoning because they actually hurt performance.* **SIMD Probing**: I tried using AVX2 to probe 8 keys in parallel. However, hash probing is the definition of random memory access. The expensive **Gather** operations required to load disparate data into SIMD registers completely negated any computational speedup. SIMD excels with contiguous data, which is the opposite of what's happening here.* **Bloom Filters**: A bloom filter is great for quickly filtering out probe keys that definitely don't exist in the build table. This is a huge win in **low-hit-rate** scenarios. My benchmark, however, had a high hit rate, meaning most keys found a match. The bloom filter couldn't filter much, so it just became pure overhead—every key paid the cost of an extra hash and memory lookup for no benefit.* **Grouped Probing**: This technique involves grouping probe keys by their hash value to improve cache locality. However, the ""grouping"" step itself requires an extra pass over the data. In my implementation, where memory access was already heavily optimized with linear probing and prefetching, the cost of this extra pass outweighed the marginal cache benefits it provided.# ConclusionThe performance of flash\_hash\_join doesn't come from a single silver bullet. It's the result of a combination of synergistic design choices:* **Architecture**: Choosing the more modern, lower-overhead Unpartitioned model.* **Algorithm**: Using cache-friendly Linear Probing.* **Concurrency**: Minimizing contention with Shard Locks.* **Memory**: Managing allocation with an Arena and hiding latency with Software Prefetching.* **Details**: Squeezing performance with tag arrays and hardware-accelerated hashing.Most importantly, this entire process was **driven by relentless benchmarking**. This allowed me to quantify the impact of every change and be ruthless about cutting out ""optimizations"" that were beautiful in theory but useless in practice.I hope sharing my experience was insightful. If you're interested in the details, I'd love to discuss them here.Note: my implementation is mainly insipred by this excellent blog: [https://cedardb.com/blog/simple\_efficient\_hash\_tables/](https://cedardb.com/blog/simple_efficient_hash_tables/)",146,0.92,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nfxgze/how_i_built_a_hash_join_2x_faster_than_duckdb/,2025-09-13 13:26:23,2025-09-18 01:24:11

1nhmwcw,We Treat Our Entire Data Warehouse Config as Code. Here's Our Blueprint with Terraform.,Mafixo,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, Wanted to share an approach we've standardized for managing our data stacks that has saved us from a ton of headaches: treating the data warehouse itself as a version-controlled, automated piece of infrastructure, just like any other application. The default for many teams is still to manage things like roles, permissions, and warehouses by clicking around in the Snowflake/BigQuery UI. It's fast for a one-off change, but it's a recipe for disaster. It's not auditable, not easily repeatable across environments, and becomes a huge mess as the team grows.We adopted a strict Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model for this using Terraform. I wrote a blog post that breaks down our exact blueprint. If you're still managing your DWH by hand or looking for a more structured way to do it, the post might give you some useful ideas.Full article here: [https://blueprintdata.xyz/blog/modern-data-stack-iac-with-terraform](https://blueprintdata.xyz/blog/modern-data-stack-iac-with-terraform) Curious to hear how other teams are handling this.

1netgod,Bucketing vs. Z-Ordering for large table joins: What's the best strategy and why?,Then_Difficulty_5617,dataengineering,"I'm working on optimizing joins between two very large tables (hundreds of millions of records each) in a data lake environment. I know that bucketing and Z-ordering are two popular techniques for improving join performance by reducing data shuffling, but I'm trying to understand which is the better choice in practice.Based on my research, here’s a quick summary of my understanding:* **Bucketing** uses a hash function on the join key to pre-sort data into a fixed number of buckets. It's great for equality joins but can lead to small files if not managed well. It also doesn't work with Delta Lake, as I understand.* **Z-Ordering** uses a space-filling curve to cluster similar data together, which helps with data skipping and, by extension, joins. It’s more flexible, works with multiple columns, and helps with file sizing via the `OPTIMIZE` command.My main use case is joining these two tables on a single high-cardinality `customer_id` column.Given this, I have a few questions for the community:1. For a simple, high-cardinality equality join, is Z-ordering as effective as bucketing?2. Are there scenarios where bucketing would still outperform Z-ordering, even if you have to manage the small file problem?3. What are some of the key practical considerations you've run into when choosing between these two methods for large-scale joins?I'm looking for real-world experiences and insights beyond the documentation.

Each master data view with some data object to evaluate calls one or more of these functions and writes the result in a new column on the view itself (e.g. ""dq\_validity\_website"").7. These views get loaded into PowerBI for data owners that can check on the quality of their data.8. I experimented with something like a score that aggregates all 500 or what columns with ""dq\_validity"" in the data warehouse. This is a stored procedure that writes the results of all these functions with a timestamp every day into a table to display in PBI as well (in order to have some idea whether data quality improves or not). \-----Example Function ""Website"":\---SET ANSI\_NULLS ONSET QUOTED\_IDENTIFIER ON/\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Function: \[bpu\].\[fn\_IsValidWebsite\]Purpose: Validates a website URL using basic pattern checks.Returns: VARCHAR(30) – 'Valid', 'Empty', 'InvalidFormat', or 'InvalidPlaceholder'Limitations: SQL Server doesn't support full regex.

1ne6jki,Postgres/MySQL migration to Snowflake,maxbranor,dataengineering,"Hello folks, I'm a data engineer at a tech company in Norway. We have terabytes of operational data, coming mostly from IoT devices (all internal, nothing 3rd-party dependent). Analytics and Operational departments consume this data which is - mostly - stored in Postgres and MySQL databases in AWS. Tale as old as time: what served really well for the past years, now is starting to slow down (queries that timeout, band-aid solutions made by the developer team to speed up queries, complex management of resources in AWS, etc). Given that the company is doing quite well and we are expanding our client base a lot, there's a need to have a more modern (or at least better-performant) architecture to serve our data needs. Since no one was really familiar with modern data platforms, they hired only me (I'll be responsible for devising our modernization strategy and mapping the needed skillset for further hires - which I hope happens soon :D ) My strategy is to pick one (or a few) use cases and showcase the value that having our data in Snowflake would bring to the company. Thus, I'm working on a PoC migration strategy (Important note: the management is already convinced that migration is probably a good idea - so this is more a discussion on strategy). My current plan is to migrate a few of our staging postgres/mysql datatables to s3 as parquet files (using aws dms), and then copy those into Snowflake. Given that I'm the only data engineer atm, I choose Snowflake due to my familiarity with it and due to its simplicity (also the reason I'm not thinking on dealing with Iceberg in external stages and decided to go for Snowflake native format)My comments / questions are \- Any pitfalls that I should be aware when performing a data migration via AWS DMS? \- Our postgres/mysql datatabases are actually being updated constantly via en event-driven architecture. How much of a problem can that be for the migration process? (The updating is not necessarily only append-operations, but often older rows are modified) \- Given the point above: does it make much of a difference to use provided instances or serverless for DMS? \- General advice on how to organize my parquet files system for bullet-proofing for full-scale migration in the future? (Or should I not think about it atm?) Any insights or comments from similar experiences are welcomed :)",7,0.72,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ne6jki/postgresmysql_migration_to_snowflake/,2025-09-11 11:42:26,2025-09-18 01:24:11

1nfz6id,How do you figure out relationships between database tables when no ERD or documentation exists?,FalseCartographer168,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I wanted to get some feedback from people who work with databases and data pipelines regularly.# The ProblemIn a lot of real-world projects (especially data migrations, warehouse integrations, or working with client-provided dumps), I often receive a set of **database tables with only column names and maybe some sample data — but no ERD, no constraints, no documentation**.For example:* I might get 50–100 tables dumped from SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL.* Columns have names like `cust_id`, `c_id`, `customerID`, `fk_cust` spread across tables.* Foreign key constraints are either missing or never set up.* Sometimes I also get a CSV or JSON with sample data, but that’s it.Manually figuring out how these tables connect is time-consuming:* Which `id` in one table maps to which column in another?* Which columns are just lookups vs. actual relationships?* Which ones are “fake” similarities (like `code` columns that don’t really connect)?I end up doing a mix of manual joins, searching for overlapping values, and asking business users — but it’s not scalable.# My Approach (experimental)1. **Column Name Matching:** Use fuzzy string matching (manually) to catch things like `cust_id` ≈ `customerID`.2. **Data Overlap:** Sample distinct values from columns and see if they overlap (e.g., 70% of values in one column appear in another).3. **Weighted Confidence:** Combine name similarity + overlap + datatype compatibility into a score (e.g., strong match if name & overlap both high).4. **Visualization:** generate a graph view (like a partial ERD) that shows “probable” relationships.It’s not 100% accurate, but in testing I can get \~60–70% of relationships guessed correctly, which is a good starting point before manual validation.# My Question to You* How do *you* usually solve this problem today when no documentation or foreign keys exist?* Do you rely on scripts, BI tools, schema crawlers, or just manual detective work?* If you had such a tool, what features would make it actually useful in your day-to-day (e.g., synonym dictionaries, CSV upload, integration with ERD tools, etc.)?* Do you see this as a real pain point, or just an occasional annoyance not worth automating?I’d really appreciate your insights :folded_hands: — even if your answer is “we don’t face this problem often.”",7,0.63,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nfz6id/how_do_you_figure_out_relationships_between/,2025-09-13 14:40:41,2025-09-18 01:24:11

1nifuaj,AI platforms with observability - comparison,ShakyCucumber,dataengineering,"**TL;DR*** nexos.ai provides unified dashboard, real-time cost alerts, and sharable assistants.* Langfuse is extremely robust and allows deep tracing while remaining free and open-source and you can either self host it or use their Cloud hosting.* Portkey is a bundle with gateway, routing, and additional observability utilities. Great for developers, less so for non-tech-savvy users.* Arize Phoenix offers enterprise-grade features like statistical drift detection and model health scores.**Why did I even bother writing this?**I found a couple of other Reddit posts that have compared AI orchestration platforms, but couldn’t find any list that would go over the exact things I was interested in. The company I work for (SMBish/SMEish?) is looking for something that will make it easier for us to manage multiple LLM subs, without having to build a whole system on our own. Hence, I’ve spent some time trying out the available options and put together a list.**Platforms****nexos.ai**Quick take: A single page allows me to see things like: token usage, token usage per model, total cost, cost per model, completions, completion rates, completion errors, etc. Another page lets me adjust the guardrails for specific teams and users, as well as share custom Assistants between accounts.*Pros** I can manage teams, set up available language models, fallbacks, add users to the team with role-based access, and create API keys for specific teams.* Cost alert messages, so we don’t blow our budget in a week.* Built-in sharing allows us to share assistants between different teams/departments.* It has an API gateway.*Cons** They seem to be pretty fresh to the market.**Langfuse**Quick take: captures every prompt/response pair, latency, and token count. Great support for different languages, SDKs available for Python, Node, and Go.*Pros** Open-source! In theory this should reduce the cost if self-hosted.* The A/B testing feature is awesome.*Cons** It’s open-source, so we’ll see how it goes.**Portkey**Quick take: API gateway, guardrails, logs and usage metrics, plug-and-play routing. Very robust UI*Pros** Rate-limit controls, auto-retries, pretty good at handling busy hours and heavy traffic.* Robust logging features.* Dev-centric UI.*Cons** Dev-centric UI, some of our non-tech-savvy team members found it rather difficult to navigate.**Arize Phoenix**Quick take: Provides drift detection, token-level attribution, model-level health scores. Allows alerts to be integrated into Slack.*Pros** Slack alerts are super convenient.* Ability to have both on-premise and externally hosted LLMs.*Cons** Seems to have a fairly steep learning curve. Especially for less technically inclined users.**Overall**I feel like for most SMEs/SMBs the lowest entry barrier and by an extension the easiest adoption would mean going with nexos.ai. It’s just all there available out of the box, with the observability, management, and guardrails menu providing the exact feature set we were looking for. Close second for me is Langfuse due to its open-source nature and good documentation coverage.",6,0.81,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nifuaj/ai_platforms_with_observability_comparison/,2025-09-16 12:17:52,2025-09-18 01:24:11

1niamp8,Built a tool to keep AI agents connected to live R sessions during data pipeline development,Unable_Huckleberry75,dataengineering,"Morning everyone,Like many of you, I've been trying to properly integrate AI and coding agents into my workflow, and I keep hitting the same fundamental wall: agents call `Rscript`, creating a new process for every operation and losing all in-memory state. This breaks any real data workflow.I hit this wall hard while working in R. Trying to get an agent to help with a data analysis that took 20 minutes just to load the data was impossible. So, I built a solution, and I think the architectural pattern is interesting beyond just the R ecosystem.**My Solution: A Client-Server Model for the R Console**I built a package called `MCPR`. It runs a lightweight server inside the R process, exposing the live session on the local machine via `nanonext` sockets. An external tool, the AI agent, can then act as a client: it discovers the session, connects via JSON-RPC, and interacts with the live workspace without ever restarting it.**What this unlocks for workflows:*** **Interactive Debugging:** You can now write an external script that connects to your running R process to list variables, check a dataframe, or even generate a plot, all without stopping the main script.* **Human-in-the-Loop:** You can build a workflow that pauses and waits for you to connect, inspect the state, and give it the green light to continue. * **Feature engineering:** Chain transformations without losing intermediate stepsI'm curious if you've seen or built similar things. The project is early, but if you're interested in the architecture, the code is all here:**GitHub Repo:**[https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR](https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR)I'll be in the comments to answer questions about the implementation.

1nen2n6,"“My class forces us to use AI like a crutch, and it feels like real coding doesn’t matter anymore”",Juandhjdi,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, I need to vent a little and maybe get some perspective.I am taking a **Distributed Systems class** where we are graded like a **""battle royale""** . The Rules:We are given a problem to solve 10 - 20 min, the first team to finish gets the max grade, the second team gets one unit less, the third team another unit less and so on, if you don't finish in time you get 0. Here's the problem: I feel I have a solid foundation in python and sockets, but is not enough when everyone else is just using AI( Ctrl c + Ctrl v). As long as the code runs you get the grade. Meanwhile I try to understand things deeply and write my own solutions, but is hard to do it on your own when you only get 15-20 min, I freeze under pressure, even though I can solve the problems on my own if I had more time. This makes me feel like I am bad a programming because I can't solve something under time pressure, and that programing is not worth it anymore, I am trying to do my best, but it never seems enough, or am I looking at this the wrong way. Honestly I feel this grading system sucks since we are not encouraged to fail, debug or even learn how our code works, speed is the only thing that matters and that means pasting everything AI throws, I'm seriously considering dropping from that class and take it next semester with other teacher. I could be wrong of course I just want some guidance as to what to do next, Is this grading system fine?",444,0.95,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nen2n6/my_class_forces_us_to_use_ai_like_a_crutch_and_it/,2025-09-11 22:50:34,2025-09-18 01:24:12
1ndxgh9,ThePrimeagen‬ is not a good teach. boot.dev's Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go course,Viscel2al,learnprogramming,"\*EDIT: Title should be ""not a good **teacher""**I hate to say it but ThePrimeagen is not a good teacher.I just completed boot.dev's ""Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go"" course taught by ThePrimeagen on YouTube. What I did was to first attempt the course myself, and only when I got stuck did I refer and watch the same chapter and lesson he was at on the video.In the video, Prime is taking the entire course in one go, and he was doing it on stream, and I think that was the biggest reason his lesson was not good. He is a content creator, so when he codes, he is saying ""yayayayaya"", or ""boom boom"", and rarely ever explaning what he is doing. There are times when he does, but since this is a course, I did have the expectation he would explain what he is doing. He's basically DrDisrespect with that 'stache and mannerism if you what I mean.I would attribute this to because he was streaming it. I can tell his viewers are seasoned developers because they would comment about things and he replies. In that sense, Prime wasn't doing a course, he was just programming and talking to other developers of the same level, hence the lack of verbose explanations.Secondly, while Prime did create this course, what he does in the video is also somewhat different from the course. When programming, there are defintely different ways to do things for sure. But if I go into a lecture and the lecturer doesn't use the textbook that the lesson was built upon, I would be confused too. Especially since I attempted code myself, and only looked at his videos afterwards. Like how he would convert his functions to handle \[\]byte instead of string.The reason why I'm saying is because I took 3 of Lane's course: ""Learn Go"", ""Build a Blog Aggregator in Go"" and ""Build an AI Agent in Python"". In those videos, Lane explains each line of code he is doing and why. And he also shows us what happens when he doesn't know what to do, i.e. asking Boots etc. His lessons really explains everything well and I can highly recommend courses he designs.In Prime's word, I have a skill issue and I'm taking the L. I accept that because if I didn't have a skill issue, I wouldn't be on a learning platform at all. Now the course itself definitely taught me a lot more about HTTP protocols, but after watching 3 other courses by Lane, I was quite dissapointed by the quality of this guided project video that I had to make this post. Maybe Lane will remake this video with him guiding it but I highly doubt so, he's a busy guy and I'm looking forward to the next course he is making.",330,0.91,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ndxgh9/theprimeagen_is_not_a_good_teach_bootdevs_learn/,2025-09-11 02:37:32,2025-09-18 01:24:12
1nhtsu3,I’m tired of people dying - how long do I need to learn how to build a flood detection app?,little_einschtein,learnprogramming,"Tl:dr; I want to create an (ios + android) app that tells when the river has burst so people can evacuate. I’ve little to 0 experience in coding.Sorry, this is going to be long so I divided it into backstory and technical questions:——Backstory——I live in a small valley town in Malaysia. That said when it floods, ANNUALLY, it becomes a choke point for people travelling to, from and between cities, suburbs and rural areas.Last year, while a young couple died trying to feed stranded families with babies in cars, the young wife fatally fell into a storm drain (hidden by deep flood waters). Now, just last week it rained again and people are stranded - and I just heard that three people have died in the span of less than a week due to record level landslides in this region.Look, everyone knows everyone in this part of the world. So when someone dies, everyone is devastated. And it saddens me that it happens to the those with the best or intentions. Not to mentions property and income losses. I’m talking those who just bought a car to go to work and now it’s CAKED with silt while some have to spend tens of thousands replacing books, devices and furniture cause they didn’t have time to move their stuff elsewhere. You might be thinking why don’t they move their cars uphill or carry your fridge upstairs when it rains? Would you do that every time it rains? It’s a tropical country anyway. Anyway, we can only extrapolate so much. If only, we had an app that tells us when a water has reached a certain threshold, people can avoid driving into the valley and move their cars or property to safer place. Again I have 0 experience in creating this app and I know that that’s just half the problem. I also need to think about the other half of the device - the flood detection thingy. In highschool I met someone in an invention convention that managed to create a device that sends a text message whenever they detect landslide/earthquake in a zone with an Arduino - so it’s like an early prevention mechanism. I’m thinking of emulating that and placing in select flood prone regions upstream as a gauge to let people flee in times when water rises to a certain threshold. I realise the ginormous uphill battle there is on this, but if I could just make one family - even if it’s just my family to turn back and not enter the valley when it floods, or move their car uphill or evacuate their home. I’ll sleep more peacefully.——Technical Questions——App: 1. What courses/topics should I take and learn as basics - and do I need to take this first or learn while developing the app?2. What language should I be using? I rather it be a multiplatform app instead of a native one so I charter to both ios and android users.3. How ”simple” will this app be? I’m not thinking fancy UIs, just maybe pings and alert when one or more of the flood detection gets activated.Flood detection:1. Is an Arduino enough to build this?2. If not, what should the detection be? Is there already an invention that does this?General:- Is this possible? How long will this take me? NB: I’m gonna fund this entirely on my own and I’ll be doing this on the side on top of my already PACKED work schedule.Obviously my questions are wacked cause I honestly don’t know what to ask. I work in an entirely different field and I always have been stupid in class when it comes to STEM.

I decided to end that trial to focus on myself and learn JavaScript again, then React and Node js. My biggest problem is I don't really know when to use what I learnt.

I feel super dumb when I'm stuck on a ticket for hours, and that my colleague solve it in like 20 minutes.After giving you some context, my question is : when programming, how do you manage to know which key notion to use to translate the solution into code ?

None of them really knew programming... and the guy they hired to lead it is gone. Because of that, I (and some fellow interns who are game developers) were tasked to increase the performance of the project. Naturally I inquired about their Github first and as a response I heard their Github was ""broken"". I initially thought going back a few pushes would fix it... but when I asked for more details it wasn't necessarily that their Github was broken... rather that they didn't have one.They didn't work with Github.The entire project was made and maintained on literally. A single. Computer.Now, I'm not a software god by any means, far from it, but I'm fairly certain Github is necessary for working with multiple people. I've learned 2 issues. The first one being that Github doesn't accept files larger than 100mb, and I'm currently learning how to work with Github Large Files to remedy that issue, as well as testing which files I can delete that won't even affect the project. However the second problem is that Github doesn't accept repositories larger than 5Gb? Mine is about 17Gb...I've already been looking up on reddit and Stackoverflow for advice but it seems that not many run into a problem like this.

I spent time thinking and debugging (""should I add code to the ad make sure it delays"")then I finally realized that I should just add it to the ""gameover"" method so that i triggers right when the player loses but before it restarts.

1nef7i8,"Decided to do a program ""school"" called 42, and now I'm way over my head.",GoddessxTessa,learnprogramming,"It's day 4 of the very intense boot camp program school. I knew going into it, it wasn't going to be like an ordinary school where you are the student and you have the teacher you. Which I was fine with. I knew the whole point was to go in person and ask your peers for help and help them as you work through projects. We're given a project book with an example that we must recreate to pass. My problem is the materials they give us explain absolutely nothing and make it seem so complicated. The ""teachers"" can't tell you anything about anything you have to figure it out yourself. I have some background in computer science and basic knowledge of knowing to code frontend with like python, and html. I passed all my exams with high grades and I'm very studious. But right now with how everything is done in this school I'm feeling overwhelmed and way in over my head. I'm sat at the school for at least 12hrs everyday when possible since the campus is open 24/7 and you set your own schedule, just have to be on time for exams. Yet I've never felt quite so dumb in my life. I could really use help about now because I'm drowning and understand nothing. Edit: It's the next day and I'm grateful for everyone's advice on my situation. I was definitely feeling stressed and not having a good day yesterday with nothing going quite right. But it's a new day and reading everyone's advice has helped me put things into perspective and calm down. So thank you everyone.I'm honestly not even going to think about the exam that's today. I'm going to look into vscode like everyone recommended and definitely try to pick at as many brains as possible. I have messaged about English versions of the pdf files that have the projects for us to do, since I struggle with my second language still. My life motto is ""one day or day one?"" So let's keep going. Thank you everyone. Edit2: I have entered the exam and failed within the first 10 minutes because I couldn't login into the exam (if you've done the 42 piscine you'll know what I mean). But I'm not in despair or anything because I stay afterwards and talked to my peers and figured out where I went wrong and what my mistake was. (It was a really small mistake of not subscribing to the event. I registered for the exam, but I didn't subscribe to the event as well prior to the exam beginning.)I know this isn't the subreddit for 42 (I'm already on that one too). But I do genuinely appreciate everyone's advice, tips and tricks. So I would still love to learn from anyone and everyone (treat me like a 5 year old and let me ask a million why and how questions :face_with_tears_of_joy:), that does include my peers at 42. After failing the exam and see who also failed, helped me see who was more on my level and that definitely gave me a lot more confidence to interact with my peers more. Now I need to figure out how to keep on doing the piscine and not sacrifice my health, because I don't think being glued to a chair for 12hrs is the most healthy thing, nor staring at a screen (I come home with horrible migraines by the end of the day). I want to learn without trying to drown. By the end of the day my brain is fried and I immediately crash out as soon as my head hits my pillow. So please do keep giving me advice, whether it's coding related, how to interact with my peers better (I really struggle with it), caring for myself during the time period, absolutely anything.

Like 'this' pointer is only being able to refer to the instance because the reference to an instance is baked into machine code.A) i found out 'this' pointer just passed to each function as invisible argument. Other OOP languages may work differently.M) I thought that OS is something different than machine code that regular peasants programs useA) It's same regular machine code, but It's more privileged. It has access to everything on the machine.M) The graphical interface of a programs made me think that's what programs are. A) Didn't see the true nature of programs, they consist of instructions to do computations and everything else what we call a graphical shell is merely a conveniences that are provided by Operating System software.M) I thought that GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is only device that is magically being able to draw 3D graphics.A) CPU could do the same but just really slow (no real time for demanding games), there's also integrated GPU that's built into ""processor"" but it's generally slower that dedicated ones.When there's no one explaining the computers from the low end to high end of course there's so much stupid assumptions and misconceptions.

1nh24jb,How can actually enjoy studying instead of grinding for results?,BitBat16,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, I’m struggling to enjoy studying. I’m naturally motivated by tangible results, which is why I love coding I can see what I create. But when it comes to other subjects, or even “harder” coding problems, the process itself feels painful.Even when I break tasks into small problems, if I can’t solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like I’m running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isn’t as satisfying as it used to be.This year in school doesn’t help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. I’ve even stopped working on projects because the thought “I must prepare for the exams” hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isn’t making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I don’t have a choice I can’t go to university if I don’t pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soonRecently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a ""logic"" question I couldn't solve it which is ""supposed to be easy"" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square"", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good ""future proof"" career, which then makes me think, ""just study AI development"" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.I might be spiraling My question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isn’t naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to ""get things in order"" I feel lost I really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.",14,0.86,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh24jb/how_can_actually_enjoy_studying_instead_of/,2025-09-14 20:35:05,2025-09-18 01:24:12

At first I thought it was just a puzzle game with logic gates… but it turned out to be much more. It gave me a hands-on understanding of logic gates, memory, and even simple CPU design. Hats off to devs for making something so educational yet so enjoyable.The game gradually pushes you from simple combinatorial circuits, to memory, to registers and to building a working CPU (LC-3 style) with your own instruction set. By the end you’re basically writing assembly for a custom ISA that you designed yourself.I’m not a computer engineer by training, but the concepts I picked up while playing \[logic gates, adders, memory, instruction cycles and more\] have been incredibly specific and useful later on. They gave me intuition that still helps me today as I'm trying to study C, data structures, and operating systems.It’s obviously not a replacement for textbooks, but for me it was a fantastic way to *feel* how computers work at a very low level, and it made the transition to more formal books study way smoother.Curious if anyone else here has tried it and how far you got — did you stop at logic gates, or did you programmed your CPU?",12,0.88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngbqgg/learning_programming_and_cs_concepts_through/,2025-09-13 23:17:13,2025-09-18 01:24:12

Most of my friends who enrolled in this program have already left, and I’m one of the few still sticking with it.Here’s my situation:* I’m 21 and just starting my degree. If all goes well, I’d finish in about 3–4 years.* At my university in Canada, internships are mandatory. Without them, you can’t graduate. The school provides some help, but it’s still hard to find one — for some people, it takes 6+ months or even a year.* I’m married, and I really want to finish as quickly as possible so I don’t make my wife wait longer than necessary.* On a personal note, my mother passed away this past January from a brain tumor. Before she passed, I wanted her to see me married, so I made that choice out of love for her and my wife. I know I have to carry the responsibility of that decision, but I don’t regret it.Looking ahead, I’d like to specialize in AI ,specifically deep learning and machine learning. I know that’s a path that might require pursuing a master’s degree or additional studies after my bachelor’s.And about passion, people often say “if you’re not passionate, switch programs.” I’d say I am passionate, but in my own way. What I really love is solving problems, whether it’s in math, physics, or programming. Coding itself is fun, but I’m not the type who will stay up all night coding just for the sake of it.

I have found though, if I repeat and focus enough on an action I can do it in my sleep. I’m not working at the moment because of it, but I desperately want to. The thing is I did a degree over 20 yrs ago, failed miserably (due to a mixture of family bereavement and wrong course) so I can not get a student loan.I need a home based job, but not phone or customer based. I decided to try a hand in software development.I’m not artistic so web design is probably out unless some one comes up with the design and I code it lol so back end is probably where I need to focus (although no clue where to start with that).I’ve started doing freecodecamp which is going good so far. I know it’ll get harder. Also I started from the beginning so web design, just to ease me in. Most if not all boot camps aren’t accredited. Although I did find one that was, but wanted £7000+ for 16 weeks for full stack and I can no way afford it.What I’m asking is there any point in going through free resources if at the end of learning I still need to do a degree to get a job.

1nhrkmw,"No coding experience, just got into engineering school, planning CS major, should I do it ?",Delresto-67,learnprogramming,"Hey guys, I’m 18 and I just got into an engineering school here in Morocco. I don’t know anything about coding or software engineering yet but I’m thinking of going for Computer Science as my major. I kinda feel like it’s the best option for me but I’m also not 100% sure.I keep hearing people say stuff like “AI is gonna take all our jobs,” and some people seem scared of going into CS because of that. But honestly I feel like this is the best time to do it, since everyone else is scared and maybe leaving space for me to get a job later.Right now I’m in what they call “preparatory years,” which is mostly math and physics for two years (calculus, analysis, linear algebra, thermodynamics, electrostatics, organic chemistry, all that stuff). After that, I’ll choose my major, probably CS unless something changes.My plan is to start self-teaching programming and development during these two years so by the time I actually get into CS I’m not a total beginner. I want to become good enough at coding and development by the end of the 5 years to freelance whenever I want and build some kind of financial freedom, so I’m not stuck depending on a job forever.I know it’s a big goal and I’m starting with zero experience in coding but I’m serious about making it work.Here’s what I’m worried about:\* Is it actually possible to become really good at coding from zero in 5 years? Like good enough to freelance or get decent jobs?\* Should I be scared about AI taking all the software jobs?\* How safe is CS compared to other majors like mechanical or electrical engineering?\* What should I be doing during these two prep years to prepare myself ?

No animation besides maybe the player's pawn moving along the way. Multiple players of course, and if not a true multiplayer, at least a way to make a program that could have various entries and parameters set by the gamemaster.I have a tad of experience with Python, and it'd be useful for me to learn more, so that would be my fav medium if possible, along with it allowing me to make it a downloable exe file.All that being said, what program/language/game engine would you recommend ? I looked up a few, and so far the most notable ones seem to be Pygames if I wanna do everything from scratch, or websites like Screentop or Boardgame.(Related coding question : how would you implement the different pathways a pawn can take with a given dice number ? My boardgame would have different paths and intersections, and no imposed direction of movement. What logic could I use to make my program give the player the option to say, with a throw of 4, go back and forth to end up on the same tile ?)Thank you so much in advance for your help, and have a good day !",8,0.8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngajxi/how_to_make_a_simpleish_board_game/,2025-09-13 22:24:07,2025-09-18 01:24:12

1njs883,Does it ever get easier?,Ok_Taro_8370,learnprogramming,"Context: I've been ""coding"" to some degree since I was 16 when I took a high school class that was supposed to introduce us to C#. We had to write our own code in that class based on established projects. I've also attempted far more complex projects based on tutorials meant to walk through nearly every step. In total, I've spent maybe 40-60 hours trying to code with C# and Java depending on the project. But to be completely honest, if you asked me to make something as simple as a calculator, I literally wouldn't even be able to tell you what the first WORD in that code would be. For some reason my brain has absorbed absolutely NOTHING about syntax or even setting up projects, and it's extraordinarily frustrating. Every tutorial or class I've ever done, I have actually been typing out all code used, and yet NOTHING sticks in my brain. I glean loose concepts, but the languages themselves leave no impression on me, and I have no idea if this is normal or not. I'm 22. If I literally can't even code ""Hello World"" for the 30th time in C# or Java because I don't remember the syntax or formatting, should I just give up trying to learn by myself (as opposed to enrolling in an in-person program)? Is coding even for me? To clarify: I understand and have learned a lot more about how code works in those 40-60 hours. The issue is the language has no place in my brain. If I am asked to code by myself, I could tell you the general concept of what I'd need to do, and that's it.

1nekzmk,A linguist in search of computer tools to get a specific job done. Maybe learning programming is not even necessary.,daliborhrelja,learnprogramming,"Dear all,I'm a linguist interested in some obscure things. I need something simple that gets the job done with the lowest learning curve. Anyway, what I need is the ability to:1) import data - let's say, all the words from a dictionary of a certain language in a column.2) I would like to be able to remove predefined letters or letter strings/combinations from this database of all words.3) after the letters are removed, get a list of all leftover letter strings/combinations (2 or 3 letters combinations, not more than that).4) sort the list by how many times a string is repeated in the database.5) possibly compare the top 100 combinations in multiple languages (I would do steps 1-4 for a couple languages or just import a new column and set the premade steps 2-4 to work on it) to see if they overlap. Some of the steps may get mixed up. \---Do I really need to learn to code to do this? Instinctually, this appears to be relatively simple and could be done even without learning how to code. But correct me if I am wrong. So far, AI has shown a bit of misdemeanor and not given me or people I know a flat out answer when the question was something very similar to what I am looking for and I would like to, therefore, skip using AI for this task. That said, I would like to learn to program enough to be able to do what is described above and get back to working with language as fast as possible. If I can do it without AI and without learning programming, even better. And maybe there is a way. Let me know. If you need more input, also, let me know.

Again, to be fair, I actually feel like I have a pretty decent understanding of what the book is getting at; working through recursions from recursive and iterative frames was really instructive, and seeing the general summation formula was a big eureka moment for me, but good God that exercise brought me right back down to earth.",6,0.8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ndz2d6/is_it_normal_to_feel_stupid_going_through_sicp/,2025-09-11 04:01:44,2025-09-18 01:24:12
1njsucu,How is data stored as bytes? How is different information separated?,FactoryBuilder,learnprogramming,"So a bit of “how I got here” for my question:I was programming in Godot and learning file access and data storage. I found out that I can store integers as bytes in a text file and the file when opened in a text editor will have those bytes translated to their ASCII characters but Godot will still read the data as bytes and return integers when the program reads the file.I thought it’d be funny to have a simple text file, not .dat or .json or any other specialized data storage format, for storing data. Because the text editor spits out the ASCII codes, it will look like gibberish. Representing the data I need stored as integers is easy. The problem is that I’m not sure how to separate different pieces of information. Let’s say variable A is an integer. Simple. Store its binary 8 bit value. Let’s say variable B is an array. Well it could be of a varied length so I need some way to tell the program when it’s reading the file that the data for this variable starts here and ends here. I can’t use any of the 256 combinations of 8 bits because they all represent numbers that the value I’m trying to store could be.**So how can I mark the beginning and end of certain pieces of data in bytes?** I’m sure this is a very basic computer science problem but I’m not proficient enough in Google-fu to find it online.",5,0.86,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1njsucu/how_is_data_stored_as_bytes_how_is_different/,2025-09-17 23:34:42,2025-09-18 01:24:12

1ngt349,"How to approach architecting apps when real users, real revenue, and long-term maintainability is at stake?",calmstoic2000,learnprogramming,"Hi guys, how do you think about architecting an app when real users are involved and you’re trying to find an effective solution? By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):1. Solves the user’s problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).2. Isn’t overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.3. Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.Context: I’m a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (\~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. I’ve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy. This gets especially tough when there's older code not written by me which looks like it was written just to get things working with no regard for quality.Questions I struggle with repeatedly:1. How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.2. How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.3. How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.4. How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?5. Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?6. Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?**I rely on AI** a lot for these questions and I worry I’m making uninformed choices that will become bad habits when I work with better, more experienced engineers. Is there some sort of tutorial / video that goes through this (Couldn't find the resources for this honestly).

1niyv29,A deep dive into a real-world Rust FFI project: wrapping a C++ bioinformatics library,AdditionalMushroom13,learnprogramming,"Hey r/learnprogramming,I've been using Rust for a while and recently finished a project that involved some interesting challenges I thought would be valuable to share, especially for those curious about using Rust with other languages.# ## The GoalIn my field (bioinformatics), there's a powerful C++ tool called `odgi` for working with complex DNA data. I wanted to use its features inside a Rust program to leverage Rust's safety and concurrency, which meant building a bridge between the two languages.# ## The Learning Journey & Key ChallengesEven with experience, this project presented some great learning opportunities:1. **Tackling FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** The core of the project was making Rust and C++ talk to each other. I used the `cxx` crate, which is a fantastic tool for generating safe bindings. It was a deep dive into how to manage data and function calls across the language boundary, which is a common task in systems programming.2. **Designing a ""Safe"" API:** A key principle in Rust is memory safety. A big part of the design work was creating a public API that completely hides the `unsafe` FFI calls. This ensures anyone using my library can write 100% safe Rust code, a rewarding design challenge.3. **Complex Build Scripts:** I had to write a [`build.rs`](http://build.rs) script to compile the entire C++ `odgi` library from source before building the Rust code. It's a good reminder of how complex real-world build pipelines can get when you're integrating different ecosystems.# ## The OutcomeThe result is a library (`odgi-ffi`) that other Rust developers in my field can now use as a solid foundation for their own tools.# ## Key Takeaways* **Real-world problems push your skills:** Integrating existing, complex libraries is a great way to move beyond language basics.* **Modern tooling makes hard problems accessible:** FFI used to be a very manual and error-prone process. Crates like `cxx` make it significantly more manageable and safe.I just wanted to share the experience in case it's helpful. I'm happy to answer any questions about the process, or about using Rust and C++ together.",3,0.72,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1niyv29/a_deep_dive_into_a_realworld_rust_ffi_project/,2025-09-17 00:39:30,2025-09-18 01:24:12
1niiu6r,coding an animation program?,flufishere,learnprogramming,"Heyo. I haven't been coding very long, I know python and I've only just started learning Java. But I've been very interested in the idea of making an animation program (Adobe Animate, Toon Boom Harmony, etc) but I have no idea how the logic of saving data to frames and then showing/hiding that data would work. Everytime I try to search anything about it I only get searches on how to play animations in java, which I don't think would apply for what I'm trying to do? (I'm unsure.) I'm not looking for a ginormous step by step guide or anything, just a general push in the direction of how a coder would think about doing something like that. The only way I can think to do it in my head involves quite literally an infinite number of if statements/switch statements, which I feel that can't be right. See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.This is an example of how I'm thinking of this in my head (This isn't a specific coding language, I'm nore trying to get across the concept of what I'm doing)\---If current\_frame == 1: erase previous drawing on screen show drawing\_1 on screenif current\_frame ==2: erase previous drawing on screen show drawing\_2 on screen\---etc etc it goes infinitely, these could also be switch statements, but I'm not sure how that makes it any better.I'm aware of the existence of dictionaries/mapping/lookup tables/whatever their called you know what I'm trying to talk about, but those have a finite amount of entries in them (as far as I'm aware?) the amount of frames the user decides to make is literally infinite.This may be a silly question, I'm not very familiar with coding visuals yet, so maybe this is obvious to soneone who is familiar with coding visuals.

This plan gets foiled when employees are at home and can easily interview at their homes. Edit: Of course people switch even with wfo but it's much harder. Also it's a factor, not the sole reason.

1njb0d3,Why do software engineers talk so much about their salaries and perks compared to other fields?,x_mad_scientist_y,cscareerquestions,"I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:* Corporate law - long hours at the top firms, but once you make partner or move in-house, the pay and perks can be incredible.* Management consulting - high salaries, travel perks, and later the option to slide into cushy corporate strategy roles.* Finance (investment banking, hedge funds, private equity) - brutal in the early years, but the compensation and eventual lifestyle roles can be extremely attractive.* Pharma/biotech corporate roles - especially regulatory affairs, medical affairs, or corporate strategy, where salaries and work-life balance can be excellent.* Government or quasi-gov jobs - not always “high salary” in the traditional sense, but great stability, pensions, benefits, and very relaxed day-to-day in some roles.I think tech gets the spotlight partly because1. It’s more relatable, everyone uses apps and websites, so people “get” what a software engineer does2. The industry actively markets itself through social media and content like those “Day in the Life” vlogsMeanwhile, most law firms or finance offices aren’t putting out lifestyle videos showing their perksCurious what others think: is it just the marketing or social media presence, or is there something unique about tech culture that makes people talk about salaries and perks more than other fields?",97,0.78,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1njb0d3/why_do_software_engineers_talk_so_much_about/,2025-09-17 11:53:00,2025-09-18 01:24:13

1ni9htj,Finishing a CS degree and realizing you're really crap at software dev. What to do?,Lamereddituser312,cscareerquestions,"The way I learnt to code was kind of backwards. I started off on forums like MPGH, first learning how to use a debugger, then learning x86 asm, and then C. For most of my coding ""life"", I just wrote everything in asm, and then later on C but still mostly asm because I found everything else kind of confusing. I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),This kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the ""low-level"", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.Now I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.I struggle to use git lolCI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusingI struggle with database stuffI struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own ""OOP"" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.Get fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shitAll of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool ""high level"" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.It's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.None of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).None of these things are ""software"" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).To be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field. The thing I noticed when studying is the things I struggled with was entirely inverse from my peers.Any insights or advice is much appreciated.",86,0.9,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ni9htj/finishing_a_cs_degree_and_realizing_youre_really/,2025-09-16 05:59:08,2025-09-18 01:24:13
1ngylzn,"Is it worth continuing to do side gigs after getting into ""big tech""",iMakeBaadChoices,cscareerquestions,"I joined my big tech company about 4 months ago. Prior to this, I was at a very chill company making lower than the average swe in my city but also had quite a bit of free time. I would always work on side projects and was always down to jump on random startup ideas with good friends where I would only handle the tech stuff. I never really did this stuff to make money (of course I always hoped that it would pay off each time) but simply for the love of the game. I genuinely think me building all these websites in the past taught me a lot and turned me into a really good engineer. Now, I'm in your typical big tech company making 250k.The other day, a friend reached out with an idea for a tool. The idea makes sense to me and doesn't sound too difficult to build. He also has a pipeline to market it and already some validation so I would only have to handle the tech stuff so I immediately told him I'm down.However thinking about it after, I'm wondering if it's the smartest thing to do. I like to think that I'm good at what I do so even at work I only work 8h and it's not too bad but now that I'm making plenty of money, I'm not sure if I want to spend time and effort on trying to build random things.Do you guys think it's worth it?

1nfcosg,Cultural differences in job search,RecognitionSignal425,cscareerquestions,"Hey all, I've been grinding through tech interviews and I've noticed some stark cultural differences. Disclaimer: this isn't about bias—it's just my personal observations and what I've heard from others in the industry. Not saying one way is better or worse, but it's definitely shaped how I prep.From my experience, interviewers who grew up in the US (or 'completely Westernized') tend to keep things chill and conversational. They'll ask about your background, chat about past projects, and throw in questions that simulate problem-solving discussions. Often helpful with hints if you get stuck, and the vibe/culture fit is crucial. On the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more ""pass/fail"" mentality—either your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. I think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly. That mindset carries over here, e.g.treating work like a promotion game rather than delivering value.Basically two styles: ""textbooker"" who want puzzle masters, vs. ""collaborative"" who prioritize discussion and personality.And don't get me started on communication styles. Overall, it's made me adapt either memorizing hard LeetCode for certain rounds but appreciate the more human approach from others. Anyone else notice this trend?

Any advice would also be great, but I know there is none for me, it's just being lucky in finding a company that wants to take a chance on you. But I have to be honest, this is making me kind of depressed, applying day in and day out, getting automated rejection after rejection whilst also going on interviews and hearing back later saying the same damn line as I mentioned earlier, or them saying ""your profile is great and we see a good match but there simply isn't any work for a junior atm"".Thanks for sharing guys.",23,0.73,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1neciu3/juniors_struggling_to_get_jobs_whats_the/,2025-09-11 15:55:50,2025-09-18 01:24:13

Three years ago, I joined a fintech startup as a DBA and I make pretty good money for the Canadian market and also have decent vacation days. It was like a dream job. I am 15 minutes from the office so I walk to it all year and no RTO issues for me.The kicker is that a year ago, we had a change of management and a new CTO was brought in. Slowly by slowly, that CTO brought in people from his ethnicity/country. Some local, some foreign but all of the CTO's ethnicity.. and that completely changed this dream job for me. Even in meetings my new coworkers speak in their own language and do not make any attempt to include me and only switch to English when they want to talk to me directly. They have their own cultural events outside the office and do not invite me. Fine I dont care for those. But being ignored in meetings is unacceptable.And I am not the only one in this situation. Another test engineer confided in me he feels the same but he does not care. My worry is that I don't think I will be promoted, no matter how much hard work I put. I also do not feel a part of the team anymore. What can I do? If I quit the market is bad. If I bring this up to the CEO, I feel like I will be fired anyway since how can he not know this??

1njr7hw,"I am putting off life stuff (love, kids, etc) because I seem to be stuck into being a SWE and haven't been able to get out for years",CompetitiveBee808,cscareerquestions,"5 YoE, all at big companies. Some very chill, some mid chill, some not chill at all. Have been miserable at all of them. No matter if the pay is good, the team is very friendly, management is great, etcI've tried tirelessly to internally transfer to business roles (PM, sales, sales engineering, product marketing) , as well as externally, using completely different resumes depending on the role, but it seems like once you are labelled a SWE, you are seen as just that: a SWE, incapable of functioning at any other jobI really hate what I do. I have never enjoyed programming for a living. I prefer things that are more high level, decision based, people based, soft skills based. i cannot believe some people get paid for a living to analyze their business, make strategic decisions, talk to upper leadership and present ideas/numbers to them, etc. That sounds significantly more interesting to me than anything SWE work involves. I would rather make half the money if its means my job isn't about worrying code.End result is that I constantly will grow miserable and stressed at whatever SWE role I'm in --> quit after 1-2 years, try and break into something else, give up and get whatever SWE job I can get, since its the \*\*only roles I get callbacks for\*\*Its really making me reconsider my entire life. I'm worried i'm stuck making a decent living but I will have to look back at my life and see a life where i spend everyday building a career i despise, doing work I cannot stand. Wasting my life away. Im going to wake up one day, at 45, maybe financially comfortable, and see I built nothing career wise. Nothing to get my excited and feel proud of accomplishing. Nothing I can do for a living that I genuinely enjoy. I'll be someone who didn't have enough intelligence to create his own destiny. It makes me sick. Its making me put everything else on hold, because i have a very hard time being stable in a job I hate this much. being a SWE requires a LOT of focus, heads down time and genuinely enjoying it. If youre people oriented and more interested in the business side of things, and don't like the nitty gritty, it feels hellish.Startups, mid size, enterprise, they all want past business-y experience (sales, product, marketing) to get other such roles.I'm worried I will have to do this job forever, and keep destroying my resume as I keep quitting 1-2 years in because I'm not getting my sprint work done, because I simply don't have the inclination to work that way. I see the work my friends in other fields do, and while they have their own BS, their version of BS is stuff I would find significantly more bearableBecause of this constant instability, and constant qutting, its hard to commit myself to someone, and I've slowly seen my life pass by because I still haven't been able to establish. myself in the career I really want. I didn't realize that once you become a SWE, unless you can get into a great business school, you are essentially stuck there unless you get extremely lucky internally.

1nitsmg,Got an OA for a job and have no idea what I’m doing. Dealing with depression and grief. Feeling dejected and hopeless and not sure how to proceed.,roundish_square_face,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,Some background: my mom has been dealing with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My dad died almost exactly one year ago, the same week my live-in partner admitted to being unfaithful and left me. I am getting help but dealt with severe depression before this, and all this launched me into a new stratosphere of grief. This got even worse when we found out my mom’s cancer spread again last month. I’ve barely been able to feed myself, bathe, or do the bare minimum at my current job.I’m a data engineer and I am currently employed at an ok company doing consulting. It’s not perfect, upper management is abusive with our time and there is client drama. I have no intention of staying long term but I’ve been there over a year and it’s remote so I can visit my mom and qualify for FMLA.A few months back when things were ok with my mom, I applied for a job at databricks for a solution architect and unexpectedly got an interview several months later. It’s also remote, and I wouldn’t get FMLA if I needed it. I am unhappy at my current job and this pays more so I wanted to give it a shot. Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. It’s all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. I’m very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that I’ve squandered this opportunity.I had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, I’m afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But I’m not. I’m afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, I’ll end up in a situation where I’ll get fired or they’ll find out I’m not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I can’t code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just can’t now.I don’t know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter.

1nh4ep2,"How to be viewed as the solution, not the problem?",L3av3NoTrac3s,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Getting labeled as problematic when trying to help my team not destroy customer trust due to poor engineering practices, how to turn the tide so management will listen?Frustrated with my team and going to get fired if I keep alienating myself by trying to do the right thing. Background: Only self-taught dev on my team, low/mid level, remote, love my company and very loyal for them taking a chance on me when I was an intern. Over the past year management changes have destroyed my team’s effectiveness.QA: Obvious bugs are getting pushed daily, we lack testing, and there’s no chain of approval. People just click approve button after skimming the code. We have juniors approving and pushing each other’s code with no oversight. Sometimes the code doesn’t even work, or it doesn’t do what they think it’s doing due to inexperience in the codebase. I feel obligated to point out bugs etc when I see them, but I hate having to be the bad guy on a daily basis. Seniors don’t seem to care even when I bring it up to them.Planning: Designers make tickets for feature work and throw them in “to-do”. Tickets are done out of order, so code written today will need to be rewritten next week when the other ticket is done. I feel obligated to try and point out that doing X before Y will mean we need to redo X, but they don’t see this as wasting time, they see me as blocking progress or Idk what I’m talking about because “it always works out anyway” (I always end up handling the duplicated work). Sometimes tickets literally cannot be done without core functionality from other tickets, so juniors will just do a crazy workaround or make the feature do something completely broken instead. We waste weeks arguing before management will finally let me fix things, then they complain I’m always prolonging simple tickets.Architecture: There’s no technical design process at all. Management says they trust engineers to make those decisions on the fly, including juniors. The designers sometimes make a figma reference sheet that doesn’t even let you do the requested features, and juniors will code half of it before realizing they’re blocked then we go back to the drawing board, instead of listening to me pointing out “hey, this doesn’t look like it’s going to do what it seems like you’re asking for” during sprint planning. They claim I’m worrying too much about edge cases.For example, a junior will pick up a ticket that should involve creating a system to support doing X task securely, using backend transactions etc. Instead of having a proper design doc to follow, they ad-lib it together using flaky frontend logic because they don’t know any better. They’ll have the frontend spoofing admin api calls to make those transactions work, creating a system that now requires the api to accept admin calls from non-admin JWT tokens. This means my next ticket has to follow their unsafe patterns, so I’m stuck refactoring their feature to something safe before I can even start my tickets. Me pointing this out as a problem leads to me getting labeled as nit-picky, too opinionated, and “thinking my way is the only way”.I’ve been trying to affect change, but it’s above my pay grade and thus rejected because I have no authority whatsoever. Management pushes back publicly against my concerns, and when I’m proven right and end up fixing things, it’s generally in private so the general sentiment for me is low. I’m also advocating for better practices for technical planning, design, QA, etc but it’s led to me getting alienated from the rest of the team who thinks we’re doing just fine. Any conversation I start now leads to arguments because I immediately get mischaracterized as causing problems when I open my mouth.

However, I can't put in time needed to do that because I am burnt out after work trying to keep up with current job.If I do put in time to study interviews during work, I fall behind on my current job.

I work closely with low-level details of microcontrollers (I have not had the chance to be a part of new board bring up). Most of work so far has gained me experience and exposed me to XCP, CAN, SPI, CAN-FD, SENT, UART. Outside of protocols, RTOS, on-chip debugging (test setup/in-vehicle debugging).I want to move to G/amzn/mfst type of companies as a generalist or even specialized team but main point being I’d be an embedded engineer coming into more of a generalist C++/Java/Python team.I am worried I will be interviewed accordingly as well, meaning, not only will they hit me with leetcodes but they might bring in a couple of their resident embedded experts into one of the rounds or something just to grill me.I think the driving reason for this concern is the fact that I haven’t been apart of ground zero board bring up and then application development, I mostly dabble around the app layer and sometimes have to go deeper into the things I mention above (hence the previous distinction between experience and exposure).Although I am able to navigate the codebase and solve problems, I don’t TRULY know what’s going on from the ground up all the way to the application layer.If someone asked me how a CAN transceiver works I couldn’t answer, “uhhh high low, take the delta??

I started as a junior SWE building automation scripts and batch jobs for customer provisioning and order management flows. I liked the WLB since I worked from home most days and the hours were manageable.Last year the project I was working on ended, and I was moved into an incident manager role in the IT department of a smaller subsidiary of the company. It’s been rough and honestly taking a toll on my mental health. Most days are just nonstop incident calls with no coding to brush up on my skills. The environment is toxic and draining with constant cost cutting, shifting expectations, and heavy micromanagement from leadership. I have terrible hours and I’m expected to be on-call on weekends. Since I joined, two people were let go and now there are only three of us handling even more responsibilities. On top of that, I didn’t get a raise this year because I switched teams. My salary was above average for my area and experience, but not getting a raise really discouraged me. It's obvious they're taking advantage of the tough job market.I’ve been in my current role almost a year now and I’m ready to jump ship. I’ve been applying to jobs on and off (nearly 200) but only got one interview from a random recruiter on LinkedIn. It’s frustrating since I have 3 YoE as a dev and thought that would at least give me an edge. My old manager said transferring to another role internally would be tricky without my current team’s support.I know I got lucky during the 2021 hiring craze but I’m wondering if I’m cooked now. I would consider myself an average programmer with knowledge of basic fundamentals, I do leetcode occasionally but I don’t really have passion projects outside of work.

Unfortunately, I was laid off about a year later.I've since landed a new role, the title is Software Engineer, but it is very AI centric, and any dev work is heavily done using AI tools where software engineers more or less prompt and review the generated code. Writing actual code is minimal, just small tweaks to results. The brainwork is mostly being offloaded to AI, we're instructed to write agents to attempt to automate almost anything and everything.I’m concerned about not being able to grow my dev skills. I genuinely miss writing and reading code and delving into codebases to solve problems. I miss debugging/troubleshooting, and learning intricacies, nuances, and quirks of the language and technologies that I am working with.In the off chance that these AI tools for dev work end up being scrapped several years down the line, I’m concerned that my skills will not have grown here. I’ve already heard first hand stories of experienced devs using these kinds of tools feeling as if their skills are dulling.Still being very early in my career, I’m wondering if I should stay in my current role (because this may be the future), or if I should try to find a job with a company that still does traditional software engineering with complemental AI use (e.g. Copilot in VS) to help me hone my raw SDE skills.I personally feel that these AI tools are best used by experienced engineers who have learned over time what to ask for, what looks good etc. I feel as though it is probably easier for an experienced dev to learn and make use of AI tools/coding assistants than someone who’s inexperienced and won't know enough to even know what to look for.So regardless of where things are headed, I think that real life hands-on coding experience is going to be king, but this is just one opinion. I'd like to hear some different points of view so I can make an informed choice.Are there any arguments for me staying in an AI centric role (which may be the future)? Or should I try and move back to a traditional dev role (which may serve me best regardless)?**\*UPDATE/EDIT\***Perhaps ""AI Vibe Coding"" was the wrong term, even though my job title is still Software Engineer, my role is more like ""Prompt Engineer"".I don't want to give too much details, but my team is currently coming up with and providing prompts for other teams to use in certain AI tools to expedite their workflows. We have also been training them on communication with the AI tools being used, basically ""AI Evangelists/Crusaders"" at this point.I haven't had the chance to write any code, and future projects are to create more prompts to feed these AI agents so they can automate more workflows. This process doesn't involve me ever having to delve deep into a codebase or understand an actual product.

1ne0zxa,.NET dev (5+ yrs) to Dynamics 365 – is it worth it?,theploop,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I could use some advice.I’ve been working as a .NET web developer for a little over 5 years now, mostly on enterprise and government-type projects. I’d say I’m mid-level, maybe senior depending on the team. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck in my career. Moving toward a team lead role in .NET seems to require switching jobs, grinding harder technically, and pushing myself in ways I can’t really do right now for personal reasons.A friend suggested I look into Dynamics 365. His reasoning was that it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication — which are actually strengths of mine. Plus, having a solid dev background might give me an edge compared to people who started directly in Dynamics.I did a bit of research and it seems like the Dynamics market is growing and there’s a clearer career path (especially with certifications). I get that certs alone aren’t enough without real experience, but at least the path feels more structured than in my current track. I’ve also heard people say Dynamics can be “boring” or “not real programming,” but honestly, I’m fine with that — stability and problem-solving are more important to me now.For context, I’m currently in a financially good job, so I’m not desperate to switch. But I don’t want to stay stagnant either.So my questions are:• Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?• What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?• Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?Would love to hear from people who are already in the field or made a similar switch.",5,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ne0zxa/net_dev_5_yrs_to_dynamics_365_is_it_worth_it/,2025-09-11 05:55:36,2025-09-18 01:24:13

Probably it's a controversial topic, but I really believe that AIs will change the world as the Internet did 35~ years ago, and I'd like to be one of those who'll build this world one way or another.Anyway, the question is, what skills should I develop now to start my career in AI/ML? I have a quite decent (at least in my country it's considered decent, but not some really high level) IT background with several years of system administration and a software engineer college degree (technically I can code, but my job has never required something more serious than Python/Bash QoL scripts, so my coding skills are probably somewhere around junior), but for some reason I feel like except the general basics it does not apply to LLMs/AI. I mean... theoretically I could get a job where I'd have to develop a mobile/desktop app that is built around AI or something like that, but it's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for something that is directly related to AIs, even if it's just a prompt engineering role.",5,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ni2ozq/entrylevel_aiml_jobs_what_are_they_what_skills_do/,2025-09-16 00:15:56,2025-09-18 01:24:13
1nh82ez,Need feedback on my portfolio projects (Ruby on Rails + React Native) and how to position myself on the market,Mislavoo7,cscareerquestions,"**TL;DR:** I’ve worked \~9 years in the same IT company (mostly backend, some frontend + DevOps). My salary is low (\~2/3 of country average). I built two showcase apps (Rails backend + React Native frontend) to better understand my market value. Looking for feedback on my execution, portfolio strength, what to improve, and whether I should present myself as junior/mid/senior. Also wondering if \~$20/h freelance (20h/week) is realistic.Hey everyone,I've been working in an IT company for about 9 years, always in the same company. My work is mostly backend, but sometimes I do a bit of frontend and DevOps as well. The issue is that my current salary is quite low, about 2/3 of the average salary in my country. The company also has some financial problems, but on the bright side, I get a lot of freedom and flexibility. Before I risk switching jobs or trying to build a second income stream, I want to better understand my real market value.The challenge for me is that my company relies heavily on internal processes, workflows, and custom setups, so it’s hard to compare my experience with ""standard"" projects. That’s why I decided to build my own apps as a showcase of what I can actually do.# What I builtI made two projects:* A Ruby on Rails app with a CMS, user dashboard, public-facing part, and an API.* A React Native (Expo) app that consumes the RoR API.# The ideaUsers can sign up or log in via either the web app or the mobile app. Once logged in, they can add products (with price and brand) and save them into lists. Each list has fields such as date, shop name, and value. Users can edit and delete both lists and products.I intentionally kept the functionality simple so people can test it without friction. My goal wasn't to build a ""real"" product, but to create a minimal app that demonstrates everyday developer practices.# What I worked with**Ruby on Rails** (API + web app + CMS + user dashboard), using Devise for authentication.* Two Devise models: Admins (login to CMS, only created by other admins) and Users (sign in to the dashboard to manage lists).* No email confirmation because I didn't want to set up MailGun/SendGrid, but I understand the process (domains, spam issues, etc.).* I use Tailwind CSS for frontend styling in my RoR app.* Stimulus JS for interactivity (sorting, filtering, etc.).**Mobile: React Native (Expo).**Users can add products without signing in, but creating a lists requires a login.* Authentication: the mobile app sends email/password to the Rails API, which returns a JWT token. The token unlocks all features (list + product management, user settings).* Settings include: language (HR/EN/DE), currency (€/$), theme (light/dark).* Legal pages are public and available in all three languages without changing settings.**DevOps**I Deployed the RoR app on a Hetzner server and installed Ubuntu 24, Nginx, Puma, cloned the RoR repo, precompiled assets, configured secrets, etc.**Content**I wrote demo texts in three languages I'm familiar with: Croatian, German, and English.# Code & live appsGitHub repo for Rails app: [Sparenzi Web](https://sparenzi.eu/) and [Repo](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenziweb/tree/master)(There are few commits because I developed in a private GitLab repo and only published the final version here)GitHub repo for React Native app: [Sparenzi](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenzi)# What I'd love to know* How would you rate my project execution? (both technically and as a portfolio piece)* What should I improve before showing this to recruiters / potential employers?* Based on what I’ve shown here, should I present myself as junior, mid, or senior developer?* I’m considering taking on freelance jobs in the \~$20/h range (about 20h/week alongside my current job). Is this realistic, or should I ask for more/less per hour and more/less hours per week?Any honest feedback is super welcome — I’m trying to figure out my real position on the market so I can plan my next steps.Thanks!",5,0.86,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nh82ez/need_feedback_on_my_portfolio_projects_ruby_on/,2025-09-15 00:53:19,2025-09-18 01:24:13
