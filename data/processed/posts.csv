I have a Databricks PySpark notebook that takes 20 minutes to run as opposed to one minute in on-prem Linux + Pandas. How can I speed it up?It's not a volume issue. The input is around 30k rows. Output is the same because there's no filtering or aggregation; just creating new fields. No collect, count, or display statements (which would slow it down). The main thing is a bunch of mappings I need to apply, but it depends on existing fields and there are various models I need to run. So the mappings are different depending on variable and model.

1k66f2e,"Are Delta tables a good option for high volume, real-time data?",StriderAR7,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I was doing a POC with Delta tables for a real-time data pipeline and started doubting if Delta even is a good fit for high-volume, real-time data ingestion. Here’s the scenario: - We're consuming data from multiple Kafka topics (about 5), each representing a different stage in an event lifecycle. - Data is ingested every 60 seconds with small micro-batches. (we cannot tweak the micro batch frequency much as near real-time data is a requirement)- We’re using Delta tables to store and upsert the data based on unique keys, and we’ve partitioned the table by date. While Delta provides great features like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel, I’m running into issues with table bloat. Despite only having a few days’ worth of data, the table size is growing rapidly, and optimization commands aren’t having the expected effect. From what I’ve read, Delta can handle real-time data well, but there are some challenges that I'm facing in particular:- File fragmentation: Delta writes new files every time there’s a change, which is result in many files and inefficient storage (around 100-110 files per partition - table partitioned by date). - Frequent Upserts: In this real-time system where data is constantly updated, Delta is ending up rewriting large portions of the table at high frequency, leading to excessive disk usage. - Performance: For very high-frequency writes, the merge process is becoming slow, and the table size is growing quickly without proper maintenance. To give some facts on the POC: The realtime data ingestion to delta ran for 24 hours full, the physical accumulated was 390 GB, the count of rows was 110 million.The main outcome of this POC for me was that there's a ton of storage overhead as the data size stacks up extremely fast!For reference, the overall objective for this setup is to be able to perform near real time analytics on this data and use the data for ML.Has anyone here worked with Delta tables for high-volume, real-time data pipelines?

They do a great job tracking metadata, but stop short of doing what seems like the next obvious step, actually helping enforce data access policies.Imagine a unified catalog that isn't just a metadata registry, but also the gatekeeper to data itself:- Roles defined at the catalog level map directly to roles and grants on underlying sources through credential-vending.- Every access, by a user or a pipeline, goes through the catalog first, creating a clean audit trail.Iceberg’s REST catalog hints at this model: it stores table metadata and acts as a policy-enforcing access layer, managing credentials for the object storage underneath.Why not generalize this idea to all structured and unstructured data? Instead of just listing a MySQL table or an S3 bucket of PDFs, the catalog would also vend credentials to access them. Instead of relying on external systems for access control, the catalog becomes the control plane.This would massively improve governance, observability, and even simplify pipeline security models.Is there any OSS project trying to do this today?Are there reasons (technical or architectural) why projects like DataHub and OpenMetadata avoid owning the access control space?Would you find it valuable to have a catalog that actually controls access, not just documents it?",30,0.95,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k8jmbo/are_we_missing_the_point_of_data_catalogs_why/,2025-04-26 18:24:38,2025-04-29 01:39:02

1k6xfby,Query runs longer than your AWS bill. How do I improve it,YameteGPT,dataengineering,"Hey folks,So I have this query that joins two table, selects a few columns, runs a dense rank and then filters to keep only the rank 1s. Pretty simple right ?Here’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. So, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.Yes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. And it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. But the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details.

1k93nf9,General guidance - Docker/dagster/postgres ETL build,VipeholmsCola,dataengineering,"HelloI need a sanity check.I am educated and work in an unrelated field to DE. My IT experience comes from a pure layman interest in the subject where I have spent some time dabbing in python building scrapers, setting up RDBs, building scripts to connect everything and then building extraction scripts to do analysis. Ive done some scripting at work to automate annoying tasks. That said, I still consider myself a beginner.At my workplace we are a bunch of consultants doing work mostly in excel, where we get lab data from external vendors. This lab data is then to be used in spatial analysis and comparison against regulatory limits. I have now identified 3-5 different ways this data is delivered to us, i.e. ways it could be ingested to a central DB. Its a combination of APIs, emails attachments, instrument readings, GPS outputs and more. Thus, Im going to try to get a very basic ETL pipeline going for at least one of these delivery points which is the easiest, an API.Because of the way our company has chosen to operate, because we dont really have a fuckton of data and the data we have can be managed in separate folders based on project/work, we have servers on premise. We also have some beefy computers used for computations in a server room. So i could easily set up more computers to have scripts running. My plan is to get a old computer up and running 24/7 in one of the racks. This computer will host docker+dagster connected to a postgres db. When this is set up il spend time building automated extraction scripts based on workplace needs. I chose dagster here because it seems to be free in our usecase, modular enought that i can work on one job at a time and its python friendly. Dagster also makes it possible for me to write loads to endpoint users who are not interested in writing sql against the db. Another important thing with the db on premise is that its going to be connected to GIS software, and i dont want to build a bunch of scripts to extract from it.Some of the questions i have:* If i run docker and dagster (dagster web service?) setup locally, could that cause any security issues? Its my understanding that if these are run locally they are contained within the network* For a small ETL pipeline like this, is the setup worth it? * Am i missing anything?",16,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k93nf9/general_guidance_dockerdagsterpostgres_etl_build/,2025-04-27 13:12:48,2025-04-29 01:39:02

In short, most of our time was spent arguing with security for reasons we needed access to data/tools/etc to do our job. They laid our entire team off last year and the job search has been brutal since. I’ve only gotten 3 engineering interviews from hundreds of applications and I’ve made it to the final round during each, only to be rejected because of technical engineering questions/problems I didn’t know how to figure out. I am very discouraged and wondering if data engineering is the right field for me. The data sphere is ever evolving and daunting, I already feel too far behind from my unfortunate first job experience. Some backend engineering concepts are still difficult for me to wrap my head around and I know now I much prefer the analysis side of things.

I've observed a concerning trend: people working on managed services projects are often engaged throughout the entire day, handling both ETL support and ad-hoc tasks.For those unfamiliar with the Data Engineering role, let me explain what ad-hoc and ETL support tasks typically involve. **Ad-hoc tasks** refer to daily activities such as data validations, new development, modifying data sources, preparing data for frontend and ML teams, and more. **ETL support**, on the other hand, is usually provided outside of standard working hours—often at night—and involves resolving issues and fixing bugs in data pipelines.The main problem is that the same resource who works a full 9–5 shift is also expected to wake up at night for ETL support whenever it's needed. ETL errors typically occur 2–3 times a week, and these support tasks can take anywhere from 1 to 5 hours, depending on their complexity and urgency.My concern is whether this practice is common across the industry? Wouldn't it be more effective to have separate resources for ETL support and ad-hoc tasks?**What are your thoughts?**",11,0.77,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k4uwcj/raising_a_concern_for_resources_working_on/,2025-04-22 01:54:32,2025-04-29 01:39:02

1k5ghoy,Iceberg in practice,wcneill,dataengineering,"Noob questions incoming!**Context:** I'm designing my project's storage and data pipelines, but am new to data engineering. I'm trying to understand the ins and outs of various solutions for the task of reading/writing diverse types of very large data. From a theoretical standpoint, I understand that Iceberg is a standard for organizing metadata about files. Metadata organized to the Iceberg standard allows for the creation of ""Iceberg tables"" that can be queried with a familiar SQL-like syntax.I'm trying to understand how this would fit into a real world scenario... For example, lets say I use object storage, and there are a bunch of pre-existing parquet files and maybe some images in there. Could be anything...**Question 1:** How is the metadata/tables initially generated for all this existing data? I know AWS has the Glue Crawler. Is something like that used? Or do you have to manually create the tables, and then somehow point the tables to the correct parquet files that contain the data associated with that table?**Question 2:** Okay, now assume I have object storage and metadata/tables all generated for files in storage. Someone comes along and drops a new parquet file into some bucket. I'm assuming that I would need some orchestration utility that is monitoring my storage and kicking off some script to add the new data to the appropriate tables? Or is it done some other way?**Question 3:** I assume that there are query engines out there that are implemented to the Iceberg standard for creating and reading Iceberg metadata/tables, and fetching data based on those tables. For example, I've read that SparkQL and Trino have Iceberg ""connectors"". So essentially the power of Iceberg can't be leveraged if your tech stack doesn't implement compliant readers/writers?

Essentially, three different flat files get printed to this folder on a nightly bases that represent three different types of data (think: person, sales, products). Essentially this data could exist as three separate long tables with date as key. I'd like to establish a proper data warehouse, but am unsure of how to best handle the process of warehousing these flats. I have been interfacing with the data through Python Pandas so far, but the company has a SQL server...It would probably be best to place the warehouse as a database on the server, then pull/manipulate the data from there? But what is tripping me up is the order of operations to perform in the warehousing procedure. I don't believe I would be able to dump into SQL server without profiling the data first as number of columns and the type of data stored in the flat files may have changed throughout the years.I am essentially struggling with how to sequence the process of : network drive flats > sql server db: My concerns are:Best method to profile the data?Best way to store the metadata?Throw flats into SQL server and then query them from there to perform data transformations/validations? \-- It seems without knowing the meta data, I should perform this step in Pandas first before loading into SQL server? What is the best practice for that? perform operations on each flat file separately or combine first (e.g., should I clean the data during the loop or after combining tables)? \-- Right now, I am creating a list of flat files, using that list to create a dictionary of dataframes, and then using that dictionary to create a dataframe of dataframes to group and concatenate into 3 long tables -- am I convoluting this process?How to approach data cleaning/validation/and additional column calculations? e.g. -- Should I perform these procedures on each file separately before concatenating into a long table or perform these procedures after concatenation?-- Should I even concatenate into longs or keep them separate and define a relationship to their keys stored in a separate table?How many databases for this process? One for raws? One for staging? A third as the datawarehouse to be queried?When to stage and how much of the process to perform in RAM/behind the scenes before printing to a new table?Should I consider compressing the data at any point in the process? (e.g. store as Parquet)The data gets used for data analytics and to assemble reports/dashboards.

There are some tasks that update Snowflake tables by running a SQL statement, and there are other tasks that updates those tasks whenever the SQL statement need to change. These changes are usually adding a new column/table and reading data in from a stream.After a few months of working with this and testing, it seems clunky to use tasks like this. More I read, tasks should be used for more static infrequent changes. The clunky part is having to suspend the root task, update the child task and make sure the updated version is used when it runs, otherwise it wouldn't insert the new schema changes, and so on etc.Is this the normal established pattern, or are there better ones?I thought about maybe, instead of using tasks for the SQL, use a Snowflake table to store the SQL string?

1ka61fg,"How to handle modeling source system data based on date ""ranges""",jardata,dataengineering,"Hello,We have a source system that is only able to export data using a ""start"" and ""end"" date range. So for example, each day, we get a ""current month"" export for the data falling between the start of the month and the current day. We also get a ""prior month"" report each day of the data from the full prior month. Finally, we also may get a ""year to date"" file with all of the data from the start of the year to current date.Nothing in the data export itself gives us an ""as of date"" for the record (the source system uses proprietary information to give us the data that ""falls"" within that range). All we have is the date range for the individual export to go off of.I'm struggling to figure out how to model this data. Do I simply use three different ""fact"" models? One each for ""daily"" (sourced from the current month file), ""monthly"" (sourced from the prior month file), and ""yearly"" (sourced from the year to date file)? If I do that, how do I handle the different grains for the SCD Type 2 DIM table of the data? What should the VALID\_FROM/VALID\_TO columns be sourced from in this case?

1k9fcmb,[Feedback Request] A reactive computation library for Python that might be helpful for data science workflows - thoughts from experts?,loyoan,dataengineering,"Hey!I recently built a Python library called [reaktiv](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv) that implements reactive computation graphs with automatic dependency tracking. I come from IoT and web dev (worked with Angular), so I'm definitely not an expert in data science workflows.This is my first attempt at creating something that might be useful outside my specific domain, and I'm genuinely not sure if it solves real problems for folks in your field. I'd love some honest feedback - even if that's ""this doesn't solve any problem I actually have.""The library creates a computation graph that:* Only recalculates values when dependencies actually change* Automatically detects dependencies at runtime* Caches computed values until invalidated* Handles asynchronous operations (built for asyncio)While it seems useful to me, I might be missing the mark completely for actual data science work. If you have a moment, I'd appreciate your perspective.Here's a simple example with pandas and numpy that might resonate better with data science folks: import pandas as pd import numpy as np from reaktiv import signal, computed, effect # Base data as signals df = signal(pd.DataFrame({ 'temp': [20.1, 21.3, 19.8, 22.5, 23.1], 'humidity': [45, 47, 44, 50, 52], 'pressure': [1012, 1010, 1013, 1015, 1014] })) features = signal(['temp', 'humidity']) # which features to use scaler_type = signal('standard') # could be 'standard', 'minmax', etc. # Computed values automatically track dependencies selected_features = computed(lambda: df()[features()]) # Data preprocessing that updates when data OR preprocessing params change def preprocess_data(): data = selected_features() scaling = scaler_type() if scaling == 'standard': # Using numpy for calculations return (data - np.mean(data, axis=0)) / np.std(data, axis=0) elif scaling == 'minmax': return (data - np.min(data, axis=0)) / (np.max(data, axis=0) - np.min(data, axis=0)) else: return data normalized_data = computed(preprocess_data) # Summary statistics recalculated only when data changes stats = computed(lambda: { 'mean': pd.Series(np.mean(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(), 'median': pd.Series(np.median(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(), 'std': pd.Series(np.std(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(), 'shape': normalized_data().shape }) # Effect to update visualization or logging when data changes def update_viz_or_log(): current_stats = stats() print(f""Data shape: {current_stats['shape']}"") print(f""Normalized using: {scaler_type()}"") print(f""Features: {features()}"") print(f""Mean values: {current_stats['mean']}"") viz_updater = effect(update_viz_or_log) # Runs initially # When we add new data, only affected computations run print(""\nAdding new data row:"") df.update(lambda d: pd.concat([d, pd.DataFrame({ 'temp': [24.5], 'humidity': [55], 'pressure': [1011] })])) # Stats and visualization automatically update # Change preprocessing method - again, only affected parts update print(""\nChanging normalization method:"") scaler_type.set('minmax') # Only preprocessing and downstream operations run # Change which features we're interested in print(""\nChanging selected features:"") features.set(['temp', 'pressure']) # Selected features, normalization, stats and viz all updateI think this approach might be particularly valuable for data science workflows - especially for:* Building exploratory data pipelines that efficiently update on changes* Creating reactive dashboards or monitoring systems that respond to new data* Managing complex transformation chains with changing parameters* Feature selection and hyperparameter experimentation* Handling streaming data processing with automatic propagationAs data scientists, would this solve any pain points you experience?

You know, things that might just work.These past months though, I've been getting really interested in math. So much so, that it has replaced my hobby of progamming (lol). What I noticed though was just how different I think about certain concepts. For example, functions. Back then, I kind of just thought of this as some wrapper of code that I can call whenever I wanted to. But getting to learn more about them in Calculus and how much I can manipulate them, it has also translated to my programming skills. Instead of just a wrapper for my code, I treat them now like actual items that take in parameters and spits out an output. Of course like, duh, but it really has changed my perspective and style on how I code now. Back then, it's more programming first then do the math to check. Now, it's math first, and let my code check if my math was correct. If it's correct, my code runs. If not, then math was wrong.I just wanted to share this insight with you guys who may be struggling to grasp some concepts in programming. Maybe, learning where these concepts came from might actually give you a deeper understanding of what they actually do.",331,0.97,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k5tzx5/learning_math_made_learning_programming_easier/,2025-04-23 08:21:38,2025-04-29 01:39:03

I have literally sent hundreds of personalised applications (resume + cover letter) for most of them and got only like 8% of answers, most of them being automatic rejections. I initially applied for machine learning/computer vision (my major at school) openings, but since there is no way I ever get one of those, I've widely reduced the importance of what I'd like to do in order to send more applications.Even when I get to go to the technical tests, and perform (I have had platforms telling me things like you performed better than 95% of candidates), I still get rejected without getting to the interview phase, ""we've had a lot of competitive applicants bla bla bla"". The only interviews I got are from Belgian societies, refusing me even though they don't pay their interns. I mean, even for free (for them bc it would be a lot of money for me to get there), they wouldn't have me work for them ??? This is just crazy.I have already worked half-time for more than 4 years alongside my studies, meaning that I have at the very least 2 years of full-time professional software engineering and that seems to not count at all, I've even had interviewers telling it didn't count as experience and that I was a junior with less knowledge than a student who wouldn't have worked during his studies (I admit that I left the interview after hearing this bs)I tried many different things on my resume & letters to not get rejected by the automated TAS. Many people reviewed what I sent, so I don't think that the problem comes from there.I mean, how are we supposed to find internships in CS ? Is this really the result of those 5 years of studies ? Absolutely no consideration from companies that I'd love to work for ?

Having people telling me that I should persist is now my new most listened song of 2025, but you guessed it : not my favorite.Sometimes it makes me want to scream after thinking of all those efforts to apply that won't ever bring me anything but sadness and despair.Finally, I don't understand why I should intern to graduate. How in the world can I not already look for a fucking job and call it a day since I already validated all the exams ? This just feel like I have to be a poorly paid (or not paid at all) person to graduate, even though the reason for that is absolutely unclear.Sorry if this is a little out of subject, I just wanted to share my experience of looking for internships after having decided, in 2019, that I wanted to learnprogramming.

1k7u3nv,using AI to learn programming,CapnCoin,learnprogramming,"Edit: What I mean by the post is not that everyone is saying not to use AI at all. That is simply how I understood it so I made a post in case there might be others.I often see comments on posts, asking how to learn programming, saying not to use AI.Although I am definitely no professional programmer myself, I have done quit a lot of learning (python, c#, and lately c++). I have always heeded this advice and have steered far away from using AI to learn how to code. Until the last couple of weeks.... and I have completely changed my mind about the subject.I still think it is a bad idea to have AI write up some copy-paste code as this definitely is not the best way to go about learning. Struggling a little and trying to get the code working yourself is what will cement the knowledge. But what I have been doing is submitting my code snippets to the AI after getting it to work and prompting it to analyze my code and suggest possible improvements. I then try implementing the suggestions and repeat the process.I feel this has vastly upgraded my programming skills, learning to implement fail safes, better error handling, better edge case handling, and being overall more robust. Still by no means am I any form of 'great' programmer yet but using Ai in this way has helped me progress a lot faster.So, in my opinion there is no problem with using AI to help you learn, the problem is in how we decide to use it.

But since I'm a total beginner when it comes to learning how to program, I'm not quite sure where or how to begin.I've checked out websites like CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp. They're great in terms of explaining concepts, almost like dictionaries, but I find it hard tot transition from theory to actually building and applying what I've learned. That's where I feel stuck. What I'm not saying is that CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp and such websites are bad. It's just that because of my lack of knowledge and experience that I don't know where to begin.

1k7lakx,[Need Advice] Struggling with Focus and Productivity After Years of Passionate Coding,hello_aaron,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I hope you’re all doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a severe lack of focus and productivity, and it’s been weighing on me for nearly a year. Let me share my story and explain where I’m at – I’d really appreciate any guidance or experiences you can share.Background: In 2021, I got my first desktop from my brother, and I was instantly hooked on computers. I spent hours exploring, learning, and diving into coding. I started with C, moved to C++, and fell in love with programming. It was exciting, and I was learning something new every day. In 2022, I joined a Computer Science Engineering program as a direct second-year student. This was the peak of my productivity. I was coding 10+ hours a day, building web development projects with Python and JavaScript, and even mastering the MERN stack. I was so focused that I’d code through the night, feeling like coding was my entire world. My hard work paid off – I became one of the top coders in my college, and my peers recognized my skills. I built a strong portfolio and improved my resume, aiming for a developer jobProblem: Things changed in my final year (2024). I started feeling depressed, demotivated, and lazy. I couldn’t focus on learning new skills or even maintaining my existing ones. While my peers were landing interviews and jobs, I struggled with aptitude tests (which I hadn’t prepared for, as I was so focused on coding). Sitting down to work on my laptop became a challenge – I just felt unmotivated. Despite this, I pushed through, and my past hard work paid off: I landed the highest-paying job at a major MNC in my college. I’m proud of this, but the problem persists. Now, with my degree wrapping up in the next 2-3 months, I want to use this time to improve myself, but I can’t focus on anything. I’ve lost the drive to learn new languages or build projects. Worse, I’m experiencing back pain from too much screen time, which makes me avoid my laptop altogether. I suspect I’m addicted to high-dopamine activities like gaming and YouTube Shorts, which make it impossible to start anything productive. My mind feels like it’s rejecting coding and my laptop for no clear reason.I’ve attempted every productivity strategy. I desperately want to be that person again who could code all day without distractions, but I feel stuck. This has been going on for almost a year, and I’m worried about starting my job in this unmotivated state. Has anyone else experienced this shift from being passionate and productive to feeling unmotivated and unable to focus? How did you overcome it?I’d love to hear your experiences, suggestions, or even just know I’m not alone in this.

Everyone seems to be using the same implementation, and it works fine in simulation without any errors: CHIP Memory { IN in[16], load, address[15]; OUT out[16]; PARTS: DMux4Way(in=load, sel=address[13..14], a=loadram1, b=loadram2, c=loadscreen, d=loadkbd); Or(a=loadram1, b=loadram2, out=loadram); RAM16K(in=in, load=loadram, address=address[0..13], out=ramout); Screen(in=in, load=loadscreen, address=address[0..12], out=scrout); Keyboard(out=kbout); Mux4Way16(a=ramout, b=ramout, c=scrout, d=kbout, sel=address[13..14], out=out); }Now, based on this design, I expected the following code to read a value from the keyboard and store it into `RAM[1]`: (loop) @24577 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPHere's my reasoning:* `@24577` sets the A register to 24577.* That value is passed to the Memory chip as the address.* The most significant bits (bits 13 and 14) are both 1, so according to the HDL, the `Keyboard` chip should be selected.* So `out` should reflect the keyboard's output.* Then `D=M` loads the keyboard value into the D register.* `@1` sets A to 1, and `M=D` writes the value to RAM\[1\].Now, here’s my confusion: How is this different from the following? (loop) @24576 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPBoth 24576 and 24577 have the same top two bits (13 and 14 = 11), so shouldn't they both route to the keyboard? Why would one work differently from the other if the given chip structure is true?edit: in the code section some parts were typed as “u/…” instead of “@…” . I fixed them.

Besides interviewing myself once in a while for practice, I've also been involved in interviewing candidates at my company.After enough exposure on both sides of the table, something became pretty clear to me: Being able to solve problems isn’t what sets you apart. Explaining them is.Solving a question correctly is important, of course. But what really stands out is how clearly and naturally someone can walk others through their thought process. It’s not about over-narrating or reciting a rehearsed script. What makes a difference is:Framing your approach in simple, accessible terms Surfacing trade-offs before you're even asked Staying steady and unfazed when edge cases come up, as if you already thought about them Because of this, I gradually adjusted how I prepare for interviews, even casual ones. I still solve problems as usual, but now I also practice summarizing the solution in one or two clean sentences, basically a ""30-second version"", then being ready to dive deeper if needed.Sometimes, I’ll use a tool that offers multiple solution paths and points out which parts are worth verbalizing, not just coding. It’s helped me avoid slipping into the ""just code it"" mindset.Curious if others have similar experiences.

1k5y2ma,Big O notation and general misunderstanding,divad1196,learnprogramming,"Disclaimer: this post is also to vent.I got into a debate on something that I didn't think was so badly understood. The debate was with people claiming that ""big O notation is just counting the number of instructions"" and ""you must abstract away things like CPU"".These claims are formally incorrect and only apply for specific contexts. The big O (and little o) notation is a mathematical concept to explain how something grow. It is never mentionned ""instruction"" as this isn't a mathematical concept. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)The reason why we ""abstract"" the CPU, and other stuff, is because if 2 algorithms run on the same computer, we can expect them be impacted in the same way. ""All instruction take the same time"" (not all instruction take the same time, but the execution duration of an instruction is considered majored by a constant. A constant doesn't impact the growth, we can define this number to be `1`). In **simple** cases, the time is a function of the the number of instruction `n`, something like `duration(n) -> INSTRUCTION_DT * n` When you compare 2 univariate (""mono-variadic"") algorithms in the same context, you get things like `dt * n_1 > dt * n_2`. For `dt > 0`, you can simplify the comparison with `n_1 > n_2`.Similarly, when the number of instruction is fix on one side and vary on the other side, then it's easier to approximate a constant by `1`. The big O notation cares about the growth, there is none and that's all we care about, so replace a constant by 1 makes sense.Back to the initial point: we don't ""count the instruction"" or ""abstract"" something. We are trying to define how somethings grows.Now, the part where I vent.The debate started because I agreed with someone's example on an algorithm with a time complexity of `O(1/n)`. The example of code was `n => sleep(5000/n)`.The response I got was ""it's 1 instruction, so O(1)` and this is incorrect. `O(1)` in time complexity would mean: ""even if I change the value of N, the program will take the same time to finish"" whereas it is clear here that the bigger N is, the faster the program finishes.If I take the opposite example: `n => sleep(3600 * n)` and something like `Array(n).keys().reduce((a, x) => a + x))`Based on their response, the first one has a time complexity of `O(1)` and the second one `O(n)`. Based on that, the first one should be faster, which is never the case.Same thing with space complexity: does `malloc(sizeof(int) * 10)` has the same space complexity has `malloc(sizeof(int) * n)` ? No. The first one is `O(1)` because it doesn't grow, while the second one is `O(n)`The reason for misunderstanding the big O notation is IMO:- school simplify the context (which is okay)- people using it never got the context.Of course, that's quite a niche scenario to demonstrate the big O misconception. But it exposes an issue that I often see in IT: people often have a narrow/contextual understanding on things. This causes, for example, security issues. Yet, most people will prefer to stick to their believes than learning.Additional links (still wikipedia, but good enough)- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory (see ""Important Complexity Classes"")- DTIME complexity: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTIME",5,0.59,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k5y2ma/big_o_notation_and_general_misunderstanding/,2025-04-23 12:36:19,2025-04-29 01:39:03

The problem is I'm not sure how to use classes/interfaces properly I was thinking about doing something like this: ```class IAssetImporter {public:~IAssetImporter() = default;virtual void importByFile() = 0;};class AssimpImporter : public IAssetImporter {};class StbImporter : public IAssetImporter {};```But I'm not sure if it makes more sense to do something like this:```class IMeshImporter {};class AssimpImporter : public IMeshImporter {};class ITextureImporter {};class StbImporter : public ITextureImporter {};```I don't think it's necessary to have an interface per type to me it just seems like bloat but as with most things in programming I'm usually wrong.,3,0.72,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1k788uj/is_it_practical_to_create_a_interface_per_type_c/,2025-04-25 00:50:09,2025-04-29 01:39:03

1k9e9p6,Mourning My Tech Career. I’m Leaving for More Pay and Stability.,Hazjut,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR:After years of chasing a tech career that never paid or stabilized, I am leaving for a career that can support a family and offer real security. I still love tech, but I had to move on to survive.I thought tech would be the future I built my life on. It didn’t work out.I chased a tech career for years, but it never came together. Ironically, I made the equivalent of around $80k a year in the military before I even had a degree, and some years a bit more. After graduating, despite years of effort, I never made over $80k again. After unstable contracts, low pay, no benefits, and rising living costs, I found a different career starting around $140k total comp and quickly climbs toward $200k and beyond, offering real retirement options and meaning that tech never did for me.I started coding for fun at 16, back in 2006. It was not rare, but it was far less common than it is today. When college came, I should have taken on debt and jumped into tech earlier. But I saw loans like credit card debt, and my family did too. We did not understand grants or aid. I was the first in my family to pursue a degree. Instead, I joined the military to pay for college.While serving, I started taking tech seriously. I built projects, took classes early, and did well both academically and physically. I am a combat veteran. After leaving, I moved to a major west coast city, earned a degree from a respected state university, and started trying to build a tech career.I completed two internships at large tech companies, but after graduating around the time layoffs began sweeping the industry, I could not find work for about a year. When I finally broke in, I spent the next few years grinding through mostly contract roles, including development, support, and program management, at two FAANG companies. Most paid well under $80k, with no benefits. Even working over 40 hours a week, I was barely surviving. And it left me drained trying to find new work throughout those three years while I worked over 40 hours. I had eventually applied to thousands of jobs even though many were targeted applications. It was consuming my life with no benefit.Over the last few years, I interviewed for about 20 roles, but nothing stuck. Pay stagnated, inflation rose, contracts ended, interviews were canceled mid-process because of layoffs and outsourcing. I did not want to leave tech. But eventually, the cost of living made it impossible to stay. I am starting a family and I want to buy a home, and the path I was on in tech could not support either.I needed something meaningful I could rely on for career growth and stability. That is when I turned to law enforcement. It shares some overlap with the military in structure, though it is not the same. For me the constant deployments were the only thing I didn't enjoy, and this is the closest I could find that felt similar without needing to travel overseas constantly. It felt like a better fit for the life I needed to build.Now, I am starting my new career. In many major west coast cities, law enforcement compensation surprisingly matches or beats the tech roles I once chased. Retirement comes in your early 50s if you want it, without penalty. I plan to use my GI Bill for a master's degree and eventually specialize in areas like police forensics. It is already improving my quality of life.I am mourning the career and identity I once imagined. But I am hopeful about what lies ahead. This path will eventually give me the freedom, disposable income, and stability to return to tech on my own terms, whether that means building my own product, starting a company, or, if nothing else, creating open-source tools that still have real impact. It may not look like the dream I once had, but it might be a better one.For now, it is another opportunity for someone else who loves this field the way it demands. I am finally choosing a path that fits me, and I do not regret it.",879,0.88,251,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k9e9p6/mourning_my_tech_career_im_leaving_for_more_pay/,2025-04-27 20:55:59,2025-04-29 01:39:04

1k8mffu,Ok I'll admit it.. I was wrong about non-tech companies. I can DEFINITELY see the appeal now.,cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"I just want to put a disclaimer: I am not saying FAANG or Big Tech sucks. It has its pros, but it also has its cons. Same with non-tech companies. But looking back on my years in the industry.. I just want to reflect on my experience and post about it.When I was just starting out, I thought I had it all figured out. Like so many others in this sub, I had one goal drilled into my brain: FAANG or bust. I thought if I was not at a top tech company or at least something adjacent, I was failing. That prestige, that resume clout, that salary, it was all that mattered.Fast forward to today. I am at a FAANG-adjacent company, something people would brag about on LinkedIn, and honestly I am exhausted. I am not even talking about having a busy week tired. I am talking about chronic, soul-sucking, life-flattening exhaustion. Every day feels like running a marathon at a sprinter's pace. There is an endless barrage of Slack messages, Jira tickets, unexpected urgent meetings, and late-night pings that just need a quick review. Every quarter feels like another round of brutal performance reviews where you are judged against metrics that seem to move the second you get close to hitting them.Even my friends who made it into the actual FAANG companies are not living the dream. They are constantly worried about the next round of layoffs. They are stuck in environments where one minor mistake can tank their rating and put their career at risk. Some are taking anxiety medication now. Some do not even enjoy coding anymore, something that used to be their passion. It has been hard to watch.And then there are my other friends.The ones I used to quietly judge. The ones who went into banking tech, insurance companies, healthcare systems, government contractors. The so-called safe non-tech companies.When we catch up, the contrast is hard to ignore. They work 20 to 30 hours a week. They log off by 4 PM, laptops closed until the next morning. No emergency production issues in the middle of the night. No hyper-aggressive performance reviews. No constant fear about the next reorg or layoff. Their companies are profitable and stable and not reacting to every market fluctuation with mass job cuts.They are happy. Genuinely happy.They have hobbies. They go hiking. They build side projects for fun. They go to the gym without feeling guilty. They spend time with family, with friends, with themselves. They are not worried about falling behind because their companies are not built on a culture of constant comparison.When I look at them now, I see peace. A peace I forgot was even possible in this industry.I was so obsessed with winning early on that I did not realize how much I was sacrificing along the way. My health. My happiness. My actual life outside of work. I thought prestige would make it all worth it, but you cannot deposit mental stability into a bank account. You cannot get back the years of stress you burned through trying to chase a logo on a resume.I am proud of what I have achieved. But if I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: ***Prestige is not everything. Stability and happiness matter more than any brand name ever will.***To anyone out there grinding away and feeling miserable but telling themselves it will all be worth it once they get to the next step.

The market is still shit, people are still getting laid off, job stability is still at an all time low.Where’s the silver lining? Because I don’t see one.Are these jobs permanently gone? Let’s be real with ourselves. Manufacturing jobs were outsourced a few decades ago in the US and literally never came back.

You’re telling me there’s no good engineers in India that don’t speak fluent English? Please.American engineers aren’t special. Companies have figured out during the remote years that outsourcing is still easier than ever.Now do I think all of us will get outsourced? No. But will it become manufacturing? Maybe the extremely complex things like computer chips are manufactured in first world countries like Korea/taiwan. And everything else is in 3rd world. What is the average joe in the US going to do?

1k6c2it,Actual career advice: Don’t argue with your manager (especially with feedback),mpaes98,cscareerquestions,"Wanted to share an anecdotal wisdom I’ve developed that I continue to see early career professionals do that hurts them; voicing disagreement with your manager will 99% of the time hurt you. Let’s say your manager corrects you over something that wasn’t your fault. In that case, trying to make an argument that you aren’t responsible for something is more likely to make you seem like you can’t take accountability.Or, in a feedback session, you get negative reviews from them on your performance for what seems like arbitrary reasons and you want to give an explanation/justification. In this case, there’s no explaining away what they’ve decided. You’re more likely to come off as insecure and argumentative for talking back.I’m not going to give a speech about how maybe you need to do self-reflection and practice humility; sometimes you’ll be in the right and you know you’re in the right. But career-wise, being right < manager being pleased.90% of the time, your manager has already made up his mind on how he feels about a situation.Part of your manager’s role is assessing your performance and giving feedback. So when you push back, not only are you expressing that you disagree with their opinion, you’re also coming across that you think you are better at their job than them (maybe you are?).I write this because I’m usually a self-advocate outside of work, but I’ve gotten to a point where I have to tell myself “it’s not worth it” quite a bit because of how important it is to not be a problem employee in this economy. The best recoveries I’ve had when I’m given feedback or told negative things (that I personally feel like are not my fault) is to not disagree or try to explain, it’s just thank them for the feedback and keep working.",290,0.89,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6c2it/actual_career_advice_dont_argue_with_your_manager/,2025-04-23 22:15:50,2025-04-29 01:39:04
1ka4cop,What is it that makes fresh grads so incredibly unhireable?,BusDriver341,cscareerquestions,"Are they really that incompetent/useless? How long does it actually take them to become productive? I remember back before covid when bootcamps were popping. A lot of them were advertising and boasting that their (bootcamp grads) were becoming productive in a few weeks, while it took university grads 1 year to become productive (based on market research). Does it actually take that long?I've also heard stories that a surprisingly large number of fresh grads can't even solve fizzbuzz.I find all of this stuff so puzzling. Say that you graduated with a degree in CS. Maybe you have one fullstack CRUD app to your name as a personal project, and maybe you did a team project in school where you used git and worked with a team of people where you made a technical toy project that required some problem solving, no fancy UI or anything like that.What is realistically that difference between this person and someone who has 2-3 years work experience as a developer that also have to learn a new tech stack? I can't really see why the new grad would necessarily be worse, or not given a chance. To me it mostly comes down to IQ, personal ability, personality, communication skills etc. Sure, in an application process its hard to give the ""new grad"" a chance. But if you give them an interview at least they can show their personality/how they think about things. I've also heard that everyone is saying that there's 1000 applicants for every job, that's why people with 0 experience get 0 interviews. But how is that even possible, and wouldn't it eventually even out? If there's 20k available jobs, and 20k available candidates, some jobs aren't being filled. I guess new grads are just so incredibly bad that the loss of hiring them is way bigger than not having a filled position?Also how does AI play into this? Is juniors just so bad that any senior just automatically does the job now with AI 10x as fast? So there's no need for juniors?",240,0.88,181,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ka4cop/what_is_it_that_makes_fresh_grads_so_incredibly/,2025-04-28 19:32:39,2025-04-29 01:39:04

1k8gaf9,Protobuf vs custom binary protocol for hiring in the long term,Pyciko_,cscareerquestions,"Hello. I'm a programmer in a tech startup that develops IoT devices for on-water activities as well as a companion app for them. Due to the nature of our usage case, we sometimes have to operate in bad network conditions: the internet bandwidth may be small, the link between smart trackers and user's phones may be unstable.. etc.. A binary protocol is such a good fit for this situation: saves the bandwidth, allows to have a unification between TCP and Bluetooth comms, works great on low-ram IoT devices. My first look went into Protobuf of course, as it slowly shapes like a new ""JSON of binary world"". But when I started digging deeper, I discovered that it has multiple big downsides and I can easily fix them if I make my own proto (spoiler: I made it).1. The generated code is HUGE (especially in Dart which is used for frontend).2. It doesn't support classes inheritance. Inheritance can be bad in some cases, but if inheriting a class with some common fields halves the codebase size, I do want to have that option.3. Some features like Enums are replaced by strange stuff like int consts (again, Dart code looks even worse)4. That whole stuff with optionals and fallback defaults isn't reliable: if it's a backwards compatible protocol, the fields have to be explicitly nullable without any fallback values.5. You can just make a bitfield for null values at the start of the message, and by doing so, you can get rid of the field headers (id + type) entirely: the id doesn't exist because fields are sequential, the type is known in schema. If receiver schema is old and transmitter has sent some unknown fields, these fields are always at the end of the message, so you can just skip these bytes.And so what I did is I actually wrote a protocol myself, and tested it for a while. Now, even though I still love it, my mind keeps thinking about the following problem: if and when the time comes to hire more people, how do I explain this tech stack to them? Protobuf is a well-known thing, we can just put it as a requirement and be okay. But what about in-house solution? Also, if we need to add another programming language the our system, the protocol has to be implemented by someone.Now I'm doubting if I should continue working with our in-house protocol, or switch to Protobuf. My questions are:1. Is an average developer ready to learn custom binary protocols?2. In other companies using binary protocols, how popular is it to write a custom one and how do employees feel about using it?3. Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?",20,0.82,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k8gaf9/protobuf_vs_custom_binary_protocol_for_hiring_in/,2025-04-26 16:01:09,2025-04-29 01:39:04
1k7yw44,Reluctance to hire ex-FANG in a mid-sized area?,thefox13guy,cscareerquestions,"I've been a programmer professionally since the late 00s. I'm in Portland, which is just a mid-sized market, but still has plenty of tech jobs. I've worked at small startups as the first or second full time dev, some mid-sized companies, and FANG. I've been through a few acquisitions and survived many layoffs.Well, I was recently laid off for the first time from a mid-sized, B-tier tech company that I was having a great time at, so I am out there applying again. It was due to the typical offshoring trend and I was grateful to have survived a few rounds of layoffs and wasn't too worried. I've never had a hard time getting responses from local companies, and probably most of the time I would get interviews, and most interviews I would get an offer. But this time is different.I've applied for about two dozen companies (hybrid or onsite, haven't expanded to remote yet) and gotten almost no response. I think I am more than qualified for them and am perfectly fine with the compensation and all of that (ie, I wasn't just randomly blasting applications out there, I was picking things I genuinely wanted to do). 2-3 companies sent me a rejection based on my application, I've talked to 2-3 recruiters, and had one ""onsite"" interview. So let's just say I've gotten any response at all from about 25-30% of the companies I sent applications to. This is much lower than I'm used to.Here is the thing: I'm starting to wonder if having been at FANG and Big Tech (even though it was B-tier) most recently has hurt my chances. Just a few years ago I would've thought that having FANG would be a huge benefit for job hunting. And the 2-3 recruiters I've talked to seemed to like it, like it would make me a more marketable candidate.But after the one onsite interview, I started to question that for the first time. I was prepared for a technical interview with maybe some behavioral, but the interviewer asked me quite a bit about FANG. I was surprised and got the feeling they thought negatively of it, like asking me about certain projects and responding with, ""So, you're saying you just wrote some Java?"" with a tone that they were downplaying what I did there.Don't get me wrong. Everything at FANG wasn't very impressive. The whole thing is mostly a joke (esp. the LeetCode interviews and corporate Kool Aid) and FANG tends to be a grindhouse for new grads who otherwise have no other experience, not a bunch of math geniuses writing crazy algorithms. But prior to that interview I didn't stop to think if I should mention it in my work history; it seemed obvious that I should. Now I'm starting to wonder all sorts of things like maybe companies are gonna think I'll ask for hundreds of thousands, that I only know how to do ""Big Tech non-sense"", or that I'll be a hard to work with.Do any hiring managers or ex-FANG have any thoughts on this? Seeing as how I am just looking for a local tech job where I can get work done and enjoy my time with the team, maybe I should just remove it from my work history?",19,0.66,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k7yw44/reluctance_to_hire_exfang_in_a_midsized_area/,2025-04-25 23:22:26,2025-04-29 01:39:04

Problem the team sees is the loss of direct access to these libraries is a loss of control and potential unknowingly misusing the underlying library through the abstraction layers.Giving up the need to have intimate knowledge about these libraries feels like strapping on a blind fold and never knowing how you got to the destination.

But it's just seeing that he's getting a bit more anxious than usual and seeing that he's a bit snappier leads me into feeling like he's almost (again, hard to say for sure) being a bit passive-aggressive with wanting us - or, at the very least, me - to pump things out quicker but with less bugs. idk, I just somehow get the feeling like I'm not living up to what he wants, and it makes me feel a bit disappointed in myself.",16,0.88,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6bzy4/anyone_else_ever_feel_like_youre_not_getting/,2025-04-23 22:12:42,2025-04-29 01:39:04

I know it's tough out there.* How can they make the most of these opportunities?For example, what if the job uses a completely different tech stack than what you've worked with throughout your career, or even worse, historically the market don't want this tech stack, or if the role is different (i.e. transitioning from backend to frontend heavy fullstack), or you're not interested in the domain (i.e. insurance)? If you plan to stay in this job for at least 3 years while waiting for the job market to improve (if it ever does), how can you make the most of the situation?In my experience, becoming a domain expert and the goto person in a part of the system it's what makes you grow within an organization. However, becoming an expert requires time and effort, and both of these have an opportunity cost.So knowing that time is finite and I can just study so much while keeping all my other adult responsibilities, should I focus on becoming an expert in this new tech stack and domain to take ownership and grow, in detriment of my original stack, knowing that my original stack is still evolving and requires ongoing study, and that I might never use this new stack again?",13,0.69,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k990t6/how_to_make_the_most_of_a_stepping_stone_job/,2025-04-27 17:12:27,2025-04-29 01:39:04

I spent my first year working as a consultant and have since been working as a fullstack engineer, with a heavy focus on backend engineering.Currently, I'm at a large tech company — maybe a step or two below FAANG — but it's a name most people would recognize. Lately, though, I've been feeling stagnant. I'm still classified as an entry-level engineer in terms of pay and title, even though I'm consistently performing at a level or two above that. (That's not just my opinion — both my manager and two technical mentors have told me this.)For example, as a Level 1 engineer, I'm technically supposed to be mostly taking tickets, relying on senior engineers for clarification, and developing technical depth in one main language. In reality, my day-to-day work involves starting and completing projects independently, defining requirements while working with outside stakeholders, implementing new technologies into our tools, and even managing a contractor. There’s a big gap between my responsibilities and my official title.Some extra context: since joining my current role, my company has gone through two rounds of layoffs, and my team has been moved under two different organizations (so I've had two different skip-level managers). Although no one has explicitly said it, I suspect that promotions are being slowed or avoided to cut costs, especially since the current job market makes it less likely that people will leave. Promotions *have* happened elsewhere in the company, but not on my team.That said, if I didn't enjoy my job, I would just risk it and leave. But the truth is, I actually like it. My boss is supportive, my work-life balance is solid, and the benefits are good. The only real issue is that my career growth — specifically my title and pay — feels stuck. Technically, I'm still learning and working on interesting problems, so in that sense I’m not stagnant.I'm looking for advice on what to do next. Stay patient and hope things change?

I'm a career switcher and ex-military, so this isn't my first job overall.My main goal is to get promoted, and I know that I can't do that without the support of my manager. However, I get the feeling that my manager either doesn't care/ doesn't want me to get promoted, or maybe my manager is fine and I'm simply not at the required level yet.Usually when we talk/ have 1 on 1s, it's almost always terse, and he seems almost angry/ annoyed to be there. I am a very calm person who is easy to get along with, so I'm almost positive that it isn't my attitude causing this.He will also call me out publically in front of the team/ grill me on technical details in meetings (he does this to others, not just me). This is odd to me, because prior to the tech industry, I followed the standard of praise in public, punish in private. Not sure if this is normal or not.Generally speaking, I get the feeling that my manager just simply doesn't like me or want/ care about my success. I have not once felt like he was on my side, rather that he is a barrier that I would need to overcome to get to where I want to go.Despite this, I've heard from others that he is a good manager. Maybe this is true and I'm misinterpreting things, or maybe they are afraid/ careful to speak out? This is a company known for its toxic culture, so I would keep that in mind as a possibility.Any thoughts on this?

Job market was rough for international students, and big tech wasn’t hiring, but I was fortunate enough to get a return offer from my internship at a mid-sized company. I was doing ML research and modelling work in a lab before my job but I’m now working in the ML Platform/MLOps team.Work involves building big data platforms, data drift monitoring, IAC, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, model deployment, Docker, load balancers, async programming, and building semantic search engines.Stack: Python, PySpark, AWS, Databricks, Docker, Pulumi, asyncio.Fully remote, good WLB, $118k base + $50k~$60k RSUs over 4 years with a bulk of it vested towards the end. Grateful to have something stable in this economy. But the compensation doesn’t increase much in the long run in my company compared to big tech and its always been my dream to work at a big tech like google.A few questions:1. ML work here in my company is mostly calling LLM APIs which I find boring. One of the main reasons why I switched to MLOps. If you are an MLE at a big tech how does your work look like? If I pivot, I’d want to focus on Information Retrieval/RecSys.2. I enjoy the engineering side more. Should I stay in ML Platform roles or move toward more traditional MLE roles?3. How’s ML Platform Engineering for long-term career growth? 4. Should I stay a year more and try for SDE 2 equivalent roles at FAANG/big tech? ( I will have 3 YoE by next march including my internships and work experience before masters). Hearing bad things about Meta/Amazon WLB and layoffs.

I currently work at a local Fortune 500 company's office making ~$85k/year, and have been here for almost a year. I've accepted an offer as an SDE-1 from one of the major tech giants for approximately double my current salary. The new offer is in the same city, so thankfully I don't have to handle moving logistics along with everything else here.I have received e-contracts that I've clicked ""sign"" on (not sure how binding these are?), and their background check is currently underway. I have *not* been introduced to my manager or gotten team match confirmation yet, but I've heard that this can often take until a week before your start date at this specific company. Technically the offer could still be rescinded, but I think that's fairly unlikely.My start date at the new company is June 9th, and I have a pre-planned europe trip the last half of May. I'm trying to decide between three options:1. Resign now: Give my full two weeks' notice, finish cleanly, then enjoy my vacation and an additional week completely job-free before starting the new position.2. Resign after vacation: Return from my trip and immediately submit my resignation, giving slightly less than two weeks for documentation and handover. This approach would also eliminate any risk of the offer being rescinded while I'm already unemployed.3. Sandwich notice period with vacation: Resign one week before vacation, and offer to work one more week after I get back. This would give them a long time to decide what to do, and would hopefully let the background check clear before I give them notice of my departure. The downside is mostly that this would feel kind of weird to me, but maybe it's more normal than I think?What would be the most professional approach in this situation?

I didn't choose to be in COBOL; that's what they trained and assigned me to and I didn't have anywhere else to go to at that time. I could have left and tried to go for a more useful tech stack after 2 years but the pandemic happened so looking for a new job was impossible. When the pandemic ended, I eventually got to move to a different company and do Java development instead.My problem is, I only have 2+ years of professional experience with Java. I've been working for way longer than that but I'm treated more like a mid level developer because my only experience in Java is that long and nobody seems to care about my 4 years of experience in COBOL because to be quite honest, it's a really outdated language. I'm unable to break into the senior developer level in my company because I need more years of experience with Java.To make things worse, I have zero work experience in frameworks, APIs, microservices, cloud development, etc. The Java project I worked on didn't have those, or at least didn't have me do work in those. I never got to work on CI/CD or databases because that's not the task I got assigned to. I got to do side tasks like automation with Excel VBA macros but that doesn't seem to be as helpful for my resume as it sounds.Meanwhile, I see others younger than me get to be 5 years of experience, have experience with things like AWS, microservices, frameworks, RedHat, containers, etc.Did they just get lucky in their projects and I got unlucky? How do I even ask my manager to put me in a project that allows me to gain experience with cloud development, microservices, frameworks, and all that trendy stuff?

1k6nwhk,"Torn between SE, ES and ML",louleads,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR : I have built some projects in ES and SE and liked ES a bit more but find SE to have more opportunities even though it might become so boring and hellish. Didn't try building any ML projects but I think ML jobs will be highly demanded in the future due to the fast progress of AI and what people are saying online (maybe thats just hype).I can't decide between software engineering, embedded systems and machine learning. I like them all and have had experience with some of them but I know that I can't be a jack of all trades.For embedded systems, I have built 2 arduino projects back in high school (currently I'm in my second year of CS uni). First one was a basic project with some LEDs and some code to make the LEDs light in different ways. Second one was a car that follows a black line and avoids obstacles. I really enjoyed and loved it. Though I have no idea what the market is for ES.For software engineering, I have not made any full projects, just some basic terminal projects, like fizzbuzz and some python scripts that automated some tasks for me. I'm currently in the process of making my first uni project (a games library with search and user authentification functionalities). I'm also going to have an internship this summer as a web dev. I enjoyed the small projects a lot, but I don't know how I'll feel about this project by the time I finish it or about the web dev internship. However, I think I have the best chance at this since I'm from a third world country and I think finding jobs in SE would be easier (not easy, just easier).For machine learning, I haven't tried anything yet. I have planned a final project for my bachelors, which is going to be an AI customer support agent (a family member has a business and suggested I try making that tool for their business). I don't know anything about ML, but I know it requires a lot of math, and I've been a math nerd since high school (solved about 1000+ math problems in my last year of high school). I also think that ML will be a ""goldmine"" for those who choose it now because I keep seeing online that ML jobs will be in high demand in the future.I know I'm deciding what I want to do based on my feelings, but I want to choose something that I'm not gonna regret by the time I turn 30. For example, I like some aspects of software engineering, but I do know that many software engineers hate their jobs because of how shit the work environment is in many companies (too many meetings, coding the same shit everyday...etc).What should I base my decision on? Preference? Market state? Opportunities?And how should I know if I actually enjoy any of these (if I should choose based on passion)?I appreciate anybody who took the time to read this.",4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1k6nwhk/torn_between_se_es_and_ml/,2025-04-24 09:22:39,2025-04-29 01:39:04

1kaan9k,30 days into Network operations role -- Did I step into unsustainable chaos?,Fit_Personality_2191,cscareerquestions,"I started a new position 30 days ago at an MSP (Managed Service Provider) as a Network Operations Manager.My original understanding was that I'd lead infrastructure migration projects at a structured, strategic pace — taking ownership of planning, execution, and building operational discipline.I knew the environment might be somewhat messy — and I actually saw that as an opportunity to bring structure where it was needed.But instead, an existing senior team member (let's call him Mark) immediately flooded the process with urgency:– Meetings all day, often back-to-back– Little to no time to plan deeply, reflect, or organize properly– Constant interruptions and ad hoc requests — expectation to be hyper-responsive– No official timeline from leadership, but Mark imposed a fast-track timeline anywayMeanwhile, the CTO — who I technically report to — is largely absent:– Doesn’t respond to emails– Doesn’t return calls– Occasionally appears briefly (e.g., grabbing a sandwich at the airport) but otherwise offers no active guidanceI also hired two team members early on, originally planning to assign them to focused infrastructure projects.But with the current chaos, they are now being treated as generalists, expected to somehow cover a wide range of topics, including undocumented environments.Additionally, while I was never explicitly told it was a ""cloud-first MSP,"" the way the role was presented (focused on infrastructure modernization and migration leadership) led me to assume it was heavily cloud-oriented.In reality:– Only about 20% of the infrastructure is actually cloud-based.– Roughly 40% is legacy systems, many undocumented, requiring reverse engineering just to understand what's running.(For context, during the interview I asked for a website to learn more about the company, and was told they didn’t have one — in hindsight, that probably should have been a red flag.)The biggest problem:I was hired to bring structure, but the current rhythm is so accelerated that trying to implement thoughtful leadership would simply slow things down.In short:– I feel I’ve lost the leadership narrative I was hired for.– I’m being forced to play at their chaotic rhythm instead of leading with my own structure and pace.Mark himself is extremely intense:– Wakes up at 3–5 AM– Eats lunch by 9 AM– Spends afternoons studying for certifications — while pushing the team at full speedI was aiming for a leadership role where I could build, structure, and scale — not a permanent crisis-response role in a fragmented environment.Am I overreacting?Is this just what IT leadership looks like today?You're welcome to criticize me.I’d appreciate any references:– Is this 50%, 70%, 90% of IT leadership roles now?– Is this common across MSPs?– Or are there still companies where structured leadership and thoughtful execution are respected?\-- Does it make sense to stay 2 weeks more, or do you see a long term position worth enduring?Thanks for reading — I’m trying to calibrate my expectations.",3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kaan9k/30_days_into_network_operations_role_did_i_step/,2025-04-29 00:09:19,2025-04-29 01:39:04
