1ktpgcf,"New data engineer getting paid more than me, a senior DE",Yoyo_Baggins,dataengineering,"I found out that a new data engineer coming onto my team is making a few thousand more than me (a senior thats been with the company several years) annually, despite this new DE having less direct/applicable experience than me. Having to be a bit vague for obvious reasons. I have been a top individual contributor on my team every year. Every review I've received from management is overwhelmingly positive. This new DE and I are in the same geographic area, so thats not the explanation. How should I broach this with my management without: - revealing that I am 100% sure what this new DE is making, - threatening to leave if they don't up my pay, - getting myself on the short list for layoffsWe just finished our annual reviews. This pay disparity is even after I received a meager merit raise. Anyone else navigated this? Am I really going to have to company hop just to get paid a fair market salary? I want to stay at this company. I like what I do, but I also need more money to make ends meet.EDIT (copying a comment I left): I guess I should have said this in the original post, but I already tried this before our annual reviews. I provided evidence of my contribution, asked for a specific annual salary increase, and wanted it to be part of my annual increase which had a specific deadline. What I ended up getting was a bunch of excuses as to why it wasn't possible, empty promises of things they might be able to do for me later this year, and a meager merit raise well below inflation.So, to take your advice and many others here, sounds like I should just start looking elsewhere.",201,0.93,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ktpgcf/new_data_engineer_getting_paid_more_than_me_a/,2025-05-23 17:31:03,2025-05-25 01:48:48

1ksw491,I don’t know how Dev & Prod environments work in Data Engineering,Reddit-Kangaroo,dataengineering,"Forgive me if this is a silly question. I recently started as a junior DE.Say we have a simple pipeline that pulls data from Postgres and loads into a Snowflake table. If I want to make changes to it without a Dev environment - I might manually change the ""target"" table to a test table I've set up (maybe a clone of the target table), make updates, test, change code back to the real target table when happy, PR, and merge into the main branch of GitHub. I'm assuming this is what teams do that don't have a Dev environment?If I did have a Dev environment, what might the high level process look like? Would it make sense to:- have a Dev branch in GitHub- some sort of overnight sync to clone all target tables we work with to a Dev schema in Snowflake, using a mapping file of some sort - paramaterise all scripts so that when they're merged to Prod (Main) they are looking at the actual target tables, but in Dev they're looking at the the Dev (cloned) tables?

But the need — a simple, internal way to spin up data environments, turned out to be much more universal. Onyxia is now used by teams in Norway, at the UN, and in the US, among others.At its core, Onyxia is a web app (packaged as a Helm chart) that lets users log in (via OIDC), choose from a service catalog, configure resources (CPU, GPU, Docker image, env vars, launch script…), and deploy to their own K8s namespace.Highlights:- Admin-defined service catalog using Helm charts + `values.schema.json` → Onyxia auto-generates dynamic UI forms.- Native S3 integration with web UI and token-based access. Files uploaded through the browser are instantly usable in services.- Vault-backed secrets injected into running containers as env vars.- One-click links for launching preconfigured setups (widely used for teaching or onboarding).- DuckDB-Wasm file viewer for exploring large parquet/csv/json files directly in-browser.- Full white label theming, colors, logos, layout, even injecting custom JS/CSS.There’s a public instance at [datalab.sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) for French students, teachers, and researchers, running on real compute (including H100 GPUs).If your org is trying to build an internal alternative to Databricks or Workbench-style setups — without vendor lock-in, curious to hear your take.",37,0.89,18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvpNfVrxBFM,2025-05-21 09:21:39,2025-05-25 01:48:48

Written from scratch to support long-running Spark clusters and newer Spark 3.5/4.x features. Choose this if you need on-demand clusters or Spark Connect server features.Apparently, the Apache team started fresh because the older Kubeflow operator's Go codebase and webhook-heavy design wouldn't fit ASF governance.

1ksyj2m,Best practice for scd type 2,Constant-Gear1206,dataengineering,"I just started at a company where my fellow DE’s want to store history of all the data that’s coming in. This team is quite new and has done one project with scd type2 before. The use case is that history will be saved in scd format in the bronze layer. I’ve noticed that a couple of my colleagues have different understandings of what goes in the valid_from and valid_to columns. One says that they get snapshots of the day before and that the business wants the reports based on the day that the data was in the source system and therefore we should put current_date -1 in the valid_from.The other colleague says that it should be the current_date because that’s when we are inserting it in the dwh. Argument is that when a snapshot hasn’t been delivered you are missing that data and the next day it is delivered, you’re telling the business that’s the day it was active in the source system, while that might not be the case.Personally, second argument sounds way more logical and bullet proof since the burden won’t be on us, but I also get the first argument.Wondering how you’re doing this in your projects.",23,0.91,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ksyj2m/best_practice_for_scd_type_2/,2025-05-22 18:46:05,2025-05-25 01:48:48

1kpaisy,Is it a bad idea to use DuckDB as my landing zone format in S3?,DuckDatum,dataengineering,"I’m polling data out of a system that forces a strict quota, pagination, and requires I fanout my requests per record in order to denormalize its HATEAOS links into nested data that can later be flattened into a tabular model. It’s a lot, likely because the interface wasn’t intended for this purpose. It’s what I’ve got though. It’s slow with lots of steps to potentially fail at. All that, and I can only filter at a days granularity—so polling for changes is a loaded process too.I went ahead and set up an ETL pipeline that used DuckDB as an intermediate caching layer, to avoid memory issues, and set it up to dump parquet into S3. This ran for 24 hours then failed just shy of the dump, so now I’m thinking about micro batches.I want to turn this into a microbatch process. I figure I can cache the ID, HATEAOS link, and a nullable column for the JSON data. Once I have the data, I update the row where it belongs. I could store duckdb in S3 the whole time, or just plan to dump it if a failure occurs. This also gives a way to query the duckdb for missing records in case it fails mid way.So before I dump duckdb into S3, or even try to use duckdb in s3 over a network, are there limitations I’m not considering?

1ktkqj6,Modular Data Pipeline (Microservices + Delta Lake) for Live ETAs – Architecture Review of La Poste’s Case,Typical-Scene-5794,dataengineering,"In a recent blog, the team at La Poste (France’s postal service) shared how they redesigned their real-time package tracking pipeline from a monolithic app into a modular microservice architecture. The goal was to provide more accurate ETA predictions for deliveries while making the system easier to scale and monitor in production. They describe splitting the pipeline into multiple decoupled stages (using Pathway – an open-source streaming ETL engine) connected via Delta Lake storage and Kafka. This revamped design not only improved performance and reliability, but also significantly cut costs (the blog cites a 50% reduction in total cost of ownership for the IoT data platform and a projected 16% drop in fleet capital expenditures, which is huge). Below I’ll outline the architecture, key decisions, and trade-offs from the blog in an engineering-focused way.From Monolith to Microservices: Originally, a single streaming pipeline handled everything: data cleansing, ETA calculation, and maybe some basic monitoring. That monolith worked for a prototype, but it became hard to extend – for instance, adding continuous evaluation of prediction accuracy or integrating new models would make the one pipeline much more complex and fragile. The team decided to decouple the concerns into separate pipelines (microservices) that communicate through shared data layers. This is analogous to breaking a big application into microservices – here each Pathway pipeline is a lightweight service focused on one part of the workflow.They ended up with four main pipeline components:1. Data Acquisition & Cleaning: Ingest raw telemetry from delivery vehicles and clean it. IoT devices on trucks emit location updates (latitude/longitude, speed, timestamp, etc.) to a Kafka topic. This first pipeline reads from Kafka, applies a schema, and filters out bad data (e.g. GPS (0,0) errors, duplicates, out-of-order events). The cleaned, normalized data is then written to a Delta Lake table as the “prepared data” store. Delta Lake was used here to persist the stream in a queryable table format (every incoming event gets appended as a new row). This makes the downstream processing simpler and the intermediate data reusable. (Notably, they chose Delta Lake over something like chaining another Kafka topic for the clean data – a design choice we’ll discuss more below.)2. ETA Prediction: This stage consumes two things – the cleaned vehicle data (from that Delta table) and incoming ETA requests. ETA request events come as another stream (Kafka topic) containing a delivery request ID, the target destination, the assigned vehicle ID, and a timestamp. The topic is partitioned by vehicle ID so all requests for the same vehicle are ordered (ensuring the sequence of stops is handled correctly). The Pathway pipeline joins each request with the latest state of the corresponding vehicle from the clean data, then computes an estimated arrival time. The blog kept the prediction logic straightforward (e.g., basically using current location to estimate travel time to the destination), since the focus was architecture. The important part is that this service is stateless with respect to historical data – it relies on the up-to-date clean data table as its source of truth for vehicle positions. Once an ETA is computed for a request, the result is written out to two places: a Kafka topic (so that whoever requested the ETA gets the answer in real-time) and another Delta Lake table storing all predictions (for later analysis).3. Ground Truth Extraction: This pipeline waits for deliveries to actually be completed, so they can record the real arrival times (“ground truth” data for model evaluation). It reads the same prepared data table (vehicle telemetry) and the requests stream/table to know what destinations were expected. The logic here tracks each vehicle’s journey and identifies when a vehicle has reached the delivery location for a request (and has no further pending deliveries for that request). When it detects a completed delivery, it logs the actual time of arrival for that specific order. Each of these actual arrival records is written to a ground-truth Delta Lake table. This component runs asynchronously from the prediction one – an order might be delivered 30 minutes after the prediction was made, but by isolating this in its own service, the system can handle that naturally without slowing down predictions. Essentially, the ground truth job is doing a continuous join between live positions and the list of active delivery requests, looking for matches to signal completion.4. Evaluation & Monitoring: The final stage joins the predictions with their corresponding ground truths to measure accuracy. It reads from the predictions Delta table and the ground truths table, linking records by request ID (each record pairs a predicted arrival time with the actual arrival time for a delivery). The pipeline then computes error metrics. For example, it can calculate the difference in minutes between predicted and actual delivery time for each order. These per-delivery error records are extremely useful for analytics – the blog mentions calculating overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and also segmenting error by how far in advance the prediction was made (predictions made closer to the delivery tend to be more accurate). Rather than hard-coding any specific aggregation in the pipeline, the approach was to output the raw prediction-vs-actual data into a PostgreSQL database (or even just a CSV file), and then use external tools or dashboards for deeper analysis and alerting. By doing so, they keep the streaming pipeline focused and let data analysts iterate on metrics in a familiar environment. (One cool extension: because everything is modular, they can add an alerting microservice that monitors this error data stream in real-time – e.g. trigger a Slack alert if error spikes – without impacting the other components.)Key Architectural Decisions:Decoupling via Delta Lake Tables: A standout decision was to connect these microservice pipelines using Delta Lake as the intermediate store. Instead of passing intermediate data via queues or Kafka topics, each stage writes its output to a durable table that the next stage reads. For example, the clean telemetry is a Delta table that both the Prediction and Ground Truth services read from. This has several benefits in a data engineering context:Data Reusability & Observability: Because intermediate results are in tables, it’s easy to query or snapshot them at any time. If predictions look off, engineers can examine the cleaned data table to trace back anomalies. In a pure streaming hand-off (e.g. Kafka topic chaining), debugging would be harder – you’d have to attach consumers or replay logs to inspect events. Here, Delta gives a persistent history you can query with Spark/Pandas, etc.Multiple Consumers: Many pipelines can read the same prepared dataset in parallel. The La Poste use case leveraged this to have two different processes (prediction and ground truth) independently consuming the prepared\_data table. Kafka could also multicast to multiple consumers, but those consumers would each need to handle data cleaning or maintaining state. With the Delta approach, the heavy lifting (cleaning) is done once and all consumers get a consistent view of the results.Failure Recovery: If one pipeline crashes or needs to be redeployed, the downstream pipelines don’t lose data – the intermediate state is stored in Delta. They can simply pick up from the last processed record by reading the table. There’s less worry about Kafka retention or exactly-once delivery mechanics between services, since the data lake serves as a reliable buffer and single source of truth.Of course, there are trade-offs. Writing to a data lake introduces some latency (micro-batch writes of files) compared to an in-memory event stream. It also costs storage – effectively duplicating data that in a pure streaming design might be transient. The blog specifically calls out the issue of many small files: frequent Delta commits (especially for high-volume streams) create lots of tiny parquet files and transaction log entries, which can degrade read performance over time. The team mitigated this by partitioning the Delta tables (e.g. by date) and periodically compacting small files. Partitioning by a day or similar key means new data accumulates in a separate folder each day, which keeps the number of files per partition manageable and makes it easier to run vacuum/compaction on older partitions. With these maintenance steps (partition + compact + clean old metadata), they report that the Delta-based approach remains efficient even for continuous, long-running pipelines. It’s a case of trading some complexity in storage management for a lot of flexibility in pipeline design.Schema Management & Versioning: With data passing through tables, keeping schemas in sync became an important consideration. If the schema of the cleaned data table changes (say they add a new column from the IoT feed), then the downstream Pathway jobs reading that table must be updated to expect that schema. The blog notes this as an increased maintenance overhead compared to a monolith. They likely addressed it by versioning their data schemas and coordinating deployments – e.g. update the writing pipeline to add new columns in parallel with updating readers, or use schema evolution features of Delta Lake. On the plus side, using Delta Lake made some aspects of schema handling easier: Pathway automatically stores each table’s schema in the Delta log, so when a job reads the table it can fetch the schema and apply it without manual definitions. This reduces code duplication and errors. Still, any intentional schema changes require careful planning across multiple services. This is just the nature of microservices – you gain modularity at the cost of more coordination.Independent Scaling & Fault Isolation: A big reason for the microservice approach was scalability and reliability in production. Each pipeline can be scaled horizontally on its own. For example, if ETA requests volume spikes, they could scale out just the Prediction service (Pathway supports parallel processing within a job as well, but logically separating it is an extra layer of scalability). Meanwhile, the data cleaning service might be CPU-bound and need its own scaling considerations, separate from the evaluation service which might be lighter. In a monolithic pipeline, you’d have to scale the whole thing as one unit, even if only one part is the bottleneck. By splitting them, only the hot spots get more resources. Likewise, if the evaluation pipeline fails due to, say, a bug or out-of-memory error, it doesn’t bring down the ingestion or prediction pipelines – they keep running and data accumulates in the tables. The ops team can fix and redeploy the evaluation job and catch up on the stored data. This isolation is crucial for a production system where you want to minimize downtime and avoid one component’s failure cascading into an outage of the whole feature.Pipeline Extensibility: The modular design also opened up new capabilities with minimal effort. The case study highlights a few:They can easily plug in an anomaly detection/alerting service that reads the continuous error metrics (from the evaluation stage) and sends notifications if something goes wrong (e.g., if predictions suddenly become very inaccurate, indicating a possible model issue or data drift).They can do offline model retraining or improvement by leveraging the historical data collected. Since they’re storing all cleaned inputs and outcomes, they have a high-quality dataset to train next-generation models. The blog mentions using the accumulated Delta tables of inputs and ground truths to experiment with improved prediction algorithms offline.They can perform A/B testing of prediction strategies by running two prediction pipelines in parallel. For example, run the current model on half the vehicles and a new model on a subset of vehicles (perhaps by partitioning the Kafka requests by transport\_unit\_id hash). Because the infrastructure supports multiple pipelines reading the same input and writing results, this is straightforward – you just add another Pathway service, maybe writing its predictions to a different topic/table, and compare the evaluation metrics in the end. In a monolithic system, A/B testing could be really cumbersome or require building that logic into the single pipeline. Operational Insights: On the operations side, the team did have to invest in coordinated deployments and monitoring for multiple services. There are four Pathway processes to deploy (plus Kafka, plus maybe the Delta Lake storage on S3 or HDFS, and the Postgres DB for results). Automated deploy pipelines and containerization likely help here (the blog doesn’t go deep into it, but it’s implied that there’s added complexity). Monitoring needs to cover each component’s health as well as end-to-end latency. The payoff is that each component is simpler by itself and can be updated or rolled back independently. For instance, deploying a new model in the Prediction service doesn’t require touching the ingestion or evaluation code at all – reducing risk. The scaling benefits were already mentioned: Pathway allows configuring parallelism for each pipeline, and because of the microservice separation, they only scale the parts that need it. This kind of targeted scaling can be more cost-efficient.The La Poste case is a compelling example of applying software engineering best practices (modularity, fault isolation, clear data contracts) to a streaming data pipeline. It demonstrates how breaking a pipeline into microservices can yield significant improvements in maintainability and extensibility for data engineering workflows. Of course, as the authors caution, this isn’t a silver bullet – one should adopt such complexity only when the benefits (scaling, flexibility, etc.) outweigh the overhead. In their scenario of continuously improving an ETA prediction service, the trade-off made sense and paid off.I found this architecture interesting, especially the use of Delta Lake as a communication layer between streaming jobs – it’s a hybrid approach that combines real-time processing with durable data lake storage. It raises some great discussion points: e.g., would you have used message queues (Kafka topics) between each stage instead, and how would that compare? How do others handle schema evolution across pipeline stages in production? The post provides a concrete case study to think about these questions. If you want to dive deeper or see code snippets of how Pathway implements these connectors (Kafka read/write, Delta Lake integration, etc.), I recommend checking out the original blog and the Pathway GitHub.

I’d like to do something similar via an API: the user sends input like `{col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}` to an endpoint, and the API returns the output of the dbt model (e.g., `{out_col_1: ""out_val_1"", out_col_2: ""out_val_2""}`), having used that input as the data behind `ref('input_model_or_data')`.What’s the recommended way to do something like this?",11,0.92,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kr1azg/how_to_build_an_api_on_top_of_a_dbt_model/,2025-05-20 10:15:49,2025-05-25 01:48:48

I have list of tuples like : (TableName, URL, Offset) . I'm making RDD out of it. So the structure looks like something like this : |TableName|URL|Offset||:-|:-|:-||Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|0||Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|100||Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|200||PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|0||PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|150||PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|300| For each RDD, a function is called to extract data from API and returns a dictionary of data.Later on I want to filter RDD based on table name and create separate dataframes out of it. Each table has a different schema, so I'm avoiding creating a data frame that could include extra irrelevant schemas for my tables rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(offset_tuple_list) fetch_rdd = rdd.flatMap(lambda tuple:get_data(tuple,extraction_date,token)).cache() ## filter RDD per table invoices_rdd = fetch_rdd.filter(lambda row: row[""table""] == ""Invoices"") purchaseOrders_rdd = fetch_rdd.filter(lambda row: row[""table""] == ""PurchaseOrders"") ## convert it to json for automatic schema inference by read.json invoices_json_rdd = invoices_rdd.map(lambda row: json.dumps(row)) purchaseOrders_json_rdd = purchaseOrders_rdd.map(lambda row: json.dumps(row)) invoices_df = spark.read.json(invoices_json_rdd) purchaseOrders_df = spark.read.json(purchaseOrders_json_rdd)I'm using cache() to avoid multiple API calls and do it only once. My problem is that caching won't work for me if **invoices\_df and purchaseOrders\_df** are running by different executors. If they are run on the same executor then one takes 3 min and the other a few seconds, since it uses the cache(). If not both take 3 min + 3 min = 6min calling API twice. This behaviour is random, sometimes it runs on separate executors and I can see locality becomes RACK\_LOCAL instead of PROCESS\_LOCAL Any idea how I can make all executors use the same cached RDD?",5,0.86,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ktqbov/sharing_cache_between_spark_executors_possible/,2025-05-23 18:06:20,2025-05-25 01:48:48
1ktn8tv,Should I switch teams? Manager limiting my growth opportunities,eatdrinksleepp,dataengineering,"Background: I’m on a support data engineering team and have recently been working on a full stack project that helped me learn new tools and skills that I was really interested in. I really enjoyed the work and felt like I was growing in the right direction. I also expressed my interest in this work with my manager and he said he would forward any similar projects to me as they come. The issue: However, now my manager seems to have changed his mind and told me that any future full stack opportunities will go to other team members instead of me because “I’ve had enough.” His reasoning is that projects should rotate through the team members one by one before coming back to me. While I understand wanting to give everyone opportunities, this feels like it’s limiting my ability to build expertise and grow in areas where I’m performing well.I’m also sensing some tension from teammates who seem to think I’m being “greedy” for wanting to continue with this type of work, even though I’m just trying to advance my career like anyone else would.My question: I’m considering talking to the director of data engineering about potentially switching to a different team that focuses more on core data engineering work rather than support. Is this a reasonable move, or should I try to work things out with my current manager first?Additional context:- I’ve been doing well in the full stack/data engineering work and it aligns with my career goals- This seems to be part of a broader pattern where I feel like growth opportunities are being limited- The team culture feels like it discourages ambition or self-advocacyHas anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?TL;DR: Manager is rotating opportunities away from me after I had success with a project. Considering switching teams.

We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.""One part that resonated with me greatly was regarding the human developer. ""I will toil in this cave and no one will know this code exists until it is perfect, at which point I will emerge and be recognized for the genius I am.""

Enduring those failures and overcoming them, I believe, is more important then, and required by, any programming language, framework, tool, etc.Newcomers have all the resources, AI, and work previous generations have accomplished to look up to but we are doing those people a disservice by hiding our failures due to human emotion wether thats how we want to be viewed or general fear of negative feedback from our work.Hopefully this doesn't offend anyone or become divisive, it's just some unspoken honesty that I have appreciation for and it stuck with me because honestly... it hit close to home when I saw it back then.",249,0.95,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kujmka/new_to_programming_dont_fall_for_the_myth_of_the/,2025-05-24 19:23:24,2025-05-25 01:48:49

But I don’t ship projects, or try freelancing because I feel like “it’s not good enough.”Before tech, I worked jobs in hotels (cashier, counter helper), and I even did graphic design, video editing, 2D/3D animation.

But the backend takes the cross site request, runs the request, and sends a proper response like how it would do for a genuine request. so now I don't understand what if [bank.com](http://bank.com) has some endpoint like /sendmoney, that returns success or failure. and [evil.com](http://evil.com) makes cross site request to that endpoint. Will the backend still execute the /sendmoney? what I understand is, backend does the work and returns response, then browser blocks [evil.com](http://evil.com) from seeing the response(which doesnt matter in this case).so if this is how it works, CORS is to stop [evil.com](http://evil.com) from only viewing resources/responses of [bank.com](http://bank.com) it wont stop from making it hit some endpoints?I have read about CSRF tokens.

1ksjv0u,"Feeling lost in tech. Burned out, falling behind, and scared I’ll stay mediocre forever.",idk-who-you-are,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I’m 22 and about to graduate with a Master’s in Computer Applications. I don’t have a job yet, and honestly, I feel completely stuck and left behind.When I was 14, I found out about software engineering after my neighbor moved to the US. That lit a fire in me—I started dreaming of becoming a great engineer, moving abroad, doing something meaningful. I pushed hard through 9th and 10th grades believing that hard work now would lead to success later.Then the lockdown hit just as I entered my Bachelor's. I learned a bit of programming, but I also wasted a lot of time—watching movies, helping at home, and losing direction.In 2022, I tried learning web development. I got a job I didn’t enjoy, then an internship where I couldn’t perform well. I tried React, but it felt overwhelming. Since then, I’ve bounced between DSA, frontend, Golang, and trying to build projects—but nothing sticks. Most projects remain unfinished. I’m not proud of anything I’ve built.I try starting projects, but I lose interest after two or three days. The initial excitement fades quickly, and I struggle to push through once things get repetitive or challenging. I feel stuck in a loop—excited to begin, but unable to finish. This keeps happening, and it kills my confidence even more.Now it’s 2025, and I feel like I’ve lost the **curiosity and excitement** that got me into tech in the first place. Programming doesn’t excite me anymore—it feels like just another boring subject I’m forcing myself through. I accept that YouTube and social media made tech look glamorous, and I got pulled into that version. But now I realize—it’s only fulfilling if you truly love the work.I have a short attention span. I give up easily when I hit bugs. I don’t learn frameworks or concepts as fast as I think I should. I feel like I’m not cut out for this.The worst part? I’m scared I’ll be stuck as someone mediocre forever. I lie awake at night thinking, *What if I’m falling behind in this race? What if I missed the boat? What if I end up like someone who fell out during the dot-com bubble and never recovered?*Meanwhile, I see people younger than me building amazing things, earning well, learning fast. It crushes me.My family—especially my parents and older brother—are amazing and supportive. They never pressure me, but I know deep down they want me to start earning. A few days ago, my mom quietly said, *“I thought you’d do something to change things at home, but you couldn’t.”* That sentence shattered me. I want to help them financially and emotionally. But I haven’t earned a single **dime** yet.I’ve been cold-emailing founders, CTOs, and employees on LinkedIn, and applying to jobs almost every day—but I keep getting rejections or no responses at all. It’s disheartening.Sometimes, I want to give up. But I also don’t want to. There’s still a small part of me that wants to break through, to build something meaningful, and to prove to myself that I *can* do it.I want to make it in tech. I want to be good at it. I still dream of building cool products and figuring out how things work. But I just don’t know how to keep going when everything feels overwhelming. I want to feel motivated again. I want to believe it’s not too late for me.Lately, I’ve been interested in backend development, but I know frontend is important too—and after failing so many times at it, frontend feels boring and intimidating. Starting again feels stupid and exhausting.Sorry if I sound like a complaint box or just another burnt-out CS guy. I just needed to get this off my chest.If anyone has been through this—or made it out of this kind of mental/emotional/technical rut—please let me know: **How do you stay consistent when your confidence is shattered?** **How do you bring back the excitement and curiosity for tech?** **How do you stop feeling like a failure?**Thanks for reading.**TL;DR:** 22, finishing MCA. Lost interest and motivation in programming. Tried web dev, Go, DSA—nothing sticks. Projects remain incomplete. Haven’t earned a dime yet. Family is supportive but I feel like I’ve let them down. Programming feels boring now; glamorized YouTube content pulled me in. I’m cold emailing founders, CTOs, employees and applying for jobs—but facing rejections. I’m scared of falling behind forever.

1ku26l8,Is learning to code worth it?,FriendshipPresent686,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone. My 12 year old brother has expressed interest in becoming a software engineer when he grows up. I myself was not introduced to coding until much later in life which I wish I was, stuff would’ve been easier for me. I was thinking of enrolling him into a scratch course to help him get ‘head start’ into the field. He has done some scratch animation projects in school however I came across a course which teaches scratch more in depth with more projects. He said he would be interested in doing it, however I was relaying the information to some people and they’ve said that programming is dead now because of AI and a lot of people are not able to make use of their skills anymore. They said that it’s not worth it to learn how to code. I’m really conflicted because I would like my brother to learn skills early on that will help him in his later schooling and career and he isn’t struggling to grasp basic concepts in college like I was. I still want to enroll him in scratch course because I know in the end he will learn something and it’s worth it rather than him not doing anything at all. I wanted to know if anyone had any advice on how I can help him learn early on about the IT industry, software engineering, etc. so he already has basic knowledge beforehand. Any courses, classes, activities for middle schoolers? I know about code ninjas but I’m not a fan of those learning center franchises. I have tried them out, They are super expensive and barely learn anything while they are there.

1kpenmw,I made a cipher that uses the digits of π to encode messages!,Remarkable_Depth4933,learnprogramming,"Hi all, I recently created a fun cipher that encodes text using the digits of π. I thought it would be a cool way to explore string matching and character encoding in Python — and I'd love to get your thoughts or improvements!## How the cipher works:- Each character is converted to its ASCII value.- That number (as a string) is searched for in the digits of π (ignoring the decimal point).- The **starting index** of the first match and the **length** of the match are recorded.- Each character is encoded as `index-length`, separated by hyphens.### Example:The ASCII value of `'A'` is `65`. If `65` first appears in π at index **7** (π = 3.141592653... → digits = 141592653...), then it's encoded as:```7-2```---## Here’s an encrypted message:```11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2```---## And here’s the Python code to decode it:```pythonfrom mpmath import mpmp.dps = 100005 # digits of πpi_digits = str(mp.pi)[2:]cipher_text = ( ""11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2"")segments = cipher_text.strip().split(""-"")index_length_pairs = [ (int(segments[i]), int(segments[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(segments), 2)]decoded_chars = []for index, length in index_length_pairs: ascii_digits = pi_digits[index - 1 : index - 1 + length] decoded_chars.append(chr(int(ascii_digits)))decoded_message = """".join(decoded_chars)print(decoded_message)```---### Tutorial FlairThis post demonstrates how to decode a custom cipher based on the digits of π.

Runtime errors. So many times I couldn't 100% understand why something I am passing is not rendering and what the console errors mean, what is a type Object Object etc and since I got tired of starting and giving up I decided randomly to do a project with Typescript instead of JS and holy shit. All type errors get underlined right away and just copy pasting to AI and asking for an explanation gets to understand things like when you're using a reference or comparing a reference instead of a value instead of learning about it once you set everything up. So while it might be more work, what got me to truly enjoy writing web stuff is learning Typescript. If you know any typed language it is super quick to pick up, and if it's your first typed language you'll need a bit more time to get it but once you do you're not going back to vanilla JS.

I have been making a VB .Net WinForms app to archive project directories at work to a different storage raid by scanning all the files/folders recursively and ensuring everything is older than a specified date. It then copies the files to our archive drive. then, it does a binary comparison of the source and copied files to ensure everything was 100% successful before deleting the source file. All that functionality works PERFECTLY. (Picture a shared drive full of folders, each of which is a complete project. If no changes have happened to a project in at least a year, it's safe to archive. Stuff on the archive drive is read-only for most of the company to keep it safe for record keeping and not cluttering up daily work)For the next phase, I want it to go through that archive drive and put all the archived directories into compressed files (Zip or 7Zip). So, each project folder becomes its own zip file. Our data is highly compressible, and we can save about 30% space by compressing files that we don't need to be regularly accessing.I see that this line of code easily creates the zip file for me: System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory(FolderPath, OutputZipPath, CompressionLevel.SmallestSize, True)My questions are:* Is there a way to verify the file accuracy after zipped before I delete the source files? * I may be over-cautious, but I don't want to risk any file corruptions* Is there a different way to compress folders that I should research? * I did my proof-of-concept testing using a batch file that triggered 7zip, but I prefer to keep everything integrated into a single program if possible unless there's a good reason not to. edit: minor error: i flipped the percentage of saved space, sorry. they compress to 70% of original size, saving 30%.",6,1.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ks61v4/is_there_a_way_to_verify_file_accuracy_after/,2025-05-21 19:00:59,2025-05-25 01:48:49

I did not do that personally, our IT guy did, but I came up with the vision etc and I put in a few lines of code myself but will not take credit for what he's done.I've completed Foundational C# with Microsoft/freeCodeCamp and I'm like halfway through Harvard's free CS50 course.I'm still quite unfamiliar with Git or GitHub, but I kind of know how it's used and what it's purposes are.I really feel like I would be happy doing this as a career, but I am now 31 and I don't have a CS degree under my belt, I have a music production degree instead. How hard will it be to change careers to a programming one? I know I like more of the backend, logical problem solving. I'm not a big fan of designing websites using HTML/CSS although I'm somewhat familiar with them and would learn them more thoroughly quite quickly should I need to.I also have just had my first child last year and don't want to take too much of a paycut, I'm currently earning like 32k a year (this is in the UK) and maybe for the sake of it I'd go down to 28k but starting a programming job for 25k is a bit out of the question for me at the moment I feel, due to family commitments.Could anyone give me some words of advice please and maybe encouragement lol. I feel like I've been learning for so long and I want the ball to start rolling, as I know working in this field will only speed up my learning.Should I just start applying for jobs and see if can get anything or listen to their feedback?

Most of the time, I ended up just following what was shown, without actually understanding *why* we were doing something a certain way. The basics never felt clear, and I was always left with questions like “why exactly is this done like this?”So now, I’ve decided to start fresh — this time with a proper focus on understanding things deeply, step by step. My main preference is to **read books or documentation** rather than watching videos. I feel like books allow me to go at my own pace, re-read things, and properly think about what I’m learning. I’ve also heard from others that books usually explain things in more detail and depth compared to many tutorials.Here’s how I’m planning to approach it:1. First, I want to learn **general programming concepts** — like how code works, what happens behind the scenes, how computers interpret programs, memory, logic, etc.2. Then I’ll move on to **Python**, relearn it properly with all the basics and get confident with it.3. After that, I want to get into **C++**, so that I can understand things on a lower level and get better with performance, system-level thinking, etc.I'm also planning to go into **data structures and algorithms** in between, once I have a decent hold on Python.So I’m mainly looking for **book recommendations** (or any really well-explained resources) for:* Basics of coding and general programming logic* Beginner to intermediate Python* DSA (preferably in Python, but general ones are okay too)* A good path to learn C++ after Python* Clean code, writing good code, and long-term coding habitsIf there are any **video courses that explain things really well and in depth**, I’m open to them too, but my first preference will always be books.If anyone here has gone through a similar journey or prefers reading like me, I’d love to hear your experience and suggestions.

I'd only consider it for a very high salary (mid-level developer range), which might be unrealistic for an entry-level hire.---### Internship at a Startup- **Status:** Offer available.- **Details:** The startup recently closed a big contract and is expanding.- **Pros:** I'd probably learn a lot quickly.- **Cons:** Very low pay.

1kslf3b,"After 4 years at Google, here's my honest take on why their work culture and processes didn't work for me.",dethstrobe,cscareerquestions,"I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.Just to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.# Agile is a SinI come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?Wrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.It is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.Also, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for ""X"" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.# The Doc MachineSo, if you're not regularly shipping software, how can you possibly measure impact?Docs.Endless docs.Countless docs.So many docs that it can be impossible to find what doc says what you did.Google's mission is to ""organize the world's information."" Internally in Google, they generate a lot of information in docs, and it's very hard to search and find the information you're looking for.What's the point of docs no one reads? Well, since software doesn't get shipped, I assume it just acts as a laundry list of links when attempting to show impact for your performance reviews or promotions. You might not have shipped anything, but at least you left a paper trail of what you didn't ship.You want to know the worst part of it? They want you to write a doc on a system you don't understand. So you write it up, make some assumptions and send it out for approval. No one reads it to approve it. Let's say you get your single approver and start implementing. Guess what, your core assumption is wrong. The data isn't in the right place, or the data you thought had what you needed, doesn't. Now you need to rewrite the doc.What's the point of getting approval? What's the point of a doc that is wrong from the start? What's the point of upfront design that is wrong? Why not just implement and find out what actually is going on and make it work?The point is, it's just theater to make it look like we're doing our jobs. Why isn't the software the evidence we're doing our job?I'm not trying to say docs are bad, and everything should just be tribal knowledge. But I am saying docs that need to be rewritten from the get-go are a waste of time.# Bad docsIronically, despite needing to write so many docs to implement things. When you read other people's docs, you might notice something. They're very high-level. They're more like a thesis, then like actual documentation on how to use an API.What is the point of docs that don't answer how to use an API?Focusing on the high-level philosophy of a service is honestly distracting and unhelpful. I think I understand why this happens. It's hard to keep docs up to date. So if you keep them high-level, they won't become obsolete or need to be updated. But I don't care about your thesis defense; I just want to use your software to solve my problem.And I know Google can write good docs. [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) has fantastic documentation. [Proto Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview/) have great docs. Both of these are made by Google. I guess the difference is they're public facing and Google doesn't prioritize internal docs like they do their external facing ones.# A Culture of SilenceSo, there is a lot of lip service towards how open Google is. Say how they're trying to encourage employees in fireside chats to not ask anonymous questions so that leadership can follow up with the individual to gain more context. (This, by the way, does not prevent people from asking anonymously, which they do.)There is also a culture of no-blame retrospectives. They don't run regularly, even when I advocate for them. And worst of all, when we finally do run retrospectives, we don't discuss challenges and problems we are encountering. So, what's the point of a retrospective that doesn't talk about pain points and mitigation strategies? From my perspective, it just looks like theater and a way to paint a false view that everything is good and we have nothing to complain about. Or worse, that we are helpless and we really cannot change anything.Coming from companies with genuinely open cultures where we fostered candid and open discussions, it's baffling to me that no one seems willing to put in the minimal effort to improve everyone's lives.It is better to be positive about a broken system and keep the status quo than it is to ask people to put in a laughable small level of effort to make everyone's life better. Not everything is going smoothly all the time. And assuming we **want** it to run smoothly, we should probably discuss the pain points and workarounds or solutions to them. Knowledge silos are bad. More open discussions can reduce knowledge silos which reduces the burden on individuals and gives everyone a balance for job responsibilities.# A Culture of Bottom-Up (but only if it's top-down)So, in meetings with leadership. They emphasize that our *bottom-up culture* is how we do such great work. And by *bottom-up*, they apparently mean *top-down*.# When Bottom-Up Meets Brick WallSo, let's say our UXR (user experience research team) has come up with an obvious gap in our offerings. What would you do? Perhaps gather some people from multiple disciplines and brainstorm a solution. Or maybe you just get leadership and design in a room and iterate on who knows what behind closed doors for literal months, before you ever even involve engineering. And for those few months, you pull engineering off their current teams in a large-scale reorg and don't give them marching orders instead just give them a bunch of vague ideas of what they might want to build. Like...what is engineering supposed to do? Build against an invisible moving target? The answer is, that is exactly what we do. Not because it's a good use of our time, but because we have nothing better to do and we have no input into the vision of the product.So let's say, you're an engineer, like yours truly, and you think that process is stupid, and instead you really do want to try to implement a bottoms up initiative. So maybe, see a feature, we originally spec'd out but was dropped because they didn't see the current value in implementing it. But it sounds kind of cool, and shouldn't be that difficult to get an MVP for this feature. Maybe you go to reach out across teams, pull in people that own data you need, a team that works on Android and iOS, and try to get people from the backend team so you can make an e2e MVP to demonstrate this feature is doable. Also, act as a test bed to show smaller agile processes work and probably how we should handle work in the org.Sounds pretty encouraging, right? But here is the real problem, one of the teams is a no-show. Not only are they a no-show, they also refuse to work with you and ignore your messages. You escalate to your manager and tech lead, and that team also ignores them too. You work with the other teams and implement everything, but say the one thing to tie everything together and make it work e2e. Let's say a backend team refused to work with you. So, naturally, offer to do the work for them. And they tell you to not do that. Because it's not my code base, I'm not on call, and I don't have to maintain it. So what do you do?What I did was create a video demo that made it look like it should work and presented it to leadership. We were reorged before this demo was even presented, so the feature died on the vine.# The Only MVP Is Minimum Viable Plausible DeniabilityLet's say that you do still believe in the rhetoric that, *the organization really does believe in bottom-up*. So you take some time and write up a doc (which is an activity you don't enjoy but if that's how the game is played, and you want to play ball, you do it). The doc outlines an open source initiative that is coincidentally attempting to solve the space we just tried to fill. But since there's an open-source community trying to solve the same problem space, maybe we can just leverage that and even help them grow at the same time. Anyway, it was super nice to have leadership hear me out, but they didn't want to go with it, because it turns out that one of the reasons we hamstrung our last project was because we were attempting to skirt a legal definition that the open source project is tackling head on. Suddenly, it made more sense: The original project was destined to fail, not because it was a bad idea, but because they were trying to handicap the implementation to avoid legal scrutiny.Fundamentally, we're not trying to build good software or solve problems. We're just trying to do something without bringing legal scrutiny to Google.I understand getting sued sucks, and the law is often weaponized against Google. But why handicap ourselves? There are so many other ideas out there. Why not pursue things that are higher value and lower risk? I cynically believe it could just be virtue signaling to investors, to show Google is trying new things and still taking risks. But their risks seem high-risk, low-reward, compared to the normal practices I'm used to, which focus on mitigating risk and prioritizing high value. Taking risks here seems to be about signaling growth, but are they truly growing? Wouldn't the more obvious path be to take the calculated legal risk to solve a real problem and potentially achieve genuine growth? I don't know; I'm not in leadership. I just had a worm's-eye view of the machine.# Grassroots Agility, Stomped by ApathyLet's say you came from an agile background and you even believe it. Because you've seen it solve very obvious communication issues that you see arise in large organizations. You've experienced it firsthand, you know it works. You go and explain it to your manager, they say that there are organization issues and leadership is resistant to change. They don't discourage you from trying, but they kind of set the expectations that nothing will change. But, what else are you supposed to do? Nothing?So you have a meeting with your skip manager (your manager's manager) once again advocating to adopt agile processes and maybe get more stakeholder buy-in. And they give you the advice to do it locally with your team. You know, ""bottom-up"" kind of stuff.You present it to the team. They hate it. They don't want processes. They don't want collaboration or more communication. They say agile practices are dehumanizing and that we are not interchangeable cogs in the machine. A bit of a disservice towards agile processes. But they are willing to try some of the ceremonies.But literally, for any reason whatsoever, they cancel meetings, like retrospectives or stand-ups. Maybe we need more time to finish a feature, or maybe it's a holiday, or we get reorged. And we never start up the meeting again, at least until I ask for it. Followed by it once again being canceled at the drop of a hat. And no one cares. They don't see the value in it. And to be honest, the ceremonies are toothless because we don't discuss actual problems, we don't discuss work progress to reduce knowledge silos, and action items are never done and are also usually not meaningful anyway.The reason people don't see the value of agile processes is not that it's not a good framework to address communication gaps, but because just doing the ceremonies without the communication makes them pointless. There is value in the ceremonies if they're being used to address the problems. But actively ignoring the problems, even with ceremonies, means we're now just wasting people's time.# Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Going NowhereIf there is a bottom-up culture at Google, it is self sabotaging. There is so much momentum for the status quo that actual process change is near impossible. The only change that appears to work is a top-down mandate, which they try every year with constant reorgs and get the same results.# There is No Team in ISo, coming from an agile background (I know I sound like I'm in a cult, with how much I bring it up, but bear with me), I've come to the understanding that I as an individual do not necessarily matter. It's about putting aside ego and working together on a larger goal. This also comes with a nice benefit of distributing responsibility, and reducing burn out.That's pretty damn *ungoogley*. At Google, they're rugged cowboys. They pull themselves up by the bootstrap and don't care about your collaboration. You need to own everything. Your work, your feature, your project, your process, your career. No one is here to help you. You need to just do it yourself. Which is ironic, as [googley-ness](https://staffeng.medium.com/being-googly-62b75dd642df) should theoretically not embody it. But the performance evaluation surely doesn't emphasize trying to make teamwork work.[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.I hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.It could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *""leaning on others too much.""* How else am I supposed to read that?I've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.# Performative TheaterI hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.So, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.When they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.# Tech Debt ForeverTo say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.Cryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.So I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, ""It sounds like you need mentorship."" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, ""maybe you should find your own mentorship."" And it does make me wonder, ""what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?"" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.# I'm outSo I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.They gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.There is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.I used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",2084,0.96,332,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kslf3b/after_4_years_at_google_heres_my_honest_take_on/,2025-05-22 08:13:58,2025-05-25 01:48:51

These types of firing often come with less or no severance than if you were laid off. Also, often times no healthcare coverage paid for that a layoff would provide.But the biggest thing is it comes with you being labelled a ""bad worker"" in the press, which other hiring managers will see. Even though it was just a way to lay you off in secret. If you were not a bad performer, then this is defamation of character and is affecting you financially. Both from losing benefits you would receive from a normal layoff, as well as the potential financial pain that comes from not being hired due to being falsely labeled a ""poor performer"".It is time employees start suing these companies.

1kqmlek,"""Not an Engineer"" - Limited Growth Opportunities Because of CS Degree Title",SouthMouth79,cscareerquestions,"I graduated in May 2023 with a Computer Science degree from a well respected program. Like many others in my class, it was tough landing a full-time role in this market. I did some contract work for a while until I was recently hired full-time as a “Controls and Automation Specialist”. A basic summary of what my division in the company does is that we install and program factory computers.I didn’t think much of the title of the role before starting; it wasn’t heavily stressed as a distinguishing factor in the interview, job posting, or any further correspondence with the company. It wasn’t until I started that I came to understand that there is a significant distinction between “Specialists” and “Engineers” in my division. Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, not just computer related, but from my current understanding, C+A Engineers have more career mobility within the company as well as higher salaries, even in entry-level roles.When I asked about the difference, I was told that because I have a “Computer Science” degree, I’m not considered an engineer and can’t be billed to clients as one. I thought this might be a regional thing, that software engineering isn’t yet considered “real” engineering in the southeast. But today I found out that one of our interns is titled an engineer but is pursuing a degree in Software Engineering; a degree that differs from Computer Science at their university by a single required course (Software Security).I have plenty of CS grad friends that went on to become Software Engineers, so I didn’t expect the wording of my degree to limit my role like this. I really like my coworkers, the work that I do, and the company I work for. I genuinely pictured myself being part of the company for the long-term. But it’s been hard not to feel like I’m missing out on long-term growth simply because of a technicality in how my education is labeled.Has anyone else run into this kind of title/pay/growth ceiling based on your degree title? Would love to hear how others have navigated this or similar situations, or just general suggestions or opinions on how to proceed.TLDR:CS grad working in controls/automation was told I can't hold an ""Engineer"" title, or access related pay and growth, because my degree isn’t labeled “Engineering,” despite doing similar work.

We're in the retail industry but we do have a website which I work on. However, last year our company started a new company wide rule where we have to work some days in one of our actual retail stores. Now that I've done this multiple times, I actually hate it.1. Our customers don't like it when they realize that the person they're asking for help actually has no idea because they're a software dev cosplaying as a store employee. ""What type of item do you need to do ABC? I have no idea but let me ask a real store employee, 1 sec.""2. I've had store employees treat me harshly upon meeting me because I'm a fake store employee just there for a day, I'm taking time away from them doing their regular stuff while they explain stuff to me, etc... and I also think some resent the salary discrepancy. Sometimes someone will tell me that their family member makes X amount of money and I don't say anything but I'm thinking ""I never asked, I'm just here to comply and keep my job"".3. None of the things that the store employees complain about are something that I even have any power whatsoever to change or fix. It's just not something that my team or department works on. And instead of me being there, why can't it just be an email from them directly to management? and how many more times am I going to have to keep doing this?After completing one of these visits I'm given an opportunity to fill out a survey which I always do, but then in the future I'm still told basically ""do it or you're fired"". It feels like a bait and switch to me because I joined this company to be a software dev and this program didn't exist at that time.I know the job market is bad at the moment so I'm continuing to comply, but I just wanted to vent to my fellow devs I guess.",60,0.85,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kqjrpx/just_a_rant_from_a_frustrated_software_developer/,2025-05-19 18:51:09,2025-05-25 01:48:51

So, i've been browsing this sub for maybe 3 years? and I would sometimes read opinons here or other subs just how easy their software dev job is and that the challenging part is just passing the interview..And I feel like that is a lie.. obviously jobs differ from company to company, project to project etc.. In my case I was lucky enough to deal with good people, managers, business analysts, stuff people would complain about but if there is something I would complain is the work itself.There were moments where I would ask myself wtf am I doing working as a developer because some tasks just made me feel like I was staring at a wall, I had no idea how to approach this issue, I would have an idea but going deeper I would eventually get lost and forget why I went down the path the first place.Right now i'm on a new project which is basically rewrite from scratch of an older project that was done in a couple of years and they want some core functionality implemented in a matter of months..You might think, oh that doesn't sound so bad.. the logic is already there. Well imagine that programming paradigm changed so from functional to OOP and that you need to integrate 3rd party vendors as well.Oh yeah I forgot, nobody really talks about how most projects IRL deviate in some way from the online tutorials you're used to, that medium article you though is relevant to your problem? yeah nah.

By this time in my search 6 years ago I already had around 9 interviews under my belt. I was applying as routinely as I am today and I had no experience whatsoever, my resume was shit, and I had no solid personal projects to my name.

I know the obvious answer is ""it couldn't hurt"", but is the time and energy put towards a CS degree something that will be particularly beneficial for someone in my position?One of the benefits of this career for me was that a degree wasn't necessary to be successful.

1kprlij,10th Dentist: I don't think you can escape Programming,SnooTangerines9703,cscareerquestions,"**TLDR**: I am a CSGrad and 8year SWE but I've encountered new grads who won't practice programming. Are there fields in this industry that do not require programming? aside from sales/PM of courseI've been seeing a lot of posts on here that say SWE/Programming is not the end-all-be-all for CS. ...but I'm wondering if people are confusing the two or perhaps I'm misguided. Yeah I believe that as a CS guy/gal, you might not be responsible for building and developing complex systems that communicate and work with each other (in fact I believe 2025 SWE is just Distributed Systems in disguise but we can argue about that in my next post)My question: is there really any field within CS that does not require at least some programming skills for survival (and No I'm not talking a FullStack Dev, maybe a niche position)?Context: 1.I always thought **Networking** was how I would escape programming. Sure, there are many tools that automate some of these processes, but from my tiny experience in this domain, there seems to be many situations where writing custom scripts gives you the advantage?2.**System Admins/CyberSecurity:** C'mon Sys Admins/CyberSecurity Consultants, you shouldn't even be in this discussion since I know you guys have to or perhaps should automate some of those tasks you handle every day lol3\*\*.UI/UX Designers:\*\* A lot of the UI/UX designers in my circle were slowly funneled into jobs that required them to also know some FE Programming.

1ksxsmx,"Seeking some advice. CS degree, working retail job.",whoami_jav,cscareerquestions,"Seeking some advice… In March 2023, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science from a UC in Southern California after returning to school following a break in 2019. While in college, I completed an internship at a local tech company doing software engineering and also picked up some freelance web development work.After graduation, I spent about five months preparing for technical interviews and applying for jobs. Unfortunately, I drained my limited savings during that time and didn’t land any offers. I eventually stepped away from the job search, partly due to frustration and loss of professional motivation and because I really needed money quickly.Since then, I’ve been working at an organics grocery store (the rain forest one) for the past year and eight months. I currently make $18.67 per hour, working 30 to 35 hours a week. I’ve recently been offered a leadership-track role that would bump my pay to around $21.50 per hour with a 40-hour workweek. Still, I’m not happy with my financial situation or this job.Despite working in retail, I continue to code and try to learn software engineering topics on my days off or when I have the energy after work. That said, it has been difficult to maintain momentum, and I feel like I’ve lost touch with many of the CS fundamentals needed in the field.Part of me regrets not going all in on the job search earlier and settling for a grocery store job. Another part of me is grateful for the soft skills I’ve developed in the meantime.Now, I want to pivot back into tech and become a software engineer. At this point, I’d take almost any role in the field just to gain experience and start building a network. I know the job hunt will require time, discipline, and financial commitment. Preparing through LeetCode, system design, and personal projects is going to be time consuming, but it’s necessary. I am rusty on a lot topics. That said, reading about the current job market has me feeling anxious.I’m at a crossroads and feel completely lost. My options are:1. **Stay in my current role**, working 30–35 hours per week. Continue saving and use my days off or evenings to focus on technical prep (LeetCode and NeetCode). Once I feel ready, start applying.2. **Accept the leadership position**, work full-time for six months, and save aggressively. This will net me roughly $20,000 in savings considering holiday pay and OT. After that, step back to part-time (I’m able to work from 4 to 24 hours a week) and use my savings to support myself while focusing full-time on interview prep and project work.

1kpjo1q,My internship is offering me an ambitious full-time role and I’m nervous,motuwed,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Interned at a non-tech company for 1.5 years, recently got offered a part-time-to-full-time software dev role on their AI use case team. Super excited, but nervous since there’s no real junior dev pipeline or formal training, and I’m jumping straight from student to full-time dev in a small team that mostly hires experienced people.I interned at this company for about 1.5 years with 8 moths full-time and the rest part-time.During that time, I worked on a pretty wide range of stuff: manually testing new software, creating architectural diagrams, documenting codebases, and toward the end, helping a new AI team build web apps with AI-driven features.It’s been about two months since the internship ended. When I wrapped up, there was talk of a full-time offer closer to graduation (which is in August). But recently, they reached out and said they’d actually like to offer me a position now—starting part-time, then moving to full-time after I graduate. I asked about the role, and they said “AI Developer,” which basically just means I’d be a software dev on the AI use case team (so not data science or ML).I’m super excited because I loved the team environment and like most of us our dream is software dev. That said, I’m also nervous.This company isn’t a tech company, it’s actually pretty far from one. And because of that, the structure is a bit different. There’s not really a formal junior engineer pipeline or training program. Most people get hired with several years of experience already under their belt. I do know a couple folks who came in a year or two after graduating, but even then, it was through a setup where they’d already been doing independent contract work for a while.I know I’m a strong developer, and I learn quickly, but I also know I benefit a lot from structure and guidance. Obviously working with the team towards the end of my internship did give me SOME experience, but I still feel like the jump from student to full time dev is massive and I’m worried about working in an environment that might not have that change in the forefront of their mind.

It's something that’s been on my mind for a while. I used to think it was too tedious or far-fetched, but lately, desperation and a deep hunger to make something real have completely overridden that imposter syndrome I carried. Reading their post was like hearing my own thoughts said out loud made me hyperfocus on it.So here’s what I’m proposing (and may even build myself if I get enough support behind me):**One group. One community.** Let’s stop being divided and conquered in a dog-eat-dog grind. Let’s build *together*. Learn together. Grow together.The idea is to start a community, on Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, Reddit, wherever there's traction where anyone who's serious about learning and building can join. No gatekeeping, just mutual accountability.**How it would work:*** Each member logs their learning journey with a start and end date, plus their chosen path (e.g. [`MOOC.fi`](http://MOOC.fi) `Java => Java Internship (3 months) & Java II (3 months)`, `Harvard CS50 => (3 months) => w: Web Dev Internship, ai: AI Internship`, etc.).* Proof of completion is required (certs, GitHub commits, demo videos). This isn’t about fluff, it’s about **real growth*** Every Thursday or Friday we could have a community event like DSA Thursday/Friday* After internship, or if you want to skip it would be **Entry-Level** (the initial commitment would be **6 to 12 months**)* Everyone begins by building a **personal project** to set a baseline and gauge their current level.* If possible, everyone at this stage is assigned an accountability buddy, preferably one that isn't on the same team so that one person isn't doing the work of another. * After that, we begin and transition into **collaborative projects** run in an agile team format. Everyone keeps their main role they want and rotates any unused/unsure roles: designer, dev, PM, tester, to build real-world skills.# The exposure strategy:Once a project is finished, we create a **video breakdown** and post it on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, or wherever else makes sense. Each person is credited for their work and gets the exposure they deserve.Let’s be real: Most of us are **introverts**. Some of us are **highly skilled**. And many of us are **still unemployed**, even while being more capable than folks earning six figures.This isn't just about skill, it's about being **seen**. We need a system that clears the dust off our shine. Many of us are grasping at straws. **Maybe this is what we actually need: real experience, real proof, and real support.**# Long-term vision:* After 6+ months, or if your **personal project** stands out, you transition into a **junior developer role** within the group.* You start to take on leadership responsibilities and begin developing those soft skills like communication, initiative, and mentoring.* By then, or even earlier, you should be ready for a paid role. If not, you’ll still have a strong portfolio, exposure, and momentum to start freelancing or even launch your own thing.# What a full journey might look like (if starting from zero):1. **Internship Phase (Learning Phase):** * Java I & II (MOOC.fi), or Full-Stack, or Python, or 2x+ CS50 courses, etc. * \~6 months total (self-paced) * Initial project (\~1 month) * Career development + feedback2. **Entry-Level Phase** * 3 to 12 projects built with team * Weekly GitHub updates, project demos, and social proof * Lasts 6 to 12 months3. **Junior Phase** * \~6+ months of group work and possible freelancing * Exposure, mentorship, and leadership opportunitiesIn total, you’d have **about 2 years of experience**, real-world projects, team collaboration skills, leadership development, and consistent exposure. With that kind of portfolio and growth, **you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t hire you**.I may start this, but I obviously can’t do it alone. If you’re interested, or if you have suggestions to improve the idea, **drop a comment or DM me**.

Eight months ago, I had a solid foundation in Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, along with frameworks like React and Spring Boot. Since then, I’ve added multi-cloud experience, DevOps, and AI concepts like RAG.Very rarely I’d gone through complete interview processes: submissions, interviews, take-homes, technical rounds, only to get ghosted or declined.

I never saw a researcher get their work out to production early on in my career, and now it seems like ops is an expectation of the ML / researcher role. part of the reason thats possible is how good the tooling is now. not everything has to be rewritten to c, or created from scratch in a matrix compatible arrangement of html + css + vanilla js.I havent worked with young devs since 2018. so I guess I am wondering, what kinds of work are jr developers being expected to do today? is there still a lot of the same kind of work I started out doing or is it different? appreciate any insights people might offer.",10,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kuhu65/what_kinds_of_work_are_jr_developers_expected_to/,2025-05-24 18:03:54,2025-05-25 01:48:51

I’m about 9 months into my first role, and while things have improved a bit, I’m still really struggling and could use some career advice.So heres a bit about my background. I started in tech through a conversion Master’s and landed a graduate role in a Big 4 consultancy. The first few months were rough. I was getting minimal work, no mentorship, and I felt totally lost. I nearly quit, but after speaking to management, I was paired with a senior dev and shifted to frontend (React), which I’m more comfortable with.My problem is that I’m still not learning like I want to. I lean too heavily on ChatGPT and feel like I don’t really understand what I’m doing. I feel stuck and like I’m not becoming a better software engineer. I’m constantly being rejected from even other graduate level dev jobs, and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I have completed a couple of interviews, one company was kind of a dream role which I do think I was pretty unqualified for but I did get to the final stage of the process. I actually pulled out of another interview process because I realised during the first interview that this wasn’t the right job for me.So here’s what I’m doing to try to learn and get better. I have an active github with personal projects, and a publicly available CV website. I attempt most leetcode daily challenges, and complete online udemy courses. I also attend local tech meetups and listen to tech podcasts to expand my knowledge.So these are my questions:* *How do I get better as a software engineer when I feel like I’m just guessing or relying on AI?** *What do other junior devs do to actually learn rather than just getting by?** *Why do I keep getting rejected from other jobs/how can I make myself stand out?*Any advice, resources or honest stories from other devs would really help.

The thing is:1. They pay less2. It’s for a US-based startup , and there aren’t many real benefits3. It’s full-time (not contractor)4. It’s kind of weird because the technical interview is basically a classic FullStack mini-project, nothing AI-related… it seems like the position is more oriented towards FullStack work and consuming LLMs. My friend told me he’s now learning TensorFlow/PyTorch (which is actually what interests me the most, same as Architecture modeling), but apparently he doesn’t work strictly with that.----------------------------------------I’ve been looking for Senior Mobile jobs in my stack for the past 6 months — they obviously pay more and have better benefits (though I haven't been lucky, I always make it to the 3rd interview only).---My questions are:1- What future do you see for Mobile? With AI and the current market, I’m seeing fewer open roles (in LATAM more than anything). Do you think it makes sense to pivot to something with more demand?

They’re all in relatively the same location and all are full time upon placement(not contract to hire). The two considerations I’m struggling with the most are:1. Tech stack.

Trying to weigh roles with tech I’m comfortable in against immersing myself in Java to insulate against future job searches. 2. Pay discrepancy between large and small contractors.

I'm an Los Angeles based Sr. Dev with \~9 YOE. Haven't been on the hunt in a while, so I wanted opinions on each of the job listing sites and their pros/cons.LinkedIn was king last time I was looking. I used to have multiple recruiters DMing me every day, but that's all in the past. Even jobs that have been posted < 4 hours ago have 100+ applications. However, applying here is really simple. So maybe this lends itself to bots, etc.Dice/Indeed seemed very scammy with overall lower quality postings than the last time I tried using them.

1ks05ut,How do you explain your thought process while programming?,djmax121,cscareerquestions,"I absolutely suck at this on a comical level. SWE with 3 almost 4 years of industry experience with a good amount of projects and some Leetcode practice also. I can program. Doing it live, in 15 minutes, while explaining what I’m thinking, with 3 other engineers watching over me though? Feels like a 30 IQ debuff at the very least.It’s honestly like language processing and logical reasoning exist on separate threads, in different languages in my brain. So not only do I have to interrupt the logic thread which is necessary for a coherent, correct solution, I also need to translate it into English language to be presentable and make sense, on the fly. But also keep enough reference of the logic to have something to return to once I explain a point. The result is both threads are interrupted frequently and produce incoherent responses. On top of the pressure of being watched and judged for it.That’s why I can program a solution in whole, then I can explain it well after it’s all done. Each thread can complete one by one without loss of context mid execution.Does anyone have any advice? Ideally if you used to be bad at this, but got significantly better? Is it just a matter of more exposure? This feels insurmountable since I’ve always been this way. Top of math class, but teacher asks me to walk through a solution on the whiteboard?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on which path would be best to start my career. Ideally, I’d like to stay flexible and be able to explore different areas in the future if my curiosity changes, so I don't want an area that will specialize me too much too early. I have always heard BE engineering seems to be the best role for this kind of felxibility, but please let me know what you think!Here's the list of opportunities, ordered from most attractive to least (in my opinion):### Backend Engineer Internship at a Product Company- **Duration:** 9-month internship, with a possibility of a full-time offer afterwards.- **Tech stack:** Spring, Kafka, SQL and NoSQL databases.- **Pros:** I love everything about this—tech stack, company culture, team vibe.- **Cons:** The pay is lower than the other (non-internship) offers for the first 9 months.---### Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at a Product Company- **Status:** Interview scheduled next week.- **Details:** The company was acquired by a major player, so it seems relatively stable.- **Pros:** I find SRE work interesting.- **Concerns:** I'm worried that starting my career in SRE might limit my ability to change into other areas later on.---### Backend Engineer at an Outsourcing Consultancy- **Status:** Passed HR round; they're waiting on salary expectations.- **Details:** They want to move me forward to client interviews.- **Pros:** I expect to learn a lot, and they were open to salary negotiations—even with my slightly above-entry-level ask.- **Cons:** Still unclear which client or project I'd end up on.---### Data Scientist at a Consulting Company- **Status:** Just received the message; haven't responded yet.- **Details:** Seems to involve in-house consulting, with a focus on machine learning.- **Pros:** They seem very enthusiastic about some ML stuff in my CV and my Python experience (pretty advanced for an entry level).- **Cons:** I’m not particularly interested in data roles right now. I'd only consider it for a very high salary (mid-level developer range), which might be unrealistic for an entry-level hire.---### Internship at a Startup- **Status:** Offer available.- **Details:** The startup recently closed a big contract and is expanding.- **Pros:** I'd probably learn a lot quickly.- **Cons:** Very low pay. Feels unstable. Work would include a mix of backend, data, and no-code frontend (only one other dev on the team). Might make transitioning to more traditional jobs harder later on.Thank you so much in advance! :)",3,0.64,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ktrop2/help_choosing_my_first_tech_job_backend_sre_or/,2025-05-23 19:02:05,2025-05-25 01:48:51
