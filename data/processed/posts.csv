1mbs1iw,Data Engineering Job Market - What the Hell Happened?,MoRakOnDi,dataengineering,"I might come off as complaining, but it’s been 9 months since I started hunting for a new data engineering position with zero luck. After 7 years of doing DE (working with Oracle BI, self-hosted Spark clusters, and optimizing massive Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses) I’m feeling stuck. For the first time, I’ve made it to the final stages with 8 companies, but unlike before when I’d land multiple offers, I'm totally out of luck.What’s changed?Why are companies acting like jerks?Last week, I had a design review meeting with an athletic clothing company, and the guy grilled me on specific design details that felt like his assigned homework; then he rejected me. I’ve spent days working on over 10 take-home assignments, and some looked like Jira tasks, only to get this: “While your take-home showed solid architectural thinking and familiarity with a wide range of data tools, the team felt you lacked the clarity and technical depth to match in the design review meeting.”Seriously? Last year, I was hiring a senior BI engineer and couldn’t find anyone who could write a left join SQL, and now I’m expected to write a query for complex marketing metrics on the fly and still fall short?Here’s what I’ve noticed:* Take-home assignments often feel like ticket work, not real evaluations.* Teams seem to gatekeep, shutting out anyone new.* There’s a huge gap between job descriptions and technical discussions. e.g., the JD and hiring manager were all about AWS Glue, but the technical questions were focused on managing and optimizing a self-hosted Spark cluster on Kubernetes.* Transferable skills get ignored. I’ve worked with BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, Apache Beam, MongoDB, Airflow, Databricks, GCP, AWS, and set up Delta Lake in my assignment, but I couldn't recite the technical differences between Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Nope, not good enough. I got rejected.Do you guys really know all the technologies? Are you some sort of god or what? I can’t know every tech, but I can master anything new. why won’t they see that anymore?I’m tired of this crap! It’s not fair. No one values transferable skills anymore; they demand an exact match on tech stack, plus a massive time spent on prep work: online exams and technical assignments, only to get a “no” at the end.\-----\[EDIT\]I'm not a victim here; I already have a job with decent pay, 17 years of experience, and I want to switch to a better team with a 10% pay cut because I have a shitty boss.",420,0.93,119,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mbs1iw/data_engineering_job_market_what_the_hell_happened/,2025-07-28 20:52:39,2025-07-31 01:53:33

1m9xbk5,Primary Keys: Am I crazy?,bengen343,dataengineering,"TLDR: Is there any reason *not* to use primary keys in your data warehouse? Even if there aren't any legitimate reasons, what are your devil's advocate arguments against using them?Maybe I am, indeed, the one who is crazy here since I'm interested in getting the thoughts of actual humans rather than ChatGPT, but... I've encountered quite the gamut of warehouse designs over the course of my time, especially in my consulting days. During this time, I've come to think of primary keys as ""table stakes"" (har har) in the creation of any table. In all my time, I've only encountered two outfits that didn't have any sort of key strategy. In the case of the first, their explanation was ""Ah yeah, we messed that up and should probably fix that."" But, now, in the case of this latest one, they're treating their lack of keys as a legitimate design choice. This seems unbelievable to me, but I thought I'd take this to the judgement of the broader group: is there a good reason to avoid having any primary keys?I think there are ample reasons to have some sort of key strategy:* Data quality tests: makes it easier to check for unique records and guard against things like fanout.* Lineage: makes it easy to trace the movement of a single record through tables.* Keeps code DRY (don't repeat yourself): effective use of primary/foreign keys can prevent complex \`join\` logic from being repeated in multiple places. * Not to mention general \`join\` efficiency* Interpretability: makes it easier for users to intuitively reason about a table's grain and the way \`join\`s should work.I'd be curious if anyone has any arguments against the above bullets or keys in data warehouses, specifically, more broadly.Full disclosure, I may turn this discussion into a blog post so I can lay out my argument once and for all.

1md5wp9,quick PSA on LLM fear.,Thinker_Assignment,dataengineering,"hey folks, i see a lot of fear of LLMs and i just wanted to say we are doing ourselves a disservice by having knee jerk reactions against it.# The real threat isn’t replacement. It’s displacement.Your work isn’t actually replaceable by autocomplete. But it **looks like it is,** and that’s the problem.LLMs are built to sound confident, not to be correct. They generate fluent, plausible output that gives the *illusion* of competence, without understanding, judgment, or responsibility.So the danger isn’t the model. **It’s your manager thinking you’re replaceable.** Or their manager pressuring them to “do more AI, less people.” Or a CFO using AI as cover for layoffs in a foggy, panic-driven economy.You won’t be replaced by a language model. But you can be **displaced** by the perception that one is “good enough.” The next few years look the same: Industry is adding: memory, tools, multimodal input, even planning— Still out of reach, no clear pathway ahead: **true cognition, self-awareness, reasoning under uncertainty, and grounded understanding.** even today for cognitive restructuring and grounding we use 2k year old methods like socratic questioning - we're nowhere close to solving this.# How you can win this fight Right now, every company is standing in a dense AI fog. No one knows what’s real, what’s hype, or how to use these tools safely.The most valuable roles today? They go to the **LLM navigators** — the people who understand what's possible, what’s coming, and how to steer through uncertainty.It’s the same prestige arc we saw with data 15 years ago. With ML 5–10 years ago. And now it’s your turn.You don’t need to be an LLM expert. But if you’re the one testing tools, forming opinions, stress-testing outputs, and helping others make sense of it all — you’ve already stepped into leadership.**Be the scout.** The one-eyed engineer guiding the blind through this strange new frontier. It’s improv now. The answer is “yes, and…” → Yes, and let’s do it safely. → Yes, and let’s make the most of it. → Yes, and let’s not blow up the business.But “no”? no AI, no experiments, no change? This will get interpreted as “no value.” ""falling behind"" ""missed opportunity"" ""company risk"". And if you’re a blocker, the system will set you free and find a helper.So don’t be a victim. Don’t freeze. Don’t frame it as *you vs. AI.* That’s a losing game.Frame it as: **“I’m the one who understands AI. I’ll help us use it — safely, effectively, and with eyes open.”**That’s who companies want. That’s who they’re **desperate** to invest in. And while you personally as an engineer may not care, this is the **prestige** that data managers in large companies are after - they want to be the person steering the company in AI age, keep job, get promoted, take credit for riding the possibilities out there. It's almost like whitepapers used to be a few years ago. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

1maloa5,Leaving a Company Where I’m the Only One Who Knows How Things Work. Advice?,WasabiBobbie,dataengineering,"Hey all,I’m in a bit of a weird spot and wondering if anyone else has been through something similar.I’m about to put in my two weeks at a company where, honestly, I’m the only one who knows how most of our in-house systems and processes work. I manage critical data processing pipelines that, if not handled properly, could cost the company a lot of money. These systems were built internally and never properly documented, not for lack of trying, but because we’ve been operating on a skeleton crew for years. I've asked for help and bandwidth, but it never came. That’s part of why I’m leaving: the pressure has become too much.Here’s the complication:I made the decision to accept a new job the day before I left for a long-planned vacation.My new role starts right after my trip, so I’ll be giving my notice during my vacation, meaning 1/4th of my two weeks will be PTO.I didn’t plan it like this. It’s just unfortunate timing.I genuinely don’t want to leave them hanging, so I plan to offer help after hours and on weekends for a few months to ensure they don’t fall apart. I want to do right by the company and my coworkers.Has anyone here done something similar, offering post-resignation support?How did you propose it?Did you charge them, and if so, how did you structure it?Do you think my offer to help after hours makes up for the shortened two-week period?Is this kind of timing faux pas as bad as it feels?Appreciate any thoughts or advice, especially from folks who’ve been in the “only one who knows how everything works” position.",122,0.87,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1maloa5/leaving_a_company_where_im_the_only_one_who_knows/,2025-07-27 12:59:37,2025-07-31 01:53:33

1mce29s,A little rant on (aspiring) data engineers,Stock-Contribution-6,dataengineering,"Hi all, this is a little rant on data engineering candidates mostly, but also about hiring processes.As everybody, I've been on the candidate side of the process a lot over the years and processes are all over the place, so I understand both the complaints on being asked leetcode/cs theory questions or being tasked with take-home assigned that feel like actual tickets. Thankfully I've never been judged by an AI bot or did any video hiring.That's why now that I've been hiring people I try to design a process that is humane, checks on the actual concepts rather than tools or cs theory and gets an overview of the candidate's programming skills.Now the meat of my rant starts. I see curriculums filled to the brim with all the tools in existance and very few years of experience. I see peopel straight up using AI for every single question in the most blatant way possible. Many candidates mostly cannot code at all past the level of a YouTube tutorial.It's very grim and there seems to be just no shame in feeding any request in any form to the latest bullshit AI that spews out complete trash.Rant over. I don't think most people will take this seriously or listen to what I'm saying because it's a delicate subject, but if you have to take anything out of this post is to stop using AIs for the technical part because it's very easy to spot and it doesn't help anybody.TLDR: stop using AI for the technical step of hiring, it's more damaging than anything",112,0.88,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mce29s/a_little_rant_on_aspiring_data_engineers/,2025-07-29 15:12:15,2025-07-31 01:53:33
1m92akn,From DE Back to SWE: Trading Pay for Sanity,Kairos243,dataengineering,"Hi, I found this on a YouTube comment, I'm new to DE, is it true?---Yep. Software engineer for 10+ years, switched to data engineering in 2021 after discovering it via business intelligence/data warehousing solutions I was helping out with. I thought it was a great way to get off the dev treadmill and write mostly SQL day to day and it turned out I was really good at it, becoming a tech lead over the next 18 months. I'm trying to go back to dev now. So much stuff as a data engineer is completely out of your control but you're expected to just fix it. People constantly question numbers if it doesn't match their vibes. Nobody understands the complexities. It's also so, so hard to test in the same concrete way as regular services and applications.Data teams are also largely full of non-technical people. I regularly have to argue with/convince people that basic things like source control are necessary. Even my fellow engineers won't take five minutes to read how things like Docker or CI/CD workflows function.I'm looking at a large pay cut going back to being a dev but it's worth my sanity.

1m8vf1g,What's your opinion on star schema approach in Analytics?,Kukaac,dataengineering,"Dear Fellow Data Engineer,I've been doing data for about 15 years (mostly in data analytics and data leadership - so not hardcore DE, but had DEs reporting to me). Recently, I joined a company that tries to build data models with full star schema normalization, as it was a transactional database.For example, I have a User entity that can be tagged. One user can have multiple Tags.They would create * the User entity* the Tag entity, which only contains the tag (no other dimension or metric)* a UserTag entity that references a many-to-many relationship between the twoAll tables would be SCD2, so it would be separately tracked when the Tag was first recognized and when the Tag has changed.Do you think this approach is normal, and I've been living under a rock? They reason that they want to build something long-term and structured. I would never do something like this, because it just complicates simple things that work anyway.I understand the concept of separating dimensions and fact data, but, in my opinion, creating dedicated tables for enums is rare, even in transactional models.Their progress is extremely slow. Approximately 20 people have been building this data lakehouse with stringent security, governance, and technical requirements (SCD2 for all transformations, with only recalculated IDs between entities) for over two years, but there is still no end-user solution in production due to slow velocity and quality issues.",65,1.0,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m8vf1g/whats_your_opinion_on_star_schema_approach_in/,2025-07-25 10:17:21,2025-07-31 01:53:33

A lot of times recursive CTEs hide data modeling issues underneath - using the RANK window function Skipping ranks is never needed and causes annoying problems. Use DENSE_RANK or ROW_NUMBER 100% of the time unless you work for data analytics for the Olympics- using INSERT INTO Writing data should be a single idempotent and atomic operation. This means you should be using MERGE or INSERT OVERWRITE 100% of the time. Some older databases don’t allow this, in which case you should TRUNCATE/DELETE first and then INSERT INTO.

After a lot of effort, I got an offer from a known consulting company. The role was labeled as Data Engineer, and it sounded like the kind of step up I had been looking for — better tools, better projects, and a brand name that looked solid on paper.Fast forward ~9 months, and honestly, I regret the move almost every single day.There’s barely any actual engineering work. The focus is all on meeting strict client deadlines (which company usually promise to clients), crafting stories, and building slide decks. All the company cares about is how we sell stories to clients, not the quality of the solution or any meaningful technical growth. There’s hardly any real engineering happening — no time to explore, no time to learn, and no one really cares about the tech unless it looks good in a PPT.To make things worse, the work-life balance is terrible. I’m often stuck working late into the night working (mostly 12+ hrs). It’s all about output and timelines — not the quality of work or the well-being of the team.For context, my background is:•~3 years working with SQL, Python, and ETL tools ( like Informatica PowerCenter)•~1 year of experience with PySpark and Databricks•Comfortable building ETL pipelines, doing performance tuning, and working in cloud environments (AWS mostly)I joined this role to grow technically, but that’s not happening here.

I’m wondering: is it possible to automate these data quality checks and the cleanup process before promoting the data to the silver layer?Right now, the only approach I can think of is to brute-force it, table by table—which obviously doesn't seem like the most scalable or efficient solution.Have any of you faced a similar situation?

1mbypdh,Is data engineering becoming more plug and play? A few questions about the profession.,EversonElias,dataengineering,"I got into data engineering during the pandemic, when an internship opportunity came up. I find the profession interesting, but I don't think I've ever really found myself in it. What's more, I've only had experience with medium-complexity projects. I don't think I ever really worked with big data. That's why I decided to ask you about it, because my view may have some negative bias.Where I've worked, I've used a lot of ready-made solutions on well-known platforms, such as Databricks, GCP and Azure (including Fabric). With each passing day, I feel that I've picked up many ready-made things. The connectors are ready, the platforms are ready and some already offer options to optimize automatically. Not that it's a bad thing, because this abstraction makes work easier and allows us to focus on what's most important: modeling, security, scalability, data quality, etc.However, even that makes me a little worried about my future in the profession. The platforms are going to offer more and more pre-assembled configurations. What will be left to challenge me in the profession? Sometimes I see myself as a doer of the same things and less of a creator... I've sent out a few CVs recently and haven't had many replies, so it could be that I'm actually taking a rather pessimistic view.

1mb47hg,Struggling to keep up in my first real engineering role — advice from anyone who’s been there?,Past_University_7144,dataengineering,"I come from a self taught background, and have been in my F200 “Data engineer” role for about a year. I started in GIS for a couple years in the public sector, teaching myself Python, SQL, and OOP. Automated some stuff in ArcPy, tinkered using trial and error. At the time, didn’t really know what unit testing was or best practices, just scripting things I can run manually to automate work or calculations.Then through a combination of skills I built and connections I got a BI job for a year or two, again in the public sector, building more skills in power bi, sql, and python to load data into sql. Learned more about reusability, but didn’t really fundamentally understand software development. We were a shop where my manager or other people on the team didn’t really want to learn beyond what was necessary, and I was just figuring things out through trial and error again as the only guy who was motivated. No unit testing or anything there either. I didn’t even really know about best practices or unit testing until my current job.Fast forward, through other connections I got a referral to a F200 company where tech is not the product. Got the job as “data engineer”. Ever since joining I feel like a total failure. We have one person on the team younger than me who has been there a couple years, is whip smart, initiates convos with the business, and is already promoted to senior. Everyone else is 10+ year seniors. My problems are the following:- Upon my hire, the tech lead was a total asshole, denigrating my abilities via passive aggressive behavior, destroying my confidence. He has since left. I went to my manager about it and at one point let some tears out saying I feel like I was doing a bad job, and I feel like they no longer respect me. We no longer have 1:1s or talk about anything really while he still talks regularly to the rest of the team- My technical intuition is nowhere near as strong as my peers, and I often need hand holding in solution design- I make dumb mistakes and am not as attentive to detail as I feel I should be, occasionally rushing my work due to feeling like if I don’t I’ll be found out as a fraud - An example of this is manually editing a bunch of JSON, where with no way to test it across a couple hundred lines I had a few typos- I am the only “BI” guy in my org, everyone else is stronger in software engineering. Everyone. Our team is based on developing a new data platform and reporting solution, but everything from the app to the data pipelines feels out of my depth, seeing as my background is in developing much lower level solutions. Our org is all CRUD devs. I’ve never even written a unit test, and most of my work has been SQL pipelines or reporting- I don’t give a shit about the domain (by this - I mean the business, not DE). I thought the money would make me care, and I still kind of try, but I don’t have the fire to go and seek out knowledge beyond what I need to for my current tasksNobody has told me I’m doing poorly directly but I’ve had conversations about my lack of attention to detail with one of my peers, just being warned to take my time and have it done right.I guess it’s just the constant comparing myself to not only my teammates but everyone around me. I feel like the village idiot. My first jobs had a mentality of “let’s figure it out together”, despite a lack of desire to really go beyond to learn more than necessary. Now, the pressure to deliver is higher, and I feel woefully behind. I also struggle to be motivated.

It’s a mess! Talend is EOL, buggy, and impossible to collaborate on. We're rebuilding with open-source tools, without buying into the modern data stack hype.Figuring out:* The right mix of tools for ELT and transformation* Whether to centralize all customer data (ClickHouse) or keep siloed Postgres per tenant* Whether to stay batch-first or prepare for streaming. Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.\---Hey all!We’re currently modernizing our internal data platform and trying to do it without going on a shopping spree across the modern data stack hype.# Current setup:* PostgreSQL (\~80–100GB per customer, growing \~5% yearly), Kimball Modelling with facts & dims, only one schema, no raw data or staging area* Talend Open Studio OS (free, but EOL)* Shell scripts for orchestration* Tableau Server* ETL approach* Sources: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, APIs, flat filesWe're in the parking industry and handle data like parking transactions, payments, durations, etc. We don’t need real-time yet, but streaming might become relevant (think of live occupancies, etc) so we want to stay flexible.# Why we’re moving on:Talend Open Studio (free version) is a nightmare. It crashes constantly, has no proper git integration (kinda impossible to work as a team) and it's not supported anymore.Additionally, we have no real deployment cycle, we do it all via shell scripts from deployments to running our etls (yep... you read that right) and waste hours and days on such topics.We have no real automations - hotfixes, updates, corrections are all manual and risky.We’ve finally convinced management to let us change the tech stack and started hearing words ""modern this, cloud that"", etc... But we’re not replacing the current stack with 10 overpriced tools just because someone slapped “modern” on the label.We’re trying to build something that:* Actually works for our use case* Is maintainable, collaborative, and reproducible* Keeps our engineers and company market-relevant* And doesn’t set our wallets on fire# Our modernization idea:* Python + PySpark for pipelines* ELT instead of ETL* Keep postgres but add staging and raw schemas additionally to the analytics/business one* Airflow for orchestration* Maybe dbt for modeling / we’re skeptical* Great Expectations for data validation* Vault for secrets* Docker + Kubernetes + Helm for containerization and deployment* Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring/logging* Git for everything - versioning, CI/CD, reviews, etc.All self-hosted and open-source (for now).# The big question: architectureStill not sure whether to go:* Centralized: ClickHouse with flat, denormalized tables for all customers (multi-tenant)* Siloed: One Postgres instance per customer (better isolation, but more infra overhead)Our sister company went full cloud using Debezium, Confluent Cloud, Kafka Streams, ClickHouse, etc. It looks blazing fast but also like a cost-heavy setup. We’re hesitant to go that route unless it becomes absolutely necessary.I believe having one hosted instance for all customers might not be a bad idea in general and would make more sense than having to deploy a ""product"" to 10 different servers for 10 different customers.# Questions for the community:* Anyone migrated off Talend Open Studio? How did it go, and what did you switch to?* If you’re self-hosted on Postgres, is dbt worth it?* Is self-hosting Airflow + Spark painful, or fine with the right setup?* Anyone gone centralized DWH and regretted it? Or vice versa?* Doing batch now but planning for streaming - anything we should plan ahead for?* Based on our context, what would your rough stack look like?We’re just trying to build something solid and clean and not shoot ourselves in the foot by following some trendy nonsense.Appreciate any advice, stories, or “wish I had known earlier” insights.

1mbbnlf,Dreaming of Graphs in the Open Lakehouse,ssinchenko,dataengineering,"**TLDR:**I’ve been thinking a lot about making graphs first-class citizens in the Open Lakehouse ecosystem. Tables, geospatial data, and vectors are already considered first-class citizens, but property graphs are not. In my opinion, this is a significant gap, especially given the growing popularity of AI and Graph RAG. To achieve this, we need at least two components: tooling for graph processing and a storage standard like open tables (e.g., Apache Iceberg).Regarding storage, there is a young project called Apache GraphAr (incubating) that aims to become the storage standard for property graphs. The processing ecosystem is already interesting:* GraphFrames (batch, scalable, and distributed). Think of it as Apache Spark for graphs.* Kuzu is fast, in-memory, and in-process. Think of it as DuckDB for graphs.* Apache HugeGraph is a standalone server for queries and can be thought of as a Clickhouse or Doris for graphs.HugeGraph already supports reading and writing GraphAr to some extent. Support will be available soon in GraphFrames (I hope so, and I'm working on it as well). Kuzu developers have also expressed interest and informed me that, technically, it should not be very difficult (and the GraphAr ticket is already open).This is just my personal vision—maybe even a dream. It feels like all the pieces are finally here, and I’d love to see them come together.",10,0.92,2,https://semyonsinchenko.github.io/ssinchenko/post/dreams-about-graph-in-lakehouse/,2025-07-28 09:31:59,2025-07-31 01:53:33

It’s been a great learning experience, and I feel proud of the progress so far.I'm now looking to deepen my skills and become more proficient in building robust, scalable data solutions. I'm planning to start learning Docker, Airflow, and Git to take my ETL workflows to the next level.For those of you who have gone down this path, what would you recommend I focus on next?

1m8yuyv,Newbie question | Version control for SQL queries?,HotDamnNam,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,Bit of a newbie question for all you veterans.We're transitioning to Microsoft Fabric and Azure DevOps. Some of our Data Analysts have asked about version control for their SQL queries. It seems like a very mature and useful practice, and I’d love to help them get set up properly. However, I’m not entirely sure what the current best practices are.So far, I’ve found that I can query our Fabric Warehouse using the MSSQL extension in VSCode. It’s a bit of a hassle since I have to manually copy the query into a `.sql` file and push it to DevOps using Git. But at least everything happens in one program: querying, watching results, editing, and versioning.That said, our analysts typically work directly in Fabric and don’t use VSCode. Ideally, they’d be able to query and version their SQL directly within Fabric, without switching environments. From what I’ve seen, Fabric doesn’t seem to support source control for SQL queries natively (outside of notebooks). Or am I missing something?Curious to hear how others are handling this, with and without Fabric.Thanks in advance!Edit: forgot to mention I used Git as well, haha",9,0.91,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m8yuyv/newbie_question_version_control_for_sql_queries/,2025-07-25 13:14:38,2025-07-31 01:53:33

1m9nykt,Data Quality Profiling/Reporting tools,Kojimba228,dataengineering,"Hi,When trying to Google for the tools matching my usecass, there is so much bloat, blurred definitions and ads that I'm confused out of my mind with this one. I will attempt to describe my requirements to the best of my ability, with certain constraints that we have and which are mandatory. Okay, so, our usecase is consuming a dataset via AWS Lakeformation shared access. Read-only, with the dataset being governed by another team (and very poorly at that).Data in the tables is partitioned on two keys, each representing a source database and schema from which a given table was ingested. Primarily, the changes that we want to track are: 1. count of nulls in columns of each table (an average would do, I think; reason for it is they once have pushed a change where nulls occupied majority of the columns and records, which went unnoticed for some time :smiling_face_with_tear:)2. changes in table volume (only increase is expected, but you never know)3. schema changes (either Data type changes, or, primarily, new column additions)4. Place for extended fancy reports to feed to BAs to do some digging, but if not available it's not a showstopper. To do the profiling/reporting we have the option of using Glue (with PySpark), Lambda functions, Athena. This what I tried so far:1. Gx. Overbloated, overcomplicated, doesn't do simple or extended summary reports, without predefined checks/""expectations"";2. Ydata-profiling. Doesn't support missing values check with PySpark, even if provided PySpark dataframe it casts it to pandas (bruh). 3. Just write custom PySpark code to collect the required checks. While doable, yes, setting up another visualisation layer on top, is surely going to be a pain in the ass. Plus, all this feels like redeveloping the wheel. Am I wrong to assume that a tool exists that has the capabilities described?

1m81i0v,Liquibase best practices,tech-man-ua,dataengineering,"I am building a Liquibase foundation for one of our repositories and have a couple of questions in mind. I went through the official 'best practices' page multiple times, Liquibase forum and other pages, but still can't get complete answers. I am using community edition + PostgreSQL. I am a backend engineer, not a DB person.1. >Unless you are grouping several changes as a single transaction, we strongly encourage you to specify only one change per changeset. This approach makes each change ""atomic"" within a single transaction.I understand the reasoning behind this: some DBMS, including Postgre I use, auto-commit DDL statements such as *createTable, createTrigger,* so if I have multiple DDLs in a single changeset and error happens on the later one, Liquibase does not mark the whole changeset as ""RUN"", but because every successful DDL is going to be auto-committed, this creates a conflict whenever I retrigger the update.What is unclear to me is if I should **ALWAYS** create single 'atomic' changesets for DDL operations? I do createTable that should have a Foreign Key index so the next command would be createIndex on that FK. Logically, createTable and createIndex should be considered as a single operation so it makes sense to group them. But because they are DDLs, should I split them up?2. I am following Liquibase recommendation to have a separate changelog for rerunnable (runOnChange = true) logic such as functions / triggers. That is going to be similar question to #1. Because my trigger/function declarations have DROP IF EXISTS or CREATE OR REPLACE, I could group them under the same changeset. But is it correct? databaseChangeLog: - changeSet: id: periods-log-trigger author: XYZ runOnChange: true changes: - sqlFile: path: db/functions/periods-log.function.sql - sqlFile: path: db/triggers/periods-log.trigger.sql rollback: - sql: sql: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS periods_log_function()3. Back to table and its trigger. createTable has auto-rollback out-of-the-box. Because trigger does not make sense without a table, when table is dropped, trigger is dropped automatically. Although I still need to drop the function used in the trigger.Because createTable and trigger changelog are two separate changesets, how should one manage rollback? Do I always need to write a rollback for trigger even though it is going to be dropped if table is dropped?Thanks everyone!",10,0.92,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m81i0v/liquibase_best_practices/,2025-07-24 11:09:28,2025-07-31 01:53:33

1mcrhcq,Offer decision,Existing-Mousse3509,dataengineering,"Hi, first of all I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this, for my English (as it's not my first language), and for any mistakes since this is my first time posting.I'm writing here to ask for advice regarding a decision I need to make between two offers I've received. I'm unsure which one to take, as I’m trying to evaluate how each could benefit me in the future.To give some context, I have a BSc in Computer Science and worked for a year as a Software Engineer. During that time, I became interested in data, so I decided to leave my job and enroll in a Master’s in Data Science, from which I recently graduated. During the program, I was particularly interested in subjects related to Big Data and Cloud, more so than ML and DL. Then I started to see Data Engineering as a great career path, since I think it combines my previous software engineering skills with data, and I’m also quite interested in architecture.Now, about the two offers:On one hand, I received an offer from a tech consultancy focused on data. It’s aimed at recent graduates and includes a short training period in technologies like Scala and Spark, after which you start working on a client project. I like that this offer is very focused on people wanting to pursue a Data Engineering career, which really appeals to me. It also offers full remote work, which I appreciate (although I’d also like the option to go to the office and meet people). From what I’ve seen, over time you can progress toward a Data Architect role, which I also find interesting.However, most of the people who have been part of this program in previous years seem to come from non-tech backgrounds or bootcamps, and managed to get in with minimal justification. In fact, when I got the offer call, they told me I was one of the most qualified candidates they’d seen in terms of education and IT experience, which made me a bit skeptical. Another downside is that this offer pays less than the second one, and I might end up being subcontracted to the same client that the second offer comes from.The second offer comes from a well-known bank in my country. After going through several processes, I was offered the position of ""Data Scientist Analyst"", and they told me I could choose the department that interested me most. I chose the Engineering department because it seemed the most appealing, and they mentioned that they work closely with other Data Engineers and Architects. Even though they mentioned some technologies I’m familiar with (Python, SQL, PySpark, Git, BigQuery, CI/CD), it still feels like the role is more data science–oriented than engineering.The positives are that the bank pays more and has better benefits overall, and it could add some prestige to my cv even if the experience isn’t exactly what I’m looking for. On the downside, I'm required to go to the office 3 days a week, and it’s quite far from where I live by public transport. If I want to drive there, I’d have to wake up very early to avoid traffic and not lose my whole day. Also, from what I’ve read and seen from others working there, the role seems very focused on ML, which doesn’t excite me that much, I actually got Little bit bored of it during the Master’s. But then again, maybe working on ML in a real job is very different from studying it in university, so it might turn out to be more interesting than I expect.That’s why I’m unsure whether I should take the first offer or take a chance on the second one, see if I like it, and if not, try to pivot to a more suitable project/ department or job in the bank, and leave with some experience if it doesn’t work out. I feel like if I reject the bank now, I probably won’t get another chance to work there in the future.So I’m looking for opinions and different perspectives from others, because honestly, I feel a bit lost and don’t really know which path to take since nowadays Data Engineering seems more appealing.Again, sorry because probably I forgot to mention so many details, either way I’ll be happy to answer questions you might have.",6,0.67,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mcrhcq/offer_decision/,2025-07-29 23:49:57,2025-07-31 01:53:33

1marnw3,Dimensional Modeling Periodic Snapshot Standard Practices,Boltonet12,dataengineering,"Our company is relatively new to using dimensional models but we have a need for viewing account balances at certain points in time. Our company has billions of customer accounts so to take daily snapshots of these balances would be millions per day (excluding 0 dollar balances because our business model closes accounts once reaching 0). What I've imagined was creating a periodic snapshot fact table where the balance for each account would utilize the snapshot from the end of the day but only include rows for end of week, end of month, and yesterday (to save memory and processing for days we are not interested in); then utilize a flag in the date dimension table to filter to monthly dates, weekly dates, or current data. I know standard periodic snapshot tables have predefined intervals; to me this sounds like a daily snapshot table that utilizes the dimension table to filter to the dates you're interested in. My leadership seems to feel that this should be broken out into three different fact tables (current, weekly, monthly). I feel that this is excessive because it's the same calculation (all time balance at end of day) and could have overlap (i.e. yesterday could be end of week and end of month). Since this is balances at a point in time at end of day and there is no aggregations to achieve ""weekly"" or ""monthly"" data, what is standard practice here? Should we take leadership's advice or does it make more sense the way I envisioned it?

Use Airflow’s data_interval_start macro to identify and read all S3 files for the relevant partition and generate a manifest file.2. Use the manifest to load data into a Redshift staging table via the COPY command.3. Perform an upsert from the staging table into the target table.I plan to run the data load on ECS, with Airflow triggering the ECS task on schedule.My main question: I want to decouple config changes (YAML updates) from changes in the EL pipeline code.Would it make sense to store the YAML configs in S3 and pass a reference (like the S3 path or config name) to the ECS task via environment variables or task parameters?Also I want to create a separate ECS task for each table, is dynamic task mapping the best way to do this?

1ma19ck,App Integrations and the Data Lake,Full_Metal_Analyst,dataengineering,"We're trying to get away from our legacy DE tool, BO Data Services. A couple years ago we migrated our on prem data warehouse and related jobs to ADLS/Synapse/Databricks. Our app to app integrations that didn't source from the data warehouse were out of scope for the migration and those jobs remained in BODS. Working tables and history are written to an on prem SQL server, and the final output is often csv files that are sftp'ed to the target system/vendor. For on-prem targets, sometimes the job writes the data directly in.We'll eventually drop BODS altogether, but for now we want to build any new integrations using our new suite of tools. We have our first new integration we want to build outside of BODS, but after I saw the initial architecture plan for it, I brought together a larger architect group to discuss and align on a standard for this type of use case. The design was going to use a medallion architecture in the same storage account and bronze/silver/gold containers as the data warehouse uses and write back to the same on prem SQL we've been using, so I wanted to have a larger discussion about how to design for this.We've had our initial discussion and plan on continuing early next week, and I feel like we've improved a ton on the design but still have some decisions to make, especially around storage design (storage accounts, containers, folders) and where we might put the data so that our reporting tool can read it (on-prem SQL server write back, Azure SQL database, Azure Synapse, Databricks SQL warehouse).Before we finalize our standard for app integrations, I wanted to see if anyone had any specific guidance or resources I could read up on to help us make good decisions.For more context, we don't have any specific iPaaS tools, and the integrations that we support are fine to be processed in batches (typically once a day but some several times a day), so real-time/event-based use cases are not something we need to solve for here. We'll be using Databricks Python notebooks for the logic, unity catalog managed tables for storage (ADLS), and likely piloting orchestration using Datbricks for this first integration too (orchestration has been using Azure up to now).Thanks in advance for any help!",4,0.71,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ma19ck/app_integrations_and_the_data_lake/,2025-07-26 18:56:38,2025-07-31 01:53:33

Do some transformation/aggregation, store in partitioned parquet files.3. Push to more available database for API to query.I'm finding it tricky with this kind of data though, as I can't really partition or store the json in an identifiable way given the number of dimensions, without making a lot of partitions.

1mcdj71,Is it just me or is AI vibe coding the most painful and infuriating thing ever?,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"Now, I may be biased because I'm all for learning to code, but holy Christ the amount of times that I have given AI a chance, it has done nothing but hurt me emotionally. I have NO IDEA how those ""no-code"" people are even making ANYTHING half useful, maybe it's because they haven't learned how to code so to them all the AI obstacles are normal, but to someone who actually understands what should be happening, it hurts my soul.So, I'm big on the backend, that's what I like doing. I'm fine with making a website, I'm fine with HTML, I'm fine with JavaScript, but you're not catching me writing any CSS and so I let AI do it. ""Style it this way with the color scheme we specified and maintain the same style for the borders that we've been using, and put each element in it's own little border side-by side"". I paste in the CSS and the button is black instead of pink and each element is listed vertically instead of horizontally like I asked it to. And so what do I do? I tell it to please fix it. ""They're not side-by-side, they're being listed vertically, please fix it or tell me what changes to make, here is the broken code"". I paste the supposedly ""corrected code"" and.... nothing is corrected, IT'S STILL THE SAME. I spent at least 8 minutes doing that when I'm sure that if I had learned CSS like a normal front-end developer, I would've been able to solve that problem in 2 minutes max. And you know what the worst part is? The AI will tell you with 100% confidence, ""Oof, you're so close! Here is the corrected version"", and it's not the correct version.Another example, a few days ago I tried to give vibe coding another chance, just for the experience. I installed Cursor and I told the AI exactly what app I wanted to make. I wanted a mobile app that let's users track their water intake, calories, and create workout plans with a calendar in the app, the UI will be built with Kotlin, the backend with Java and the database will be SQLite. Very popular technologies used for mobile development, so it should be easy right? No, the AI couldn't even get past installing Java dependencies. It installed Gradle, but it installed version 4 which doesn't work with Java 21 and so instead of recommending that we upgrade Gradle, it instead recommends that we DOWNGRADE JAVA, to Java 17 WHICH ALSO DOESN'T WORK WITH GRADLE VERSION 4. I ended up giving up like 20 minutes into trying to start the damn project, I swear it was this back and forth of ""seems like this isn't working, should I proceed with ...?"" I press proceed because it seems like a reasonable thing to do and it didn't work, over and over and over again and because I know nothing about Kotlin and Java I didn't even know how to debug the thing, which makes the experience even more frustrating.

1m7yf1z,Codefinity yay or nay? My honest review after trying it.,FunnyAzn,learnprogramming,"I have been using Codefinity for a few weeks and wanted to share my honest review. Overall, I think Codefinity is a pretty solid platform for beginners. The interface is simple, and the lessons are broken down into small steps that make it easy to follow along without feeling overwhelmed. I really like that you can write and test code directly in the browser, which saves time switching between different tools. The built‑in AI assistant has also been helpful when I get stuck or need a quick explanation, and that feature makes the learning experience feel more interactive than just watching videos or reading articles.That said, there are some things to keep in mind. The pricing is not very clear at the start, and you only see some details after signing up. A few lessons in the beginning feel too basic if you already have some knowledge, but they do get more interesting as you move forward. I wouldn’t say it is perfect, but it has kept me motivated to practice regularly, which is something I struggled with on other platforms.Just to clarify I’m mainly using it to learn Python and get a stronger foundation in programming before moving on to data analysis and maybe web development later.I’m curious to hear from others who have tried Codefinity for a longer time. Did you find that the content goes beyond beginner level and really builds useful skills?

At least I'll have a major and a double minor instead of a double major--my other minor incidentally enough is also one of my favorite hobbies.

For a little more than a week, I have been learning Unity and C#. For fun. I don't think game dev is my thing.I have seen online that as programmers, university does open doors more easily, but work experience beats any title. Is that true? What should I focus on? Should I learn coding online? And then go for freelancer until I land a job? Or something like that? Should I go to university?

I’m 16M and barely have gotten into coding.I started learning around last September, hoping to eventually get a remote job. So far I’ve picked up some HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. One of my older cousins told me that if I get really good at those, it could be enough to land a job. So I stuck with it.But while trying to learn JS, I kept seeing videos and posts saying stuff like “do CS50 first before anything else.” So I started that, and I’m about 3 weeks in now.

It’s hard to know what actually matters.My goal is pretty simple: I just want a remote job in some decent western country. Even if it pays minimum wage (like $15k/year in the US or something), that would still be a big deal for me. I live in a third world country, and things aren’t great financially. I really want to help my family out as soon as I can.But yeah, I just don’t know what I should be doing right now to actually get closer to that.

The craftsmanship of coding feels like it is dying. I used to spend hours reading documentation, slowly building something through rigorous testing and tweaking, enjoying every part of the process. Now I just prompt and paste. There is zero fulfillment. When people talk about AI replacing programmers, most worry about losing their jobs.

I've been working as a developer in a non-tech company for 4 years making 78k CAD. I am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years. I love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education. However, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities. The reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.So I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.TL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job.

I always knew about computers, but never actually owned one until then—so I began with touch typing on January 4, learned HTML, CSS, and basically figured out how to use a computer properly for those first 3–4 months. I had some help from a senior in the summer (May–June) with HTML, CSS, and JS, and it felt pretty intuitive and fun.Then I decided to seriously learn the MERN stack and bought Colt Steele’s Web Dev course in July, which covered HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS, and VSC (Git, GitHub). But because of academic pressure, I barely coded at all during the final months of 2024—I got wrapped up more in Linux, version control, vim, and stuff like that and actually got pretty good at it. During a gap in November–December, I really enjoyed working with Linux, Lua, and was a Dotfile Engineer for a bit (which was honestly way more my vibe). Then, I learned some Python at a bootcamp in college/university, circled back to JavaScript in March, and then got into React in April/May.I’ll admit, I was really just rushing through React so I could get to backend stuff—I kept getting frustrated with frontend, and after talking with a couple of techie friends (with 7–8 years of experience each), they told me I’d probably be happier and do better if I went into backend, considering how much I liked working with Linux and all. I realized frontend really isn’t my thing: I can tweak things decently, but I can’t design or build from scratch like true frontend devs.So now, I’m currently in my 6th semester of engineering with exactly one year and 28 days left to graduate. I’ve just started learning Java and I’m actually liking it, especially compared to some parts of frontend. In my country, Java also seems to have way better career prospects, and the React/frontend job market is extremely saturated—tons of applicants for every position.Right now, the challenge is I’m just not sure how to organize my next steps. There’s a lot of anxiety because I’m still new, I’ve got 5 backlogs (3 in Maths), and it’s hard to stay motivated or focused when I don’t even know what to prioritize—should I hammer down Java fundamentals, focus on DSA, Leetcode, frameworks like Spring Boot, or work on projects?

I've been with said company for almost 11 months now.Over this past year, I've tasked with single-handedly developing an internal web application. This app includes a range of features - from web scrapers and data preprocessing scripts, to systems for managing and rating external collaborators, and even some AI agents that automate repetitive tasks.The stack I'd chosen to work with is Next.js, FastAPI and PostgreSQL.I won't lie - the journey developing this app has been a tough one. Being fresh out of university with limited knowledge and experience, and the only developer in the whole company meant a lot of trial and error and ambiguity in the beginning. But that challenge has also proven to help me grow as a person. I've learned many things of which I had no idea about before.That said, due to heavy nature of said responsibility and time constrains, I've also relied quite heavily on AI whenever I would hit a roadblock. While it's been helpful, I feel like it made me skip the deeper learning that comes from reading the docs and explore various sites, such as StackOverflow and others. Now, that the app had reached a solid state, I would like to go back and rectify my past mistakes.So now, I'm reaching out to the more experienced devs here:What books, courses, or other resources would you wholeheartedly recommend to someone who wants to deepen their skills, fill in knowledge gaps, and become truly solid - maybe even a ""cracked developer""? Something that would make me stand out from the rest of my peers as a SWE.Through this job, I’ve discovered a strong passion for Python, backend development (FastAPI) and Generative AI (LangGraph and LLMs' APIs) - so I’d love to also hear your suggestions on these topics on how I can become more proficient, perhaps even share with me some valuable tips.As I've mentioned earlier, being a solo dev - a beginner, nonetheless - often felt like I was missing out on a real growth experience. I didn’t have someone more experienced to learn from, to guide me when I was stuck, or just to point me in the right direction when things got overwhelming. I’m also pretty sure that while building the internal web app, there were better tools or approaches I could’ve used — I just didn’t know about them at the time. That's why I want to change that. I want to become a better dev and, due to the competitive nature of the current market, not get lost with the tide.",5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1md67si/looking_to_grow_as_a_junior_dev_need_help/,2025-07-30 13:11:17,2025-07-31 01:53:35

I liked it so much that I switched my major and college just to study CS.My 13 year old brother has recently been interested in programming, mostly because he's intrigued with how a computer works (same reason that made me start CS). He asked for some advice to start, and my plan was this:First, a university (not bootcamp) intro course. I was thinking CS61a but it will probably be too difficult, so maybe CS50x or MIT's intro class (I read SICP so I could help him). Second, at the same time, a quick guide on Lua or some language that will allow him to mod games, or maybe PyGame. I'm skipping Scratch as he wants to actually write code. Another option would be starting with Scheme (the language), as after learning basic Python I read up The Little Schemer and SICP which were crucial to my development as a Computer Scientist.How does all that sound? I like the idea of the uni course over other methods as it's structured, more difficult, they focus on the fundamentals, and I could probably help him if certain parts are too difficult. For those with kids who wanted to learn CS, what did you guys do? Would an intro uni course be too difficult? Also, how did you guys learn CS?

1mdai3n,Stuck with developing a device identification logic in my app - How should I proceed?,_ihsunaj,learnprogramming,"Hi Reddit!Last time I asked for your help in deciding the perfect backend and frontend and you guys pulled through. The development has been going good but we have run into an issue, as follows. Requesting any and all help you guys can provide:**Backend:** Python FastAPI **Frontend:** Flutter **User Authentication:** Firebase **IDE:** Android Studio**Problem Statement:** Our app will be used with a combination of Unique Mobile Number and Unique Email ID, which will create a Unique User ID (through Firebase). We want to make the app as such, that it **CANNOT** be accessed on more than one device wrt to the following conditions:1. App cannot be used at once on more than one device2. If user logs in from an unknown device (not the one it was registered on), then the app's main functionality will be disabled and only view mode will existTo solve this, we did create a logic for generating Device ID, which will help us associate the User + Primary Device combination, but in turn ran into another problem: *The device ID does not stay consistent and changes with Uninstall/Reinstall/Software Updates/etc.****I cannot attach any images here, please text me for the exact scenarios, but here's an example:*** USER A DEVICE ID ON DEVICE A - 96142fa5-6973-4bf5-8fe8-669ec50f7dc5 USER B DEVICE ID ON DEVICE B - 02f81a46-13a6-4b19-a0d6-77a2f8dc95ebUSER A DEVICE ID ON DEVICE B - 02f81a46-13a6-4b19-a0d6-77a2f8dc95eb (ID MISMATCH = DISABLE PARSER) USER B DEVICE ID ON DEVICE A - 96142fa5-6973-4bf5-8fe8-669ec50f7dc5 (ID MISMATCH = DISABLE PARSER)USER B DEVICE ID AFTER REINSTALL - fe77779a-3e1d-4ac4-b4d0-b380b1af98a7 (ID MISMATCH - ASK USER FOR VERIFICATION)It would be of immense help if someone who has worked a similar issue could guide us on how to take this forward!If there's any cooperation needed in seeing the code or having a quick call to discuss further, I'm more than willing to.Thanks reddit!",2,0.67,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mdai3n/stuck_with_developing_a_device_identification/,2025-07-30 16:02:11,2025-07-31 01:53:35

1mbgto9,Need advice: Total career change and UK education.,gen-cy,learnprogramming,"**Hi all,**25/M UK – I’ve been working as a self-employed joiner for the past five years, but about four months ago, I gave it up to pursue a career in programming. (This didn’t come as a shock to my friends, family, or me.)Since then, I’ve been educating myself, completing _The Odin Project_ and working on several small personal projects. I enrolled in the Open University a while ago and am set to start a 2 year software development course in October.Where I need your guidance is this: given the current state of education, I’m struggling to figure out whether university is really the best option. Frankly, I see a lot of UK university education as BS (subject dependent, of course). I saw this with joinery courses in my late teens, which led me to skip further education in that field and instead take a minimum wage job. I slowly but surely worked my way into full-time self-employment with decent pay. That turned out to be the right choice for me at the time.Another caveat: While I’ll receive student finance for tuition, I’ll need to support myself alongside studying by working in hospitality most days and weekends. (The scope and grind of this doesn’t faze me as I know people who have done this before.)There’s a part of me that thinks a better option might be to get a low-paid tech job (since it’s related) and continue educating myself over the next two years. The goal would be to build a strong portfolio and eventually transition into programming full time.**NOT programming is NOT an option.**So I ask you all:- How feasible is my second option? - Do you think the courses currently available are a waste of time and money? - What would you do in the same situation?

1m9n8ew,Got Laid Off 12 Days Ago and Signed an Offer Today - Here's My Sankey Diagram,Yung_Carrot,cscareerquestions,"*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC >$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*I always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)I do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.As for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a ""Mandatory Meeting"" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.I did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only ""automation"" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.The first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.For context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.Of course, this is just one data point.

I have over 15 job board sites I use daily, so every one hour I'm able to find 8-10 relevant entry-level roles and apply. By the end of the day I have 50-70 jobs applied to.

I reduced my bullet points down from five to three to keep things concise and less cluttered, as I was advised. Some of the technologies and tools I listed aren’t part of my projects or internship, but I do know them, I might just be a little rusty since it’s been a while since I last used some.Edit 3: Figured since this is still getting traction that I will write down what are the new changes I've been told to make:1. Contribute to open-source projects2. Bold technologies in projects/internships3. Apply to less jobs, focus on adding cover letter & tailoring cv to roles (+ make a few different CVs depending on what sort of role im targeting such as front-end, back-end, etc)4. Get rid of mthree experience5. Reduce technical skills6. Remove GPA7.

1mcqr3o,9 months unemployed 2.5YOE... What should I even do?,VanillaAble4188,cscareerquestions,"I'm at my wit's end and could really use a reality check from the community. Got laid off from my first SWE job 9 months ago. Since then, I've sent out thousands of applications and have gotten zero interviews. Not a single one. I'm applying to at least 10-20 jobs a day on LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. I've easily cleared 1,500+ applications at this point. Anything that seems like a fit. Software Engineer, Software Developer, Automation Engineer, Test Engineer, Embedded Software Engineer... if it involves code, and 60-80% of the keywords apply to my experience, I'm probably applying. I'm applying to both remote (preferred) and on-site roles, especially in major tech hubs. I live in NYC and mostly apply to NYC jobs because i likely get filtered out for a lot of other ones. Absolute nothing. Zero. No interviews. No screener calls from recruiters. I barely even get the automated ""thanks but no thanks"" emails anymore.

Background:* Experience: 2.5 YOE at a hardware/software startup. I was unfortunately part of a layoff due to the company losing major government contracts.* What I Did: I wasn't just a cog in a wheel.

I have a very hands-on, end-to-end background.* Core Skills: * Python: Very strong. Built entire applications, GUIs, data analysis pipelines. * C/C++: Wrote the embedded firmware for all our custom-designed hardware.

I also found out a couple days after I started that the job title changed after I interviewed for a business analyst role, I only found out when I looked at an org chart.The attorney has barely said a few words to me and anytime she does it feels like she's just talking at me.

I always get conflicting instructions, one day she emails me that I need to automate things, the next day I have to justify why programming takes so long. The following day I'm told I need to only do my job title, then the next week she said I stopped programming and need to figure out how to do both.Last week, I was asked to meet with the new HR person who has been firing 2-3 people a week since she started. When I get to her office she told me she wanted to talk about my performance. She said I'm taking too long to finish my programming tasks. She said at her old company they were able to build an architecture, build complete features in 1-2 hours and an entire system in less than a year for all the departments that was even HIPAA compliant. I asked how many developers they had and what was their background. She said there were only 2 people and they weren't even developers but was able to ""just get it to work"".

No dedicated time for learning, or interval sprint for learning, yet there are hours of learning requirements that basically end up requiring overtime to get done.2. short ""technical onboarding program"" was not useful for what i'm doing on my team3. Don't like my team. mean tech lead, scrum master that blames people. asking questions gets uncomfortable. Tech lead gets very irritable very fast. I’d code and he’d giggle and be like “what are you doing.” Small team. This is the biggest problem. tech lead told me 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you.” I do all my user stories, communicate blockers, never caused carry over or even a defect. Received multiple certifications. 4. Disorganized leadership. ""everyone in the department do the same amount of points""(7+). Told me I didn't have to do that since that's for seniors and up, then received bad feedback for not doing that amount of points.5.

1mabvyv,My skip is blocking my growth and transfer to new team of choice,Comprehensive_Award3,cscareerquestions,"For context, I am in a junior role that is hourly paid and below average pay. I’m not a software engineer but it’s adjacent. In my job description it says I am part of a rotational training program where I will learn and gain experience on three adjacent teams in the same role, that’s why I accepted. I was put on a team with no manager and where all of the team members are remote offshore contractors. My work entailed receiving written tasks that lacked any context and with that got no training or onboarding. I was told not to talk to the requestors directly. This whole time I’ve been there I’ve basically had no manager. There is no path toward growth. With time my team warmed up to me and would help here and there but the start was extra rough. Two months ago I applied to a full time higher paid role in an adjacent department. The next day after the interview, the hiring manager said my department won’t let me go. No one in my department talked to me. The manager that was there for two months but did no managing, had already left. My tech lead gave a green light. So I assumed the hiring manager was letting me down softly or that there are some company policies, like I haven’t been there long enough. The policies in this company change whichever way suits them btw. Very recently two people in my role left an adjacent team. This team was supposed to be one of my rotations. I have been here long enough to rotate. This team is in person and the manager is a good manager and the people are knowledgeable, so I reached out to join their team. The hiring manager said yes. My tech lead gave a green light. My new manager, who also hasn’t done any managing so far, gave a green light. The HR gave a green light. During my first one on one with my manager I was told “Skip said you will either stay on your current team or will join ‘team that doesn’t exist yet and does work that is not my role’.” I was baffled. When I said “but I want to do my role and rotations are in my job description” my manager gaslighted and told me that the team I applied to doesn’t do my role. Ladies and gents, the titles are exactly the same as mine. I went to HR. HR was also baffled. Obviously I am already applying externally. But I am so upset that my chance to grow in my career was arbitrarily blocked and that now they are blatantly going against policies and my job description.

There were over 500 applicants, and I keep thinking about this, but if you extrapolate this to the entire field, doesn't this mean that it's basically close to impossible to actually get a job if you don't have an insane resume upon graduation, especially given that this sub frequently mentions that projects no longer really matter? I'm at the point where I keep thinking that there's honestly zero point in even trying to get a job in the field because of how unlikely it is. Like I see no reason that given 1000+ applicants to a role, with at least a handful of those being guys that have programmed an entire OS from scratch and went to a top ten school and likely already have experience, the odds of those guys not applying or there being such a small applicant pool that the guy who had a mediocre GPA along with no internships who has farted out a middling personal project to fill out an otherwise empty resume actually gets a role seems almost astronomically low.I doompost here a lot but in my head there genuinely seems to be no real path to employment in the industry (I'm not even talking SWE either, like literally any job that requires a bachelors in CS at all) if you're not exceptional or quite literally apply to every single open position in the country and just move wherever at a whim and hope you essentially win the lottery",14,0.8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mbygci/is_getting_a_job_with_no_internships_having/,2025-07-29 01:26:48,2025-07-31 01:53:36

A little background, I have a Bachelor's degree in CS and I graduated in 2021. I was unemployed for a little over two years due to having to take care of my family + my own mental health issues. Since then, I've had a full-time job in the biopharmaceutical industry. I don't do anything with tech or CS really at my current job, besides a little bit database management (Not that I'm writing the SQL or anything). I've been working here for almost two years now. I mostly work on the equipment in our lab and do a good amount of troubleshooting/small engineering stuff on the robotics in the lab. I'm kind of burning out of this place and don't like my current job too much. I want to break into the tech industry. It doesn't have to be a SWE position or anything, just something tech-related or CS adjacent.I was wondering what steps I can take in my situation to start learning again and be ready to apply to CS Jobs? I honestly forgot like 95% of what I learned about programming and my other CS courses from just not doing it consistently since I graduated, but I would be willing to take online courses or put in a lot of time to learning again. Unfortunately, I don't have any internship experience related to CS as I switched to CS later in my college career and just rushed to finish the degree in a shorter time so I wouldn't have to take out more in student loans.Where do you think a good starting point is to get back into it? What kind of projects can I make that would help me stand out? And is there a larger demand for full-stack engineers or data analysts in the healthcare/biopharma industry?

However, he gave us advice that we should present ourselves as AI experts right now. He said we could do that by learning how to use the AI tools to take over small tasks as much possible and teaching others to do the same.So the question is, where do I go from here? Based on these estimates, I could stay at that FAANG company for a few more years and then job hop to a company that hasn’t migrated to AI software.

This is my first permanent job after completing my master’s degree.Initially, I was welcomed on and had a really great time getting to know people and contribute, and my performance review was “exceeds all expectations” from everyone on my team. My boss indicated that they were seeking to have me transition into a leadership role in the future given that I have a specific background.Fast-forward a couple of months later, and one of the senior devs on my team has become somewhat hostile to me. They started calling out any critiques of my work directly in our Teams channel (that contains some senior company leadership like VPs) and during meetings in a way that I kind of take offense to. EX) “u/ice-truck-drilla seems to have done this wrong.” instead of “u/ice-truck-drilla, this doesn’t look right to me. Can you double check this?”First, I think this should be a direct message, not a company wide blast. Second, when this has happened, so far, the work being critiqued has always been correct. Of course I make mistakes, but these were not. These company-wide callouts have only happened a few times over the past few weeks, and luckily, the technical lead had my back and stated that my work was correct in front of everyone. One time, one of the VPs who was previously a dev mentioned that the work output I presented looked very accurate.I’m not sure what changed but this hostile dev used to be really pleasant to work with. I try hard and work long hours, and it feels like they’re trying to birth a negative reputation for me. Some added context is that this dev recently found out that I am not white (I’m white-passing) and my parents are immigrants. I’m not sure if this is the root cause, but it is something I’ve considered. I do not want to make any waves, and I have been thinking that the job market is way too harsh rn for me to even think about defending myself or bringing this up with anyone.

I've been working as a developer in a non-tech company for 4 years making 78k CAD. I am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years. I love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education. However, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities. The reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.So I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects.

I did a bit of research, and they seem legit, but here’s the part that threw me off:Before even scheduling any interviews, they insisted on getting a copy of my photo ID.I honestly can’t remember the last time a recruiter asked for that, even after an offer.

Is this something others experience? How do you handle or improve communication in technical discussions to avoid misunderstandings?I also notice that other senior engineers seem skilled, they can answer almost any question on the spot whereas I’m not that type of person. When I’m asked something technical, I usually need some quiet time to fully understand the question, then I look through the relevant files and documentation before I can come up with a good answer.

I'm wondering if this will impact my future career growth, as I have options to jump to another company with a more modern tech stack.- most parts are still with the old .NET 4.8 Framework but some parts in .NET core. They have concrete plans for upgrading to modern .NET, but it won't be so soon (around 3 years)- CI CD pipeline using old ass tech, with plenty of environment issues (this has caused me and the team a lot of headaches and time wasted). Not containerised, but plans to be. Modernizations in this area are in the plan as well- Not a huge app, around 10 microservices- Hosted on AWS but not cloud native, still traditional server architecture- Not much scalability concerns- However, the product is highly secure and must pass stringent pentests. So plenty of security concerns- I get to work with and do the modernization, anything from code to infra migrations. Manager is highly supportive of any effort in this area- I get to touch on all areas of the albeit old application, from frontend to backend to devops and security- only one team of devs+QA of around 15 peopleWhat I will miss out on:- Scalability concerns. The product is meant to be low key b2b, there are basic scalability concerns but not big tech level where scalability is top priority.- Cloud native infra: I'm seeing most companies have already left the server architecture behind and adopt cloud native.- It feels bad still using Remote Desktop Connection and windows sucks major ass- Modern devops- Modern tech- Large company things with the big tech feel.

My chances were significantly higher if there was a take home project involved.* Startups almost never ask LeetCode problems directly.* If startups really like you in one way, they can look past your weaknesses in other areas.* Startups hire quickly.

Job security is no better - it is only for 6 months, with only verbally saying they are very likely to make me into a full time after the 6 months.Chatgpt says that this is an absurd offer, and that it is very much a lowball offer, which I agree, and I would need to ask for $120k, MIN $95k as an independent contractor to even consider it.

This is the first time I am hearing about a role with this title. I know what a ""customer support"" does and what an ""engineer"" does but this looks different. Looking at the role [description](https://vercel.com/careers/customer-support-engineer-us-5241583004) it made me even more confused. The pay seems to be way less than a regular developer at Vercel, so I am leaning to believe it's more customer support than engineering.I am a full stack developer myself and I have no idea why I would be reached out for a customer support role. Anybody can help me make a decision? Should I move forward with the process or decline it?",3,0.8,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mcpwpq/what_is_a_customer_support_engineer/,2025-07-29 22:41:26,2025-07-31 01:53:36
1mc3vq5,Overworking myself for a good reason?,Seinhauser,cscareerquestions,"So this past March I was blessed with an incredible opprtunity. Great compensation, great team, great mentorship, great WLB, great name to have on the resume.The compensation is more than I've ever had. The position is fully remote. The company hasn't done any ""mass"" layoffs. The team (except one guy) has great WLB. In fact my manager has told me not to be like that guy, since he's not your average joe. The company specifically says they don't reward long hours.Yet I find this all makes me anxious. I've worked 15 hour days just because I want to feel useful. No one asks me to do this, but everything seems to point to this being a complete fluke and it can all go away in a snap. It's fully remote, in a saturated field, great benefits and pay, and many people have called it their dream company. In other words, I feel incredibly replaceable and it makes me work twice as hard.I feel like I might be on my way to burnout if I don't correct myself. Has anyone been in this position before and how did you deal with it?",3,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mc3vq5/overworking_myself_for_a_good_reason/,2025-07-29 06:13:05,2025-07-31 01:53:36

1marhll,How to balance expectations on working too much at my new job?,wont-share-food,cscareerquestions,"Hello! I'm in a weird predicament and I'd appreciate some advice. Right after graduating, I started working at a job making less than 100k. I have been there for the last 4 years. Towards the last 6 months, I was pretty unmotivated and was completely coasting due to low pay and also not having fun things to work on. One thing to note is that this was a very small startup and I was the first engineer to be hired so I learned a LOT over the years.Few months ago I decided enough is enough and I started applying and I somehow made it into FAANG.I'm very happy and proud of myself. I'm now making more money than I ever imagined and I'm more motivated than ever. I want to climb this ladder and shoot for the moon. I know I have the capabilities and I come from a poor family so money is certainly a huge motivation. I'm also a huge nerd and I love to learn. The technologies used in this company are completely different than what I'm used to and I've always been curious on the inner workings of platforms that work at massive scale so having access to all these docs and the entire codebase is incredible.The problem is that sometimes I feel like I may be full sending it way too hard. I know the general consensus is that when you start a new job, you shouldn't go too crazy and set unrealistic expectations because you can't keep the same motivation as when you just started over a long period of time.I just got handed my first project and I was told that while my teammates (who have been here 3-4 years) can probably knock it out in 1-2 weeks, they expect me to take 3-4 weeks (and also said it's totally okay if I take more).However I've been so excited and itching to code and learn that I've completed around 60% of it in 3 days.So my question is, should I purposefully slow down?On one hand, I want to prove my worth and get promoted to senior as fast as possible because I truly believe I gained the ability to work at that level at the startup, but on the other hand I don't want to set unrealistic expectations.How should I go about balancing all this?",3,0.8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1marhll/how_to_balance_expectations_on_working_too_much/,2025-07-27 17:01:35,2025-07-31 01:53:36

1m9582a,"Any tips on breaking into SWE with less than stellar GPA, projects and school?",mijia08,cscareerquestions,"I could sob story here, but the TLDR is that I was at a really good state school and had to switch to WGU bc of $$ and health. WGU doesn't give GPA, so it's auto 3.0, and my GPA at the state school was bad. I worked at *three tech internships* across two companies (one I just interviewed for was my first tech position), the first two being service desk (one co-op-like) for 3 years combined, and as a student engineer who coded for 2 years in Python and maintained a full-stack project. My last two Student Eng and SD Student employees were at the same company. **Graduated June 2025.** I recently built a Python app that I like, so I added it to my resume:\-- Home Builder Market Type Intelligence Tool (Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib) --◦ Developed a machine learning model using Random Forest to predict California counties with high home-building likelihood, achieving over 80% accuracy.◦ Cleaned, merged, and analyzed 10+ years of home sales and permit data using Pandas; visualized insights via interactive Matplotlib heatmaps and county comparisons. **Q1**: Should I be doing more? I'm currently unemployed (since May) and got rejected by a company I worked for previously after interviewing for a tech support role. I do not get responses on my job apps for SWE, maybe bc they think I'm a joke applicant LOL, so I Hail Mary a bunch of tech support jobs.**Q2:** Is there anything that stands out heavily about me that makes me unemployable? I keep thinking about going to GA Tech for their OMSCS just bc I'm failing at this CS stuff rn. **Q3:** I really like coding in Python and maintaining apps built in Py, but is Python currently too competitive for me to proceed? Should I focus more on my Java side? **Q4:** Should I work on more projects for my resume, or focus on Leetcode?
