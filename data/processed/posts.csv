1mfx209,I used to think data engineering was a small specialty of software engineering. I was very mistaken.,big_like_a_pickle,dataengineering,"I've had a 25 year career as a software engineer and architect. Most of my concerns have revolved around the following things:- Application scalability, availability, and security.- Ensuring that what we were building addressed the business needs without getting lost in the weeds.- UX concerns like ensuring everything functioned on mobile platforms and legacy web browsers.- DevOps stuff: How do we quickly ship code as fast as possible to accelerate product delivery, yet still catch regression defects early and not blow up things?- Mediating organizational conflicts: Product owner wants us to go faster but infosec wants us to go slower, existing customers are complaining about latency due to legacy code but we're also losing new customers because we're losing ground to competitors due to lack of new features. I've been vaguely aware of data engineering for years but never really thought about it. If you had asked me, I probably would have said *""Yeah, those are the guys who keep Power BI fed and running. I'm sure they've probably repurposed DevOps workflows to help with that.""*However, recently a trap door opened under me as I've been trying to help deliver a different kind of product. I fell into the world of data engineering and am shocked at how foreign it actually is.Data lineage, feature stores, Pandas vs Polars, Dask, genuinely saturating dozens of cores and needing half a TB of RAM (in the app dev world, hardware is rarely a legit constraint and if it is, we easily horizontally scale), having to figure out what kind of GPU we need and where to optimally use that in the pipeline vs just distributing to a bunch of CPUs, etc. Do we use PCA reduction on these SBERT embeddings or not?Even simple stuff like ""what is a 'feature'?"" took some time to wrap my head around. *""Dude, it's a column. Why do we need a new word for that?""*Anyhow... I never disrespected data people, I just didn't know enough about the discipline to have an opinion at all. However, I definitely have found a lot of respect for the wizards of this black art. I guess if I had to pass along any advice, it would be that I think that most of my software engineering brethren are equally ignorant about data engineering.

1md5wp9,quick PSA on LLM fear.,Thinker_Assignment,dataengineering,"hey folks, i see a lot of fear of LLMs and i just wanted to say we are doing ourselves a disservice by having knee jerk reactions against it.# The real threat isn’t replacement. It’s displacement.Your work isn’t actually replaceable by autocomplete. But it **looks like it is,** and that’s the problem.LLMs are built to sound confident, not to be correct. They generate fluent, plausible output that gives the *illusion* of competence, without understanding, judgment, or responsibility.So the danger isn’t the model. **It’s your manager thinking you’re replaceable.** Or their manager pressuring them to “do more AI, less people.” Or a CFO using AI as cover for layoffs in a foggy, panic-driven economy.You won’t be replaced by a language model. But you can be **displaced** by the perception that one is “good enough.” The next few years look the same: Industry is adding: memory, tools, multimodal input, even planning— Still out of reach, no clear pathway ahead: **true cognition, self-awareness, reasoning under uncertainty, and grounded understanding.** even today for cognitive restructuring and grounding we use 2k year old methods like socratic questioning - we're nowhere close to solving this.# How you can win this fight Right now, every company is standing in a dense AI fog. No one knows what’s real, what’s hype, or how to use these tools safely.The most valuable roles today? They go to the **LLM navigators** — the people who understand what's possible, what’s coming, and how to steer through uncertainty.It’s the same prestige arc we saw with data 15 years ago. With ML 5–10 years ago. And now it’s your turn.You don’t need to be an LLM expert. But if you’re the one testing tools, forming opinions, stress-testing outputs, and helping others make sense of it all — you’ve already stepped into leadership.**Be the scout.** The one-eyed engineer guiding the blind through this strange new frontier. It’s improv now. The answer is “yes, and…” → Yes, and let’s do it safely. → Yes, and let’s make the most of it. → Yes, and let’s not blow up the business.But “no”? no AI, no experiments, no change? This will get interpreted as “no value.” ""falling behind"" ""missed opportunity"" ""company risk"". And if you’re a blocker, the system will set you free and find a helper.So don’t be a victim. Don’t freeze. Don’t frame it as *you vs. AI.* That’s a losing game.Frame it as: **“I’m the one who understands AI. I’ll help us use it — safely, effectively, and with eyes open.”**That’s who companies want. That’s who they’re **desperate** to invest in. And while you personally as an engineer may not care, this is the **prestige** that data managers in large companies are after - they want to be the person steering the company in AI age, keep job, get promoted, take credit for riding the possibilities out there. It's almost like whitepapers used to be a few years ago. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I hope this helps you guys keep your jobs.",205,0.95,20,https://i.redd.it/5l0gt05s10gf1.png,2025-07-30 12:57:57,2025-08-06 01:54:39

We are consistently losing or misprocessing late arriving events from edge devices in poorer connectivity zones. Even with event timestamps and buffer logic in Spark, we end up with duplicated records or gaps in aggregation windows.And two. Schema drift is also messing things up. Whenever the hardware team updates firmware or adds new sensor types, the structure of the incoming data changes slightly which breaks something downstream.We have tried enforcing Avro schemas via Schema Registry but it does not do that well when things evolve quickly.To make things even worse, our Snowflake MERGE operations are starting to fizzle under load. Clustered tables help but not enough. We are debating whether to continue building around this setup with more Spark jobs and glue code, or switch to something more managed that can handle real-time ingestion and late arrival tolerance.

When I try to study with MOOCs or read books alone, I drop off quickly. So I’m considering **enrolling in a postgrad certificate or structured course**, even if it’s not the most elite one — just to have *external pressure* and deadlines. I care about building real skill, not networking or titles.# What I’m looking for:* A **practical learning path**, preferably with hands-on projects and real tech* Structure that helps me stay accountable* Deepening my skills in: Airflow (advanced), PySpark/Spark, Kafka, SQL, cloud-based pipelines, testing, CI/CD* Willing to invest time and money if it helps me build solid skills# Questions:* Has anyone here gone through something similar — what helped you push through the discipline barrier?* Any recommendations for **serious technical courses** (e.g. Udemy, DataCamp, Udacity, ProjectPro, Coursera, others)?* Are structured certs or postgrad programs worth it for people like me who need external accountability?* Would a “nanodegree” (e.g. Udacity) be overkill or the right fit?Any thoughts are welcome.

You can merge it, filter it, export it, perform calculations on it, whatever.The workflow has LLM jobs that are arranged like a waterfall, model-agnostic, and designed around structured output. So you can use one step with 4o-mini, or nano, or opus, etc. You can select any model, run your logic, chain it together, etc. Then you can export results back to Snowflake or just work with it in the GUI to build reports. You can schedule it to scrape the data sources and just run the new data sets.

You pay for all tables replicated, even if many are not used now.2) Less flexibility: archiving/access to raw data is tied to Redshift; older/unused data still incurs cost.3) Possible need to manage Redshift partitioning, retention policies, and performance tuning as more data accumulates.I am confused what to use. Directly landing into redshift makes things so much more easier and using it as a data lake and then periodically unloading to s3.

Disclaimer: we created the Telomere service that this integrates with.With just a couple lines of code, you can monitor both schedule health (""did the nightly job run?"") and execution health (""did it finish within 4 hours?""). The provider automatically configures timeouts based on your DAG settings: from telomere_provider.utils import enable_telomere_tracking # Your existing DAG, scheduled to run every 24 hours with a 4 hour timeout... dag = DAG(""nightly_dag"", ...) # Enable tracking with one line! enable_telomere_tracking(dag)It integrates with Telomere which has a free tier that covers 12+ daily DAGs. We built this because Airflow's own alerting can fail if there's an infrastructure issue, and external cron monitors miss when DAGs start but die mid-execution.Check out the [blog post](https://modulecollective.com/posts/telomere-airflow-provider/) or go to [https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider](https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider) to check out the code.Would love feedback from folks who've struggled with Airflow monitoring!",14,0.94,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mfx5u8/released_an_airflow_provider_that_makes_dag/,2025-08-02 18:08:31,2025-08-06 01:54:39

(Also if you have recommendations for better architecture here I'm open to ideas).Of course the boss asked me to look into Talend to do the whole thing.

1mdw8ef,Architecture advices on AWS,Adrien0623,dataengineering,"Hey!I recently joined a new company as their first data engineer. The team had already set up a basic data warehouse, but I see opportunities to improve its scalability and efficiency.In my previous roles, I primarily worked with GCP using BigQuery, Dataproc, and Airflow-managed Spark jobs. I found that stack to be clean, scalable, and cost-effective as a batch oriented pipeline. Now that I’m working in an AWS environment, I’m adapting to a different toolset and architecture.Here’s a high-level overview of the current setup:- Ingestion: Airbyte pulls data from backend databases every few minutes.- Storage & Transformation: A provisioned Redshift cluster serves as the warehouse, with DBT jobs triggered by GitHub Actions.- Consumption: A back-office app queries both Redshift (when joins accross backend services data are required) and the backend databases (for real-time needs).While this works for now, it lacks scalability and clarity. Key challenges I’ve identified:- No data partitioning, due to Airbyte’s current limitations. It's still striking that they don't support it on such important connectors as Redshift or S3...- No clear separation between data lake and data mart, making the warehouse feel disorganized.- Redshift is over-provisioned and underutilized, resulting in high costs for relatively low value.- When backend databases schemas changes (which is frequent), there's often a lot of manual procedure to handle breaking changes.To address this, I’m considering the following changes:- Replace Redshift with Athena + Glue to cut costs and enable a more flexible, serverless architecture—accepting a bit more latency in return.- Eventually replace Airbyte with Spark or Glue-based ingestion, to introduce time partitioning and better control (though some source tables lack timestamp fields, which limits options for now).- Move away from GitHub Actions and adopt a more robust scheduler like Airflow.- Possibly replace DBT with Spark for greater flexibility in the long term.- Add a BI tool connected on the data warehouse to enable self service analysis internally.Given the company expects significant data growth, I’d like to design something more scalable, but still pragmatic and cost effective. For now many people agree the current architecture is problematic, that processes are complex and error-prone and that we have little observability and room for improvements. However due to organization structures I have little impact or decision level on data models, migrations etc. And because many people don't have data expertise or experience it's often hard to make them understand some challenges and why some practices are problematic and not future-proof. So I'd be very grateful to get your view on the following questions to be sure I'm heading in the correct direction:1. Does this current architecture seem suboptimal to you as well?2. Do my proposed changes make sense, or would you suggest a different direction?3. Any other ideas for improving or simplifying the setup?Thanks a lot!",10,0.92,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mdw8ef/architecture_advices_on_aws/,2025-07-31 08:40:03,2025-08-06 01:54:39

The manual classification process was becoming unsustainable: slow, inconsistent, and impossible to scale.Instead of spinning up Python-based NLP pipelines or fine-tuning models, we tried something surprisingly simple: **Snowflake Cortex's** `CLASSIFY_TEXT()` function directly in SQL.A simple example: SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.CLASSIFY_TEXT( 'Delivery was fast but support was unhelpful', ['Product', 'Customer Service', 'Delivery', 'UX'] ) AS category; We took it a step further and plugged this into a scheduled task to automatically label incoming feedback every week. Now the pipeline runs itself, and sentiment and category labels get applied without any manual touchpoints.It’s not perfect (nothing is), but it’s consistent, fast, and gets us 90% of the way with near-zero overhead.If you're working with survey data, CSAT responses, or other customer feedback streams, this might be worth exploring.

This tracks information about the process such asa. did i log into the API successfullyb. how much data is availablec. how much data did i download successfullyd. did the api report any license changes when queried.This is all separate from the API data that I download and save. I want to save the process information as it helps me troubleshoot and manage what happened. I then process the process information json file after the fact to see what happened. The read/report process runs in a different code base so the idea of having json is nice since i dont have to care about the json being a certain structure. I output some text to a chat bot to a small group of users. I would like to send some more information in the read/report process via email; or even save to a database and stand up a simple self hosted streamlit process. However, when I report it's a straight one-shot read the json files saved, do some simple calcs in pandas and output to a chat room. I dont save the metrics in another datasource.However i would like to send a lot more information in the json file as the process runs. And I want to report on it. Each process has several disparate steps that it goes through. I am thinking that I should convert the json file to a pub sub event process that publishes to a database.

1mgv9ri,New educational project: Rustframe - a lightweight math and dataframe toolkit,palashtyagi,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I've been working on [`rustframe`](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe), a small educational crate that provides straightforward implementations of common dataframe, matrix, mathematical, and statistical operations. The goal is to offer a clean, approachable API with high test coverage - ideal for quick numeric experiments or learning, rather than competing with heavyweights like `polars` or `ndarray`.The README includes quick-start examples for basic utilities, and there's a growing collection of demos showcasing broader functionality - including some simple ML models. Each module includes unit tests that double as usage examples, and the documentation is enriched with inline code and doctests.Right now, I'm focusing on expanding the DataFrame and CSV functionality. I'd love to hear ideas or suggestions for other features you'd find useful - especially if they fit the project's educational focus.### What's inside:* **Matrix operations**: element-wise arithmetic, boolean logic, transposition, etc.* **DataFrames**: column-major structures with labeled columns and typed row indices* **Compute module**: stats, analysis, and ML models (correlation, regression, PCA, K-means, etc.)* **Random utilities**: both pseudo-random and cryptographically secure generators* **In progress**: heterogeneous DataFrames and CSV parsing### Known limitations:* Not memory-efficient (yet)* Feature set is evolving### Links:* GitHub: [Magnus167/rustframe](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe) (includes CI/CD and self-hosted runners)* Crates.io: [rustframe](https://crates.io/crates/rustframe)* Homepage & Examples: [magnus167.github.io/rustframe](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/)* Docs:  [magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs/)  or  [docs.rs/rustframe](https://docs.rs/rustframe/latest/rustframe/)* [Benchmark report](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/benchmark-report/)* [CodeCov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Magnus167/rustframe/)I'd love any feedback, code review, or contributions!Thanks!",4,1.0,0,https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe,2025-08-03 21:34:11,2025-08-06 01:54:39

I wasn’t expecting big changes because they were busy with coursework and exam prep and didn’t have much time to practice between sessions. To my surprise there was a huge difference in the way they solved questions.This experience completely changed my perspective on learning programming. For many topics like system design or learning a new language, a week of focused effort can cover most essentials. I used to think problem-solving was different that you had to grind endlessly to “figure it out.” In college, I spent countless hours on Codeforces (eventually reaching ~1900 rating and I remember feeling soo excited) and told others, including my brother to just practice more.

Instead of just following along with videos, my strategy has been something like this:1. I find a project with source code (usually from GitHub or a course).2. I go through the code and figure out which parts I don’t understand.3. I take crash courses or quick tutorials on those missing concepts.4. Then I try to rebuild the project from scratch on my own.I’ve seen a lot of people here say that building your own stuff is the key, and I totally get that. But as a beginner, building something *completely* on my own still feels a bit overwhelming. So this method has been kind of a middle ground for me.

My last couple of review cycles have been positive overall but have highlighted some areas that I feel like are quite big weaknesses for me and that I am not sure how to improve at.It took me a very long time to get to the level of being a steady junior contributor who can be given a task and reasonably trusted to implement it with some guidance and instruction from more senior engineers (partially slow adjustment period on my part, partially poor management during COVID) but I really feel like I've hit a plateau and don't know how to get out of it. The main feedback I'm getting is that I need to do more code reviews and speak up more in meetings to discuss design - my work is fine in and of itself (though I feel my ability to design things and push my projects forward is a bit lacking) but I have very little impact on the wider team. I feel like I don't know how to analyse code or review it at all, that I have no deep understanding or knowledge. I can execute tasks well but really struggle a lot with designing solutions to problems or critiquing designs to suggest improvements or point out potential holes. When I try to review code I can spot simple mistakes, but amn't able to give anything more indepth (pointing out areas of refactoring, inefficiencies, suggesting alternative ways of solving the problem) and don't know where to start. When I start looking at reviews I can just feel my mind go blank instead of being able to break down the review and think through what's going on with it or what could be done better.Because I've been working in this career for quite some time I feel bad even asking for help, I've managed to struggle my way through it so far but it's very stressful and I don't want to feel so incompetent and afraid when doing my job.

1mf0jc4,Should a student learn computer science with pseudocode first to learn programming or learn programming through projects to learn computer science? How to get out of the theory->application-> theory loop?,tree332,learnprogramming,"I tried to learn CS both out of an interest to learn about applied mathematics field and to understand the theory behind software development. I had taken an intermediate java course and while I often asked for help, I thought I was prepared for the next semester of: linear algebra, intro to discrete math, intro to dsa. I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.In linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor. I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems, but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \*any\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation. In discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me. In intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.I ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.I have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school. I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year, but I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS degree curriculum on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.When I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. when I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as ""how to draw a 2d triangle program"" opens up a new journey learning the opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.I have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. I then go back to an ""intro to java/python/c# course"" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages.

Well, you know how some of you guys (typically beginners) will wait until you get a cool idea of what to code like a poker game or a new mod for minecraft, code it, then wait for your next big idea to come to you? Yeah stop doing that. Waiting on motivation to code won't build good habits and at the end of the day you can't make it that far, not just in getting a job but in your personal growth as well. Coding by discpline means to code something, anything every day or whatever interval you want to set. If you don't have an idea, search for one online. Maybe even do some leetcode problems if nothing interests you that day. But, you have to do something. After all, if you want to get a job in coding you will have to code every day. Might as well get used to it early right? But yeah, just waiting until ispiration strikes means you won't code as many projects as you could've if you just coded say a small add function to a calculator, or the collision physics for snake instead of doing nothing.Anyways, that's my advice.

Eventually, I turned it into a short book.A few ideas it covers:* How to evolve a system without turning it into spaghetti* Safer ways to deserialize and construct your data* Turning input validation into something the compiler helps with* Where generics shine — and where they secretly hurt you* Treating time/space complexity as part of the interface contract* Making failure obvious and early instead of quiet and delayedIt’s all freely available — just a public repo on GitHub.If that sounds interesting, I’d be genuinely happy to hear what you think.",10,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1me284k/i_wrote_a_free_book_on_keeping_systems_flexible/,2025-07-31 13:54:40,2025-08-06 01:54:41

I've been with said company for almost 11 months now.Over this past year, I've tasked with single-handedly developing an internal web application. This app includes a range of features - from web scrapers and data preprocessing scripts, to systems for managing and rating external collaborators, and even some AI agents that automate repetitive tasks.The stack I'd chosen to work with is Next.js, FastAPI and PostgreSQL.I won't lie - the journey developing this app has been a tough one. Being fresh out of university with limited knowledge and experience, and the only developer in the whole company meant a lot of trial and error and ambiguity in the beginning. But that challenge has also proven to help me grow as a person. I've learned many things of which I had no idea about before.That said, due to heavy nature of said responsibility and time constrains, I've also relied quite heavily on AI whenever I would hit a roadblock. While it's been helpful, I feel like it made me skip the deeper learning that comes from reading the docs and explore various sites, such as StackOverflow and others. Now, that the app had reached a solid state, I would like to go back and rectify my past mistakes.So now, I'm reaching out to the more experienced devs here:What books, courses, or other resources would you wholeheartedly recommend to someone who wants to deepen their skills, fill in knowledge gaps, and become truly solid - maybe even a ""cracked developer""? Something that would make me stand out from the rest of my peers as a SWE.Through this job, I’ve discovered a strong passion for Python, backend development (FastAPI) and Generative AI (LangGraph and LLMs' APIs) - so I’d love to also hear your suggestions on these topics on how I can become more proficient, perhaps even share with me some valuable tips.As I've mentioned earlier, being a solo dev - a beginner, nonetheless - often felt like I was missing out on a real growth experience. I didn’t have someone more experienced to learn from, to guide me when I was stuck, or just to point me in the right direction when things got overwhelming. I’m also pretty sure that while building the internal web app, there were better tools or approaches I could’ve used — I just didn’t know about them at the time. That's why I want to change that. I want to become a better dev and, due to the competitive nature of the current market, not get lost with the tide.",5,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1md67si/looking_to_grow_as_a_junior_dev_need_help/,2025-07-30 13:11:17,2025-08-06 01:54:41

To prevent files from touching my server I plan to use pre-signed URLs with some restrictions on file type, size, etc. but I still have some concerns that I am hoping someone could clarify.I need a way to remove metadata from the images and (I think?) scan them for malware. My approach is to just do this with Lambda and use either a temporary uploads bucket, then run the scans and move to a separate permanent storage bucket, or just upload directly to permanent storage. The part that I am concerned about is that this does not seem to be the industry standard. I have played around with several sites and they all seem to have the same approach. They use a single bucket, and the entire image upload latency is < 5 seconds. After \~5 seconds the images are uploaded and available via their CDN, the metadata is removed, and I assume they have either already scanned for malware or have queued an async scan.Unless there is something I am missing, it seems that there is a brief period of time where user content is available via their CDNs but post-upload processing like metadata removal and malware scans have not been completed.

I’m aiming to get into front end web dev / software dev, but I’m seeing how tough it is for new grads with no experience. I'm honestly just hoping to land any position that relates to my degree now.The only job I’ve had is working at Burger King for a year. I know I messed up not doing internships during school. Skill-wise, I know HTML, CSS, some basic JavaScript, C++, Java, and SQL. I’ve been working through The Odin Project but I’m only around halfway through the Foundations section. It’ll probably take me well into next year to finish the whole curriculum and ideally I’d like to be working before then.I know this kind of post probably shows up here a lot, and I’ve done a bit of googling and researching already. I guess I just want to feel more certain about what all my options really are, given my situation and in todays market (since it seems to shift around quickly).After researching, I'm wondering if I should just get my A+ cert and try to land a help desk job for now. I’d honestly prefer not to go that route, but if it’s the most realistic way to get a foot in the door, I’ll do it.So basically I’m wondering: – Is it still worth trying to get an internship now, even after graduating? – Are there other entry-level roles besides help desk that I can realistically land with my degree + skills in 2025? – Given where I’m at, what should I focus on most right now?Any advice or personal experience would be really appreciated.

1mfteom,Hiring norms have changed much faster than entry level candidates realize,FredWeitendorf,cscareerquestions,"A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)Let me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may ""know"" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.Number one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?Number two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.Third most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they ""get it""? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.None of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.Here are a few common examples:* Sending very flowery, ""fake personalized"", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to ""stand out"" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.*** Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**What these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**(cont. below: what to do instead)",1064,0.93,227,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mfteom/hiring_norms_have_changed_much_faster_than_entry/,2025-08-02 15:31:35,2025-08-06 01:54:42

We live in south of Italy which makes already hard to find some positions, I feel she's doing it at the extra difficulty level.These are the thing she knows:* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Angular* Java* Git, bootstrap, tailwind, postman, docker, payload CMS, Figma* Mobile design, responsive design* VSCode, EclipseShe did find some jobs that were paid very very little, like around 600 euro for months (while an average salary is more than 1200 euro).The first one had a very toxic boss and I advised her to leave that because she was going insane, the guy was really toxic. The second one they had to let her go because they did some bad calculation around the budget they had and fired a couple of new people and she was one of them.She is getting really depressed with this despite being her dream, and I think she's not so bad that she can't find a job, there are really bad people out there, how can she not find one after all this energy and struggle. It makes me really sad to see her in this situation and would love to help her in any way possible.Since I use reddit regularly I wanted to ask people in this subreddit what we can do?We have optimized CV in every possible way, she did a portfolio, she's trying to find clients in the meanwhile.

Got into the field through a bootcamp after a liberal arts BA. It’s the only proper job offer I’ve ever received. I came in at the minimum, making a bit over $50k. I was happy to finally have a job.The job is stable. Demands are more than reasonable. But with 6 YoE, I make under $80k in a top 10 US metro. I'm in the bottom 20% of my pay band. I’ve argued for raises. Answer is basically, ""why should we?"" It's frustrating, but I realize that if I don't have any offer letters as leverage, then they *don't* have any reason to do anything. And raises are now frozen for *everyone* due to federal funding changes. Meanwhile, my coworkers are in the top half, if not top third or quarter of their pay bands, making $30k+ more than me. And don't even get me started on how I compare to the figures on levels.fyi or Glassdoor.I’ve been applying since I got my 401k vested, which coincided with the job market starting to fall apart. The search has not been successful or positive or encouraging. It's particularly disheartening to know that people out there with actual expertise and proper CS degrees and double/triple my YoE are also struggling. If *they* can't find jobs, what chance do *I* have?Maybe I am still behind in some ways, but I *have* improved. I’ve gotten promoted. (Even though the promotion just put me at a lower percentile in my new pay band.) I get positive feedback from PMs and BAs, and a coworker recently said he's even impressed with how far I've come on a history degree and that he thinks I might make a good architect someday. Their praise doesn't translate into anything material, of course.I had always had an interest in tech, but this is not a case of ""I love code, but the bureaucracy is killing me."" These days, I *prefer* the requirements gathering and backlog refinement sessions to head-down coding. I didn't exactly get into this field as a fulfillment of a lifelong passion. I think early on I felt gratification in helping people *via* the code. But there's not joy inherent to the code itself. Nowadays, my work feels disconnected from real users. It feels like grinding through abstract problems created by the tools themselves. Some days I wish I never had to touch code ever again.Maybe my mentality would change if I felt like I had a future, even a path to just being a median developer making a median salary. But right now, I don't see it.I don't think every person is necessarily cut out for every type of job. Am I just not cut out to be a developer? Or maybe not cut out for it anymore?

1mf26ye,Unemployed for 3 years after graduation. Advice needed.,LoLNumberFour,cscareerquestions,"I'm based in the US. For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.During my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.Lately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.Here's my resume for the ones that care: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/88MUfWW)EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the suggestions.

1mhmy7l,"Junior / Mid-level engineers feeling invisible or stuck, hope this helps!",SomeRandomCSGuy,cscareerquestions,"For all the engineers that are feeling invisible, stuck or plateaued, this is for you and hope it helps / guides you into the next steps. I am a senior software engineer who got to this position pretty fast, and got promoted over other engineers with 3-4x my YoE, so whatever I saw in this post contributed massively to my growth, making my impact visible, getting me recognized, and eventually promoted. As a junior engineer, I was always awed by these senior+ engineers who seemed to make such an impact by whatever they did. This led me to start observing and building relationships with some of these really senior engineers around me (staff/principal) and learn how they operated, built that authority around them, and got stuff done, and something clicked. I realized it wasn’t just about technical skill and crushing tickets. What moved the needle was learning to communicate clearly, understand what impacts the business, build trust, build alignment between stakeholders, and be proactive (taking initiatives) instead of just reactive (wait to get assigned work).There is usually a misconception, that to stand out, you just need to work on your technical skills. That is wrong. To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. These are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau.A lot of engineers think that these skills are only required for managers etc, but they are wrong - even ICs require them. For these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing wikis/docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Taking time to write these up can not only promote healthy structured offline discussions (google docs for eg) but also act as an information aggregator for knowledge sharing (instead of being scattered on slack for eg or lost in meetings) and for having an audit log of important decisions - so in the future anyone can refer back to why a decision was taken and one doesn’t have to scramble to remember it, etc. The documents that you write now also help you to present your ideas and propose changes in a better manner in live meetings, where you can present that doc during the meetings and walk everyone through it - you don't need to memorize anything since all the information is already there in front of you, in a clean structured manner.Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.I worked heavily on my speech. I was afraid to speak in meetings because I was introverted and had confidence issues because I had a bit of stuttering problem, I used to use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc. But I took time to work on it, and over time I started speaking more eloquently and fluently which made such a massive difference in my confidence, and whenever I had to propose something or even speak during meetings, it made a difference. Don’t get me wrong, technical skills are also important, but as you go up, your mastery of these other non-technical skills starts to matter more. They will make you more visible, your impact more visible, and eventually get you promoted. So I urge you to start working on them, you will be surprised just how much difference they make. If you are an introvert like me, if I can do it so can you. I used to think these soft skills are reserved for extroverts but I was extremely wrong, and these are most definitely learnable. Looking forward to hearing in the comments what has worked for other engineers out there as well!Happy to answer any questions in the comments and DMs! I am an open book and happy to help however I can!",45,0.92,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mhmy7l/junior_midlevel_engineers_feeling_invisible_or/,2025-08-04 19:20:18,2025-08-06 01:54:42

I've had to do everything from the infrastructure, database setups, APIs, project management, UX/UI ab testing, optimization and scalability, server stuff, project management (think, massive social/ecommerce platform with tons of stuff on it and people joining and using), backend dashboards, random particular features of many kinds, managed small team of 3, sales, campaigns, so on.

(Math Bachelors),Tecoloteller,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,Currently considering going for part-time SUNY Stony Brook CS for Masters (optimally in person) or maybe OMSCS or some other part-time online Masters program for CS.Not sure I can get into Stony Brook because I don't really have any academic letters of rec (only professional), and doing an online masters would mean I'm not stuck in 1 location for like 5 years. I have a dream of doing a CS PhD (probably in Europe) for Type Theory/Programming Language Theory, but I did Math in undergrad so all my letters of rec would have to come from the Masters. Is an online Masters program a death knell for my dream of doing a CS PhD or is there any precedent of getting into a PhD from OMSCS or getting letters of rec from an online program?

Then he pushes for me to make the change in the same sprint by hand waving away ""it should be quick"". I take issue with this because more often than not, when working on the changes he wants, they turn out to not be as straightforward as he thought and I have to work longer to complete the story. It wouldn't be such an issue if I found out earlier in the sprint, but with him, it's usually like 1-3 days before the sprint ends and this is a noticeable pattern with him. It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that. I try not to take it personal, but it's getting harder. It's like he purposefully tries to put me in tight spots to try and get out of it. And it's not like I'm trying to not work.

To be honest, I really regret it and I want to get back into a computer science job, specifically as a front end developer, but from the results of my hundreds of applications and from seeing other posts, it seems like the job market for CS is absolutely horrendous right now? Do I even have a chance as someone who is 30 years old and having been out of the field professionally for 4 years?

1mcwau7,Infra Teams For New Grad,Money-Ability-7548,cscareerquestions,"Hello! I'm currently a new grad working in FAANG on an infra team. I'd appreciate if some senior engineers could give their insight into working on an infra team in terms of career growth (junior -> senior).A lot of people on my team are pretty experienced with only a couple junior engineers which is pretty common for infra teams. I've read that infra teams tend to give more scope than product teams for senior engineers who are looking to be promoted to staff. However, how is career progression from junior to senior? Will it be slow due to there being many tenured folks? Talking to some of the folks, they said that the team is harder than other teams to onboard onto because of the technical complexity. I feel like working on an infra team as a new grad is a rare opportunity but I am also hesitant on career progression even though a new grad on the team did make it to senior in 5 years.Any input would be appreciated :)Edit: I work on cloud infrastructure.

1md73xr,feeling like an imposter despite actively contributing to their team,caramel_macchiato27,cscareerquestions,"I’m a senior software engineer with 4.5 years of experience (recently promoted) and have contributed a lot in my team. I constantly doubt my own understanding and technical skills, which has led to a sense of imposter syndrome. Even with several years of experience, I find myself questioning whether I truly grasp certain topics or if I’m just missing something everyone else understands. I am truly worried if somebody will ask me something during the meetings because of this. I often feel that when I discuss technical topics, the person I’m talking to tends to speak vaguely or there’s some misunderstanding at first. I also wonder if part of the issue is that my thoughts don’t always come across exactly as I intend in English, or maybe I have difficulty understanding vague explanations. Is this something others experience? How do you handle or improve communication in technical discussions to avoid misunderstandings?I also notice that other senior engineers seem skilled, they can answer almost any question on the spot whereas I’m not that type of person. When I’m asked something technical, I usually need some quiet time to fully understand the question, then I look through the relevant files and documentation before I can come up with a good answer. Sometimes I worry this means I’m not as competent, maybe I shouldn’t even be senior engineer in the first place.",4,0.7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1md73xr/feeling_like_an_imposter_despite_actively/,2025-07-30 13:49:34,2025-08-06 01:54:42

1mhipsa,Breaking into HFT as a C++ Developer,Perfect_Prune_1490,cscareerquestions,"In 2026, I'm going to be a grad fresh out of college in Ireland. I want to break into high frequency trading as a SWE and had a roadmap set in my mind for how I would reach my goal in 2 - 3 years time. I wanted to have people's opinion on how realistic this is. Currently as part of my placement year (more like semester), I'm interning at IBM. I'm working on Db2 which is IBM's enterprise database solution. If I get a return offer, hopefully, this is what I'll continue working on. Now, I know to break into HFT, I'll need a lot of experience in C++ and I was hoping this opportunity would give me that. I have considered applying to HFT firms but I feel like I won't be able to make it past their interviews since I'm not prepared much in that area and also am quite inexperienced in C++. As Db2 is a database, I'm also getting experience in low latency/high transaction systems, solving concurrency problems. I feel like these are all skills HFT firms value. I understand I'll be lacking in the area of financial knowledge. After 2 years of working here, I hope to get a Master's done with a minor in Finance, after which I plan on applying to HFTs. Would you say this plan is realistic or are there some changes you would suggest?
