1nh9mnk,"[Experience] Amazon Data Engineer Inter view (L5, 2025)",Ok-Code3908,dataengineering,"Hey all, I just finished my Amazon Data Engineer Inter view loop recently (and got the offer ). Since I noticed a lot of outdated info online, thought I’d share how the process looked for me and what concepts are worth preparing. Hopefully this helps someone grinding through prep.**Process Overview** **Recruiter Screen (30 min)** Role fit + background discussion. One or two simple SQL/Python checks.**Technical Phone Screens (75 min each)** Mostly SQL and Python/ETL. Not just solving, but also follow-ups on query optimization and edge cases. Each screen also tested one Leadership Principle (LP) (mine were Dive Deep and Deliver Results).**Onsite / Virtual Loop (3–5 rounds, 60 min each)** SQL Deep Dive → joins, windows, Top-K, rolling averages. Coding / ETL Design → handling messy/late data, retries, streaming vs batch. Data Modeling → fact/dim schema, partitions, SCDs, trade-offs in Redshift/S3/Spark. Manager + Bar Raiser → critical rounds. Heavy mix of technical judgment + LPs. These carry a lot of weight in the final decision.LPs are central across all rounds. Prep STAR stories for Dive Deep, Deliver Results, Insist on Highest Standards, Are Right A Lot, Customer Obsession.**Concepts / Questions to Prepare** **SQL** Window functions (ROW\_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD). Complex joins, CTEs, subqueries. Aggregations + grouping, rolling averages, time-based calcs. Growth/churn queries (YoY, MoM).**Python / ETL** Flattening nested JSON/lists. Real-time sliding window averages. Deduplication by key + timestamp. Batch pipeline design with late data handling.**Data Modeling** Orders/transactions schema with fact/dim and SCD for Prime status. Clickstream/session schema with partitions. Star vs snowflake schema, warehouse trade-offs.**Leadership Principles (LPs)** Dive Deep: Debugging a broken pipeline under pressure. Deliver Results: Handling a P0 deadline. Highest Standards: Raising quality standards despite deadlines. Invent & Simplify: Automating repetitive workflows.**My Takeaways** Amazon DE evaluations are 50% technical and 50% LPs. SQL/Python prep is not enough — LP storytelling is equally important. Manager + Bar Raiser rounds are the toughest and usually decide the outcome.That’s my experience. If you’re preparing, don’t underestimate the LP side of it — it’s just as important as SQL/Python.

1nhykbt,Am I the only one who seriously hates Pandas?,yourAvgSE,dataengineering,"I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert in Python DE. It's actually something I recently started because most of my experience was in Scala.But I've had to use Pandas sporadically in the past 5 years and recently at my current company some of the engineers/DS have been selecting Pandas for some projects/quick scriptsAnd I just hate it, tbh. I'm trying to get rid of it wherever I see it/Have the chance to.Performance-wise, I don't think it is crazy. If you're dealing with BigData, you should be using other frameworks to handle the load, and if you're not, I think that regular Python (especially now that we're at 3.13 and a lot of FP features have been added to it) is already very efficient.Usage-Wise, this is where I hate it.It's needlessly complex and overengineered. Honestly, when working with Spark or Beam, the API is super easy to understand and it's also very easy to get the basic block/model of the framework and how to build upon it. Pandas DataFrame on the other hand is so ridiculously complex that I feel I'm constantly reading about it without grasping how it works. Maybe that's on me, but I just don't feel it is intuitive. The basic functionality is super barebones, so you have to configure/transform a bunch of things.Today I was working on migrating/scaling what should have been a quick app to fetch some JSON data from an API and instead of just being a simple parsing of a python dict and writing a JSON file with sanitized data, I had to do like 5 transforms to: normalize the json, get rid of invalid json values like NaN, make it so that every line actually represents one row, re-set missing columns for schema consistency, rename columns to get rid of invalid dot notation.It just felt like so much work, I ended up scraping Pandas altogether and just building a function to recursively traverse and sanitize a dict and it worked just as well.I know at the end of the day it's probably just me not being super sharp on Pandas theory, but it just feels like a bloat at this point",277,0.87,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nhykbt/am_i_the_only_one_who_seriously_hates_pandas/,2025-09-15 21:21:08,2025-09-20 01:22:53

1nfxgze,How I Built a Hash Join 2x Faster Than DuckDB with 400 Lines of Code,Motor_Crew7918,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering I recently open-sourced a high-performance Hash Join implementation in C++ called flash\_hash\_join. In my benchmarks, it shows exceptional performance in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios, running up to **2x faster** than DuckDB, one of the top-tier vectorized engines out there.**GitHub Repo:** [**https://github.com/conanhujinming/flash\_hash\_join**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconanhujinming%2Fflash_hash_join)This post isn't a simple tutorial. I want to do a deep dive into the optimization techniques I used to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the CPU, along with the lessons I learned along the way. The core philosophy is simple: align software behavior with the physical characteristics of the hardware.# Macro-Architecture: Unpartitioned vs. Radix-PartitionedThe first major decision in designing a parallel hash join is how to organize data for concurrent processing.The industry-standard approach is the **Radix-Partitioned Hash Join**. It uses the high-order bits of a key's hash to pre-partition data into independent buckets, which are then processed in parallel by different threads. It's a ""divide and conquer"" strategy that avoids locking. DuckDB uses this architecture.However, a fantastic paper from TUM in SIGMOD 2021 showed that on modern multi-core CPUs, a well-designed **Unpartitioned** concurrent hash table can often outperform its Radix-Partitioned counterpart.The reason is that Radix Partitioning has its own overhead:1. **Materialization Cost**: It requires an extra pass over the data to compute hashes and write tuples into various partition buffers, consuming significant memory bandwidth.2. **Skew Vulnerability**: A non-ideal hash function or skewed data can lead to some partitions becoming much larger than others, creating a bottleneck and ruining load balancing.I implemented and tested both approaches, and my results confirmed the paper's findings: **the Unpartitioned design was indeed faster**. It eliminates the partitioning pass, allowing all threads to directly build and probe a single shared, thread-safe hash table, leading to higher overall CPU and memory efficiency.# Micro-Implementation: A Hash Table Built for SpeedWith the Unpartitioned architecture chosen, the next challenge was to design an extremely fast, thread-safe hash table. My implementation is a fusion of the following techniques:**1. The Core Algorithm: Linear Probing** This is the foundation of performance. Unlike chaining, which resolves collisions by chasing pointers, linear probing stores all data in a single, contiguous array. On a collision, it simply checks the next adjacent slot. This memory access pattern is incredibly cache-friendly and maximizes the benefits of CPU prefetching.**2. Concurrency: Shard Locks + CAS** To allow safe concurrent access, a single global lock would serialize execution. My solution is **Shard Locking** (or Striped Locking). Instead of one big lock, I create an array of many smaller locks (e.g., 2048). A thread selects a lock based on the key's hash: lock\_array\[hash(key) % 2048\]. Contention only occurs when threads happen to touch keys that hash to the same lock, enabling massive concurrency.**3. Memory Management: The Arena Allocator** The build-side hash table in a join has a critical property: **it's append-only**. Once the build phase is done, it becomes a read-only structure. This allows for an extremely efficient memory allocation strategy: the **Arena Allocator**. I request a huge block of memory from the OS once, and subsequent allocations are nearly free—just a simple pointer bump. This completely eliminates malloc overhead and memory fragmentation.**4. The Key Optimization: 8-bit Tag Array** A potential issue with linear probing is that even after finding a matching hash, you still need to perform a full (e.g., 64-bit) key comparison to be sure. To mitigate this, I use a parallel tag array of uint8\_ts. When inserting, I store the low 8 bits of the hash in the tag array. During probing, the check becomes a two-step process: first, check the cheap 1-byte tag. Only if the tag matches do I proceed with the expensive full key comparison. Since a single cache line can hold 64 tags, this step filters out the vast majority of non-matching slots at incredible speed.**5. Hiding Latency: Software Prefetching** The probe phase is characterized by random memory access, a primary source of cache misses. To combat this, I use **Software Prefetching**. The idea is to ""tell"" the CPU to start loading data that will be needed in the near future. As I process key i in a batch, I issue a prefetch instruction for the memory location that key i+N (where N is a prefetch distance like 4 or 8) is likely to access: \_mm\_prefetch((void\*)&table\[hash(keys\[i+N\])\], \_MM\_HINT\_T0); While the CPU is busy with the current key, the memory controller works in the background to pull the future data into the cache. By the time we get to key i+N, the data is often already there, effectively hiding main memory latency.**6. The Final Kick: Hardware-Accelerated Hashing** Instead of a generic library like xxhash, I used a function that leverages hardware instructions: uint64_t hash32(uint32_t key, uint32_t seed) { uint64_t k = 0x8648DBDB; uint32_t crc = _mm_crc32_u32(seed, key); return crc * ((k << 32) + 1); }The \_mm\_crc32\_u32 is an **Intel SSE4.2 hardware instruction**. It's absurdly fast, executing in just a few clock cycles. While its collision properties are theoretically slightly worse than xxhash, for the purposes of a hash join, the raw speed advantage is overwhelming.# The Road Not Taken: Optimizations That Didn't WorkNot all good ideas survive contact with a benchmark. Here are a few ""great"" optimizations that I ended up abandoning because they actually hurt performance.* **SIMD Probing**: I tried using AVX2 to probe 8 keys in parallel. However, hash probing is the definition of random memory access. The expensive **Gather** operations required to load disparate data into SIMD registers completely negated any computational speedup. SIMD excels with contiguous data, which is the opposite of what's happening here.* **Bloom Filters**: A bloom filter is great for quickly filtering out probe keys that definitely don't exist in the build table. This is a huge win in **low-hit-rate** scenarios. My benchmark, however, had a high hit rate, meaning most keys found a match. The bloom filter couldn't filter much, so it just became pure overhead—every key paid the cost of an extra hash and memory lookup for no benefit.* **Grouped Probing**: This technique involves grouping probe keys by their hash value to improve cache locality. However, the ""grouping"" step itself requires an extra pass over the data. In my implementation, where memory access was already heavily optimized with linear probing and prefetching, the cost of this extra pass outweighed the marginal cache benefits it provided.# ConclusionThe performance of flash\_hash\_join doesn't come from a single silver bullet. It's the result of a combination of synergistic design choices:* **Architecture**: Choosing the more modern, lower-overhead Unpartitioned model.* **Algorithm**: Using cache-friendly Linear Probing.* **Concurrency**: Minimizing contention with Shard Locks.* **Memory**: Managing allocation with an Arena and hiding latency with Software Prefetching.* **Details**: Squeezing performance with tag arrays and hardware-accelerated hashing.Most importantly, this entire process was **driven by relentless benchmarking**. This allowed me to quantify the impact of every change and be ruthless about cutting out ""optimizations"" that were beautiful in theory but useless in practice.I hope sharing my experience was insightful. If you're interested in the details, I'd love to discuss them here.Note: my implementation is mainly insipred by this excellent blog: [https://cedardb.com/blog/simple\_efficient\_hash\_tables/](https://cedardb.com/blog/simple_efficient_hash_tables/)",151,0.92,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nfxgze/how_i_built_a_hash_join_2x_faster_than_duckdb/,2025-09-13 13:26:23,2025-09-20 01:22:53

1nkyd8u,Introducing Columnar MemTable: A High-Performance In-Memory KV Engine Achieving ~52 Million ops/s for single-thread write,Motor_Crew7918,dataengineering,"# Hi r/dataengineering When building high-performance storage systems, the performance bottleneck in write-intensive scenarios often lies in the in-memory data structures. Traditional MemTables based on Skip-Lists or B-Trees, while excellent at maintaining data order, can become a performance drag under high-concurrency writes due to their complex internal node operations.To break through this barrier, my colleague and I designed and open-sourced a brand new, high-performance in-memory KV storage engine: **Columnar MemTable**. It leverages a suite of modern C++17 techniques and clever concurrency designs to achieve astonishing performance. In our benchmarks, its concurrent write throughput reached **\~17 million ops/s**, 3.5 times that of a traditional Skip-List implementation. Single-threaded batch writes hit an incredible **\~52 million ops/s**, a 50x improvement over Skip-Lists. In mixed read-write scenarios, its performance soared to **\~61 million ops/s**, leading by a factor of 4.This blog post will serve as a tutorial, taking you on a deep dive into the internal world of Columnar MemTable to dissect the core design philosophy and implementation details behind its high performance.**Core Design Philosophy: Separate the Hot Path, Process Asynchronously**The foundation of Columnar MemTable's high performance can be summarized in one sentence: **Completely separate the write hot path from the background processing cold path.*** **An Extremely Optimized Write Path:** All write operations go into an ""active block"" (FlashActiveBlock) tailor-made for concurrent writes. At this stage, we don't care about global data order; we pursue the absolute maximum write speed and lowest latency.* **Asynchronous Organization and Consolidation:** Once an active block is full, it is ""sealed"" and seamlessly handed over as a whole to a dedicated background thread.* **Leisurely Background Processing:** The background thread is responsible for sorting the sealed data, converting its format, building indexes, and even performing compaction. All these time-consuming operations are completely decoupled from the foreground write path, ensuring stable and efficient write performance.# A Simple Architecture Diagram[Columnar MemTable Design](https://preview.redd.it/vzchkgjz43qf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=d74fb77e99e8e0f228c77ed1e8b48ce92e02ee96)As you can see, Columnar MemTable is essentially an in-memory LSM-Tree. However, because the MemTable itself has a limited size, it doesn't generate a huge number of sorted blocks (usually just a dozen or so). Therefore, in-memory compaction isn't strictly necessary. My implementation provides a configuration option to enable or disable compaction for in-memory sorted blocks, with it being disabled by default.Next, we'll dive into the code to break down the key components that realize this philosophy.**Deep Dive into the Write Path (The ""Hot"" Zone)**The write path is the key to performance. We minimize lock contention through sharding and a clever memory allocation mechanism.**1. Sharding**Like all high-performance concurrent components, sharding is the first line of defense. ColumnarMemTable maintains an array of Shards. By taking the hash of a key modulo the number of shards, we distribute different keys to different shards, which greatly reduces concurrency conflicts. // Locate the corresponding Shard using the key's hash size_t GetShardIdx(std::string_view key) const { return hasher_(key) & shard_mask_; } **2. FlashActiveBlock: The Core of Write Operations**All current writes within a Shard are handled by a FlashActiveBlock. It consists of two parts:* **ColumnarRecordArena**: A memory allocator designed for concurrent writes.* **ConcurrentStringHashMap**: A quasi-lock-free hash index for fast point lookups within the active block.**3. ColumnarRecordArena**Traditional memory allocators require locking under high concurrency, whereas ColumnarRecordArena almost completely eliminates contention between write threads by using Thread-Local Storage (TLS) and atomic operations.Here's how it works:* **Thread-Exclusive Data Blocks:** The first time a thread writes, it's allocated its own ThreadLocalData, which contains a series of DataChunks. A thread only writes to its own DataChunk, avoiding data races at the source.* **Lock-Free In-Block Allocation:** How do we safely allocate space within a DataChunk for multiple threads (although by design TLS is mostly accessed by a single thread, we aim for maximum robustness)? The answer is a 64-bit atomic variable, positions\_. * The **high 32 bits** store the number of allocated records. * The **low 32 bits** store the number of bytes used in the buffer.When a thread needs to allocate space, it enters a Compare-And-Swap (CAS) loop: // Simplified core logic of AllocateAndAppend uint64_t old_pos = chunk->positions_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); while (true) { // Parse old record index and buffer position uint32_t old_ridx = static_cast(old_pos >> 32); uint32_t old_bpos = static_cast(old_pos); // Check if there's enough space if (old_ridx >= kRecordCapacity || old_bpos + required_size > kBufferCapacity) { break; // Not enough space, need to switch to a new Chunk } // Calculate the new position uint64_t new_pos = (static_cast(old_ridx + 1) << 32) | (old_bpos + required_size); // Atomically update the position if (chunk->positions_.compare_exchange_weak(old_pos, new_pos, ...)) { // CAS successful, allocation complete record_idx = old_ridx; buffer_offset = old_bpos; goto allocation_success; } // CAS failed, means another thread interfered. Retry the loop. } This approach avoids heavyweight mutexes (std::mutex), achieving safe and efficient memory allocation with only lightweight atomic operations.**4. ConcurrentStringHashMap: A Fast Index for Active Data**Once data is written to ColumnarRecordArena, we need a fast way to find it. ConcurrentStringHashMap is designed for this. It's based on linear probing and uses atomic tags to handle concurrency.* **Tag Mechanism:** Each slot has an 8-bit atomic tag. EMPTY\_TAG (0xFF) means the slot is empty, and LOCKED\_TAG (0xFE) means it's being written to. When inserting, a thread first tries to CAS the tag from EMPTY\_TAG to LOCKED\_TAG. If successful, it safely writes the data and then updates the tag to its final value.* **Lock-Free Reads:** Read operations are completely lock-free. They just need to atomically read the tag and other data for comparison. This makes point lookups (Get) in the active block extremely fast.**From Hot to Cold: Sealing and Background Processing**Things get more complex when a FlashActiveBlock reaches its size threshold.1. **Seal*** A foreground thread acquires a lightweight SpinLock for the shard.* It marks the current active\_block\_ as sealed.* It creates a new, empty FlashActiveBlock to replace it.* It places the sealed block into a global background processing queue.* It releases the lock.This entire process is very fast, with minimal impact on foreground writes.**2. Background Worker Thread (BackgroundWorkerLoop):**An independent background thread continuously pulls sealed blocks from the queue.* **Data Consolidation:** It iterates through all the data in the sealed block's ColumnarRecordArena, converting it from a fragmented, multi-threaded layout into a compact, contiguous columnar block (ColumnarBlock).* **Columnar Storage (Structure-of-Arrays):** ColumnarBlock stores all keys, values, and types in separate std::vectors. This layout dramatically improves cache locality, especially for future analytical scan queries (OLAP), as it allows reading only the required columns.* **Parallel Sorting:** After consolidation, the background thread calls a Sorter (defaulting to ParallelRadixSorter) to sort all records in the ColumnarBlock by key. Radix sort is highly efficient for strings, and parallelizing it fully utilizes multi-core CPUs.* **Generate SortedColumnarBlock:** Once sorted, a final, immutable, read-only SortedColumnarBlock is generated. To accelerate future reads, we also build: * **Bloom Filter:** To quickly determine if a key might exist, effectively filtering out a large number of queries for non-existent keys. * **Sparse Index:** We sample a key every N records (e.g., 16). When querying, we first use the sparse index to quickly locate an approximate range, then perform a binary search within that small range, avoiding the overhead of a binary search over the entire dataset.As you can see, this SortedColumnarBlock is very similar to a Level 0 SSTable in an LSM-Tree.**The Complete Query Path**What is the lifecycle of a Get(key) request? It searches through data from newest to oldest to ensure it reads the latest version:1. **Check the Active Block:** First, it searches in the current shard's FlashActiveBlock using its ConcurrentStringHashMap. This is the hottest, newest data and usually results in the fastest hits.2. **Check Sealed Blocks:** If not found, it iterates in reverse through the list of sealed\_blocks in the shard that have been sealed but not yet processed by the background thread.3. **Check Sorted Blocks:** If still not found, it finally iterates in reverse through the list of SortedColumnarBlocks that have been processed. Here, it first uses the Bloom filter and sparse index for quick pruning before performing a precise lookup.If the key is not found anywhere, or if the last record found is a Delete type, it returns std::nullopt.Here, to ensure memory safety, we need to maintain a reference count while searching the Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks to prevent the MemTable from deallocating them. However, incrementing a shared\_ptr's reference count on the Get path is very expensive and prevents Get operations from scaling across multiple cores. Using raw pointers, on the other hand, introduces memory safety issues.Our solution uses a **thread-local shared\_ptr** and maintains a **global sequence number**. When the set of Active, Sealed, and Sorted Blocks is modified (e.g., a block is sealed), the global sequence number is incremented. When a Get operation occurs, it checks if its locally cached sequence number matches the global one.* **If they match (the common case)**, the thread-local shared\_ptrs are still valid. The query can proceed using these cached pointers, completely avoiding an expensive atomic ref-count operation.* **If the local number is outdated**, the thread must update its local shared\_ptr cache and sequence number (a much rarer event). This design allows our Get performance to scale effectively on multi-core systems.**Limitations and Future Work**Although Columnar MemTable excels at writes and point lookups, it's not a silver bullet.**Adaptation Issues with RocksDB**The current design is not well-suited to be a drop-in MemTable plugin for RocksDB. A core requirement for RocksDB is an Iterator that can traverse all data in the MemTable in sorted order. In our implementation, data in the FlashActiveBlock is unsorted. To provide a globally sorted iterator, we would have to sort the active block's data on-the-fly every time an iterator is created and merge it with the already sorted blocks. This on-the-fly sorting is extremely expensive and completely defeats our write-optimized design philosophy. Therefore, perfectly adapting to RocksDB would require further design changes, such as maintaining some degree of local order within the active block. One idea is to replace FlashActiveBlock with a skiplist, but that would essentially turn it into an in-memory RocksDB (haha).**Ideal Use Cases**The current ColumnarMemTable is specifically designed for scenarios like:* **Extremely high write throughput and concurrent point lookups:** For example, real-time metrics monitoring, user behavior logging, and other write-heavy, read-light workloads.* **In-memory buffer for OLAP engines:** Its native columnar format makes it a perfect in-memory staging area for OLAP databases (like ClickHouse). When data is flushed from memory to disk, it can be done directly in the efficient columnar format. Even while in memory, its columnar properties can be leveraged for pre-aggregation calculations.**Conclusion**ColumnarMemTable is an exploration and a breakthrough in traditional MemTable design. By separating the hot write path from background processing and designing highly optimized data structures for each—a thread-local arena allocator, a quasi-lock-free hash index, parallel radix sort, and columnar blocks with Bloom filters and sparse indexes—we have successfully built an in-memory KV engine with outstanding performance under write-intensive and mixed workloads.I hope this design deep dive has given you some inspiration.

I now mange the environment and I am looking to get a modern set up with Airflow running in azure on a couple VMs. The dba is not happy that I don’t use SSIS and I feel kind of stuck since I was hired to write Python anyway. I’m also watching more people in my organization develop Python skills so I feel like it makes sense for me to align with the skills of the org as a whole. We also just aquired Snowflake and I feel like Python works better with that kind of data warehouse.Now I do understand some of my dba point of view. My team just did their own thing and he feels that was wrong. I don’t know the whole story as to why things ended up this way and I’ve heard critiques of both IT and my team. My environment wasn’t setup with the best security in mind. I am working to rectify this but I’ve bumped heads with the dba on a solution because he never feels the security is enough and doesn’t trust me fully. I am trying to run Airflow on azure as I said and my plan is to store anything sensitive in key vault and call the secrets at runtime. This should be secure enough to get his sign off but that’s to be seen.Now when it comes to what tool to use(Python, ssis, airflow, etc.) I feel stuck between everyone. On one hand my dba wants to say SSIS and that’s it. I’ve tried SSIS and I prefer Python. If needed I could use SSIS but I’ve brought up other issues such as my dba doesn’t use CI/CD or version control and I think that is very important in a modern setup. Additionally the dba didn’t have other people on his team who knew and a could support ssis until recently and their still new to it. On the flip side I know that the dba team doesn’t have any people who know Airflow or Python so I understand when my dba says that he can’t support Python. I know there are people outside of that team and IT who do know Python though.When it comes down to it I guess I’m trying to figure out if I’m making the right call and telling my dba that I’m going to use Airflow and make it as secure as possible or should I give in because ssis is what he knows? Also should he even have as much say as he does in the agency data engineering stack when he is the dba and he doesn’t develop the pipelines himself?

Data from some core systems (ERP, PDM, CRM, ...)2. Data gets ingested to SQL Database through Azure Data Factory.3. Several schemas in dwh for governance (original tables (IT) -> translated (IT) -> Views (Business))4. What I then did is to create master data views for each business object (customers, parts, suppliers, employees, bills of materials, ...)5. I have around 20 scalar-valued functions that return ""Empty"", ""Valid"", ""InvalidPlaceholder"", ""InvalidFormat"", among others when being called with an Input (e.g. a website, mail, name, IBAN, BIC, taxnumbers, and some internal logic). At the end of the post, there is an example of one of these functions.6. Each master data view with some data object to evaluate calls one or more of these functions and writes the result in a new column on the view itself (e.g. ""dq\_validity\_website"").7. These views get loaded into PowerBI for data owners that can check on the quality of their data.8. I experimented with something like a score that aggregates all 500 or what columns with ""dq\_validity"" in the data warehouse.

Great support for different languages, SDKs available for Python, Node, and Go.*Pros** Open-source! In theory this should reduce the cost if self-hosted.* The A/B testing feature is awesome.*Cons** It’s open-source, so we’ll see how it goes.**Portkey**Quick take: API gateway, guardrails, logs and usage metrics, plug-and-play routing.

I like it but definitely don't love it / have a passion for it.At this point, I'm heavily considering pivoting into sales of some sort, ideally software. I have good social skills and outgoing personality and people have always told me I'd be good at it. I know Software Sales is a lot less stable, major lay-offs happen from missing 1 month's quota, first couple years I'll be making \~$80k-$90k and is definitely more of a grind. But in order to excel in Data Science/Engineering I'm going to have to become a math/tech geek, get a masters and dedicate years to learning algorithms/models/technologies and coding languages. It doesn't seem to play to my strengths and kind of lacks excitement and energy imo.1. Do you see any opportunities for those with data analytics to break into a good sales role/company without sales experience?2. Data Science salary seems to top out around $400k, and thats rather far along in a career at top tech firm (I know FAANG pays much more).

Then the data is served through an API (with FastAPI) with endpoints that allow to fetch historical data etc.Everything works as expected and I had fun building it as I never worked with Timescale. However, after a month I have collected already like 1 TB of raw data (around 100 GB on timescale after compression) .

1nhtsu3,I’m tired of people dying - how long do I need to learn how to build a flood detection app?,little_einschtein,learnprogramming,"Tl:dr; I want to create an (ios + android) app that tells when the river has burst so people can evacuate. I’ve little to 0 experience in coding.Sorry, this is going to be long so I divided it into backstory and technical questions:——Backstory——I live in a small valley town in Malaysia. That said when it floods, ANNUALLY, it becomes a choke point for people travelling to, from and between cities, suburbs and rural areas.Last year, while a young couple died trying to feed stranded families with babies in cars, the young wife fatally fell into a storm drain (hidden by deep flood waters). Now, just last week it rained again and people are stranded - and I just heard that three people have died in the span of less than a week due to record level landslides in this region.Look, everyone knows everyone in this part of the world. So when someone dies, everyone is devastated. And it saddens me that it happens to the those with the best or intentions. Not to mentions property and income losses. I’m talking those who just bought a car to go to work and now it’s CAKED with silt while some have to spend tens of thousands replacing books, devices and furniture cause they didn’t have time to move their stuff elsewhere. You might be thinking why don’t they move their cars uphill or carry your fridge upstairs when it rains? Would you do that every time it rains? It’s a tropical country anyway. Anyway, we can only extrapolate so much. If only, we had an app that tells us when a water has reached a certain threshold, people can avoid driving into the valley and move their cars or property to safer place. Again I have 0 experience in creating this app and I know that that’s just half the problem. I also need to think about the other half of the device - the flood detection thingy. In highschool I met someone in an invention convention that managed to create a device that sends a text message whenever they detect landslide/earthquake in a zone with an Arduino - so it’s like an early prevention mechanism. I’m thinking of emulating that and placing in select flood prone regions upstream as a gauge to let people flee in times when water rises to a certain threshold. I realise the ginormous uphill battle there is on this, but if I could just make one family - even if it’s just my family to turn back and not enter the valley when it floods, or move their car uphill or evacuate their home. I’ll sleep more peacefully.——Technical Questions——App: 1. What courses/topics should I take and learn as basics - and do I need to take this first or learn while developing the app?2. What language should I be using? I rather it be a multiplatform app instead of a native one so I charter to both ios and android users.3. How ”simple” will this app be? I’m not thinking fancy UIs, just maybe pings and alert when one or more of the flood detection gets activated.Flood detection:1. Is an Arduino enough to build this?2. If not, what should the detection be? Is there already an invention that does this?General:- Is this possible? How long will this take me? NB: I’m gonna fund this entirely on my own and I’ll be doing this on the side on top of my already PACKED work schedule.Obviously my questions are wacked cause I honestly don’t know what to ask. I work in an entirely different field and I always have been stupid in class when it comes to STEM.

Most of my friends who enrolled in this program have already left, and I’m one of the few still sticking with it.Here’s my situation:* I’m 21 and just starting my degree. If all goes well, I’d finish in about 3–4 years.* At my university in Canada, internships are mandatory. Without them, you can’t graduate. The school provides some help, but it’s still hard to find one — for some people, it takes 6+ months or even a year.* I’m married, and I really want to finish as quickly as possible so I don’t make my wife wait longer than necessary.* On a personal note, my mother passed away this past January from a brain tumor. Before she passed, I wanted her to see me married, so I made that choice out of love for her and my wife. I know I have to carry the responsibility of that decision, but I don’t regret it.Looking ahead, I’d like to specialize in AI ,specifically deep learning and machine learning. I know that’s a path that might require pursuing a master’s degree or additional studies after my bachelor’s.And about passion, people often say “if you’re not passionate, switch programs.” I’d say I am passionate, but in my own way. What I really love is solving problems, whether it’s in math, physics, or programming. Coding itself is fun, but I’m not the type who will stay up all night coding just for the sake of it. For me, the thrill is in figuring out the solution.So far, I’ve only done one or two very small side projects, and I’m starting a third one (a bit harder, I want to make a simple GPT wrapper). They’re nothing big, but I’m slowly building up.My concern is: should I stick with software engineering?By the time I graduate, will it still be worth it? Or is the field going to be so saturated that even with a degree and internships, finding a job will be tough?Has anyone here been in a similar situation, balancing marriage, studies, and an uncertain job market?

1njsucu,How is data stored as bytes? How is different information separated?,FactoryBuilder,learnprogramming,"So a bit of “how I got here” for my question:I was programming in Godot and learning file access and data storage. I found out that I can store integers as bytes in a text file and the file when opened in a text editor will have those bytes translated to their ASCII characters but Godot will still read the data as bytes and return integers when the program reads the file.I thought it’d be funny to have a simple text file, not .dat or .json or any other specialized data storage format, for storing data. Because the text editor spits out the ASCII codes, it will look like gibberish. Representing the data I need stored as integers is easy. The problem is that I’m not sure how to separate different pieces of information. Let’s say variable A is an integer. Simple. Store its binary 8 bit value. Let’s say variable B is an array. Well it could be of a varied length so I need some way to tell the program when it’s reading the file that the data for this variable starts here and ends here. I can’t use any of the 256 combinations of 8 bits because they all represent numbers that the value I’m trying to store could be.**So how can I mark the beginning and end of certain pieces of data in bytes?** I’m sure this is a very basic computer science problem but I’m not proficient enough in Google-fu to find it online.",19,0.74,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1njsucu/how_is_data_stored_as_bytes_how_is_different/,2025-09-17 23:34:42,2025-09-20 01:22:54

Most of my day is basically just me sitting behind my laptop grinding through uni work so I can keep my grades up.At the same time, I also have the ambition to build my own projects, either to make money from programming or at least to create tools that are genuinely useful to me. The problem is I haven’t even managed to start a project yet. I struggle with discipline and time. After a full day of studying, my brain just feels fried, and at that point I usually need to do something physical instead. I’m pretty active and I love sports, so I go to MMA once a week and try to squeeze in short workouts on other days. Honestly, without sports I’d probably go crazy.Another factor is that I still live at home. My family expects me to spend a lot of time with them, helping out aroud the hosue, hanging with my sibling, etc. I feel guilty if I ignore them, so usually when I get back from uni I end up just chilling in the living room instead of working on a personal project. On top of that, my little brother has been sick for a few years and can’t really leave the house, so he needs more of my time and energy too. I hope he gets better soon, since that would have a good impact on both our lives.I’m the type of person who really likes having structure and a routine, so part of me feels like moving out nearby could help me manage my time better. But then that also makes me feel guilty for “leaving” my family.Meanwhile, one of my classmates (and a good friend) has the same ambitions as me, but his routine is very different. After studying all day, he takes break at home, then spends the rest of the evening grinding on a personal project until he goes to bed. He basically lives on his own, doesn’t care much for sports, and spends almost all his time in front of a screen. I can see it working for him, he’s making progress and hitting his goals, but I also suspect it’s taking a toll on his health. Still, I can’t help but compare myself to him and admire his discipline.Sorry for the info dump, but I just wanted to put it out there. If anyone has advice on how to balance studies, family, health, and personal projects, I’d really appreciate it. I would also appreciate it if people got drop some project ideas or just routes i can take. I only looked into automating stuff in my live.

I’m naturally motivated by tangible results, which is why I love coding I can see what I create. But when it comes to other subjects, or even “harder” coding problems, the process itself feels painful.Even when I break tasks into small problems, if I can’t solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like I’m running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isn’t as satisfying as it used to be.This year in school doesn’t help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. I’ve even stopped working on projects because the thought “I must prepare for the exams” hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isn’t making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I don’t have a choice I can’t go to university if I don’t pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soonRecently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a ""logic"" question I couldn't solve it which is ""supposed to be easy"" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square"", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good ""future proof"" career, which then makes me think, ""just study AI development"" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.I might be spiraling My question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isn’t naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to ""get things in order"" I feel lost I really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.",14,0.83,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh24jb/how_can_actually_enjoy_studying_instead_of/,2025-09-14 20:35:05,2025-09-20 01:22:54

At first I thought it was just a puzzle game with logic gates… but it turned out to be much more. It gave me a hands-on understanding of logic gates, memory, and even simple CPU design. Hats off to devs for making something so educational yet so enjoyable.The game gradually pushes you from simple combinatorial circuits, to memory, to registers and to building a working CPU (LC-3 style) with your own instruction set. By the end you’re basically writing assembly for a custom ISA that you designed yourself.I’m not a computer engineer by training, but the concepts I picked up while playing \[logic gates, adders, memory, instruction cycles and more\] have been incredibly specific and useful later on. They gave me intuition that still helps me today as I'm trying to study C, data structures, and operating systems.It’s obviously not a replacement for textbooks, but for me it was a fantastic way to *feel* how computers work at a very low level, and it made the transition to more formal books study way smoother.Curious if anyone else here has tried it and how far you got — did you stop at logic gates, or did you programmed your CPU?",10,0.79,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngbqgg/learning_programming_and_cs_concepts_through/,2025-09-13 23:17:13,2025-09-20 01:22:54

I hate feeling this way and making my partner feel bad since I really do appreciate it when she helps me.

Writing this makes me feel ashamed because I don’t know what I did with all this time.Now I’ve got around 8 months left before graduation. For my project idea, I was planning to build a simple web app a platform to connect local organizations, community groups, and citizens, where people could find local events, volunteering opportunities, or community updates in one place. My thought was that at least I could learn something while trying to finish this project.But when I presented it, my teacher wasn’t impressed and honestly, I don’t blame him. Looking back, I can see the idea probably didn’t sound very impressive the way I explained it. He said:I should add AI integration. And more importantly, he told me: *“Web development is dead. You should switch to mobile development. It would be better for you. Everybody knows web dev""*Now I’m stuck. I know I wasted so much time, but I want to at least use these last months to learn and build something. My main question is: is web development really “dead” and not worth doing anymore?

After that, I’ll choose my major, probably CS unless something changes.My plan is to start self-teaching programming and development during these two years so by the time I actually get into CS I’m not a total beginner. I want to become good enough at coding and development by the end of the 5 years to freelance whenever I want and build some kind of financial freedom, so I’m not stuck depending on a job forever.I know it’s a big goal and I’m starting with zero experience in coding but I’m serious about making it work.Here’s what I’m worried about:\* Is it actually possible to become really good at coding from zero in 5 years? Like good enough to freelance or get decent jobs?\* Should I be scared about AI taking all the software jobs?\* How safe is CS compared to other majors like mechanical or electrical engineering?\* What should I be doing during these two prep years to prepare myself ?

I looked up a few, and so far the most notable ones seem to be Pygames if I wanna do everything from scratch, or websites like Screentop or Boardgame.(Related coding question : how would you implement the different pathways a pawn can take with a given dice number ? My boardgame would have different paths and intersections, and no imposed direction of movement.

I have around 2 years of professional experience (plus personal projects), and my degree is in Industrial Engineering, not CS, unfortunately.I’m currently exploring job opportunities in the EU and I live in Turkey as a EU citizen. From what I’ve seen, Go related roles are quite limited and often target senior/lead engineers (likely for teams migrating to Go). Because of this, I’m considering shifting to Java for backend work, since it seems to have a much broader job market.At the same time, I’m also tempted by C++. There aren’t many developers specializing in low-level coding, and I feel that makes it a valuable skill in the long run.

1ngt349,"How to approach architecting apps when real users, real revenue, and long-term maintainability is at stake?",calmstoic2000,learnprogramming,"Hi guys, how do you think about architecting an app when real users are involved and you’re trying to find an effective solution? By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):1. Solves the user’s problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).2. Isn’t overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.3. Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.Context: I’m a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (\~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. I’ve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy. This gets especially tough when there's older code not written by me which looks like it was written just to get things working with no regard for quality.Questions I struggle with repeatedly:1. How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.2. How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.3. How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.4. How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?5. Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?6. Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?**I rely on AI** a lot for these questions and I worry I’m making uninformed choices that will become bad habits when I work with better, more experienced engineers.

1niyv29,A deep dive into a real-world Rust FFI project: wrapping a C++ bioinformatics library,AdditionalMushroom13,learnprogramming,"Hey r/learnprogramming,I've been using Rust for a while and recently finished a project that involved some interesting challenges I thought would be valuable to share, especially for those curious about using Rust with other languages.# ## The GoalIn my field (bioinformatics), there's a powerful C++ tool called `odgi` for working with complex DNA data. I wanted to use its features inside a Rust program to leverage Rust's safety and concurrency, which meant building a bridge between the two languages.# ## The Learning Journey & Key ChallengesEven with experience, this project presented some great learning opportunities:1. **Tackling FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** The core of the project was making Rust and C++ talk to each other. I used the `cxx` crate, which is a fantastic tool for generating safe bindings. It was a deep dive into how to manage data and function calls across the language boundary, which is a common task in systems programming.2. **Designing a ""Safe"" API:** A key principle in Rust is memory safety. A big part of the design work was creating a public API that completely hides the `unsafe` FFI calls. This ensures anyone using my library can write 100% safe Rust code, a rewarding design challenge.3. **Complex Build Scripts:** I had to write a [`build.rs`](http://build.rs) script to compile the entire C++ `odgi` library from source before building the Rust code. It's a good reminder of how complex real-world build pipelines can get when you're integrating different ecosystems.# ## The OutcomeThe result is a library (`odgi-ffi`) that other Rust developers in my field can now use as a solid foundation for their own tools.# ## Key Takeaways* **Real-world problems push your skills:** Integrating existing, complex libraries is a great way to move beyond language basics.* **Modern tooling makes hard problems accessible:** FFI used to be a very manual and error-prone process. Crates like `cxx` make it significantly more manageable and safe.I just wanted to share the experience in case it's helpful. I'm happy to answer any questions about the process, or about using Rust and C++ together.",2,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1niyv29/a_deep_dive_into_a_realworld_rust_ffi_project/,2025-09-17 00:39:30,2025-09-20 01:22:54
1niiu6r,coding an animation program?,flufishere,learnprogramming,"Heyo. I haven't been coding very long, I know python and I've only just started learning Java. But I've been very interested in the idea of making an animation program (Adobe Animate, Toon Boom Harmony, etc) but I have no idea how the logic of saving data to frames and then showing/hiding that data would work. Everytime I try to search anything about it I only get searches on how to play animations in java, which I don't think would apply for what I'm trying to do? (I'm unsure.) I'm not looking for a ginormous step by step guide or anything, just a general push in the direction of how a coder would think about doing something like that. The only way I can think to do it in my head involves quite literally an infinite number of if statements/switch statements, which I feel that can't be right. See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.This is an example of how I'm thinking of this in my head (This isn't a specific coding language, I'm nore trying to get across the concept of what I'm doing)\---If current\_frame == 1: erase previous drawing on screen show drawing\_1 on screenif current\_frame ==2: erase previous drawing on screen show drawing\_2 on screen\---etc etc it goes infinitely, these could also be switch statements, but I'm not sure how that makes it any better.I'm aware of the existence of dictionaries/mapping/lookup tables/whatever their called you know what I'm trying to talk about, but those have a finite amount of entries in them (as far as I'm aware?) the amount of frames the user decides to make is literally infinite.This may be a silly question, I'm not very familiar with coding visuals yet, so maybe this is obvious to soneone who is familiar with coding visuals.

1nlig1c,Can't decide what to learn.,vap0ri,learnprogramming,"Firstly, I'm tired of endlessly reading books/tutorials on languages. I switched three resources for C++. The last one was the most recommended - C++ primer, 5th edition (or whatever edition covers C++11). After authors told me about auto and decltype() in SECOND chapter, I dropped it, because... No. Just no. Why would they teach me this, if they even couldn't provide me some real-world examples of its usage? The worst thing is that I know C++'s basics, so reading any book on C++ becomes mostly a torment for me. And yet I can't just ""skip to the interesting part"", because I never know what I'm gonna miss unless I read that. :) And the most important: I'm just tired of doing nothing. Yeah, there are these little exercises in each chapter, but I wanna learn programming to make software, not to accomplish those exercises. That means, I would like to start building something as soon as possible.I have some experience in C, C++, C#, Python. The last language I used was python. Python did let me start building as soon as possible (thanks to python's docs and previous experience in C-languages). I mostly liked it, but I'm pretty sure that I don't wanna tie my life to it. I tried building a text-only roguelike with it, but I struggled with the structure. Not that I'm saying this is python's fault, just sharing what I made so far with it. I made the main game loop (fight system, basically) and classes of characters (warrior, mage, etc). Each character has max health, max mana, level, some spells and growths of health and mana with each level (like growths of attributes in DoTA 2). Stopped and decided to rewrite the whole thing, because it felt like the structure got too messy. The largest barrier in making it is import cycles existence and relations between classes. Also I had to work on C# for two weeks. I made a GUI calculator with it, which uses the worst but (it seems) working algorithm of evaluation. C# let me start building right away too, thanks to my previous C++ knowledge. I also found Microsoft docs really helpful. I have ~~experience~~ knowledge of old C++, which is compatible with C (raw pointers, C-strings, C-arrays, etc), and knowledge of just a few things that comes only with C++, like vectors/stacks/queues and classes (basics of all of them).Finally, I would like to provide my vision on languages that I'm interested in OR have ever tried. Note that I don't consider web at all (and even electron or whatever way to use JS for software developing). I'm not interested in it.C++: seems too low-level to just let me start building things, plus it has terrible ecosystem with all of these build systems, their generators (CMake, Meson) and unpleasant ways to get 3rd party libraries.Rust: seems too low-level to just let me start building things. It does have better ecosystem, but I guess there are just no resources on it for newbies like me.C#: tied to windows... Not that I hate it, but coding on windows just feels wrong, plus I've never found something better than bare GNU Emacs when it comes to text editors, but it works fine only on native linux setup. There is .NET SDK for Linux, but... I'm not sure.

1nkwrgg,Switching to contracting was the best decision I've ever made.,WildPresentation7295,cscareerquestions,"After my last layoff from a full time job, I decided for the first time to actually stop ignoring the recruiters messaging me about W2 contract roles and actually see what it's about. I ended up getting a role through one of the major firms in tech. I'm now 2 years in after a few renewals, and oh my god, I didn't know what I was missing.It's probably just because of the type of person I am. I hate ""team building"" bullshit and people who treat work like a social club. I want to be left alone so I can do my work, though I'm good at working as part of a team and collaborating when needed. But work is work to me, I don't want to be friends and get together for a beer.I don't have to go a bunch of the company meetings and townhalls. I don't have to meet with a manager each quarter to discuss my ""career goals"" because nobody cares. I just get my work, do it, and get my weekly paycheck that is significantly higher than my full time pay was, even accounting for paying for the insurance I get through the firm. Nobody cares when I clock in and out, as long as I get my work done. There's no less job security than there was at my full time roles where rounds of layoffs would come every year at least.This is the only job I've ever had where I am not constantly bombarded with a bunch of ""extracurricular"" bullshit that eats away at my soul and burns me out.Oh yeah, perhaps most importantly: **I got the job after two interviews: a phone screen with HR and a technical discussion with my team, with no leetcode or DSA interrogation rounds.** Just a discussion of my projects and experience.

But having literally never “done a project” before I can’t think of one I can actually do that is cool. There’s just too many complicated parts and it is difficult to map out how to get started (I.e. what types of tooling I would need, what objects I’d need, how they will interact etc).

1njb0d3,Why do software engineers talk so much about their salaries and perks compared to other fields?,x_mad_scientist_y,cscareerquestions,"I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:* Corporate law - long hours at the top firms, but once you make partner or move in-house, the pay and perks can be incredible.* Management consulting - high salaries, travel perks, and later the option to slide into cushy corporate strategy roles.* Finance (investment banking, hedge funds, private equity) - brutal in the early years, but the compensation and eventual lifestyle roles can be extremely attractive.* Pharma/biotech corporate roles - especially regulatory affairs, medical affairs, or corporate strategy, where salaries and work-life balance can be excellent.* Government or quasi-gov jobs - not always “high salary” in the traditional sense, but great stability, pensions, benefits, and very relaxed day-to-day in some roles.I think tech gets the spotlight partly because1. It’s more relatable, everyone uses apps and websites, so people “get” what a software engineer does2. The industry actively markets itself through social media and content like those “Day in the Life” vlogsMeanwhile, most law firms or finance offices aren’t putting out lifestyle videos showing their perksCurious what others think: is it just the marketing or social media presence, or is there something unique about tech culture that makes people talk about salaries and perks more than other fields?",135,0.79,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1njb0d3/why_do_software_engineers_talk_so_much_about/,2025-09-17 11:53:00,2025-09-20 01:22:55

Interviews have rarely anything to do with what you do on the job. Thanks to all the endless technology programmers have to make up every year, good luck keeping up with everything. Also, look forward to 3-5 rounds of BS each time. Good luck finding the time to do this if you have a job you hate. I guess good luck if you run out of days to use for interviews.

I started off on forums like MPGH, first learning how to use a debugger, then learning x86 asm, and then C.

I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),This kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the ""low-level"", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.Now I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.I struggle to use git lolCI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusingI struggle with database stuffI struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own ""OOP"" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.Get fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shitAll of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool ""high level"" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.It's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.None of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).None of these things are ""software"" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).To be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field.

Now, I'm in your typical big tech company making 250k.The other day, a friend reached out with an idea for a tool. The idea makes sense to me and doesn't sound too difficult to build. He also has a pipeline to market it and already some validation so I would only have to handle the tech stuff so I immediately told him I'm down.However thinking about it after, I'm wondering if it's the smartest thing to do.

Instead of encouragement, I was labeled as “too ambitious” and even considered a flight risk(the very next day HR in a very friendly manner if i am happy working here?). After that conversation, the communication from my boss slowly disappeared.At first that was disappointing. Then something unexpected happened. I found a mentor here on Reddit. Even though he lives in a different time zone,. He reviews my work, gives me honest suggestions, and the only thing he has asked in return is that I pay it forward when my time comes. That single request has inspired me more than anything else.My plan is simple. I want to stay where I am for the next three years, collect AWS certifications, and keep building homelabs with different tools. I am not going anywhere. I am a resilient and determined MF, and no lack of support will stop me from learning and growing.What I have realized is that ambition makes some people uncomfortable, but it also attracts the right kind of people who genuinely want to see you succeed. I am grateful that I found one of those people here.Edit: I have been axed. Received email.

But he did ask me to revamp my resume to be more Python focused and emphasize that in the interview.I've also had companies latch on to random keywords in my resume and ascribe way more meaning than necessary. For example: I helped build an internal search engine for a previous company, which made a recruiter think that I should work on the internal search engine at their company.My question is... why? I can think of 15 things that are more important than those when it comes to technical experience/ ability.

Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. It’s all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. I’m very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that I’ve squandered this opportunity.I had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, I’m afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But I’m not. I’m afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, I’ll end up in a situation where I’ll get fired or they’ll find out I’m not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I can’t code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just can’t now.I don’t know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter. I don’t even want to try to take the assessment because I’m so overwhelmed, I’m behind at my current job and don’t have the time or energy for the interview process, but I also feel stuck and sad at my current job, at least I’m comfortable though.I guess I’m just looking for sympathy and support, and maybe some advice as to what I should say to the recruiter.

1nh4ep2,"How to be viewed as the solution, not the problem?",L3av3NoTrac3s,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Getting labeled as problematic when trying to help my team not destroy customer trust due to poor engineering practices, how to turn the tide so management will listen?Frustrated with my team and going to get fired if I keep alienating myself by trying to do the right thing. Background: Only self-taught dev on my team, low/mid level, remote, love my company and very loyal for them taking a chance on me when I was an intern. Over the past year management changes have destroyed my team’s effectiveness.QA: Obvious bugs are getting pushed daily, we lack testing, and there’s no chain of approval. People just click approve button after skimming the code. We have juniors approving and pushing each other’s code with no oversight. Sometimes the code doesn’t even work, or it doesn’t do what they think it’s doing due to inexperience in the codebase. I feel obligated to point out bugs etc when I see them, but I hate having to be the bad guy on a daily basis. Seniors don’t seem to care even when I bring it up to them.Planning: Designers make tickets for feature work and throw them in “to-do”. Tickets are done out of order, so code written today will need to be rewritten next week when the other ticket is done. I feel obligated to try and point out that doing X before Y will mean we need to redo X, but they don’t see this as wasting time, they see me as blocking progress or Idk what I’m talking about because “it always works out anyway” (I always end up handling the duplicated work). Sometimes tickets literally cannot be done without core functionality from other tickets, so juniors will just do a crazy workaround or make the feature do something completely broken instead. We waste weeks arguing before management will finally let me fix things, then they complain I’m always prolonging simple tickets.Architecture: There’s no technical design process at all. Management says they trust engineers to make those decisions on the fly, including juniors. The designers sometimes make a figma reference sheet that doesn’t even let you do the requested features, and juniors will code half of it before realizing they’re blocked then we go back to the drawing board, instead of listening to me pointing out “hey, this doesn’t look like it’s going to do what it seems like you’re asking for” during sprint planning. They claim I’m worrying too much about edge cases.For example, a junior will pick up a ticket that should involve creating a system to support doing X task securely, using backend transactions etc. Instead of having a proper design doc to follow, they ad-lib it together using flaky frontend logic because they don’t know any better. They’ll have the frontend spoofing admin api calls to make those transactions work, creating a system that now requires the api to accept admin calls from non-admin JWT tokens. This means my next ticket has to follow their unsafe patterns, so I’m stuck refactoring their feature to something safe before I can even start my tickets. Me pointing this out as a problem leads to me getting labeled as nit-picky, too opinionated, and “thinking my way is the only way”.I’ve been trying to affect change, but it’s above my pay grade and thus rejected because I have no authority whatsoever. Management pushes back publicly against my concerns, and when I’m proven right and end up fixing things, it’s generally in private so the general sentiment for me is low. I’m also advocating for better practices for technical planning, design, QA, etc but it’s led to me getting alienated from the rest of the team who thinks we’re doing just fine. Any conversation I start now leads to arguments because I immediately get mischaracterized as causing problems when I open my mouth. I’ll raise a concern, and the response is usually to the effect of “no it’s not” or “prove it”… so I will screenshare in the codebase why something is an issue, then get told “stop being too technical”. Basically they don’t trust me when I tell them something is problematic, and then still don’t understand when I show the code causing the issue. It’s a no-win situation.1:1 with the tech lead who said basically “we don’t need to worry about good principles because we can rewrite the whole app in a month if we really had to, just chill out and stop worrying, the company isn’t really affected.” I disagree wholeheartedly, I think our performance has the ability to kill the company by destroying our customer’s trust from the sheer amount of bugs and misrepresented data in the product.",12,0.85,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nh4ep2/how_to_be_viewed_as_the_solution_not_the_problem/,2025-09-14 22:06:58,2025-09-20 01:22:55
1nk5eig,Baby while working?,JustForArkona,cscareerquestions,"Lots of little details here so bear with me. Tech lead, 13 YOE, F500, WFH 95% of the time. Only need to go into the office for select VIP meetings. I am 9 weeks into ""maternity leave"" (aka 6 weeks to heal from major abdominal surgery plus 6 weeks unpaid leave) and I am getting anxiety about the end of it looming - mostly about dropping off my baby into daycare. First time mom. Husband works a blue collar job. I make good money for our MCOL area but shit money compared to FAANG peeps. But I typically work strictly 40 hours/week and it's flexible. We cannot afford an in home nanny.This part is about baby/daycare specifics so skip this paragraph to get to the work stuff. He's so little. He's still unable to fall asleep on his own and he does not sleep very long in his bassinet during the day so I've been doing a lot of contact napping. Also the daycare has had a change in management since we signed him up for it and they've been hard to reach/accumulating some bad reviews since then. Also also, I made the mistake of reading about how, while older kids do well in preschool to help prepare them for kindergarten in terms of social and academic achievements, there are only negative outcomes associated with a baby under a year old going into daycare. I'm just getting super nervous about all of this and I'm literally losing sleep over it (which is hard to come by at the moment to begin with haha).I have had a couple coworkers (admittedly more in project management type roles) tell me just keep the baby at home for the first year! It'll be fine! I just don't understand how that's gonna work. I have days of back to back meetings, presenting or leading coding ensembles, trying to focus and get work done. He's still too young to get on a schedule, and he was slightly underbaked. We can start working towards a schedule soon but it's way too chaotic at the moment. I am not nursing or pumping so that doesn't factor into all of this.An additional complicating factor... My team, who had been together for 5+ years, was disbanded three weeks before I had to have my baby. I have been shoved into a ""solution architect"" position now, and despite me begging for time with my new manager, no one took the time to explain wtf you actually do as a SA in our company and what my new role responsibilities were. My team never worked with one so I have no idea. I spent those 3 weeks (before I suddenly developed pre-eclampsia and had to deliver) being upset about the changes, mad about no one communicating with me, and just mad in general cause I was heavily pregnant in the dead of summer haha. So there's a high degree of uncertainty of what I'll be doing when I do get back. And I'm sad that there's a good possibility I won't be coding anymore, won't be leading and mentoring anymore, but the job market appears to be shit so all in all feeling stuck, frustrated, anxious, and hormonal. So I guess my questions are... Has anyone successfully taken care of a baby while in a technical role like this? Am I crazy for contemplating how I can make it work?

It was kind of like a repeat of the previous inerview, I thought. I asked them about it, asked what brought this about given I already accepted the offer weeks ago. They said that it's a ""pipeline"" thing, I didn't quite follow. Something about how at that time they were gearing up for the recompete, and how we all have background checks and security clerance to be done, and basically that the purpose of this was, now that we're approaching the work for real, the get a feel for precisely where I should be on this large team.

Unfortunately, I was laid off about a year later.I've since landed a new role, the title is Software Engineer, but it is very AI centric, and any dev work is heavily done using AI tools where software engineers more or less prompt and review the generated code. Writing actual code is minimal, just small tweaks to results. The brainwork is mostly being offloaded to AI, we're instructed to write agents to attempt to automate almost anything and everything.I’m concerned about not being able to grow my dev skills. I genuinely miss writing and reading code and delving into codebases to solve problems. I miss debugging/troubleshooting, and learning intricacies, nuances, and quirks of the language and technologies that I am working with.In the off chance that these AI tools for dev work end up being scrapped several years down the line, I’m concerned that my skills will not have grown here. I’ve already heard first hand stories of experienced devs using these kinds of tools feeling as if their skills are dulling.Still being very early in my career, I’m wondering if I should stay in my current role (because this may be the future), or if I should try to find a job with a company that still does traditional software engineering with complemental AI use (e.g. Copilot in VS) to help me hone my raw SDE skills.I personally feel that these AI tools are best used by experienced engineers who have learned over time what to ask for, what looks good etc. I feel as though it is probably easier for an experienced dev to learn and make use of AI tools/coding assistants than someone who’s inexperienced and won't know enough to even know what to look for.So regardless of where things are headed, I think that real life hands-on coding experience is going to be king, but this is just one opinion. I'd like to hear some different points of view so I can make an informed choice.Are there any arguments for me staying in an AI centric role (which may be the future)? Or should I try and move back to a traditional dev role (which may serve me best regardless)?**\*UPDATE/EDIT\***Perhaps ""AI Vibe Coding"" was the wrong term, even though my job title is still Software Engineer, my role is more like ""Prompt Engineer"".I don't want to give too much details, but my team is currently coming up with and providing prompts for other teams to use in certain AI tools to expedite their workflows. We have also been training them on communication with the AI tools being used, basically ""AI Evangelists/Crusaders"" at this point.I haven't had the chance to write any code, and future projects are to create more prompts to feed these AI agents so they can automate more workflows. This process doesn't involve me ever having to delve deep into a codebase or understand an actual product.

1nl8jwd,AWS Offer vs Current Company (Startup),TellerOTPS,cscareerquestions,"Hello, I realize I might get clowned for asking this, but I do genuinely think hearing peoples' perspectives will help me.I have been working as a Software Engineer at a relatively large (for a startup) startup for 3 years now (was 22 then, am 25 now). I work on pretty low-levelled stuff with C, like Linux kernel stuff, network stuff, etc. I started as an intern right out of college making $25 an hour, but gradually moved up each year to $140,000 per year which I make now.My team is really chill overall, and I am good friends with a good-sized portion of the team members. I do think that I have learned a lot already throughout my \~3 years at my current role, but I know I could still learn more here if I stayed. But it would have to come from myself searching out new opportunities actively within the organization, as the work I have been getting has been kind of the same for a while, and I do feel kind of monotonous at times. However, I also fault myself for not being more proactive and asking my boss for more interesting work, I realize I've been kind of just doing whatever they needed me to do, without advocating to be given what I think would be most interesting/ best for my learning. Lastly I should mention that I do lots of work with an overseas team so sometimes I have to do late night meetings and stuff which is not exactly preferable (though I'm sure that's not necessarily something that is avoidable, and might happen at any other job).The situation I am in is, I have just received an offer from AWS as an SDE II, at around \~$330,000 total compensation. I wasn't really seeking it out, I just got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, and thought I'd give it a shot and see how the interview process went. And then, yeah I just kind of Forrest Gump'd to an offer. So yeah it all kind of happened sort of fast for me, so I have mixed emotions. Obviously, the money is more (though the startup I work at might get acquired, I think we do have potential offers etc., but I am not entirely sure as the management hasn't directly told us). But I am trying to decide what is best for my career. While I love my current team, I do think that I could gain a lot from expanding my horizons. And working at Amazon might also allow me to open new doors. The team I was offered to join is pretty similar to what I am doing now (systems level and network stuff). But I also would potentially have more opportunities to move around within the organization (eventually) and try new things, which is definitely not really possible with my current company. Also I think I might want to try living somewhere else some day (been in the Bay Area really my whole life) and obviously it might be easier to do that if I had other offices at my company I could go to (not really an option at my current company). So I guess I just want to hear what people would do in my shoes, it is surprisingly a little difficult to decide. I do think I know what most of you are going to say but I just thought it would be good to seek the guidance of the forefathers/foremothers, the pioneers who have walked this path before me.

My salary is low (\~2/3 of country average). I built two showcase apps (Rails backend + React Native frontend) to better understand my market value. Looking for feedback on my execution, portfolio strength, what to improve, and whether I should present myself as junior/mid/senior. Also wondering if \~$20/h freelance (20h/week) is realistic.Hey everyone,I've been working in an IT company for about 9 years, always in the same company. My work is mostly backend, but sometimes I do a bit of frontend and DevOps as well. The issue is that my current salary is quite low, about 2/3 of the average salary in my country. The company also has some financial problems, but on the bright side, I get a lot of freedom and flexibility. Before I risk switching jobs or trying to build a second income stream, I want to better understand my real market value.The challenge for me is that my company relies heavily on internal processes, workflows, and custom setups, so it’s hard to compare my experience with ""standard"" projects. That’s why I decided to build my own apps as a showcase of what I can actually do.# What I builtI made two projects:* A Ruby on Rails app with a CMS, user dashboard, public-facing part, and an API.* A React Native (Expo) app that consumes the RoR API.# The ideaUsers can sign up or log in via either the web app or the mobile app. Once logged in, they can add products (with price and brand) and save them into lists. Each list has fields such as date, shop name, and value. Users can edit and delete both lists and products.I intentionally kept the functionality simple so people can test it without friction. My goal wasn't to build a ""real"" product, but to create a minimal app that demonstrates everyday developer practices.# What I worked with**Ruby on Rails** (API + web app + CMS + user dashboard), using Devise for authentication.* Two Devise models: Admins (login to CMS, only created by other admins) and Users (sign in to the dashboard to manage lists).* No email confirmation because I didn't want to set up MailGun/SendGrid, but I understand the process (domains, spam issues, etc.).* I use Tailwind CSS for frontend styling in my RoR app.* Stimulus JS for interactivity (sorting, filtering, etc.).**Mobile: React Native (Expo).**Users can add products without signing in, but creating a lists requires a login.* Authentication: the mobile app sends email/password to the Rails API, which returns a JWT token. The token unlocks all features (list + product management, user settings).* Settings include: language (HR/EN/DE), currency (€/$), theme (light/dark).* Legal pages are public and available in all three languages without changing settings.**DevOps**I Deployed the RoR app on a Hetzner server and installed Ubuntu 24, Nginx, Puma, cloned the RoR repo, precompiled assets, configured secrets, etc.**Content**I wrote demo texts in three languages I'm familiar with: Croatian, German, and English.# Code & live appsGitHub repo for Rails app: [Sparenzi Web](https://sparenzi.eu/) and [Repo](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenziweb/tree/master)(There are few commits because I developed in a private GitLab repo and only published the final version here)GitHub repo for React Native app: [Sparenzi](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenzi)# What I'd love to know* How would you rate my project execution?

I enjoy both areas (software, hardware, and everything in between), so the only question is which one offers better work prospects? Also, if you did any of these what college did you go to (I'm still looking for colleges so I'd like to know some ppl's experiences).
