1oieor6,Are DE jobs moving?,Numerous-Fix-4360,dataengineering,"Hi, I'm a senior analytics engineer - currently in Canada (but a US/Canada dual citizen, so looking at North America in general).I'm noticing more and more that in both my company, and many of my peers' companies, data roles that were once located in the US are being moved to low-cost (of employment) regions. These are roles that were once US-based, and are now being reallocated to low cost regions.My company's CEO has even quietly set a target of having a minimum of 35% of the jobs in each department located in a low-cost region of the world, and is aggressively pushing to move more and more positions to low cost regions through layoffs, restructuring, and natural turnover/attrition. I've heard from several peers that their companies seem to be quietly reallocating many of their positions, as well, and it's leaving me uncertain about the future of this industry in a high-cost region like North America.The macro-economic research does still seem to suggest that technical data roles (like a DE or analytics engineer) are still stable and projected to stay in-demand in North America, but ""from the ground"" I'm only seeing reallocations to low-cost regions en mass.Curious if anybody else is noticing this at their company, in their networks, on their feeds, etc.?I'm considering the long term feasibility of staying in this profession as executives, boards, and PE owners just get greedier and greedier, so just wanting to see what others are observing in the market.Edit: removed my quick off the cuff list of low cost countries because debating the definition and criteria for “low cost” wasn’t really the point lol",64,0.89,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oieor6/are_de_jobs_moving/,2025-10-28 16:50:57,2025-11-04 01:39:57

There’s also a path here for data analysts to move into data science, which pays better and involves predictive analytics and advanced modeling.That used to be my plan, but lately I’ve realized I’m not sure it’s for me. I’m autistic and I struggle with the constant presentations, storytelling, and meetings that come with more “business-facing” roles. I’m very introverted and prefer structured, predictable work and I’ve noticed the parts I enjoy most are the engineering ones: building pipelines, automating processes, making data flow efficiently.I don’t have a software engineering background (I’m a physicist), but I’ve always done well with computational work and Python. I haven’t worked with Spark, IaC, or devops yet, but I like that kind of technical challenge.I’m not looking for advice per se, just wanted to share my thoughts and see if anyone here has had a similar experience, moving from a data or analytics-heavy background into something more engineering-focused.",55,0.93,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1om350m/for_what_reasons_didwould_you_migrate_from_data/,2025-11-02 00:05:29,2025-11-04 01:39:57

1oj1itv,How to convince a switch from SSIS to python Airflow?,GehDichWaschen,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,TLDR: The team prefers SSIS over Airflow, I want to convince them to accept the switch as a long term goal.I am a Senior Data Engineer and I started at an SME earlier this year.Previously I used a lot of Cloud Services, like AWS BatchJob for the ETL of an Kubernetes application, EC2 with airflow in docker-compose, developed API endpoints for a frontend Application using sqlalchemy at a big company, worked TDD in Scrum etc.Here, I found the current setup of the ETL pipeline to be a massive library of SSIS Packages basically getting data from an on prem ERP to a Reporting Model.There are no tests, there are many small-small hacky ways inside SSIS to get what you want out of the data. The is no style guide or Review Process. In general it's lacking the usual oversight you would have in a \*\*searchable\*\* code project as well as the capability to run tests on the system and databases. git is not really used at all. Documentation is hardly maintainedEverything is being worked on in the Visual Studio UI, which is buggy at best and simply crashing at worst (around twice per day).I work in a 2-person team and our Job it is to manage the SSIS ETL, Tabular Model and all PowerBI Reports throughout the company. The two of us are the entire reporting team.I replaced a long-time employee that has been in the company for around 15 years and didn't know any code and left minimal documentation. Generally my colleague (data scientist) does documentation only in his personal notebook which he shares sporadically on request.Since my start I introduced JIRA for our processes with a clear task board (it was a mess before) and bi-weekly sprints. Also a Wiki which I filled with hundreds of pages by now. I am currently introducing another tool, so at least we don't have to use buggy VS to manage the tabular model and can use git there as well.I am transforming all our PBI reports into .pbip files, so we can work with git there, too (We have like 100 reports).Also, I built an entire prod Airflow Environment on an on-prem Windows server to be able to query APIs (not possible in SSIS) and run some basic statistical analysis (""AI-capabilities""). The Airflow repo is fully tested, has Exception Handling, feature and hotfix branches, dev, prod etc. and can be used locally as well as on remote.But I am the only one currently maintaining it. My colleague does not want to change to Airflow, because ""the other one is working"". Fact is, I am losing a lot of time managing SSIS in VS while getting a lower quality system.Plus, if we ever want to hire an additional colleague, he will probably face the same issues as I do (no docs, massive monolith, no search function, etc.) and will probably not get a good hire.My boss is non-technical, so he is not of much help. We are also not in IT, so every time the SQL Server bugs, we need to run to the IT department to fix our ETL Job, which can take days.So, how can I convince my colleague to eventually switch to Airflow?It doesn't need to be today, but I want this to be a committed long term goal.Writing this, I feel I have committed so much to this company already and would really like to give them a chance (preference of industry and location)Thank you all for reading, maybe you have some insight how to handle this. I would rather not quit on this, but might be my only option.",43,0.89,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oj1itv/how_to_convince_a_switch_from_ssis_to_python/,2025-10-29 11:04:22,2025-11-04 01:39:57

1ombfgf,Need help with Redshift ETL tools,div192,dataengineering,Dev team set up AWS Glue for all our Redshift pipelines. It works but our analysts are not happy with this setup because they are dependent on devs for all data points.Glue doesn't work for anyone who isnt good at PySpark. Our analysts know SQL but they can't do things themselves and are bottlenecked by the dev team. We are looking for Redshit ETL tool setup that's like Glue but is low code enough for our BI team to not be blocked frequently. We also don't want to manage servers. And again writing Spark code just to manage new data source would also be pointless.How do you suggest we address this?

Essentially, I will have the following entity:* student* class* teacher* paymentAnd while designing this new database, aside from migration, I'm currently planning ahead on implementing design choices that will help me with my work, some of them are currently this:* track payments (installment/renewal, if installment, how much left, etc)* attendance (to track whether or not the student skipped the class, more on that below)Basically, my company's course model is session based, so students paid some amount of sessions, and they will attend the class based on this sessions balance, so to speak. I came up with a two ideas for this attendance tracking:* since they are on fixed schedule, only lists out when they took a leave (so it wouldn't be counted on the number of sessions they used)* make an explicit attendance entity.I get quite overwhelmed with the rabbit hole of trying to make the db perfect from the start.

Despite enabling statistics and applying query-specific rewrites, I'm seeing ClickHouse perform 4-10x slower than Exasol depending on scale factor. If you've tuned ClickHouse for TPC-H-style workloads at these scales on r5d.\* instances (or similar) and can share concrete settings, join rewrites, or schema choices that move the needle on **Q04/Q08/Q09/Q18/Q19/Q21** in particular, I'd appreciate detailed pointers.Specifically, I'm looking for advice on:**1. Join strategy and memory*** Recommended settings for large, many-to-many joins on TPC-H shapes (e.g., guidance on `join_algorithm` choices and thresholds for spilling vs in-memory)* Practical values for `max_bytes_in_join`, `max_rows_in_join`, `max_bytes_before_external_*` to reduce spill/regressions on Q04/Q18/Q19/Q21* Whether using grace hash or partial/merge join strategies is advisable on SF30+ when relations don't fit comfortably in RAM**2. Optimizer + statistics*** Which statistics materially influence join reordering and predicate pushdown for TPC-H-like SQL (and how to scope them: which tables/columns, histograms, sampling granularity)* Any caveats where cost-based changes often harm (Q04/Q14 patterns), and how to constrain the optimizer to avoid those plans**3. Query-level idioms*** Preferred ClickHouse-native patterns for EXISTS/NOT EXISTS (especially Q21) that avoid full scans/aggregations while keeping memory under control* When to prefer IN/SEMI/ANTI joins vs INNER/LEFT; reliable anti-join idioms that plan well in 25.9* Safe uses of PREWHERE, `optimize_move_to_prewhere`, and read-in-order for these queries**4. Table design details that actually matter here*** Any proven primary key / partitioning / LowCardinality patterns for TPC-H `lineitem`/`orders`/`part*` tables that the optimizer benefits from in 25.9**So far I've been getting the following results****Test environment*** **Systems under test:** Exasol 2025.1.0 and ClickHouse 25.9.4.58* **Hardware:** AWS r5d.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 124 GB RAM, eu-west-1)* **Methodology:** One warmup, 7 measured runs, reporting medians* **Data:** Generated with dbgen, CSV input**Full reports*** **SF1:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (baseline, stats-enabled, query-tuned) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\_vs\_ch\_1g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_1g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)* **SF10:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (same three variants) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\_vs\_ch\_10g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_10g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)* **SF30:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (same three variants) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\_vs\_ch\_30g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_30g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)**Headline results (medians; lower is better)*** **SF1 system medians:** Exasol 19.9ms; ClickHouse 86.2ms; ClickHouse\_stat 89.4ms; ClickHouse\_tuned 91.8ms* **SF10 system medians:** Exasol 63.6ms; ClickHouse\_stat 462.1ms; ClickHouse 540.7ms; ClickHouse\_tuned 553.0ms* **SF30 system medians:** Exasol 165.9ms; ClickHouse 1608.8ms; ClickHouse\_tuned 1615.2ms; ClickHouse\_stat 1659.3ms**Where query tuning helped****Q21** (the slowest for ClickHouse in my baseline):* SF1: 552.6ms -> 289.2ms (tuned); Exasol 22.5ms* SF10: 6315.8ms -> 3001.6ms (tuned); Exasol 106.7ms* SF30: 20869.6ms -> 9568.8ms (tuned); Exasol 261.9ms**Where statistics helped (notably on some joins)****Q08:*** SF1: 146.2ms (baseline) -> 88.4ms (stats); Exasol 17.6ms* SF10: 1629.4ms -> 353.7ms; Exasol 30.7ms* SF30: 5646.5ms -> 1113.6ms; Exasol 60.7ms**Q09** also improved with statistics at SF10/SF30, but remains well above Exasol.**Where tuning/statistics hurt or didn't help*** **Q04:** tuning made it much slower - SF10 411.7ms -> 1179.4ms; SF30 1410.4ms -> 4707.0ms* **Q18:** tuning regressed - SF10 719.7ms -> 1941.1ms; SF30 2556.2ms -> 6865.3ms* **Q19:** tuning regressed - SF10 547.8ms -> 1362.1ms; SF30 1618.7ms -> 3895.4ms* **Q20:** tuning regressed - SF10 114.0ms -> 335.4ms; SF30 217.2ms -> 847.9ms* **Q21** with statistics alone barely moved vs baseline (still multi-second to multi-tens-of-seconds at SF10/SF30)**Queries near parity or ClickHouse wins**Q15/Q16/Q20 occasionally approach parity or win by a small margin depending on scale/variant, but they don't change overall standings.

1on8j79,Polyglot Persistence or not Polyglot Persintence?,Sweaty-Act-2532,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I’m currently doing an academic–industry internship where I’m researching polyglot persistence, the idea that instead of forcing all data into one system, you use multiple specialized databases, each for what it does best.For example, in my setup:PostgreSQL → structured, relational geospatial dataMongoDB → unstructured, media-rich documents (images, JSON metadata, etc.)DuckDB → local analytics and fast querying on combined or exported datasetsFrom what I’ve read in literature reviews and technical articles, polyglot persistence is seen as a best practice for scalable and specialized architectures. Many papers argue that hybrid systems allow you to leverage the strengths of each database without constantly migrating or overloading one system.However, when I read Reddit threads, GitHub discussions, and YouTube comments, most developers and data engineers seem to say the opposite, they prefer sticking to one single database (usually PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of maintaining several.So my question is:**Why is there such a big gap between the theoretical or architectural support for polyglot persistence and the real-world preference for a single database system?**Is it mostly about:Maintenance and operational overhead (backups, replication, updates, etc.)?, Developer team size and skill sets?, Tooling and integration complexity?, Query performance or data consistency concerns?, Or simply because “good enough” is more practical than “perfectly optimized”?**Would love to hear from those who’ve tried polyglot setups or decided against them, especially in projects that mix structured, unstructured, and analytical data.

I am using data generators to Lazy load the data with pandas wrangler and turn it into a tensor. I have already parallelized my lazy loads, but I’m running into a couple of roadblocks that I was hoping the community might have answers to. 1. What is the most efficient/standard way to lazy load data from an s3 parquet table? I’ve been iterating by partition (utc date + Rand partition key) but it’s a pretty slow response time (roughly 15 second round trip per partition). 2. My features and targets are in separate s3 tables right now. Is there an efficient way to join them at load or should I set up an upstream spark job to join the feature and target set to a single bucket and work from there? My intuition is that the load and x-process of handling that join for a disjoint set will be completely inefficient, but it would be a large data duplication if I have to maintain an entire separate table just to have features and targets combined in one parquet file.

Then, the user could ask natural language questions about the CRM data using the Claude AI desktop app or a similar tool, via a connection to the DuckDB MCP server. These REST APIs require the user to be connected (using a session cookie or, in some cases, an API token) to the service and make potentially 1,000 to 100,000 API calls to retrieve all the necessary details. To keep the data current, an automated scheduler is necessary. * I've built a Go program that performs the complete ETL and tested it, packaging it as a macOS application; however, maintaining database changes manually is complicated. I've reviewed various Go ORM packages that could add significant complexity to this project. * I've built a Python DLT library-based ETL script that does a better job normalizing the JSON objects into database tables, but I haven't found a way to package it yet into a standalone macOS app. * I've built several Chrome extensions that can extract data and save it as CSV or JSON files, but I haven't figured out how to write DuckDB files directly from Chrome.

As a result, I find myself in a generic “data engineer” category, and my package is assessed accordingly, even though data engineering is only a part of my job and my profile is much broader than that.Before, when I was at my small company, my package evolved comfortably each year as I expanded my skills and we relied less and less on external subcontractors to manage the data aspects that I did not master well. Now, even though I continue to improve my skills and expertise, I find myself stuck with a fixed package because my new company is unaware of the breadth of my expertise...Specifically, on my local industrial site, I do the following:* Manage all the data ingestion pipeline (cleaning, transformation, uploading to the database, management of feedback loops, automatic alerts, etc.)* Manage a very large Postgresql database (maintenance, backup, upgrades, performance optimization, etc.) with multiple schema and broad variaty of data embedded* Create new database structures (new schemas, tables, functions, etc.)* Build custom data exploitation platforms and implement various business visualisations* Use data for modelling/prediction with machine learning techniques* Manage our cloud services (access, upgrades, costs, etc.) and the cloud architectures required for data pipelines, database, BI,… (on AWS: EC2, lambda, SQS, RDS, dynamoDB, Sagemaker, Quicksight,…)I added these functions over the years. I was originally hired to do just ""data analysis"" and industrial statistics (I'm basically a statistician and I have 25 years of experience in the industry), but I'm quite good at teaching myself new things. For example, I am able to read documentation and several books on a subject, practice, correct my errors and then apply this new knowledge in my work.

1oif45q,Migrating from Spreadsheets to PostgreSQL,oihv,dataengineering,"Hello everyone, I'm doing a part time as a customer service for an online class. I basically manage the students, their related informations, sessions bought, etc. Also relates it to the class that they are enrolled in. At the moment, all this information is stored in a monolithic sheets (well I did divide atleast the student data and the class, connect them by id).But, I'm a CS student, and I just studied dbms last semester, this whole premise sounds like a perfect case to implement what I learn and design a relational database!So, I'm here to crosscheck my plan. I plan this with gpt.. btw, because I can't afford to spend too much time working on this side project, and I'm not going to be paid for this extra work either, but then I believe this will help me a ton at my work, and I will also learn a bunch after designing the schema and seeing in real time how the database grows.So the plan is use a local instance of postgreSQL with a frontend like NocoDB for spreadsheets like interface. So then I have the fallback of using NocoDB to edit my data, or when I can, and I will try to, always use SQL, or atleast make my own interface to manage the data.Here's some considerations why I should move to this approach:1. The monolithic sheets, one spreadsheets have too much column (phone number, name, classes bought, class id, classes left, last class date, note, complains, (sales related data like age, gender, city, learning objective). And just yesterday, I had a call with my manager, and she says that I should also includes payment information, and 2 types of complains, and I was staring at the long list of the data in the spreadsheets..2. I have a pain point of syncing two different sheets. So my company uses other service of spreadsheets (not google) and there is coworker that can't access this site from their country. So, I, again, need to update both of this spreadsheet, and the issue is my company have trust issue with google, so I would also need to filter some data before putting it into the google spreadsheet, from the company one. Too much hassle.What I hope to achievr from migrating to sql, is that I can just sync them both to my local instance of SQL instead of from one to the other.cons of this approach (that i know of):This infrastructure will then depends on me, and I think I would need a no-code solution in the future if there will be other coworker in my position. Other approach being considered: Just refactore the sheets that mimics relational db (students, classes, enrolls_in, teaches_in, payment, complains)But then having to filter and sync across the other sheets will still be an issue.I've read a post somewhere about a teacher that tried to do this kind of thing, basically a student management system. And then it just became a burden for him, needing him to maintain an ecosystem without being paid for it.But from what I see, this approach seems need little maintenance and effort to keep up, so only the initial setup will be hard. But feel free to prove me wrong!That's about it, I hope you all can give me insights whether or not this journey I'm about to take will be fruitful.

I built a Go ETL program that pulls data from Oracle and pushes it to Postgres every hour (currently moving about 1k rows per pull). My next step was to use dbt to build out proper dimensions and new fact tables.**Why the Migration?**The company moved their on-premise Oracle database to Azure, which has tanked our Power BI and Excel report performance. On top of that, the database account they gave us for reporting doesn't have access to materialized views, can't create indexes, or schedule anything. We're basically locked into querying views-on-top-of-views with no optimization options.**Where I'm Stuck**I've hit a few walls that are keeping me from moving forward:1. **Development environment**: The dbt plugin is deprecated in IntelliJ, and the VS Code version is pretty rough. SqlMesh doesn't really solve this either.

This makes incremental syncing really difficult. I'm not sure how to handle this cleanly.3. **Dimension table design**: Since I'm filtering to only active jobs to keep row volume down, my dimension tables grow and shrink. That means I have to truncate them on each run instead of maintaining a proper slowly changing dimension. I know it's not ideal, but I'm not sure what the better approach would be here.Your advice would be appreicated.

1ojz8gn,How to develop Fabric notebooks interactively in local repo (Azure DevOPs + VS Code)?,muskagap2,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, I have a question regarding integration of Azure DevOps and VS Code for data engineering in Fabric.Say, I created notebook in the Fabric workspace and then synced to git (Azure DevOps). In Azure DevOps I go to Clone -> Open VS Code to develop notebook locally in VS Code. Now, all notebooks in Fabric and repo are stored as .py files. Normally, developers often prefer working interactively in `.ipynb` (Jupyter/VS Code), not in .py.And now I don't really know how to handle this scenario. In VS Code in Explorer pane I see all the Fabric items, including notebooks. I would like to develop this notebook which i see in the repo. However, I don't know I how to convert .py to .ipynb to locally develop my notebook. And after that how to convert .ipynb back to .py to push it to repo. I don't want to keep .ipynb and .py in remote repo. I just need the update, final .py version in repo. I can't right-click on .py file in repo and switch to .ipynb somehow. I can't do anyhting.So the **best-practice workflow** for me (and I guess for other data engineers) is:Work interactively in `.ipynb` → convert/sync to `.py` → commit `.py` to Git.I read that some use jupytext library:`jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:light notebooks/my_notebook.py`but don't know if it's the common practice.

1ojcrji,Need advice on choosing a new title for my role,dRuEFFECT,dataengineering,"Principal Data Architect - this is the title my director and I originally threw out there, but I'd like some opinions from any of you. I've heard architect is a dying title and don't want to back myself into a corner for future opportunities. We also floated Principal BI Engineer or Principal Data Engineer, but I hardly feel that implementing Stitch and Fivetran for ELT justifies a data engineer title and don't feel my background would line up with that for future opportunities. It may be a moot point if I ever try going for a Director of Analytics role in the future, but not sure if that will ever happen as I've never had direct reports and don't like office politics. I do enjoy being an individual contributor, data governance, and working directly with stakeholders to solve their unique needs on data and reporting. Just trying to better understand what I should call myself, what I should focus on, and where I should try to go to next.Background and context below.I have 14 years experience behind me, with previous roles as Reporting Analyst, Senior Pricing Analyst, Business Analytics Manager, and currently Senior Data Analytics Manager. With leadership and personnel changes in my current company and team, after 3 years of being here my responsibilities have shifted and leadership is open to changing my title, but I'm not sure what direction I should take it.Back in college I set out to be a Mechanical Engineer; I loved physics, but was failing Calc 2 and panicked and regrettably changed my major to their Business program. When I started my career, I took to Excel and VBA macros naturally because my physics brain just likes to build things. Then someone taught me the first 3 lines of SQL and everything took off from there.In my former role as Business Analytics Manager I was an analytics team of 1 for 4 years where I rebuilt everything from the ground. Implemented Stitch for ELT, built standardized data models with materialized views in Redshift, and built dashboards in Periscope (R.I.P.).I got burnt out as a team of 1 and moved to my current company so I can be a part of a larger team, at first I was hired into the Marketing Department just focusing on standardizing data models and reporting under Marketing, but soon after started supporting Finance and Merchandising as well. We had a Senior Data Architect I worked closely with, as well as a Data Scientist; both of these individuals left and were never backfilled so I'm back to where I started managing all of it, although we've dropped all projects the data scientist was running. I now fall under IT instead of Marketing, and I report to a Director of Analytics who reports to the CTO. We also have 3 offshore analyst resources for dashboard building and ad hoc requests, but they primarily focus on website analytics with GA4.I'm currently in the process of onboarding Fivetran for the bulk of our data going into BigQuery, and we just signed on with Tableau to consolidate dashboards and various spreadsheets. I will be rebuilding views to utilize the new data pipelines and rebuilding existing dashboards, much like my last company.What I love most about my work is writing SQL, building complex but clean views to normalize/standardize data to make it intuitive for downstream reporting and dashboard building. I loved building dashboards in Periscope because it was 100% SQL driven, most other BI tools I've found limiting by comparison. I know some python, but working in that environment doesn't come naturally to me and I'm way more comfortable writing everything directly in SQL, building dynamic dashboards, and piping my data into spreadsheets in a format the stakeholders like.I've never truly considered myself an 'analyst' as I don't feel comfortable providing analysis and recommendations, my brain thinks of a thousand different variables as to why that assumption could be misleading. Instead, I like working with the people asking the questions and understanding the nuances of the data being asked about in order to write targeted queries, and let those subject matter experts derive their own conclusions. And while I've always been intrigued by the deeper complexities of data engineering functions and capabilities, there are an endless number of tools and platforms out there that I haven't been exposed to and know little about so I'd feel like a fraud trying to call myself an engineer. At the end of the day I work in data with a mechanical engineering brain rather than a traditional software engineering type, and still struggle to understand what path I should be taking in the future.",1,0.57,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ojcrji/need_advice_on_choosing_a_new_title_for_my_role/,2025-10-29 18:39:31,2025-11-04 01:39:57

All on the starter subscription.Then, we sign up and pay, but who would know, EU support is now removed from the entry monthly plan. So EU data residency is now a paid extra feature.We are told that EU data residency is for annual plans only, bit annoyed, but fair enough, so i head over to their pricing page to see the entry subscription in an annual plan. I contact them to proceed with this, and guess what, it is gone, just like that! And it is gone, despite (at this point) still being listed on their pricing page!Ok, so after much back & forth, we are allowed to get the entry plan in annual (for an extra premium of course, gotta pay up). So now we finally have EU data residency, but now, all of a sudden the one important feature we were presented by their sales team is gone.We already signed up now to the annual plan to get EU, so bit in the shit you can say, but I contact them, and 20 emails later we can get the dynamic configuration of destinations, if we upgrade to a new and more expensive plan.And to put it into context, starter annual is 11'800 USD for 7m events a month, so it is not like it is cheap in any way. God knows what we will end up paying in a few weeks or months from now, after having to constantly pay up for included features being moved to more expensive plans.Is segment, fivetran and the other ones equally as shit and eager with their enshittification?

Also, we're working on AWS.* I'm a Data Analyst with a couple years of experience: this is just to say I have a good base in programming and a general knowledge in the data field.* I already enrollled in Coursera Plus and Udemy Premium for a year using this budget, but I still have some money left to spend.That said, I'm looking for good places on which to spend this money. The cost of Udacity's ""Data Engineering with AWS"" (the 1 year individual course) is virtually the same amount of money I have left to spend. But the thing is, even though it's not my money, I want to make it worth it. Like, I personally think it's very expensive, so I don't want to spend it on something that won't add value to my career. I've read several comments on other posts here saying this nanodegree is sometimes outdated, the mentor's knowledge being very limited to the course's subject etc.So, in case there's someone there who did this course recently, I wish you could share some opinions on it. Other suggestions are also welcome, on the condition they fit the budget of $ 600 - $ 700, but having in mind I speak from Brazil, so in situ suggestions are harder to actually consider. Also, though I'm aiming at DE training because of the immediate context I explained above, suggestions of courses in related fields (like, if you think I should purchase a Machine Learning course) are also welcome.

1ol7lta,Personal Project feedback: Lightweight local tool for data validation and transformation,RevolutionaryTop4427,dataengineering,"Hello everyone,I’m looking for feedback from this community and other data engineers on a small personal project I just built.At this stage, it’s a lightweight, local-first tool to validate and transform CSV/Parquet datasets using a simple registry-driven approach (YAML). You define file patterns, validation rules, and transformations in the registries, and the tool:* Matches input files to patterns defined in the registry* Runs validators (e.g., required columns, null checks, value ranges, hierarchy checks)* Applies ordered transformations (e.g., strip whitespace, case conversions)* Writes reports only when validations fail or transforms error out* Saves compliant or transformed files to the output directory* Generate report with failed validations* Give the user maximum freedom to manage and configure his own validators and trasformerThe process is run by the [main.py](http://main.py) where the users can define any number of steps of Validation and trasformation at his preference. The main idea is not only validate but provide something similar to a well structured template where is more difficult for the users to create a a data cleaning process with a messy code (i have seen tons of them). The tool should be of interest to anyone who receives data from third parties on a recurring basis and needs a quick way to pinpoint where files are non-compliant with the expected process.I am not the best of programmers but with your feedback i can probably get better.What do you think about the overall architecture? is it well structured? probably i should manage in a better way the settings.What do you think of this idea?

For reference, I am the only data guy in my whole company and there is nobody to help me. So, I work for a small company and it is non-profit. I have been given this task to build a dynamic dashboard. The dynamic dashboard must be able to track grants, and also provide demographic information. For instance, say we have a grant called ‘grantX’ worth of 50,000$. Using this 50,000 the company promised to provide medical screening for 10 houseless people. Of these, 50,000 the company used 10,000 to pay salaries and 5000 for gas, and other miscellaneous things, and the rest 35,000 to screen the houseless individuals. The dynamic dashboard should show this information. Mind you, there are a lot of grants and the data they collect for each grant is different. For example they collect name, age of the person served for one grant but they only get initials for the second grant. The company does not have a database and only uses office 365 environment. And most of the data is in sharepoint lists or excel spreadsheets. And the grant files are located in a dropbox. I am not sure how to work on this.

1oj5ilf,The reality is different – From JSON/XML to relational DB automatically,Exact_Cherry_9137,dataengineering,"I would like to share a story about my current experience and the difficulties I am encountering—or rather, about how my expectations are different from reality.﻿I am a data engineer who has been working in the field of data processing for 25 years now. I believe I have a certain familiarity with these topics, and I have noticed the lack of some tools that would have saved me a lot of time.﻿And that’s how I created a tool (but that’s not the point) that essentially, by taking JSON or XML as input, automatically transforms them into a relational database. It also adapts automatically to changes, always preserving backward compatibility with previously loaded data.﻿At the moment, the tool works with databases like PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Oracle. In the future, I hope to support more (but actually, it could work for all databases, considering that one of these three could be used as a data source after running the tool).﻿Let me get to the point: in my mind, I thought this tool could be a breakthrough, and a similar product (which I won’t mention here to avoid giving it promotion) actually received an award from Snowflake in 2025 because it was considered very innovative. Basically, that tool does much of what mine does, but mine still has some better features.﻿Nowadays, JSON data is everywhere, and that has been the “fuel” that kept me going while developing it.A bit against the trend, my tool does not use AI—maybe this is penalizing it, but I want to be genuine and not hide behind this topic just to get more attention. It is also very respectful of privacy, making it suitable for those dealing with personal or sensitive data (basically, part of the process runs on the customer’s premises, and the result can be sent out to get the final product ready to be executed on their own database).﻿The ultimate idea is to create a SaaS so that anyone who needs it can access the tool. At the moment, however, I don't have the financial resources to cover the costs of productization, legal fees, patents, and all the necessary expenses. That’s why I thought about offering myself as a consultant providing the transformation service, so that once I receive the input data, clients can start viewing their information in a relational database formatThe difficulties I am facing are surprising me. There are people who consider themselves experts and say that this tool doesn't make sense, preferring to write code themselves to extract the necessary information by reading the data directly from JSON—using, in my opinion, syntaxes that are not easy even for those who know only SQL.﻿I am now wondering if there truly are people out there with expert knowledge of these topics (which are definitely niche), because I believe that not having to write a single line of code, being able to get a relational database ready for querying with simple queries, tables that are automatically linked in the same way (parent/child fields), and being able to create reports and dashboards in just a few minutes, is truly an added value that today can be found in only a few tools.﻿I’ll conclude by saying that the estimated minimum ROI, in terms of time—and therefore money—saved for a developer is at least 10x.I am so confident in my solution that I would also love to hear the opinion of those who face this type of situation daily.Thank you to everyone who has read this post and is willing to share their thoughts.",0,0.5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oj5ilf/the_reality_is_different_from_jsonxml_to/,2025-10-29 14:08:13,2025-11-04 01:39:57

After all there's no reason to change it now or ever.Won't unit tests be overkill for this?What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases?

This is the essence of what he said:""Courses are useless. You'll be stuck in an endless hell and waste your time. Instead, directly start developing and learn what you need on the way.For example, instead of doing a web developement course, decide on building some website, then ask ChatGPT how to do it. ChatGPT is the best learning resource right now. Note down the steps and watch YouTube videos to learn just what's required for the development of the website, for each step. Keep developing and you'll learn along the way. Similarly, instead of doing a DSA course, just start solving LeetCode and learn as you do. You can look for explanatory videos for specific problems along the way.""I find that to be an interesting perspective. I would like to know what others think about it.

Been two weeks and my wrists already feel a lot less strained during long coding sessions. My posture is getting better and the compact 60% design also frees up desk space which is nice when I am juggling multiple devices. The layout took a few days to click especially the right side and some Fn combos but now it feels pretty natural. Typing is quiet, smooth and the little thumb keys are actually useful (again took some getting used to). Wireless mostly works but if I type really fast, sometimes it stumbles and makes me backspace a few times. I also miss a proper battery indicator but I guess its not that bad a thing. Beyond comfort, the customization options are a real productivity boost. I’ve been using Vial to set up extra layers and remap keys.

1ojc4as,Is there any benefits to limiting the recourses you learn from?,Defiant-Ad588,learnprogramming,"So I asked myself this question when I first watched a podcast with John Carmack. He was explaining how he learned programming from the very small selection of books his library offered, but mostly from NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS. On top of that he was programming games in assembly!When it comes to problem sets, I find that I learn best without the help of ai. But I ask this question in regards to googling as well because this is something I'm very indecisive about. I'll give an example, the other day I was working on a CS50 problem set and I ended up spending too much time trying to make over complicated for loops to compare each char in an array of strings. Then, when I finally googled it, I found out there was a function in a library that did it for me. Maybe this isn't the best anecdote because I could've read the documentation on the library before hand, but I hope you get my point. I also think ai is so much more looked down upon than googling, but I think both can reinforce the same bad habits, I.e when things get difficult you end up relying on something else. I understand that it wasn't the limited resources that made John Carmack into John Carmack. However, I personally think a scarcity in resources indirectly makes you remember things better. ""Why would I need to remember the syntax differences in declaring a function in JS vs Python if the answers are a couple clicks away."" I'm genuinely curious to hear what your opinions are on this. What would be ways to balance this?

I really enjoyed my work in those classes, though at times I felt exhausted and stupid.Now I work as an Insurance Aide and most of my week consists of scripting/documentation somehow. I am now responsible for building an MS Access Reporting tool and using Excel, SQL, and VBA, and documenting our existing codebase for our ""applications"".While I enjoy my work, I recognize that working with VBA isn't what programming looks like in the typical sense of the word. I don't record macros, but there's a lot of abstraction in VBA and I feel like it's quite different from in depth programming work people do in python and other languages. I'm not dealing with C pointers, or data storage problems, or even serious optimization issues. I feel like I might like ""scripting"" instead of ""programming"", but I'm not even sure how to define the difference between the two, apart from how programming involves more technical memory allocation while ""scripting"" is the surface level ""do this do that"" of programming.

1olb0nm,Doing it well is far more important than doing it fast,Ok-Process-2187,cscareerquestions,"After about 5+ years in this field, I've realized that it's always better to prefer polish over speed.The reason is simple. Unless you work in an extremely isolated silo, you are not entirely responsible for your speed.When people review your code you don't get bonus points for how quickly you wrote it.However, if there are issues with your code, for that you are entirely responsible.If there's some edge case that you didn't properly check, you're responsible for that. If you missed some step in preparing your PR, you're responsible for that. If your code is difficult for others to read, you're responsible for that.Managers will always want you to be fast but speed is a shared responsibility.You cannot be fast if the code base you inherited is a mess. You cannot be fast if the company keeps changing direction. You cannot be fast if your work is rate limited by other people or systems.I've found this applies across orgs of all levels.In big orgs you'll be slowed down by more processes and structure.In small orgs the lack of process and structure increases the potential for mistakes and misunderstandings.Without really knowing the ins and outs of what someone is working on, it's hard to say if they're actually slow but a mistake is a mistake. Now and forever. When it comes time for performance reviews, no one will have the context to know if the time you spent was reasonable but if someone is looking to get rid of you, they will form a collage of every single wrong-doing you committed since the day you joined.So remember, slow down and try to consistently get everything right on the first try.",232,0.87,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1olb0nm/doing_it_well_is_far_more_important_than_doing_it/,2025-11-01 00:46:53,2025-11-04 01:40:00

On top of this, I need to help ppl with their coding, like PR review, daily discussions, and so on. And then I also get into Production calls, reviewing production outcomes, why our code isn't performing well or whatever, etc. I fucking hate all of this. It might sound easy due to not coding, but i need to stretch my brain in a way that just gets me very overwhelmed, while also being incredibly BORED.I just never imagined that, I would be coding less, while being 5x more stressed than ever. A lot of the requirement documents I review are poorly written, so I have to keep scheduling meetings / following up with ppl to ask questions.. my day sometimes is just meetings ALL day, with almost no time to eat a damn meal. And then I need time to do code review so my team members' aren't blocked! So oftentimes, I do the code review at like 7pm after dinner or early in the morning the next day. Shit's fucked. Anyway, just a dumb rant I guess. It just makes me sad that, this is ultimately where a SWE goes.

So they hired me on as CTO and I was thrilled for the upgrade at the time. But I am looking for a change of pace and want to work on new challenges in a different space altogether. I had a few interviews earlier this year and they all mentioned that they liked my resume but were worried that my actual dev skills would be diminished, as they assume because of my C-suite title that I must not be doing much actual dev work. I explained that if anything, my skills have gotten sharper, as I am still the only dev working here and have to handle the bulk of the IT issues in addition to my dev and CTO responsibilities.

They labelled it as a senior role (despite me being a new grad) and emphasized using tools like Cursor and Chat as part of the workflow, which the company paid for. This was my first post-grad job.Got pulled aside this morning and was told ""today's your last day here,"" out of nowhere. The reasoning they gave was along the lines of not meeting ""velocity,"" despite no expectations or timelines explicitly being put into place. It was a solo project with little guidance, and I required access to tools I wasn't initially provided and had to ask for, which definitely slowed the pace. There were no warnings and no PIP. They inferred that I wasn't meeting the expectations for the position and the pay.Was told to leave immediately. It was right after I completed my first major deliverable. I was genuinely shocked, as at the beginning my boss was very pleased with my work and liked to show it off; I'd worked extra on nights and weekends in response to my boss's messages to get the project done whilst also tackling my online masters. There seemed to be conflicting expectations between moving fast vs initial code quality between two of my authorities, and I often had difficulty getting timely support or permissions from the dev team.I'd love some advice moving forwards. I just relocated across the country for this job and have pretty limited savings and a year's lease to pay. The company offered a release agreement with small severance.I'm also not the first person to be let go from this role; another person was let go under a month ago for similar vague reasoning he also wasn't aware of.

I started a new job in January at a large company with 18 days of PTO, which I thought was nice considering I'm used to ""unlimited"" which left me constantly worried about what was ok to take.For the first few months, I didn't request any time as I know it can be considered unprofessional when you're new. I took a single day because I had to move for the job, which my manager didn't seem happy about, but it was a big move from a place I had lived in for a long time and I made it clear I was going to need to before I was even offered the job.Just for some background, over the year my manager's feedback has been very negative. Whenever I get this negative feedback I put in extra effort to address it, and at first I figured he was just a bit more demanding than most. But as I'm now grinding over the weekends and occasionally pulling all-nighters, I see that my manager is just looking for anything to critique and ignoring everything else. It's not like I'm just not doing the work or half-assing it, in fact I've gone above and beyond to meet every critique, no matter how minor, and I've tried to pull out all the stops on clever solutions and building out important features. I've even had other coworkers remark at the amount I've accomplished and the quality of the results, so I don't think it's just in my head. My team is also sort of ""R&D"" for a large company, so our results are important, but we don't have rush times or fast-paced deadlines.But whenever I've put in PTO requests, he has denied them, saying I'm too behind to be taking extra time off. I put in the requests at least 2 months in advance, and I'm not requesting much -- when I had ""unlimited"" PTO I never took more than 5 days total in a year so I'm not looking to take off an entire week or anything. Honestly I just want to use the time since it goes away at the end of the year and doesn't pay out or roll over. He and other members of my team seem to take long vacations all the time though, so I'm not sure why it's just me that can't take any days of PTO.Everyone I've talked to so far has basically said that it's ultimately my manager's discretion, which surprised me as I thought dedicated PTO totals meant there was some sort of legal requirement that you be allowed to use them. I guess lesson learned now.Any advice though? Simply leaving for another job is difficult considering it's not even been a year, and my previous roles have been 1-2 years as well so I was looking to have a long stint at one place to make it not look so bad.

In terms of metrics it is pretty garbage, it can only search about 10k positions per second while a ""good"" chess engine can do several million per second easily.I don't know how to make something that isn't some random toy project, currently all my side projects are games where being a toy project is part of the point and there's only 1 class project that isn't a game and it probably doesn't count either as it has nothing in the way of metrics either. I don't really have motivation to try to make a banking website or something like that, because I know it isn't real so it will never have any real purpose and companies will see it as not fulfilling its purpose so it doesn't count?

Where should I go from here?,Puzzleheaded-Job-192,cscareerquestions,"I graduated in 2023 and spent a grueling 8 months job hunting before I landed my current position as a software engineer at a FAANG company. I've been there ~1.5 years now, and at the beginning, I really enjoyed it. Everyone on my team is kind, my manager is very supportive, and while WLB was rough, I thought I could manage it. I could care less about the work that I'm doing too, but that's probably the case for most people anyway. In the beginning, I was performing well and received a promotion at the 1 year mark, but since then, it feels like my performance has quickly gone downhill. I've had several meetings with my manager discussing my potential and how to improve my metrics. Received advice from senior eng on how to work faster. Watched projects get passed to new hires since I'm no longer reliable. I completely agree with the negative feedback I've received. I wouldn't even be surprised if I get fired during my next performance review.And it's not that the work's become too difficult after the promotion either (I'm doing similar work as before). It's just that everyday I work feels like a little part of me is suffocating. It's gotten so bad that I've been daydreaming about when I worked retail jobs on night shifts during college (legitimately think that was more enjoyable for me than this job). I don't know if I'm just not built for a corporate job. The tight deadlines, horrible WLB, constant comparisons with coworkers, etc. All of it has been causing me so much stress, and my health has gone to hell this year because of it I think. Several days this month, I've just stared at my laptop screen, feeling like I physically could not do any work that day. I'm really frustrated with myself, because I grew up pretty poor and I think, if 12yo me knew I was complaining this much about a job paying me six figures, I'd punch myself in the face. I'm hoping I can get some advice from people who've felt similar:1. Am I just depressed or is my job really not a good fit for me? 2. Do I try to push through this feeling to keep my job or should I start job hunting?3. Should I try to switch career fields if I do look for new employment? 4.

My true passion is travel, and I figured if I studied CS I could get a well paying job and potentially be able to work remotely whilst traveling in the future. But now I’m really second guessing everything considering how poor the job market for CS grads seem to be at the moment. So, am I making a mistake for continuing this path? Should I consider studying something else, or even just drop out again and see where life takes me?

I am the only 'dev' on the team. I don't have a senior, but there are a couple people doing dev works on different teams in the same building. Most of my work has felt like toy projects. I have mainly been responsible for tool development and data processing. Some examples: maintaining and making new tables for our database (there's talk of redesigning the whole db), writing a basic script people run to keep files standardized, porting our data processing scripts to another group's system, making tableaus and designing KPIs for random manager requests, and my latest is modifying one of our main C# programs to accommodate another group (and whatever other changes have built up over time).It all sounds well and good, but my concern is that I don't have any oversight and that everything seems to fall in the toy project category. None of the code I've written has been complicated, and there have been libraries for everything. I don't have a senior to call me an idiot and ask why I did things a certain way - the only metric I have is whether the tool I made works and whether I did it fast enough for people not to ask again. The point of this post is to ask what I should do to mitigate that. What can I do to move into a pure dev role after this (I'm a test engineer and have that workload on top of my dev stuff).

1omcxnn,Stagnancy in my Role,art_dragon,cscareerquestions,"I (32M; Singapore) feel as though I've hit a wall in my current role. I have 7 YoE of Web Development (4 in my current) and I'm not learning the things I want to learn, or seeing progress in terms of promotions and title-growth. The culture has also degraded after the company I joined was merged into another (I joined a bank in end-2021 that collapsed in 2023), and a lot of the original, interesting people I thought I could learn from has left for other companies or moved onto other internal positions.&nbsp;For context, my Project is some back-office data aggregator that ingests data from different sources and exposes it to downstream middle-office and front-office applications via REST API and Elasticsearch. This sounds ok, until you realize that we don't get any credit for the accomplishments of the downstream applications (which Business people can relate to), whilst still taking the heat for when the data is not what they expect it to be (i.e. we effectively just redistribute our upstream data under this new company). My daily work now involves more firefighting rather than technically challenging and inspiring tasks, and my Team Lead and I are the only ones in the Team that handles the firefighting, the rest don't.&nbsp;To be fair to this Project, every year since joining I learnt something technically ""interesting"".> * 1st year (2022) was an introduction to Backend Work and Technologies - learning how to use Mongo and Kotlin, writing proper Unit and E2E Tests (my previous companies didn't mandate tests, relying instead on a QA Dept to ensure correctness).&nbsp;> * 2nd year (2023) was tying all that I've learnt thus far into making a Full-Stack Project from the ground up - creating a Gradle Task for putting the Frontend Client-Side Bundle into the Resources Folder of the Kotlin Project and serving that, using the Quarkus framework instead of http4k, GitLab CICD Pipelines, integrating Sonarqube for both Javascript and Kotlin Source Code, using Kaniko to create a new Application Image and using Helm Charts to configure and run the Application Image onto Openshift. This new Project would have been important, to quote my former Line Manager, had my company not collapsed.&nbsp;> * 3rd year (2024) was trying to replace our former f5 / haproxy certficate-based authentication with OAuth2 / OIDC on a company centralized IDP. Supposedly this was required so that systems from the new company could access systems hosted within the old company's network. I managed to integrate OIDC on our Dev env for our UI, until it was suddenly no longer needed; someone high up pushed for something so that many Projects didn't have to individually change for this. And so many weeks of Dev work went down the drain.&nbsp;>* 4th year (2025) involved shifting our Project to be hosted on Azure Cloud services. For my part, I had to replace our old FTP Servers (we receive data in files and process them in batches) to the Azure-equivalent - Azure Blob Storage connected to an Event Grid which sends Blob Creation Events to our Event Hub, and change the Project Code to listen for those via a Kafka Interface. This should have been interesting to me, but it just felt meh. Probably because the new company had an in-house abstraction layer over the ARM / Bicep Templates via Ansible Roles - I think I would have liked it more if I dealt directly with Azure.&nbsp;There were other tasks in the background that I felt were mildly interesting too - writing code to process large text files in parallel (using nio for the Random Access and Kotlin IO Coroutines) for data analysis being one.&nbsp;I did try to go for a few interviews but I think the main problem is that my experience is not in demand - my Project is primarily written in Kotlin and http4k, and that greatly limits the search because the closest equivalent that is more popular is Java and Spring / Springboot and in this market hiring managers can pick other candidates that have the exact skillset that they are looking for rather than having to settle for candidates with adjacent skills. I used to do Frontend with React, but that was over a year ago since the UI of the project has been descoped. I feel like even if I dedicate time to learning Java and Spring / Springboot, hiring managers would just choose candidates with direct hands-on professional experience instead of experience with side projects, or pick fresh graduates instead. Probably another issue is that I can't recite my experience like how I did above on demand / in real-time - my verbal communication skills are lacking.&nbsp;It just feels very, very difficult motivationally to dedicate free time outside of work to get myself into a better position - like I _really_ don't want to spend even more of my waking time outside of work having to work for something that might not even pay off. I know staying in this role will probably eventually end my career, but it's like, what's the point? The market is horrible and AI is somehow _still_ the reason mass-layoffs are happening even though I see endless chatter on Reddit that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Honestly, it feels like I'm just waiting for the music to stop and get laid off - at least I then have an excuse to take a break.",11,0.8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1omcxnn/stagnancy_in_my_role/,2025-11-02 09:23:58,2025-11-04 01:40:00

The sessions have gone really well. This is a seriously interesting platform and I’m really wanting to ace the next step. My main experience is in .NET + MSSQL + AWS (mainly s3, ddb, lambda, SQS/SNS). This team uses .NET + Postgres + Azure. I’ve used Postgres for simple personal projects, but no complex schemas or data types. The feedback I got from the recruiter before this next stage was that they thought I was an excellent culture fit with appropriate knowledge of .NET, but they mentioned I might not have the depth of knowledge with Azure and Postgres. The recruiter said it’d be best to brush up on these and that “_They will likely ask about your skill sets in those areas and how you would deal with common problems that are encountered in Azure and Postgres_”. I get it, they don’t want an engineer that might struggle adapting to their environment. I am not worried I’d have trouble picking these up, I’m just worried about this next stage of discussion. My issue is that there is *so* much to study in just a couple of days. *What are some common problems in your experience?

I won’t lie, I relied heavily on ai to get my work done for the past year. This sprint I realized that for tasks I consider to be really complex, it’s even faster if I take baby steps and reason through it while using ai to fill any knowledge gaps or bridge my memory. But man… today I watched a senior do in an hour what I couldn’t do in five hours. And it wasn’t even his story, it was mine. He just reasoned through it and based off my explanations actually gave me a working solution to something that was really stressing me out. Like this was a story that our team considered max complexity points wise, but I’m still. Then I heard my manager talking about how I should be doing all my points and each point is like only a certain number of hours and how I should still have hours left over. I’m like, how can I know ahead of time how many hours a task will take me if I find things out mid sprint?And I’m like man… watching people do so effortlessly what takes me ages is honestly kinda painful. Like I almost shed a tear today because I was like “bro this is too much I can’t do this and the deadlines soon…” and I’m honestly tired of feeling stressed and angry over development work. And even if I end up with a working solution, it isn’t “clean”, like it isn’t up to par and my tech lead might just be like “redo this.” I get juniors have a learning curve. I get that. But it’s been a year. I had my old tech lead say 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you at this point” because I did a story incorrectly and he caught it near the end of the sprint. He always said I struggled or asked about simple things and give poor feedback to my manager on how I need to much help often. I can’t remember what’s inside an object and how that object matches to this list with this key blah blah my brain just for some reason cannot reason through it like other people can.It’s gotten to the point where not only am I not taking a portion of the sprint for stories and a portion for whatever else like my manager expects, but I’m working at night, on weekends, I even sometimes would log in on a pto day to ask a question, and I’d often struggle to the point where it would feel like I get nothing doneI just don’t know what’s going on or how to move forward with this. I never wanted to stay a dev, I always wanted to move to the business side, but I’m a dev now so I have to at least do the best I can in this role. I know I won’t stay a dev, but since I’m a dev now, what is going on here? Like, I just don’t understand what’s happening with me?

1oiyzjl,"Made What I’d Consider My First Big Mistake While Working, How Bad Is It?",JtReso,cscareerquestions,"One of my first tasks ever was creating a script that moves folders around when a column of data (let's say C) changes. The manager who gave me the job told me that there was a rule that won't ever be broken at our company. That is column C will always be set to A or B and that we can use that logic to determine where to move folders to. Like an idiot I checked exactly A or B and didn't have any other checks. My manager was let go somewhere down the line and I completely forgot about this script. Not too long ago an office worker complained that they cannot find some of our files from their PC but they can through our site. So it turns out when you set column C to something other than A or B all of our projects that rely on the data still work (because I add a unique identifier file in each that we use to search instead of path thankfully) but internal office workers can't see it directly anymore because they were moved. Someone in leadership made the decision to expand the options for column C. Without my manager here to identify that went against the systems he had us design, they just went with it. So what happens is if a row of data has certain settings and column C is changed to something other than A or B, an automation triggers the script that moves ALL related folders to an unrelated folder (that is not always the same as the last record). One instance was like 10 folders but another was like 10,000 folders. I.T. was able to move things back fairly quickly because we keep a history of movement but one guy was really mad because he thought one of the developers deleted some of our stuff. Dude was essentially yelling at me already when we didn't even fully know the cause yet. I at first didn't think it was related to us but after doing my research and finding the script, I realized it was me specifically so he was kind of right. I told them and fixed it of course. How bad is this? I feel pretty bad because checking just A or B and not having a specific fallback and other checks to make is pretty egregious. I also am not a fan of getting yelled at. I also don't like the idea of defending myself by telling them to wait until we know for sure, and then confirming they were partially right.

What should I do?",Chengue-Morales,cscareerquestions,"I've been working at my company for almost 10 years, and I'm a senior in a role that's a mix of Product Owner and Developer. The thing is, my seniority in this role is more due to my time working in support and consulting, where I worked for 6 years with the product before moving to my current position. I only started programming about 3 years ago, without a degree in the field, and dividing my time with the PO part of the job.I wanted to experience a full-time developer position in a larger scope than my current one, and I started sending out resumes for internal positions. Incredibly, I got an offer for a senior developer position for a completely different product within the same company, in an industry I have zero knowledge of. I applied for other mid-level positions, but this was the first one I received an offer for.The selection process was easy and quick, and I think the people didn't realize that my actual developer experience is quite short. I think they saw I had a senior tier and skipped technical questions about the stack and previous technical experiences, focusing instead on behavior and logic.I know it will sound like imposter syndrome, but sometimes it's not just a syndrome, right? I'm terrified of accepting the position and ending up fired if I can't deliver what they ask for in the first few months. Financially, I should receive about a 30% increase if I accept.Has anyone been in a similar situation or knows of stories of similar situations? I usually learn quickly, but I know that seniority in development isn't earned overnight. I'm even considering scheduling a meeting with the manager to explain the situation and try to align expectations, possibly reducing the seniority/salary initially to reduce the risk of dismissal, but I know that might seem like a red flag to the manager.
