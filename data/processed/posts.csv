I am currently learning Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Once I firmly know GCP, I will then learn Azure.Within my GCP training, I am currently creating OLTP GCP Cloud SQL Instances. It seems like creating Cloud SQL Instances requires a lot of memorization of SQL syntax and conceptual knowledge of SQL. I don't think I have issues with SQL conceptual knowledge. I do have issues with memorizing all of the SQL syntax and granular steps.My questions are this -1. Do data engineers remember all the steps and syntax needed to create Cloud SQL Instances or do they just reference documentation?2. Furthermore, do data engineers just memorize conceptual knowledge of SQL, Python, the terminal, etc. or do you memorize granular syntax and steps too?I assume that you just reference documentation because it seems like a lot of granular steps and syntax to memorize. I also assume that those granular steps and syntax become outdated quickly as programming languages continue to be updated.Thank you for your time. Apologies if my question doesn't make sense.

But the need — a simple, internal way to spin up data environments, turned out to be much more universal. Onyxia is now used by teams in Norway, at the UN, and in the US, among others.At its core, Onyxia is a web app (packaged as a Helm chart) that lets users log in (via OIDC), choose from a service catalog, configure resources (CPU, GPU, Docker image, env vars, launch script…), and deploy to their own K8s namespace.Highlights:- Admin-defined service catalog using Helm charts + `values.schema.json` → Onyxia auto-generates dynamic UI forms.- Native S3 integration with web UI and token-based access. Files uploaded through the browser are instantly usable in services.- Vault-backed secrets injected into running containers as env vars.- One-click links for launching preconfigured setups (widely used for teaching or onboarding).- DuckDB-Wasm file viewer for exploring large parquet/csv/json files directly in-browser.- Full white label theming, colors, logos, layout, even injecting custom JS/CSS.There’s a public instance at [datalab.sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) for French students, teachers, and researchers, running on real compute (including H100 GPUs).If your org is trying to build an internal alternative to Databricks or Workbench-style setups — without vendor lock-in, curious to hear your take.",35,0.89,13,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvpNfVrxBFM,2025-05-21 09:21:39,2025-05-23 01:41:04

Written from scratch to support long-running Spark clusters and newer Spark 3.5/4.x features. Choose this if you need on-demand clusters or Spark Connect server features.Apparently, the Apache team started fresh because the older Kubeflow operator's Go codebase and webhook-heavy design wouldn't fit ASF governance.

I'm assuming this is what teams do that don't have a Dev environment?If I did have a Dev environment, what might the high level process look like? Would it make sense to:- have a Dev branch in GitHub- some sort of overnight sync to clone all target tables we work with to a Dev schema in Snowflake, using a mapping file of some sort - paramaterise all scripts so that when they're merged to Prod (Main) they are looking at the actual target tables, but in Dev they're looking at the the Dev (cloned) tables?

1kouhgg,How do experienced data engineers handle unreliable manual data entry in source systems?,poopdood696969,dataengineering,"I’m a newer data engineer working on a project that connects two datasets—one generated through an old, rigid system that involves a lot of manual input, and another that’s more structured and reliable. The challenge is that the manual data entry is inconsistent enough that I’ve had to resort to fuzzy matching for key joins, because there’s no stable identifier I can rely on.In my case, it’s something like linking a record of a service agreement with corresponding downstream activity, where the source data is often riddled with inconsistent naming, formatting issues, or flat-out typos. I’ve started to notice this isn’t just a one-off problem—manual data entry seems to be a recurring source of pain across many projects.For those of you who’ve been in the field a while:How do you typically approach this kind of situation? Are there best practices or long-term strategies for managing or mitigating the chaos caused by manual data entry?Do you rely on tooling, data contracts, better upstream communication—or just brute-force data cleaning?Would love to hear how others have approached this without going down a never-ending rabbit hole of fragile matching logic.",24,0.96,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kouhgg/how_do_experienced_data_engineers_handle/,2025-05-17 14:36:58,2025-05-23 01:41:04

1kpaisy,Is it a bad idea to use DuckDB as my landing zone format in S3?,DuckDatum,dataengineering,"I’m polling data out of a system that forces a strict quota, pagination, and requires I fanout my requests per record in order to denormalize its HATEAOS links into nested data that can later be flattened into a tabular model. It’s a lot, likely because the interface wasn’t intended for this purpose. It’s what I’ve got though. It’s slow with lots of steps to potentially fail at. All that, and I can only filter at a days granularity—so polling for changes is a loaded process too.I went ahead and set up an ETL pipeline that used DuckDB as an intermediate caching layer, to avoid memory issues, and set it up to dump parquet into S3. This ran for 24 hours then failed just shy of the dump, so now I’m thinking about micro batches.I want to turn this into a microbatch process. I figure I can cache the ID, HATEAOS link, and a nullable column for the JSON data. Once I have the data, I update the row where it belongs. I could store duckdb in S3 the whole time, or just plan to dump it if a failure occurs. This also gives a way to query the duckdb for missing records in case it fails mid way.So before I dump duckdb into S3, or even try to use duckdb in s3 over a network, are there limitations I’m not considering?

1kotr7w,Advice on Data Pipeline that Requires Individual API Calls,pswagsbury,dataengineering,"Hi Everyone,I’m tasked with grabbing data from one db about devices and using a rest api to pull information associated with it. The problem is that the api only allows inputting a single device at a time and I have 20k+ rows in the db table. The plan is to automate this using airflow as a daily job (probably 20-100 new rows per day). What would be the best way of doing this? For now I was going to resort to a for-loop but this doesn’t seem the most efficient.Additionally, the api returns information about the device, and a list of sub devices that are children to the main device. The number of children is arbitrary, but they all have the same fields: the parent and children. I want to capture all the fields for each parent and child, so I was thinking of have a table in long format with an additional column called parent_id, which allows the children records to be self joined on their parent record. Note: each api call is around 500ms average, and no I cannot just join the table with the underlying api data source directlyDoes my current approach seem valid?

We currently have a use case where we need to seek distinct values for some fields in thousands of files, which is quite slow when done directly on S3.My manager and I were experimenting with Parquet files to achieve this. but I recently found out that Parquet files are immutable, so we can't update existing parquet files with new listings unless we load the whole file into memory.

1kr1azg,How to build an API on top of a dbt model?,bebmfec,dataengineering,"I have quite a complex SQL query within DBT which I have been tasked to build an API 'on top of'.More specifically, I want to create an API that allows users to send input data (e.g., JSON with column values), and under the hood, it runs my dbt model using that input and returns the transformed output as defined by the model.For example, suppose I have a dbt model called `my_model` (in reality the model is a lot more complex): select {{ macro_1(""col_1"") }} as out_col_1, {{ macro_2(""col_1"", ""col_2"") }} as out_col_2 from {{ ref('input_model_or_data') }} Normally, `ref('input_model_or_data')` would resolve to another dbt model, but I’ve seen in dbt unit tests that you can inject synthetic data into that `ref()`, like this: - name: test_my_model model: my_model given: - input: ref('input_model_or_data') rows: - {col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1} expect: rows: - {out_col_1: ""out_val_1"", out_col_2: ""out_val_2""} This allows the test to override the input source. I’d like to do something similar via an API: the user sends input like `{col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}` to an endpoint, and the API returns the output of the dbt model (e.g., `{out_col_1: ""out_val_1"", out_col_2: ""out_val_2""}`), having used that input as the data behind `ref('input_model_or_data')`.What’s the recommended way to do something like this?",9,0.85,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kr1azg/how_to_build_an_api_on_top_of_a_dbt_model/,2025-05-20 10:15:49,2025-05-23 01:41:04

I have decent enough problem solving skills but I take a long time and I struggle to comprehend math and numbers.Can I still be a good programmer? Is it something anyone can pick up, or does your brain have to work in a specific way?I’ve looked at the FAQ and done some research already, but I really want to hear your honest experience with programming and how accessible it is.

I didn’t expect nearly this much support, I appreciate you all.Just to add some more information- I have no experience yet. I just started taking a free online course and playing with scratch literally yesterday. I’ve always loved games but until now have been focusing on improving my creative abilities (art and writing) so that I can create a decent game, and now I think I’m finally at a good spot with that so I’m moving to the next step (programming). I am a very good reader, and can be good at problem solving, but I have fairly severe ADHD which makes it hard to keep track of things. I think it will be challenging, but it’s something I’m passionate about so I’m willing to put in the effort. Thank you all so much!Edit 2: Thank you so much everybody.

1ksjv0u,"Feeling lost in tech. Burned out, falling behind, and scared I’ll stay mediocre forever.",idk-who-you-are,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I’m 22 and about to graduate with a Master’s in Computer Applications. I don’t have a job yet, and honestly, I feel completely stuck and left behind.When I was 14, I found out about software engineering after my neighbor moved to the US. That lit a fire in me—I started dreaming of becoming a great engineer, moving abroad, doing something meaningful. I pushed hard through 9th and 10th grades believing that hard work now would lead to success later.Then the lockdown hit just as I entered my Bachelor's. I learned a bit of programming, but I also wasted a lot of time—watching movies, helping at home, and losing direction.In 2022, I tried learning web development. I got a job I didn’t enjoy, then an internship where I couldn’t perform well. I tried React, but it felt overwhelming. Since then, I’ve bounced between DSA, frontend, Golang, and trying to build projects—but nothing sticks. Most projects remain unfinished. I’m not proud of anything I’ve built.I try starting projects, but I lose interest after two or three days. The initial excitement fades quickly, and I struggle to push through once things get repetitive or challenging. I feel stuck in a loop—excited to begin, but unable to finish. This keeps happening, and it kills my confidence even more.Now it’s 2025, and I feel like I’ve lost the **curiosity and excitement** that got me into tech in the first place. Programming doesn’t excite me anymore—it feels like just another boring subject I’m forcing myself through. I accept that YouTube and social media made tech look glamorous, and I got pulled into that version. But now I realize—it’s only fulfilling if you truly love the work.I have a short attention span. I give up easily when I hit bugs. I don’t learn frameworks or concepts as fast as I think I should. I feel like I’m not cut out for this.The worst part? I’m scared I’ll be stuck as someone mediocre forever. I lie awake at night thinking, *What if I’m falling behind in this race? What if I missed the boat? What if I end up like someone who fell out during the dot-com bubble and never recovered?*Meanwhile, I see people younger than me building amazing things, earning well, learning fast. It crushes me.My family—especially my parents and older brother—are amazing and supportive. They never pressure me, but I know deep down they want me to start earning. A few days ago, my mom quietly said, *“I thought you’d do something to change things at home, but you couldn’t.”* That sentence shattered me. I want to help them financially and emotionally. But I haven’t earned a single **dime** yet.I’ve been cold-emailing founders, CTOs, and employees on LinkedIn, and applying to jobs almost every day—but I keep getting rejections or no responses at all. It’s disheartening.Sometimes, I want to give up. But I also don’t want to. There’s still a small part of me that wants to break through, to build something meaningful, and to prove to myself that I *can* do it.I want to make it in tech. I want to be good at it. I still dream of building cool products and figuring out how things work. But I just don’t know how to keep going when everything feels overwhelming. I want to feel motivated again. I want to believe it’s not too late for me.Lately, I’ve been interested in backend development, but I know frontend is important too—and after failing so many times at it, frontend feels boring and intimidating. Starting again feels stupid and exhausting.Sorry if I sound like a complaint box or just another burnt-out CS guy. I just needed to get this off my chest.If anyone has been through this—or made it out of this kind of mental/emotional/technical rut—please let me know: **How do you stay consistent when your confidence is shattered?** **How do you bring back the excitement and curiosity for tech?** **How do you stop feeling like a failure?**Thanks for reading.**TL;DR:** 22, finishing MCA. Lost interest and motivation in programming. Tried web dev, Go, DSA—nothing sticks. Projects remain incomplete. Haven’t earned a dime yet. Family is supportive but I feel like I’ve let them down. Programming feels boring now; glamorized YouTube content pulled me in. I’m cold emailing founders, CTOs, employees and applying for jobs—but facing rejections. I’m scared of falling behind forever. Still want to succeed in tech but don’t know how. Backend interests me, frontend feels overwhelming.

1kpenmw,I made a cipher that uses the digits of π to encode messages!,Remarkable_Depth4933,learnprogramming,"Hi all, I recently created a fun cipher that encodes text using the digits of π. I thought it would be a cool way to explore string matching and character encoding in Python — and I'd love to get your thoughts or improvements!## How the cipher works:- Each character is converted to its ASCII value.- That number (as a string) is searched for in the digits of π (ignoring the decimal point).- The **starting index** of the first match and the **length** of the match are recorded.- Each character is encoded as `index-length`, separated by hyphens.### Example:The ASCII value of `'A'` is `65`. If `65` first appears in π at index **7** (π = 3.141592653... → digits = 141592653...), then it's encoded as:```7-2```---## Here’s an encrypted message:```11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2```---## And here’s the Python code to decode it:```pythonfrom mpmath import mpmp.dps = 100005 # digits of πpi_digits = str(mp.pi)[2:]cipher_text = ( ""11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2"")segments = cipher_text.strip().split(""-"")index_length_pairs = [ (int(segments[i]), int(segments[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(segments), 2)]decoded_chars = []for index, length in index_length_pairs: ascii_digits = pi_digits[index - 1 : index - 1 + length] decoded_chars.append(chr(int(ascii_digits)))decoded_message = """".join(decoded_chars)print(decoded_message)```---### Tutorial FlairThis post demonstrates how to decode a custom cipher based on the digits of π.

Runtime errors. So many times I couldn't 100% understand why something I am passing is not rendering and what the console errors mean, what is a type Object Object etc and since I got tired of starting and giving up I decided randomly to do a project with Typescript instead of JS and holy shit. All type errors get underlined right away and just copy pasting to AI and asking for an explanation gets to understand things like when you're using a reference or comparing a reference instead of a value instead of learning about it once you set everything up. So while it might be more work, what got me to truly enjoy writing web stuff is learning Typescript. If you know any typed language it is super quick to pick up, and if it's your first typed language you'll need a bit more time to get it but once you do you're not going back to vanilla JS.

1kowjvr,Feeling stuck as a junior dev – is this normal or is it just my company?,Apprehensive-West119,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I'm a junior fullstack developer with just under a year of experience. I work at a small software house that maintains and develops a few internal apps and services.Lately, I’ve been feeling extremely frustrated with the direction my work has taken, and I’m not sure if I’m just being unrealistic or if this is genuinely a toxic environment. I’d love some outside perspective.When I started, I was trained in the company's main stack – NestJS (Node) and React – and I was excited to grow in that tech. But for the past few months, I’ve been doing tasks that have almost nothing to do with fullstack development:* Creating automations in low-code tools* Researching integrations with outdated platforms* Working in an 8-year-old PHP project (I had zero experience in PHP before)To make it worse, the PHP project has no proper security practices (e.g., passwords stored in plaintext in the database), and my suggestions for refactoring or rewriting it in our actual stack have been ignored.I'm currently split across 3 different projects and constantly bombarded with tasks from all sides. Meetings eat up a lot of time, and I’m falling behind. There’s barely any code review or mentorship, and I feel like I’m not learning or growing in the direction I want.On top of all that, I’m working for minimum wage in my country, which makes it even more discouraging -I’m putting in real effort but I feel like I’m getting very little in return, both in terms of compensation and career growth.I do have a backup plan (a non-IT job I could return to), but I’m hesitant to give up on development just yet. That said, the junior job market is rough, and I’m worried that if I leave now, I might end up searching for months before I find another dev position.So I'm stuck in this limbo — should I just accept that this is how things are in smaller companies and try to push through? Or is this a sign that I should look for a better environment?Would really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through something similar.

A bit of context, my dad was a programmer for the Romanian naval systems. He passed away a while ago, but he left behind this old coding book he wrote notes in. I’ve been learning from it, bit by bit, trying to make sense of how to build stuff from scratch.Now I’m trying to make my own web project (“Obscuria Terminal”, don’t laugh, I know it sounds dramatic :face_with_tears_of_joy:). Instead of putting everything in one CSS file, I ended up splitting it into a bunch of smaller files like `header.css`, `utilities.css`, `modals.css`, and so on. Here’s a screenshot of what my VS Code looks like:[https://prnt.sc/eauZsZQNvkXP](https://prnt.sc/eauZsZQNvkXP)I just thought it would be easier to keep things organized, but now it feels like maybe I’m making it harder for myself?So here are my questions:* Is this normal, or way too much for a beginner?* Is this something actual devs do, or am I going down the wrong path?* Would you have stuck with one big CSS file instead, or split things up differently?Sorry if this sounds clueless.

1ks61v4,Is there a way to verify file accuracy after creating a zip file?,rawaka,learnprogramming,"Hello. I have been making a VB .Net WinForms app to archive project directories at work to a different storage raid by scanning all the files/folders recursively and ensuring everything is older than a specified date. It then copies the files to our archive drive. then, it does a binary comparison of the source and copied files to ensure everything was 100% successful before deleting the source file. All that functionality works PERFECTLY. (Picture a shared drive full of folders, each of which is a complete project. If no changes have happened to a project in at least a year, it's safe to archive. Stuff on the archive drive is read-only for most of the company to keep it safe for record keeping and not cluttering up daily work)For the next phase, I want it to go through that archive drive and put all the archived directories into compressed files (Zip or 7Zip). So, each project folder becomes its own zip file. Our data is highly compressible, and we can save about 30% space by compressing files that we don't need to be regularly accessing.I see that this line of code easily creates the zip file for me: System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory(FolderPath, OutputZipPath, CompressionLevel.SmallestSize, True)My questions are:* Is there a way to verify the file accuracy after zipped before I delete the source files? * I may be over-cautious, but I don't want to risk any file corruptions* Is there a different way to compress folders that I should research? * I did my proof-of-concept testing using a batch file that triggered 7zip, but I prefer to keep everything integrated into a single program if possible unless there's a good reason not to. edit: minor error: i flipped the percentage of saved space, sorry. they compress to 70% of original size, saving 30%.",6,1.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ks61v4/is_there_a_way_to_verify_file_accuracy_after/,2025-05-21 19:00:59,2025-05-23 01:41:05

The basics never felt clear, and I was always left with questions like “why exactly is this done like this?”So now, I’ve decided to start fresh — this time with a proper focus on understanding things deeply, step by step. My main preference is to **read books or documentation** rather than watching videos. I feel like books allow me to go at my own pace, re-read things, and properly think about what I’m learning. I’ve also heard from others that books usually explain things in more detail and depth compared to many tutorials.Here’s how I’m planning to approach it:1. First, I want to learn **general programming concepts** — like how code works, what happens behind the scenes, how computers interpret programs, memory, logic, etc.2. Then I’ll move on to **Python**, relearn it properly with all the basics and get confident with it.3. After that, I want to get into **C++**, so that I can understand things on a lower level and get better with performance, system-level thinking, etc.I'm also planning to go into **data structures and algorithms** in between, once I have a decent hold on Python.So I’m mainly looking for **book recommendations** (or any really well-explained resources) for:* Basics of coding and general programming logic* Beginner to intermediate Python* DSA (preferably in Python, but general ones are okay too)* A good path to learn C++ after Python* Clean code, writing good code, and long-term coding habitsIf there are any **video courses that explain things really well and in depth**, I’m open to them too, but my first preference will always be books.If anyone here has gone through a similar journey or prefers reading like me, I’d love to hear your experience and suggestions.

1kslf3b,"After 4 years at Google, here's my honest take on why their work culture and processes didn't work for me.",dethstrobe,cscareerquestions,"I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.Just to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.# Agile is a SinI come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?Wrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.It is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.Also, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for ""X"" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.# The Doc MachineSo, if you're not regularly shipping software, how can you possibly measure impact?Docs.Endless docs.Countless docs.So many docs that it can be impossible to find what doc says what you did.Google's mission is to ""organize the world's information."" Internally in Google, they generate a lot of information in docs, and it's very hard to search and find the information you're looking for.What's the point of docs no one reads? Well, since software doesn't get shipped, I assume it just acts as a laundry list of links when attempting to show impact for your performance reviews or promotions. You might not have shipped anything, but at least you left a paper trail of what you didn't ship.You want to know the worst part of it? They want you to write a doc on a system you don't understand. So you write it up, make some assumptions and send it out for approval. No one reads it to approve it. Let's say you get your single approver and start implementing. Guess what, your core assumption is wrong. The data isn't in the right place, or the data you thought had what you needed, doesn't. Now you need to rewrite the doc.What's the point of getting approval? What's the point of a doc that is wrong from the start? What's the point of upfront design that is wrong? Why not just implement and find out what actually is going on and make it work?The point is, it's just theater to make it look like we're doing our jobs. Why isn't the software the evidence we're doing our job?I'm not trying to say docs are bad, and everything should just be tribal knowledge. But I am saying docs that need to be rewritten from the get-go are a waste of time.# Bad docsIronically, despite needing to write so many docs to implement things. When you read other people's docs, you might notice something. They're very high-level. They're more like a thesis, then like actual documentation on how to use an API.What is the point of docs that don't answer how to use an API?Focusing on the high-level philosophy of a service is honestly distracting and unhelpful. I think I understand why this happens. It's hard to keep docs up to date. So if you keep them high-level, they won't become obsolete or need to be updated. But I don't care about your thesis defense; I just want to use your software to solve my problem.And I know Google can write good docs. [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) has fantastic documentation. [Proto Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview/) have great docs. Both of these are made by Google. I guess the difference is they're public facing and Google doesn't prioritize internal docs like they do their external facing ones.# A Culture of SilenceSo, there is a lot of lip service towards how open Google is. Say how they're trying to encourage employees in fireside chats to not ask anonymous questions so that leadership can follow up with the individual to gain more context. (This, by the way, does not prevent people from asking anonymously, which they do.)There is also a culture of no-blame retrospectives. They don't run regularly, even when I advocate for them. And worst of all, when we finally do run retrospectives, we don't discuss challenges and problems we are encountering. So, what's the point of a retrospective that doesn't talk about pain points and mitigation strategies? From my perspective, it just looks like theater and a way to paint a false view that everything is good and we have nothing to complain about. Or worse, that we are helpless and we really cannot change anything.Coming from companies with genuinely open cultures where we fostered candid and open discussions, it's baffling to me that no one seems willing to put in the minimal effort to improve everyone's lives.It is better to be positive about a broken system and keep the status quo than it is to ask people to put in a laughable small level of effort to make everyone's life better. Not everything is going smoothly all the time. And assuming we **want** it to run smoothly, we should probably discuss the pain points and workarounds or solutions to them. Knowledge silos are bad. More open discussions can reduce knowledge silos which reduces the burden on individuals and gives everyone a balance for job responsibilities.# A Culture of Bottom-Up (but only if it's top-down)So, in meetings with leadership. They emphasize that our *bottom-up culture* is how we do such great work. And by *bottom-up*, they apparently mean *top-down*.# When Bottom-Up Meets Brick WallSo, let's say our UXR (user experience research team) has come up with an obvious gap in our offerings. What would you do? Perhaps gather some people from multiple disciplines and brainstorm a solution. Or maybe you just get leadership and design in a room and iterate on who knows what behind closed doors for literal months, before you ever even involve engineering. And for those few months, you pull engineering off their current teams in a large-scale reorg and don't give them marching orders instead just give them a bunch of vague ideas of what they might want to build. Like...what is engineering supposed to do? Build against an invisible moving target? The answer is, that is exactly what we do. Not because it's a good use of our time, but because we have nothing better to do and we have no input into the vision of the product.So let's say, you're an engineer, like yours truly, and you think that process is stupid, and instead you really do want to try to implement a bottoms up initiative. So maybe, see a feature, we originally spec'd out but was dropped because they didn't see the current value in implementing it. But it sounds kind of cool, and shouldn't be that difficult to get an MVP for this feature. Maybe you go to reach out across teams, pull in people that own data you need, a team that works on Android and iOS, and try to get people from the backend team so you can make an e2e MVP to demonstrate this feature is doable. Also, act as a test bed to show smaller agile processes work and probably how we should handle work in the org.Sounds pretty encouraging, right? But here is the real problem, one of the teams is a no-show. Not only are they a no-show, they also refuse to work with you and ignore your messages. You escalate to your manager and tech lead, and that team also ignores them too. You work with the other teams and implement everything, but say the one thing to tie everything together and make it work e2e. Let's say a backend team refused to work with you. So, naturally, offer to do the work for them. And they tell you to not do that. Because it's not my code base, I'm not on call, and I don't have to maintain it. So what do you do?What I did was create a video demo that made it look like it should work and presented it to leadership. We were reorged before this demo was even presented, so the feature died on the vine.# The Only MVP Is Minimum Viable Plausible DeniabilityLet's say that you do still believe in the rhetoric that, *the organization really does believe in bottom-up*. So you take some time and write up a doc (which is an activity you don't enjoy but if that's how the game is played, and you want to play ball, you do it). The doc outlines an open source initiative that is coincidentally attempting to solve the space we just tried to fill. But since there's an open-source community trying to solve the same problem space, maybe we can just leverage that and even help them grow at the same time. Anyway, it was super nice to have leadership hear me out, but they didn't want to go with it, because it turns out that one of the reasons we hamstrung our last project was because we were attempting to skirt a legal definition that the open source project is tackling head on. Suddenly, it made more sense: The original project was destined to fail, not because it was a bad idea, but because they were trying to handicap the implementation to avoid legal scrutiny.Fundamentally, we're not trying to build good software or solve problems. We're just trying to do something without bringing legal scrutiny to Google.I understand getting sued sucks, and the law is often weaponized against Google. But why handicap ourselves? There are so many other ideas out there. Why not pursue things that are higher value and lower risk? I cynically believe it could just be virtue signaling to investors, to show Google is trying new things and still taking risks. But their risks seem high-risk, low-reward, compared to the normal practices I'm used to, which focus on mitigating risk and prioritizing high value. Taking risks here seems to be about signaling growth, but are they truly growing? Wouldn't the more obvious path be to take the calculated legal risk to solve a real problem and potentially achieve genuine growth? I don't know; I'm not in leadership. I just had a worm's-eye view of the machine.# Grassroots Agility, Stomped by ApathyLet's say you came from an agile background and you even believe it. Because you've seen it solve very obvious communication issues that you see arise in large organizations. You've experienced it firsthand, you know it works. You go and explain it to your manager, they say that there are organization issues and leadership is resistant to change. They don't discourage you from trying, but they kind of set the expectations that nothing will change. But, what else are you supposed to do? Nothing?So you have a meeting with your skip manager (your manager's manager) once again advocating to adopt agile processes and maybe get more stakeholder buy-in. And they give you the advice to do it locally with your team. You know, ""bottom-up"" kind of stuff.You present it to the team. They hate it. They don't want processes. They don't want collaboration or more communication. They say agile practices are dehumanizing and that we are not interchangeable cogs in the machine. A bit of a disservice towards agile processes. But they are willing to try some of the ceremonies.But literally, for any reason whatsoever, they cancel meetings, like retrospectives or stand-ups. Maybe we need more time to finish a feature, or maybe it's a holiday, or we get reorged. And we never start up the meeting again, at least until I ask for it. Followed by it once again being canceled at the drop of a hat. And no one cares. They don't see the value in it. And to be honest, the ceremonies are toothless because we don't discuss actual problems, we don't discuss work progress to reduce knowledge silos, and action items are never done and are also usually not meaningful anyway.The reason people don't see the value of agile processes is not that it's not a good framework to address communication gaps, but because just doing the ceremonies without the communication makes them pointless. There is value in the ceremonies if they're being used to address the problems. But actively ignoring the problems, even with ceremonies, means we're now just wasting people's time.# Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Going NowhereIf there is a bottom-up culture at Google, it is self sabotaging. There is so much momentum for the status quo that actual process change is near impossible. The only change that appears to work is a top-down mandate, which they try every year with constant reorgs and get the same results.# There is No Team in ISo, coming from an agile background (I know I sound like I'm in a cult, with how much I bring it up, but bear with me), I've come to the understanding that I as an individual do not necessarily matter. It's about putting aside ego and working together on a larger goal. This also comes with a nice benefit of distributing responsibility, and reducing burn out.That's pretty damn *ungoogley*. At Google, they're rugged cowboys. They pull themselves up by the bootstrap and don't care about your collaboration. You need to own everything. Your work, your feature, your project, your process, your career. No one is here to help you. You need to just do it yourself. Which is ironic, as [googley-ness](https://staffeng.medium.com/being-googly-62b75dd642df) should theoretically not embody it. But the performance evaluation surely doesn't emphasize trying to make teamwork work.[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.I hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.It could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *""leaning on others too much.""* How else am I supposed to read that?I've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.# Performative TheaterI hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.So, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.When they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.# Tech Debt ForeverTo say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.Cryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.So I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, ""It sounds like you need mentorship."" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, ""maybe you should find your own mentorship."" And it does make me wonder, ""what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?"" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.# I'm outSo I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.They gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.There is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.I used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",1485,0.95,253,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kslf3b/after_4_years_at_google_heres_my_honest_take_on/,2025-05-22 08:13:58,2025-05-23 01:41:07

1kom4ek,The myth of the STEM talent shortage,SingleInSeattle87,cscareerquestions,"https://issues.org/stem-workforce-shortage-data-hira/Data doesn't lie. Why is whenever I hear justification for H1B and STEM-OPT everywhere on mainstream media, and even codified in US law, court transcripts and policy discussions: they keep saying there's a shortage of STEM workers, especially tech workers and we need more immigrants to fill those roles. Why do we hear this all the time, but it's never actually supported by data?Further, the department of labor actually has a list of jobs known to be in shortage and it doesn't use biased industry reports to determine them: it uses its own data as well as BLS data. This list is called ""Schedule A"" and it allows employers to fast track immigrant visas into these occupations without needing to go through the H1B process.But the INA has this weird thing where if a prospective job pays under $60k the employer must recruit US workers first, but it does not offer that protection to jobs that pay over $60k or if the job requires a masters degree. Congress justified this, as saying jobs paying over $60k or requiring a masters is a reasonable proxy to a job that is in shortage. But it's not. Schedule A has existed for just as long as the H1B came about in 1990. This makes me question the purpose of the H1B in the first place.If the DOL has the ability to analyze the labor market and determine certain jobs are in dire need, and need skilled immigrant labor, and our those on a dynamic list every year, why do we have ""H1B"" at all? Why can't the actual jobs in shortage, be listed, and the jobs not in shortage have to prove they couldn't find a qualified US citizen before hiring an immigrant?It seems congress relied on industry lobbying and their ""facts"" rather than our own DOL and BLS.",436,0.9,206,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kom4ek/the_myth_of_the_stem_talent_shortage/,2025-05-17 06:09:20,2025-05-23 01:41:07

Yet regardless of that, there was always a candidate more favorable than me which got chosen, until this exact day.Today I have received an email which was quite unexpected. I have been offered a full-time remote position as a junior software engineer in an international mid-sized company, with big customer base and highly distributed systems. The offer I received is realistic and slightly above average for my years of experience and the consideration it's a fully remote position, therefore I have gladly signed it and accepted it.The agenda of my post is first and foremost spreading some positivity and hope in this Subreddit in these tough market conditions, because I feel like many people can use it here as a motivation to keep trying. Secondly, I would like to celebrate this moment here in this Subreddit and post about the good times, the same as I did when I posted about the bad times.I wish everyone out there the best of luck in their job hunting journey, and as I said I want to shed some light and spread positivity proving that it is possible to get offers with the right skills, hard work, consistency, and a bit of luck.Good luck everyone!",275,0.94,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ksxljy/just_received_a_fully_remote_job_offer_as_a_self/,2025-05-22 18:08:07,2025-05-23 01:41:07

I make a sizeable amount of money, I work hybrid, and I get plenty of vacation. And yet I'm miserable.As the layoffs started, the company culture immediately rotted. I found myself pushing back on others' nonsensical, perf-driven demands. I was making decisions not for technical excellence but for less stressful approvals. I was constantly fighting off attempts to steal scope or credit. Then a coworker sabotaged my work and advertised to L7's how he already had a great plan to fix ""my"" mistakes. (He was promoted for this.)**I realized that a career in tech is not about good work or good skills. It's about politics, and it gets worse the more senior you get.** I spoke to some mid-level and senior friends, and they've all told me the same, with many of them questioning their careers too.I started not caring anymore about scalable architectures or sensible design decisions. I went looking for other jobs, then I realized nearly every big company is like this now, not just Amazon. I also realized quickly that all my cold applications were getting trashed without a look; only recruiter calls mattered. (Condolences to all the entry-level folks, it really is rough out there.)**More importantly, I started questioning the point of it all.** I pursued tech because I liked coding and designing. I liked the idea of working with others to build great things. And I liked the prospect of working anywhere in the world, and not being tied to a single company.But above all I wanted to make an impact. I wanted to build software that improved millions of lives. I planned to work my way up to senior in the private sector, save a lot of money, then take a pay cut to go work for the government or a public contractor. Then Elon Musk destroyed that path.Now, I was studying so hard to get an offer to do... what? Squeeze out 0.02% more ad revenue? Get more people addicted to gambling? Exploit more vulnerable children? Or build tools to let other companies better do those things? Because that's what most big tech companies are, and why they pay the big bucks.In college, I was a premed as well as a CS major. I had everything from lab research to volunteer hours, from the courses to the MCAT—all I had to do was send the med school applications. Then I chose to pursue tech instead. After years in the real world, I'm doubting my choice.**I'm not building things that matter. Most times, I'm not building at all.** Most of my time and energy is devoted to navigating office politics. I didn't sign up for this. I certainly can't imagine 30 more years in this career.I'm still searching for a new job. But if I don't get an offer in the next few months, I'll be studying again for the MCAT. (My old score expired—what a waste.)Medicine will be a long and tough road. I'll be working longer hours with less flexibility for somewhat less pay. But at least I'll be doing something that matters, something that makes me proud to go to work every morning. I'll have stress that's meaningful, and a sense of professional fulfillment beyond just my TC.And most of all, I won't have to deal with office politics, every day, every week, every year.",170,0.9,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1knwu1v/pivoting_from_tech_to_medicine/,2025-05-16 09:45:58,2025-05-23 01:41:07

The other two devs before me were in India. I was the only dev in the US (during working hours) for over a year before finally getting a second US full-stack dev (then a third and fourth front-end). Today, the small startup where I knew everyone's' name ended up getting bought out and had money pumped into it that ended up making it grow exponentially. Now I only see maybe 5% of who work in my company regularly. Because of my circumstanced, I have been categorized as the ""Go-To Person"" for getting stuff fixed or done in my company during the working hours.Before we were bought out, I already had that reputation, being the longest standing dev on the US side. I would get pings from people every couple hours that needed assistance in something they were working on, or needed someone with ""expert knowledge"" on the software in a quick meeting. I was able to balance this with my own work decent enough to still be able to get my work done in a reasonable time. But since our side of the company got exponentially bigger since being bought out, now I get pings ever 15 - 30 min some days and my schedule has been loaded with meetings that require that dev with ""expert knowledge"", even though most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I'm good at figuring it out though).Because of this, my productivity is shot. Tickets that should take 2 - 3 days are taking a week or more sometimes. I've talked to my manager over the last year about this and we have made an ""Ask a Dev"" channel for questions that aren't urgent (which has filtered out the obvious and obviously dumb questions that are asked from being asked), urgent stuff now gets filtered through the scrum master which she divides up between me and the only other full-stack that works during the workday, and we've preached, multiple times to not contact any dev directly, even though this only lasts for a little while before everyones ""Super Urgent!"" problem finds its way to my teams chat directly... again...So take this as a warning. Don't become the ""Go-To Person"" of your company/division/team if you want to keep your sanity. Edit: Spelling/grammer errors.

1kqmlek,"""Not an Engineer"" - Limited Growth Opportunities Because of CS Degree Title",SouthMouth79,cscareerquestions,"I graduated in May 2023 with a Computer Science degree from a well respected program. Like many others in my class, it was tough landing a full-time role in this market. I did some contract work for a while until I was recently hired full-time as a “Controls and Automation Specialist”. A basic summary of what my division in the company does is that we install and program factory computers.I didn’t think much of the title of the role before starting; it wasn’t heavily stressed as a distinguishing factor in the interview, job posting, or any further correspondence with the company. It wasn’t until I started that I came to understand that there is a significant distinction between “Specialists” and “Engineers” in my division. Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, not just computer related, but from my current understanding, C+A Engineers have more career mobility within the company as well as higher salaries, even in entry-level roles.When I asked about the difference, I was told that because I have a “Computer Science” degree, I’m not considered an engineer and can’t be billed to clients as one. I thought this might be a regional thing, that software engineering isn’t yet considered “real” engineering in the southeast. But today I found out that one of our interns is titled an engineer but is pursuing a degree in Software Engineering; a degree that differs from Computer Science at their university by a single required course (Software Security).I have plenty of CS grad friends that went on to become Software Engineers, so I didn’t expect the wording of my degree to limit my role like this. I really like my coworkers, the work that I do, and the company I work for. I genuinely pictured myself being part of the company for the long-term. But it’s been hard not to feel like I’m missing out on long-term growth simply because of a technicality in how my education is labeled.Has anyone else run into this kind of title/pay/growth ceiling based on your degree title? Would love to hear how others have navigated this or similar situations, or just general suggestions or opinions on how to proceed.TLDR:CS grad working in controls/automation was told I can't hold an ""Engineer"" title, or access related pay and growth, because my degree isn’t labeled “Engineering,” despite doing similar work.

""What type of item do you need to do ABC? I have no idea but let me ask a real store employee, 1 sec.""2. I've had store employees treat me harshly upon meeting me because I'm a fake store employee just there for a day, I'm taking time away from them doing their regular stuff while they explain stuff to me, etc... and I also think some resent the salary discrepancy. Sometimes someone will tell me that their family member makes X amount of money and I don't say anything but I'm thinking ""I never asked, I'm just here to comply and keep my job"".3. None of the things that the store employees complain about are something that I even have any power whatsoever to change or fix. It's just not something that my team or department works on. And instead of me being there, why can't it just be an email from them directly to management? and how many more times am I going to have to keep doing this?After completing one of these visits I'm given an opportunity to fill out a survey which I always do, but then in the future I'm still told basically ""do it or you're fired"". It feels like a bait and switch to me because I joined this company to be a software dev and this program didn't exist at that time.I know the job market is bad at the moment so I'm continuing to comply, but I just wanted to vent to my fellow devs I guess.",54,0.83,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kqjrpx/just_a_rant_from_a_frustrated_software_developer/,2025-05-19 18:51:09,2025-05-23 01:41:07

1knxfuz,Got paid for doing nothing TWO JOBS in a row - how common is that?,internet-person-777,cscareerquestions,"# tldr: Twice in the past year I was hired in companies (employed on full time and paid) while doing absolutely nothing (never put on any project).Hi, I'm backend/fullstack developer with experience of just few years.Last year I spent 6 months doing absolutely NOTHING in the big IT company from India. I was hired as developer in a project for a client from finance/fintech industry. The project was postponed or never started, and I've spent my entire time in there doing absolutely nothing, however I was told that they will find replacement project for me eventually, then 1 month before the end of my employment contract I was suggested to look for another job as they won't extend my employment. Can't say that I didn't expect that after few months of doing nothing, but I was really pissed off. At the time I could already be part of some nice project, get the know-how and be really productive in some other company.**2024 was my worst year in the industry in terms of looking for a new job, I was unemployed for few months after that company.**Now my current position - the same story. Very similiar IT Indian company, I won't give you any names but there is a few of them so you can probably figure it out. I was hired as backend dev at the beginning of the year, and so far I had few internal interviews for the various projects, but I don't even get feedback from them.**As I learned from my previous experience I have found another job as the contractor in the bank and I'm doing great here.**My employment in the do-nothing-company terminates in few months and I'm not resigning until they actually try put me on a project. I don't feel like I am cheating because this is second time that someone wastes my time. I'm still a beginner in the industry and in this very crowded market on every single interview everyone asks me about my experience in all the companies I've been working for - **I don't want to lie on my resume, but I also don't want to tell my interviewer that professionally I was not engaged in any project/team since the end of 2023, and why I am jumping between companies after barely 6 months of employment.**So, do you have experience like this? I know that sometimes you just sit on the bench as a contractor, but this is other situation and often after some time you just stop getting paid. Here I was full time employed, got paid and contributed absolutely nothing, twice. I probably won't even mention my current do-nothing-company on my CV.I'm sick of companies that are looking for developer while not having any position for them. And I completely understand that this is kind of a privilige nowadays and sounds like a dream job for many people, but in IT every year of your experience counts, and If you was hired on paper but got nothing from it, then it's going to turn out terribly for you in the future. Of course in both of those companies I tried to utilize my time and try to learn/work with new things on my own, but this is not the same.

Super excited, but nervous since there’s no real junior dev pipeline or formal training, and I’m jumping straight from student to full-time dev in a small team that mostly hires experienced people.I interned at this company for about 1.5 years with 8 moths full-time and the rest part-time.During that time, I worked on a pretty wide range of stuff: manually testing new software, creating architectural diagrams, documenting codebases, and toward the end, helping a new AI team build web apps with AI-driven features.It’s been about two months since the internship ended. When I wrapped up, there was talk of a full-time offer closer to graduation (which is in August). But recently, they reached out and said they’d actually like to offer me a position now—starting part-time, then moving to full-time after I graduate. I asked about the role, and they said “AI Developer,” which basically just means I’d be a software dev on the AI use case team (so not data science or ML).I’m super excited because I loved the team environment and like most of us our dream is software dev. That said, I’m also nervous.This company isn’t a tech company, it’s actually pretty far from one. And because of that, the structure is a bit different. There’s not really a formal junior engineer pipeline or training program. Most people get hired with several years of experience already under their belt. I do know a couple folks who came in a year or two after graduating, but even then, it was through a setup where they’d already been doing independent contract work for a while.I know I’m a strong developer, and I learn quickly, but I also know I benefit a lot from structure and guidance. Obviously working with the team towards the end of my internship did give me SOME experience, but I still feel like the jump from student to full time dev is massive and I’m worried about working in an environment that might not have that change in the forefront of their mind.

Reading their post was like hearing my own thoughts said out loud made me hyperfocus on it.So here’s what I’m proposing (and may even build myself if I get enough support behind me):**One group. One community.** Let’s stop being divided and conquered in a dog-eat-dog grind. Let’s build *together*. Learn together. Grow together.The idea is to start a community, on Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, Reddit, wherever there's traction where anyone who's serious about learning and building can join. No gatekeeping, just mutual accountability.**How it would work:*** Each member logs their learning journey with a start and end date, plus their chosen path (e.g. [`MOOC.fi`](http://MOOC.fi) `Java => Java Internship (3 months) & Java II (3 months)`, `Harvard CS50 => (3 months) => w: Web Dev Internship, ai: AI Internship`, etc.).* Proof of completion is required (certs, GitHub commits, demo videos). This isn’t about fluff, it’s about **real growth*** Every Thursday or Friday we could have a community event like DSA Thursday/Friday* After internship, or if you want to skip it would be **Entry-Level** (the initial commitment would be **6 to 12 months**)* Everyone begins by building a **personal project** to set a baseline and gauge their current level.* If possible, everyone at this stage is assigned an accountability buddy, preferably one that isn't on the same team so that one person isn't doing the work of another. * After that, we begin and transition into **collaborative projects** run in an agile team format. Everyone keeps their main role they want and rotates any unused/unsure roles: designer, dev, PM, tester, to build real-world skills.# The exposure strategy:Once a project is finished, we create a **video breakdown** and post it on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, or wherever else makes sense. Each person is credited for their work and gets the exposure they deserve.Let’s be real: Most of us are **introverts**. Some of us are **highly skilled**. And many of us are **still unemployed**, even while being more capable than folks earning six figures.This isn't just about skill, it's about being **seen**. We need a system that clears the dust off our shine. Many of us are grasping at straws. **Maybe this is what we actually need: real experience, real proof, and real support.**# Long-term vision:* After 6+ months, or if your **personal project** stands out, you transition into a **junior developer role** within the group.* You start to take on leadership responsibilities and begin developing those soft skills like communication, initiative, and mentoring.* By then, or even earlier, you should be ready for a paid role. If not, you’ll still have a strong portfolio, exposure, and momentum to start freelancing or even launch your own thing.# What a full journey might look like (if starting from zero):1. **Internship Phase (Learning Phase):** * Java I & II (MOOC.fi), or Full-Stack, or Python, or 2x+ CS50 courses, etc. * \~6 months total (self-paced) * Initial project (\~1 month) * Career development + feedback2. **Entry-Level Phase** * 3 to 12 projects built with team * Weekly GitHub updates, project demos, and social proof * Lasts 6 to 12 months3. **Junior Phase** * \~6+ months of group work and possible freelancing * Exposure, mentorship, and leadership opportunitiesIn total, you’d have **about 2 years of experience**, real-world projects, team collaboration skills, leadership development, and consistent exposure. With that kind of portfolio and growth, **you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t hire you**.I may start this, but I obviously can’t do it alone. If you’re interested, or if you have suggestions to improve the idea, **drop a comment or DM me**. Please share this with anyone you think may benefit from this style of rigor, discipline and community.Let's stop moping and wallowing away our best years in self pity.Let’s stop waiting for experience and start **building it**.",18,0.7,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1krqwwm/possible_ray_of_hope_in_trying_times_lets_build/,2025-05-21 06:17:27,2025-05-23 01:41:07

But the more I think about the future of software development, especially with the rise of AI, the more I believe infrastructure will play a critical role. As computing demands grow, infrastructure will only become more essential.

Trying to weigh roles with tech I’m comfortable in against immersing myself in Java to insulate against future job searches. 2. Pay discrepancy between large and small contractors. I’ve had offers from Booz Allen and Leidos along with multiple small contractors(<50 employees). The smaller companies have routinely offered ~20-30% more total compensation.

1ksxsmx,"Seeking some advice. CS degree, working retail job.",whoami_jav,cscareerquestions,"Seeking some advice… In March 2023, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science from a UC in Southern California after returning to school following a break in 2019. While in college, I completed an internship at a local tech company doing software engineering and also picked up some freelance web development work.After graduation, I spent about five months preparing for technical interviews and applying for jobs. Unfortunately, I drained my limited savings during that time and didn’t land any offers. I eventually stepped away from the job search, partly due to frustration and loss of professional motivation and because I really needed money quickly.Since then, I’ve been working at an organics grocery store (the rain forest one) for the past year and eight months. I currently make $18.67 per hour, working 30 to 35 hours a week. I’ve recently been offered a leadership-track role that would bump my pay to around $21.50 per hour with a 40-hour workweek. Still, I’m not happy with my financial situation or this job.Despite working in retail, I continue to code and try to learn software engineering topics on my days off or when I have the energy after work. That said, it has been difficult to maintain momentum, and I feel like I’ve lost touch with many of the CS fundamentals needed in the field.Part of me regrets not going all in on the job search earlier and settling for a grocery store job. Another part of me is grateful for the soft skills I’ve developed in the meantime.Now, I want to pivot back into tech and become a software engineer. At this point, I’d take almost any role in the field just to gain experience and start building a network. I know the job hunt will require time, discipline, and financial commitment. Preparing through LeetCode, system design, and personal projects is going to be time consuming, but it’s necessary. I am rusty on a lot topics. That said, reading about the current job market has me feeling anxious.I’m at a crossroads and feel completely lost. My options are:1. **Stay in my current role**, working 30–35 hours per week. Continue saving and use my days off or evenings to focus on technical prep (LeetCode and NeetCode). Once I feel ready, start applying.2. **Accept the leadership position**, work full-time for six months, and save aggressively. This will net me roughly $20,000 in savings considering holiday pay and OT. After that, step back to part-time (I’m able to work from 4 to 24 hours a week) and use my savings to support myself while focusing full-time on interview prep and project work. I know I made mistakes and as a result I feel so behind on EVERYTHING. Am I about to make another mistake?",6,0.81,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ksxsmx/seeking_some_advice_cs_degree_working_retail_job/,2025-05-22 18:16:04,2025-05-23 01:41:07

1ks05ut,How do you explain your thought process while programming?,djmax121,cscareerquestions,"I absolutely suck at this on a comical level. SWE with 3 almost 4 years of industry experience with a good amount of projects and some Leetcode practice also. I can program. Doing it live, in 15 minutes, while explaining what I’m thinking, with 3 other engineers watching over me though? Feels like a 30 IQ debuff at the very least.It’s honestly like language processing and logical reasoning exist on separate threads, in different languages in my brain. So not only do I have to interrupt the logic thread which is necessary for a coherent, correct solution, I also need to translate it into English language to be presentable and make sense, on the fly. But also keep enough reference of the logic to have something to return to once I explain a point. The result is both threads are interrupted frequently and produce incoherent responses. On top of the pressure of being watched and judged for it.That’s why I can program a solution in whole, then I can explain it well after it’s all done. Each thread can complete one by one without loss of context mid execution.Does anyone have any advice? Ideally if you used to be bad at this, but got significantly better? Is it just a matter of more exposure? This feels insurmountable since I’ve always been this way. Top of math class, but teacher asks me to walk through a solution on the whiteboard?

My situation is complicated, and I don’t want to come across as someone who quits easily.My first job was a six-month contract that didn’t get renewed—not because of my performance, but because the deputy director informed all contract staff that we would be ""released to the market on our knowledge."" I worked around the clock to deliver my assignments, but there was nothing I could do to secure a renewal.Afraid that I wouldn’t find another opportunity quickly, I accepted my next offer without much hesitation—only to discover that the company had almost no real software development expertise. The local team was constantly misled by overseas developers, and the leadership, despite lacking technical knowledge, refused to acknowledge the gaps. It was like watching The Emperor’s New Clothes play out in real life.To make matters worse, my new team lead in the last government linked company sabotaged me. After completing my assignments and demonstrating my work to the project manager and team lead, he withheld key information from the project director. He told her that I didn’t know how to import libraries—but he didn’t mention that I had already finished the task successfully. Because the project director lacked technical expertise, she dismissed me based on that remark.Additionally, I had assumed that a ""senior software engineer"" in the team before i joined the new team would have solid technical knowledge. Instead, she was actually a business analyst, and actively made my life difficulty by constantly given me wrong infor that I need to point out to her. They actually insisted the correct way of pushing your code up is git diff.Given all of this, how should I explain my work history in interviews?
