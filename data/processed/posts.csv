1mbs1iw,Data Engineering Job Market - What the Hell Happened?,MoRakOnDi,dataengineering,"I might come off as complaining, but it’s been 9 months since I started hunting for a new data engineering position with zero luck. After 7 years of doing DE (working with Oracle BI, self-hosted Spark clusters, and optimizing massive Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses) I’m feeling stuck. For the first time, I’ve made it to the final stages with 8 companies, but unlike before when I’d land multiple offers, I'm totally out of luck.What’s changed?Why are companies acting like jerks?Last week, I had a design review meeting with an athletic clothing company, and the guy grilled me on specific design details that felt like his assigned homework; then he rejected me. I’ve spent days working on over 10 take-home assignments, and some looked like Jira tasks, only to get this: “While your take-home showed solid architectural thinking and familiarity with a wide range of data tools, the team felt you lacked the clarity and technical depth to match in the design review meeting.”Seriously? Last year, I was hiring a senior BI engineer and couldn’t find anyone who could write a left join SQL, and now I’m expected to write a query for complex marketing metrics on the fly and still fall short?Here’s what I’ve noticed:* Take-home assignments often feel like ticket work, not real evaluations.* Teams seem to gatekeep, shutting out anyone new.* There’s a huge gap between job descriptions and technical discussions. e.g., the JD and hiring manager were all about AWS Glue, but the technical questions were focused on managing and optimizing a self-hosted Spark cluster on Kubernetes.* Transferable skills get ignored. I’ve worked with BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, Apache Beam, MongoDB, Airflow, Databricks, GCP, AWS, and set up Delta Lake in my assignment, but I couldn't recite the technical differences between Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Nope, not good enough. I got rejected.Do you guys really know all the technologies? Are you some sort of god or what? I can’t know every tech, but I can master anything new. why won’t they see that anymore?I’m tired of this crap! It’s not fair. No one values transferable skills anymore; they demand an exact match on tech stack, plus a massive time spent on prep work: online exams and technical assignments, only to get a “no” at the end.\-----\[EDIT\]I'm not a victim here; I already have a job with decent pay, 17 years of experience, and I want to switch to a better team with a 10% pay cut because I have a shitty boss.",455,0.93,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mbs1iw/data_engineering_job_market_what_the_hell_happened/,2025-07-28 20:52:39,2025-08-02 01:48:14

1md5wp9,quick PSA on LLM fear.,Thinker_Assignment,dataengineering,"hey folks, i see a lot of fear of LLMs and i just wanted to say we are doing ourselves a disservice by having knee jerk reactions against it.# The real threat isn’t replacement. It’s displacement.Your work isn’t actually replaceable by autocomplete. But it **looks like it is,** and that’s the problem.LLMs are built to sound confident, not to be correct. They generate fluent, plausible output that gives the *illusion* of competence, without understanding, judgment, or responsibility.So the danger isn’t the model. **It’s your manager thinking you’re replaceable.** Or their manager pressuring them to “do more AI, less people.” Or a CFO using AI as cover for layoffs in a foggy, panic-driven economy.You won’t be replaced by a language model. But you can be **displaced** by the perception that one is “good enough.” The next few years look the same: Industry is adding: memory, tools, multimodal input, even planning— Still out of reach, no clear pathway ahead: **true cognition, self-awareness, reasoning under uncertainty, and grounded understanding.** even today for cognitive restructuring and grounding we use 2k year old methods like socratic questioning - we're nowhere close to solving this.# How you can win this fight Right now, every company is standing in a dense AI fog. No one knows what’s real, what’s hype, or how to use these tools safely.The most valuable roles today? They go to the **LLM navigators** — the people who understand what's possible, what’s coming, and how to steer through uncertainty.It’s the same prestige arc we saw with data 15 years ago. With ML 5–10 years ago. And now it’s your turn.You don’t need to be an LLM expert. But if you’re the one testing tools, forming opinions, stress-testing outputs, and helping others make sense of it all — you’ve already stepped into leadership.**Be the scout.** The one-eyed engineer guiding the blind through this strange new frontier. It’s improv now. The answer is “yes, and…” → Yes, and let’s do it safely. → Yes, and let’s make the most of it. → Yes, and let’s not blow up the business.But “no”? no AI, no experiments, no change? This will get interpreted as “no value.” ""falling behind"" ""missed opportunity"" ""company risk"". And if you’re a blocker, the system will set you free and find a helper.So don’t be a victim. Don’t freeze. Don’t frame it as *you vs. AI.* That’s a losing game.Frame it as: **“I’m the one who understands AI. I’ll help us use it — safely, effectively, and with eyes open.”**That’s who companies want. That’s who they’re **desperate** to invest in. And while you personally as an engineer may not care, this is the **prestige** that data managers in large companies are after - they want to be the person steering the company in AI age, keep job, get promoted, take credit for riding the possibilities out there. It's almost like whitepapers used to be a few years ago. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

1m9xbk5,Primary Keys: Am I crazy?,bengen343,dataengineering,"TLDR: Is there any reason *not* to use primary keys in your data warehouse? Even if there aren't any legitimate reasons, what are your devil's advocate arguments against using them?Maybe I am, indeed, the one who is crazy here since I'm interested in getting the thoughts of actual humans rather than ChatGPT, but... I've encountered quite the gamut of warehouse designs over the course of my time, especially in my consulting days. During this time, I've come to think of primary keys as ""table stakes"" (har har) in the creation of any table. In all my time, I've only encountered two outfits that didn't have any sort of key strategy. In the case of the first, their explanation was ""Ah yeah, we messed that up and should probably fix that."" But, now, in the case of this latest one, they're treating their lack of keys as a legitimate design choice. This seems unbelievable to me, but I thought I'd take this to the judgement of the broader group: is there a good reason to avoid having any primary keys?I think there are ample reasons to have some sort of key strategy:* Data quality tests: makes it easier to check for unique records and guard against things like fanout.* Lineage: makes it easy to trace the movement of a single record through tables.* Keeps code DRY (don't repeat yourself): effective use of primary/foreign keys can prevent complex \`join\` logic from being repeated in multiple places. * Not to mention general \`join\` efficiency* Interpretability: makes it easier for users to intuitively reason about a table's grain and the way \`join\`s should work.I'd be curious if anyone has any arguments against the above bullets or keys in data warehouses, specifically, more broadly.Full disclosure, I may turn this discussion into a blog post so I can lay out my argument once and for all.

1mce29s,A little rant on (aspiring) data engineers,Stock-Contribution-6,dataengineering,"Hi all, this is a little rant on data engineering candidates mostly, but also about hiring processes.As everybody, I've been on the candidate side of the process a lot over the years and processes are all over the place, so I understand both the complaints on being asked leetcode/cs theory questions or being tasked with take-home assigned that feel like actual tickets. Thankfully I've never been judged by an AI bot or did any video hiring.That's why now that I've been hiring people I try to design a process that is humane, checks on the actual concepts rather than tools or cs theory and gets an overview of the candidate's programming skills.Now the meat of my rant starts. I see curriculums filled to the brim with all the tools in existance and very few years of experience. I see peopel straight up using AI for every single question in the most blatant way possible. Many candidates mostly cannot code at all past the level of a YouTube tutorial.It's very grim and there seems to be just no shame in feeding any request in any form to the latest bullshit AI that spews out complete trash.Rant over. I don't think most people will take this seriously or listen to what I'm saying because it's a delicate subject, but if you have to take anything out of this post is to stop using AIs for the technical part because it's very easy to spot and it doesn't help anybody.TLDR: stop using AI for the technical step of hiring, it's more damaging than anything",125,0.89,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mce29s/a_little_rant_on_aspiring_data_engineers/,2025-07-29 15:12:15,2025-08-02 01:48:14
1maloa5,Leaving a Company Where I’m the Only One Who Knows How Things Work. Advice?,WasabiBobbie,dataengineering,"Hey all,I’m in a bit of a weird spot and wondering if anyone else has been through something similar.I’m about to put in my two weeks at a company where, honestly, I’m the only one who knows how most of our in-house systems and processes work. I manage critical data processing pipelines that, if not handled properly, could cost the company a lot of money. These systems were built internally and never properly documented, not for lack of trying, but because we’ve been operating on a skeleton crew for years. I've asked for help and bandwidth, but it never came. That’s part of why I’m leaving: the pressure has become too much.Here’s the complication:I made the decision to accept a new job the day before I left for a long-planned vacation.My new role starts right after my trip, so I’ll be giving my notice during my vacation, meaning 1/4th of my two weeks will be PTO.I didn’t plan it like this. It’s just unfortunate timing.I genuinely don’t want to leave them hanging, so I plan to offer help after hours and on weekends for a few months to ensure they don’t fall apart. I want to do right by the company and my coworkers.Has anyone here done something similar, offering post-resignation support?How did you propose it?Did you charge them, and if so, how did you structure it?Do you think my offer to help after hours makes up for the shortened two-week period?Is this kind of timing faux pas as bad as it feels?Appreciate any thoughts or advice, especially from folks who’ve been in the “only one who knows how everything works” position.",127,0.87,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1maloa5/leaving_a_company_where_im_the_only_one_who_knows/,2025-07-27 12:59:37,2025-08-02 01:48:14

1mbap0p,How to automate data quality,Assasinshock,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I'm currently doing an internship where I'm working on a data lakehouse architecture. So far, I've managed to ingest data from the different databases I have access to and land everything into the bronze layer.Now I'm moving on to data quality checks and cleanup, and that’s where I’m hitting a wall. I’m familiar with the general concepts of data validation and cleaning, but up until now, I’ve only applied them on relatively small and simple datasets.This time, I’m dealing with multiple databases and a large number of tables, which makes things much more complex. I’m wondering: is it possible to automate these data quality checks and the cleanup process before promoting the data to the silver layer?Right now, the only approach I can think of is to brute-force it, table by table—which obviously doesn't seem like the most scalable or efficient solution.Have any of you faced a similar situation?

1mbypdh,Is data engineering becoming more plug and play? A few questions about the profession.,EversonElias,dataengineering,"I got into data engineering during the pandemic, when an internship opportunity came up. I find the profession interesting, but I don't think I've ever really found myself in it. What's more, I've only had experience with medium-complexity projects. I don't think I ever really worked with big data. That's why I decided to ask you about it, because my view may have some negative bias.Where I've worked, I've used a lot of ready-made solutions on well-known platforms, such as Databricks, GCP and Azure (including Fabric). With each passing day, I feel that I've picked up many ready-made things. The connectors are ready, the platforms are ready and some already offer options to optimize automatically. Not that it's a bad thing, because this abstraction makes work easier and allows us to focus on what's most important: modeling, security, scalability, data quality, etc.However, even that makes me a little worried about my future in the profession. The platforms are going to offer more and more pre-assembled configurations. What will be left to challenge me in the profession? Sometimes I see myself as a doer of the same things and less of a creator... I've sent out a few CVs recently and haven't had many replies, so it could be that I'm actually taking a rather pessimistic view. Today, counting a year and a half of internship, I'm going on three and a half years in data engineering.Anyway, what do you think?",31,0.9,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mbypdh/is_data_engineering_becoming_more_plug_and_play_a/,2025-07-29 01:38:42,2025-08-02 01:48:14

I started in GIS for a couple years in the public sector, teaching myself Python, SQL, and OOP. Automated some stuff in ArcPy, tinkered using trial and error. At the time, didn’t really know what unit testing was or best practices, just scripting things I can run manually to automate work or calculations.Then through a combination of skills I built and connections I got a BI job for a year or two, again in the public sector, building more skills in power bi, sql, and python to load data into sql. Learned more about reusability, but didn’t really fundamentally understand software development. We were a shop where my manager or other people on the team didn’t really want to learn beyond what was necessary, and I was just figuring things out through trial and error again as the only guy who was motivated. No unit testing or anything there either. I didn’t even really know about best practices or unit testing until my current job.Fast forward, through other connections I got a referral to a F200 company where tech is not the product. Got the job as “data engineer”. Ever since joining I feel like a total failure. We have one person on the team younger than me who has been there a couple years, is whip smart, initiates convos with the business, and is already promoted to senior. Everyone else is 10+ year seniors. My problems are the following:- Upon my hire, the tech lead was a total asshole, denigrating my abilities via passive aggressive behavior, destroying my confidence. He has since left. I went to my manager about it and at one point let some tears out saying I feel like I was doing a bad job, and I feel like they no longer respect me. We no longer have 1:1s or talk about anything really while he still talks regularly to the rest of the team- My technical intuition is nowhere near as strong as my peers, and I often need hand holding in solution design- I make dumb mistakes and am not as attentive to detail as I feel I should be, occasionally rushing my work due to feeling like if I don’t I’ll be found out as a fraud - An example of this is manually editing a bunch of JSON, where with no way to test it across a couple hundred lines I had a few typos- I am the only “BI” guy in my org, everyone else is stronger in software engineering. Everyone. Our team is based on developing a new data platform and reporting solution, but everything from the app to the data pipelines feels out of my depth, seeing as my background is in developing much lower level solutions. Our org is all CRUD devs. I’ve never even written a unit test, and most of my work has been SQL pipelines or reporting- I don’t give a shit about the domain (by this - I mean the business, not DE). I thought the money would make me care, and I still kind of try, but I don’t have the fire to go and seek out knowledge beyond what I need to for my current tasksNobody has told me I’m doing poorly directly but I’ve had conversations about my lack of attention to detail with one of my peers, just being warned to take my time and have it done right.I guess it’s just the constant comparing myself to not only my teammates but everyone around me. I feel like the village idiot. My first jobs had a mentality of “let’s figure it out together”, despite a lack of desire to really go beyond to learn more than necessary. Now, the pressure to deliver is higher, and I feel woefully behind. I also struggle to be motivated.

You pay for all tables replicated, even if many are not used now.2) Less flexibility: archiving/access to raw data is tied to Redshift; older/unused data still incurs cost.3) Possible need to manage Redshift partitioning, retention policies, and performance tuning as more data accumulates.I am confused what to use. Directly landing into redshift makes things so much more easier and using it as a data lake and then periodically unloading to s3.

Some are operational logs, others are reference datasets or ad hoc data pulls. This makes it hard to define a universal naming strategy.In the gold layer, we use standard prefixes like `dim_` and `fact_` where applicable, but we often have tables that don’t neatly fall into dimension or fact categories.

1mdw8ef,Architecture advices on AWS,Adrien0623,dataengineering,"Hey!I recently joined a new company as their first data engineer. The team had already set up a basic data warehouse, but I see opportunities to improve its scalability and efficiency.In my previous roles, I primarily worked with GCP using BigQuery, Dataproc, and Airflow-managed Spark jobs. I found that stack to be clean, scalable, and cost-effective as a batch oriented pipeline. Now that I’m working in an AWS environment, I’m adapting to a different toolset and architecture.Here’s a high-level overview of the current setup:- Ingestion: Airbyte pulls data from backend databases every few minutes.- Storage & Transformation: A provisioned Redshift cluster serves as the warehouse, with DBT jobs triggered by GitHub Actions.- Consumption: A back-office app queries both Redshift (when joins accross backend services data are required) and the backend databases (for real-time needs).While this works for now, it lacks scalability and clarity. Key challenges I’ve identified:- No data partitioning, due to Airbyte’s current limitations. It's still striking that they don't support it on such important connectors as Redshift or S3...- No clear separation between data lake and data mart, making the warehouse feel disorganized.- Redshift is over-provisioned and underutilized, resulting in high costs for relatively low value.- When backend databases schemas changes (which is frequent), there's often a lot of manual procedure to handle breaking changes.To address this, I’m considering the following changes:- Replace Redshift with Athena + Glue to cut costs and enable a more flexible, serverless architecture—accepting a bit more latency in return.- Eventually replace Airbyte with Spark or Glue-based ingestion, to introduce time partitioning and better control (though some source tables lack timestamp fields, which limits options for now).- Move away from GitHub Actions and adopt a more robust scheduler like Airflow.- Possibly replace DBT with Spark for greater flexibility in the long term.- Add a BI tool connected on the data warehouse to enable self service analysis internally.Given the company expects significant data growth, I’d like to design something more scalable, but still pragmatic and cost effective. For now many people agree the current architecture is problematic, that processes are complex and error-prone and that we have little observability and room for improvements. However due to organization structures I have little impact or decision level on data models, migrations etc. And because many people don't have data expertise or experience it's often hard to make them understand some challenges and why some practices are problematic and not future-proof.

1mbbnlf,Dreaming of Graphs in the Open Lakehouse,ssinchenko,dataengineering,"**TLDR:**I’ve been thinking a lot about making graphs first-class citizens in the Open Lakehouse ecosystem. Tables, geospatial data, and vectors are already considered first-class citizens, but property graphs are not. In my opinion, this is a significant gap, especially given the growing popularity of AI and Graph RAG. To achieve this, we need at least two components: tooling for graph processing and a storage standard like open tables (e.g., Apache Iceberg).Regarding storage, there is a young project called Apache GraphAr (incubating) that aims to become the storage standard for property graphs. The processing ecosystem is already interesting:* GraphFrames (batch, scalable, and distributed). Think of it as Apache Spark for graphs.* Kuzu is fast, in-memory, and in-process. Think of it as DuckDB for graphs.* Apache HugeGraph is a standalone server for queries and can be thought of as a Clickhouse or Doris for graphs.HugeGraph already supports reading and writing GraphAr to some extent. Support will be available soon in GraphFrames (I hope so, and I'm working on it as well). Kuzu developers have also expressed interest and informed me that, technically, it should not be very difficult (and the GraphAr ticket is already open).This is just my personal vision—maybe even a dream. It feels like all the pieces are finally here, and I’d love to see them come together.",10,0.92,2,https://semyonsinchenko.github.io/ssinchenko/post/dreams-about-graph-in-lakehouse/,2025-07-28 09:31:59,2025-08-02 01:48:14
1meipzo,"Using SQL to auto-classify customer feedback at scale, zero python and pure SQL with Cortex",New-Ship-5404,dataengineering,"I wanted to share something practical that we recently implemented, which might be useful for others working with unstructured data.We received a growing volume of customer feedback through surveys, with thousands of text responses coming in weekly. The manual classification process was becoming unsustainable: slow, inconsistent, and impossible to scale.Instead of spinning up Python-based NLP pipelines or fine-tuning models, we tried something surprisingly simple: **Snowflake Cortex's** `CLASSIFY_TEXT()` function directly in SQL.A simple example: SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.CLASSIFY_TEXT( 'Delivery was fast but support was unhelpful', ['Product', 'Customer Service', 'Delivery', 'UX'] ) AS category; We took it a step further and plugged this into a scheduled task to automatically label incoming feedback every week. Now the pipeline runs itself, and sentiment and category labels get applied without any manual touchpoints.It’s not perfect (nothing is), but it’s consistent, fast, and gets us 90% of the way with near-zero overhead.If you're working with survey data, CSAT responses, or other customer feedback streams, this might be worth exploring.

1mcrhcq,Offer decision,Existing-Mousse3509,dataengineering,"Hi, first of all I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this, for my English (as it's not my first language), and for any mistakes since this is my first time posting.I'm writing here to ask for advice regarding a decision I need to make between two offers I've received. I'm unsure which one to take, as I’m trying to evaluate how each could benefit me in the future.To give some context, I have a BSc in Computer Science and worked for a year as a Software Engineer. During that time, I became interested in data, so I decided to leave my job and enroll in a Master’s in Data Science, from which I recently graduated. During the program, I was particularly interested in subjects related to Big Data and Cloud, more so than ML and DL. Then I started to see Data Engineering as a great career path, since I think it combines my previous software engineering skills with data, and I’m also quite interested in architecture.Now, about the two offers:On one hand, I received an offer from a tech consultancy focused on data. It’s aimed at recent graduates and includes a short training period in technologies like Scala and Spark, after which you start working on a client project. I like that this offer is very focused on people wanting to pursue a Data Engineering career, which really appeals to me. It also offers full remote work, which I appreciate (although I’d also like the option to go to the office and meet people). From what I’ve seen, over time you can progress toward a Data Architect role, which I also find interesting.However, most of the people who have been part of this program in previous years seem to come from non-tech backgrounds or bootcamps, and managed to get in with minimal justification. In fact, when I got the offer call, they told me I was one of the most qualified candidates they’d seen in terms of education and IT experience, which made me a bit skeptical. Another downside is that this offer pays less than the second one, and I might end up being subcontracted to the same client that the second offer comes from.The second offer comes from a well-known bank in my country. After going through several processes, I was offered the position of ""Data Scientist Analyst"", and they told me I could choose the department that interested me most. I chose the Engineering department because it seemed the most appealing, and they mentioned that they work closely with other Data Engineers and Architects. Even though they mentioned some technologies I’m familiar with (Python, SQL, PySpark, Git, BigQuery, CI/CD), it still feels like the role is more data science–oriented than engineering.The positives are that the bank pays more and has better benefits overall, and it could add some prestige to my cv even if the experience isn’t exactly what I’m looking for. On the downside, I'm required to go to the office 3 days a week, and it’s quite far from where I live by public transport. If I want to drive there, I’d have to wake up very early to avoid traffic and not lose my whole day. Also, from what I’ve read and seen from others working there, the role seems very focused on ML, which doesn’t excite me that much, I actually got Little bit bored of it during the Master’s. But then again, maybe working on ML in a real job is very different from studying it in university, so it might turn out to be more interesting than I expect.That’s why I’m unsure whether I should take the first offer or take a chance on the second one, see if I like it, and if not, try to pivot to a more suitable project/ department or job in the bank, and leave with some experience if it doesn’t work out. I feel like if I reject the bank now, I probably won’t get another chance to work there in the future.So I’m looking for opinions and different perspectives from others, because honestly, I feel a bit lost and don’t really know which path to take since nowadays Data Engineering seems more appealing.Again, sorry because probably I forgot to mention so many details, either way I’ll be happy to answer questions you might have.",10,0.78,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mcrhcq/offer_decision/,2025-07-29 23:49:57,2025-08-02 01:48:14

1m9nykt,Data Quality Profiling/Reporting tools,Kojimba228,dataengineering,"Hi,When trying to Google for the tools matching my usecase, there is so much bloat, blurred definitions and ads that I'm confused out of my mind with this one. I will attempt to describe my requirements to the best of my ability, with certain constraints that we have and which are mandatory. Okay, so, our usecase is consuming a dataset via AWS Lakeformation shared access. Read-only, with the dataset being governed by another team (and very poorly at that).Data in the tables is partitioned on two keys, each representing a source database and schema from which a given table was ingested. Primarily, the changes that we want to track are: 1. count of nulls in columns of each table (an average would do, I think; reason for it is they once have pushed a change where nulls occupied majority of the columns and records, which went unnoticed for some time :smiling_face_with_tear:)2. changes in table volume (only increase is expected, but you never know)3. schema changes (either Data type changes, or, primarily, new column additions)4. Place for extended fancy reports to feed to BAs to do some digging, but if not available it's not a showstopper. To do the profiling/reporting we have the option of using Glue (with PySpark), Lambda functions, Athena. This what I tried so far:1. Gx. Overbloated, overcomplicated, doesn't do simple or extended summary reports, without predefined checks/""expectations"";2. Ydata-profiling. Doesn't support missing values check with PySpark, even if provided PySpark dataframe it casts it to pandas (bruh). 3. Just write custom PySpark code to collect the required checks. While doable, yes, setting up another visualisation layer on top, is surely going to be a pain in the ass. Plus, all this feels like redeveloping the wheel. Am I wrong to assume that a tool exists that has the capabilities described?

I currently have a dictionary object that I just set some first level data in. I save this dictionary object several times as a file up in a bucket. This tracks information about the process such asa. did i log into the API successfullyb. how much data is availablec. how much data did i download successfullyd. did the api report any license changes when queried.This is all separate from the API data that I download and save. I want to save the process information as it helps me troubleshoot and manage what happened. I then process the process information json file after the fact to see what happened. The read/report process runs in a different code base so the idea of having json is nice since i dont have to care about the json being a certain structure. I output some text to a chat bot to a small group of users. I would like to send some more information in the read/report process via email; or even save to a database and stand up a simple self hosted streamlit process. However, when I report it's a straight one-shot read the json files saved, do some simple calcs in pandas and output to a chat room. I dont save the metrics in another datasource.However i would like to send a lot more information in the json file as the process runs. And I want to report on it. Each process has several disparate steps that it goes through. I am thinking that I should convert the json file to a pub sub event process that publishes to a database. I have GCP so i can use pub sub, I also have access to a simple postgresdb to publish to. I do like that my stack is simple (json file to bucket) but i also know that I am not getting information that I want.Thoughts on how I could improve on this? I dont mind adding something to the stack to support it. Adding something like Sentry would be my last choice at the moment as I am trying to keep the reporting stack closer in house.

1marnw3,Dimensional Modeling Periodic Snapshot Standard Practices,Boltonet12,dataengineering,"Our company is relatively new to using dimensional models but we have a need for viewing account balances at certain points in time. Our company has billions of customer accounts so to take daily snapshots of these balances would be millions per day (excluding 0 dollar balances because our business model closes accounts once reaching 0). What I've imagined was creating a periodic snapshot fact table where the balance for each account would utilize the snapshot from the end of the day but only include rows for end of week, end of month, and yesterday (to save memory and processing for days we are not interested in); then utilize a flag in the date dimension table to filter to monthly dates, weekly dates, or current data. I know standard periodic snapshot tables have predefined intervals; to me this sounds like a daily snapshot table that utilizes the dimension table to filter to the dates you're interested in. My leadership seems to feel that this should be broken out into three different fact tables (current, weekly, monthly). I feel that this is excessive because it's the same calculation (all time balance at end of day) and could have overlap (i.e. yesterday could be end of week and end of month). Since this is balances at a point in time at end of day and there is no aggregations to achieve ""weekly"" or ""monthly"" data, what is standard practice here? Should we take leadership's advice or does it make more sense the way I envisioned it?

Use Airflow’s data_interval_start macro to identify and read all S3 files for the relevant partition and generate a manifest file.2. Use the manifest to load data into a Redshift staging table via the COPY command.3. Perform an upsert from the staging table into the target table.I plan to run the data load on ECS, with Airflow triggering the ECS task on schedule.My main question: I want to decouple config changes (YAML updates) from changes in the EL pipeline code.Would it make sense to store the YAML configs in S3 and pass a reference (like the S3 path or config name) to the ECS task via environment variables or task parameters?Also I want to create a separate ECS task for each table, is dynamic task mapping the best way to do this? Is there a way i get the number of tables from the config file and then pass it as a parameter to dynamic task mapping? Is this a viable and scalable approach?

1ma19ck,App Integrations and the Data Lake,Full_Metal_Analyst,dataengineering,"We're trying to get away from our legacy DE tool, BO Data Services. A couple years ago we migrated our on prem data warehouse and related jobs to ADLS/Synapse/Databricks. Our app to app integrations that didn't source from the data warehouse were out of scope for the migration and those jobs remained in BODS. Working tables and history are written to an on prem SQL server, and the final output is often csv files that are sftp'ed to the target system/vendor. For on-prem targets, sometimes the job writes the data directly in.We'll eventually drop BODS altogether, but for now we want to build any new integrations using our new suite of tools. We have our first new integration we want to build outside of BODS, but after I saw the initial architecture plan for it, I brought together a larger architect group to discuss and align on a standard for this type of use case. The design was going to use a medallion architecture in the same storage account and bronze/silver/gold containers as the data warehouse uses and write back to the same on prem SQL we've been using, so I wanted to have a larger discussion about how to design for this.We've had our initial discussion and plan on continuing early next week, and I feel like we've improved a ton on the design but still have some decisions to make, especially around storage design (storage accounts, containers, folders) and where we might put the data so that our reporting tool can read it (on-prem SQL server write back, Azure SQL database, Azure Synapse, Databricks SQL warehouse).Before we finalize our standard for app integrations, I wanted to see if anyone had any specific guidance or resources I could read up on to help us make good decisions.For more context, we don't have any specific iPaaS tools, and the integrations that we support are fine to be processed in batches (typically once a day but some several times a day), so real-time/event-based use cases are not something we need to solve for here. We'll be using Databricks Python notebooks for the logic, unity catalog managed tables for storage (ADLS), and likely piloting orchestration using Datbricks for this first integration too (orchestration has been using Azure up to now).Thanks in advance for any help!",4,0.83,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ma19ck/app_integrations_and_the_data_lake/,2025-07-26 18:56:38,2025-08-02 01:48:14

I'm setting up a webhook to API Gateway to S3 and want to use MSK to a processed bucket (i.e. Silver layer), and then send to Redshift. Normally I would just have a Lambda run an insert, but the boss also wants to reduce our reliance on that because ”it's too messy”. (Also if you have recommendations for better architecture here I'm open to ideas).Of course the boss asked me to look into Talend to do the whole thing.

Interested in tech and gaming, wants to be a ""coder"" when he's older, seems to have the inquisitive mind that it takes. However, he is still pretty young and doesn't have a computer yet. I am looking for gift ideas that will encourage and tap into that ""coding desire"" but aren't necessarily ""learning to code"" yet. These can be games, books or anything of the sort, maybe even android apps but it would be nicer if it was something physical. So far the only thing i've really thought of is redstone books / guides so he can do some minecraft logic. However, I would prefer something more physical. These don't need to be directly coding related but anything that will stimulate that tinkerer, programmer, problem solving mind. Bonus if it is coding related but I'd settle for something that scratches the programming itch. I know of scratch, but as he doesn't have a computer, I think ill save that one for a little later when he does.edit: Whoa, this blew up fast. Thanks everyone for your answers, there are some great suggestions.. including just getting him a computer (which I agree - but I have to convince his mum on that one first!).

1mcdj71,Is it just me or is AI vibe coding the most painful and infuriating thing ever?,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"Now, I may be biased because I'm all for learning to code, but holy Christ the amount of times that I have given AI a chance, it has done nothing but hurt me emotionally. I have NO IDEA how those ""no-code"" people are even making ANYTHING half useful, maybe it's because they haven't learned how to code so to them all the AI obstacles are normal, but to someone who actually understands what should be happening, it hurts my soul.So, I'm big on the backend, that's what I like doing. I'm fine with making a website, I'm fine with HTML, I'm fine with JavaScript, but you're not catching me writing any CSS and so I let AI do it. ""Style it this way with the color scheme we specified and maintain the same style for the borders that we've been using, and put each element in it's own little border side-by side"". I paste in the CSS and the button is black instead of pink and each element is listed vertically instead of horizontally like I asked it to. And so what do I do? I tell it to please fix it. ""They're not side-by-side, they're being listed vertically, please fix it or tell me what changes to make, here is the broken code"". I paste the supposedly ""corrected code"" and.... nothing is corrected, IT'S STILL THE SAME. I spent at least 8 minutes doing that when I'm sure that if I had learned CSS like a normal front-end developer, I would've been able to solve that problem in 2 minutes max. And you know what the worst part is? The AI will tell you with 100% confidence, ""Oof, you're so close! Here is the corrected version"", and it's not the correct version.Another example, a few days ago I tried to give vibe coding another chance, just for the experience. I installed Cursor and I told the AI exactly what app I wanted to make. I wanted a mobile app that let's users track their water intake, calories, and create workout plans with a calendar in the app, the UI will be built with Kotlin, the backend with Java and the database will be SQLite. Very popular technologies used for mobile development, so it should be easy right? No, the AI couldn't even get past installing Java dependencies. It installed Gradle, but it installed version 4 which doesn't work with Java 21 and so instead of recommending that we upgrade Gradle, it instead recommends that we DOWNGRADE JAVA, to Java 17 WHICH ALSO DOESN'T WORK WITH GRADLE VERSION 4. I ended up giving up like 20 minutes into trying to start the damn project, I swear it was this back and forth of ""seems like this isn't working, should I proceed with ...?"" I press proceed because it seems like a reasonable thing to do and it didn't work, over and over and over again and because I know nothing about Kotlin and Java I didn't even know how to debug the thing, which makes the experience even more frustrating.

To my surprise there was a huge difference in the way they solved questions.This experience completely changed my perspective on learning programming. For many topics like system design or learning a new language, a week of focused effort can cover most essentials.

At least I'll have a major and a double minor instead of a double major--my other minor incidentally enough is also one of my favorite hobbies.

However, I’m unsure what the job landscape looks like for this path:•What kinds of jobs typically involve low-level programming (outside of the usual embedded/firmware developer roles)?•Are there realistic remote opportunities in this field? Or is most of the work tied to physical labs/offices due to hardware access?•Any tips on what kinds of projects or skills I should build to get my foot in the door?I’d really appreciate any advice, stories, or resources from people already working in this space.

What’s next?",Grumpy_Gremlin49,learnprogramming,"I’m very new to computer programming but also very eager to learn. I’ve read a lot of Reddit posts but still can’t get a great answer for this question. Once I’ve written my Python code, what do I do with it?

Do I copy and paste that code into specific software to make an application? Where do I put this code next to do anything meaningful? It seems useless in PyCharm. I want to “action” it. I’ve watched a ton of YouTube videos and can run regression analysis and do basic strings/variables that provide info within PyCharm. But if I wanted to program a simple rock, paper, scissors game into a website, then what do I do with the code? Is this where mobile application software and website design software come in? Do I paste this code into this type of software to actually “create the game”? And not just have it spit out random variables (Rock, paper, or scissors) in PyCharm?

1mf0jc4,Should a student learn computer science with pseudocode first to learn programming or learn programming through projects to learn computer science? How to get out of the theory->application-> theory loop?,tree332,learnprogramming,"I tried to learn CS both out of an interest to learn about applied mathematics field and to understand the theory behind software development. I had taken an intermediate java course and while I often asked for help, I thought I was prepared for the next semester of: linear algebra, intro to discrete math, intro to dsa. I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.In linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor. I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems, but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \*any\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation. In discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me. In intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.I ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.I have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school. I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year, but I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS degree curriculum on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.When I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. when I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as ""how to draw a 2d triangle program"" opens up a new journey learning the opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.I have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. I then go back to an ""intro to java/python/c# course"" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages. I don't understand how a computer is able to encode the concept of inequality such as 2 <3 or why I need a current and temp variable when traversing an array or swapping array values.I'm not quite sure how to move forward.",11,0.93,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mf0jc4/should_a_student_learn_computer_science_with/,2025-08-01 16:07:01,2025-08-02 01:48:15

1mb8cvh,"Need Advice: 1 Year to Graduate, Learning Java But Feeling Lost and Frustrated",mosahel,learnprogramming,"Hello,Just to clarify, I started with programming and all this tech stuff at the very beginning of 2024. I always knew about computers, but never actually owned one until then—so I began with touch typing on January 4, learned HTML, CSS, and basically figured out how to use a computer properly for those first 3–4 months. I had some help from a senior in the summer (May–June) with HTML, CSS, and JS, and it felt pretty intuitive and fun.Then I decided to seriously learn the MERN stack and bought Colt Steele’s Web Dev course in July, which covered HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS, and VSC (Git, GitHub). But because of academic pressure, I barely coded at all during the final months of 2024—I got wrapped up more in Linux, version control, vim, and stuff like that and actually got pretty good at it. During a gap in November–December, I really enjoyed working with Linux, Lua, and was a Dotfile Engineer for a bit (which was honestly way more my vibe). Then, I learned some Python at a bootcamp in college/university, circled back to JavaScript in March, and then got into React in April/May.I’ll admit, I was really just rushing through React so I could get to backend stuff—I kept getting frustrated with frontend, and after talking with a couple of techie friends (with 7–8 years of experience each), they told me I’d probably be happier and do better if I went into backend, considering how much I liked working with Linux and all. I realized frontend really isn’t my thing: I can tweak things decently, but I can’t design or build from scratch like true frontend devs.So now, I’m currently in my 6th semester of engineering with exactly one year and 28 days left to graduate. I’ve just started learning Java and I’m actually liking it, especially compared to some parts of frontend. In my country, Java also seems to have way better career prospects, and the React/frontend job market is extremely saturated—tons of applicants for every position.Right now, the challenge is I’m just not sure how to organize my next steps. There’s a lot of anxiety because I’m still new, I’ve got 5 backlogs (3 in Maths), and it’s hard to stay motivated or focused when I don’t even know what to prioritize—should I hammer down Java fundamentals, focus on DSA, Leetcode, frameworks like Spring Boot, or work on projects? I really want to make the most of this last year so I don’t end up with no job at the end, but I could use some advice—even just on what to learn, what order to tackle things, or how to structure my study time.If anyone’s been in a similar situation, or has tips for making the most of this final stretch—whether it’s about Java, backend projects, passing those backlogs, or handling the stress of not knowing what’s next—I’d really appreciate any guidance.Thank you!",7,0.78,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mb8cvh/need_advice_1_year_to_graduate_learning_java_but/,2025-07-28 05:58:59,2025-08-02 01:48:15

I've been with said company for almost 11 months now.Over this past year, I've tasked with single-handedly developing an internal web application. This app includes a range of features - from web scrapers and data preprocessing scripts, to systems for managing and rating external collaborators, and even some AI agents that automate repetitive tasks.The stack I'd chosen to work with is Next.js, FastAPI and PostgreSQL.I won't lie - the journey developing this app has been a tough one. Being fresh out of university with limited knowledge and experience, and the only developer in the whole company meant a lot of trial and error and ambiguity in the beginning. But that challenge has also proven to help me grow as a person. I've learned many things of which I had no idea about before.That said, due to heavy nature of said responsibility and time constrains, I've also relied quite heavily on AI whenever I would hit a roadblock. While it's been helpful, I feel like it made me skip the deeper learning that comes from reading the docs and explore various sites, such as StackOverflow and others. Now, that the app had reached a solid state, I would like to go back and rectify my past mistakes.So now, I'm reaching out to the more experienced devs here:What books, courses, or other resources would you wholeheartedly recommend to someone who wants to deepen their skills, fill in knowledge gaps, and become truly solid - maybe even a ""cracked developer""? Something that would make me stand out from the rest of my peers as a SWE.Through this job, I’ve discovered a strong passion for Python, backend development (FastAPI) and Generative AI (LangGraph and LLMs' APIs) - so I’d love to also hear your suggestions on these topics on how I can become more proficient, perhaps even share with me some valuable tips.As I've mentioned earlier, being a solo dev - a beginner, nonetheless - often felt like I was missing out on a real growth experience. I didn’t have someone more experienced to learn from, to guide me when I was stuck, or just to point me in the right direction when things got overwhelming. I’m also pretty sure that while building the internal web app, there were better tools or approaches I could’ve used — I just didn’t know about them at the time. That's why I want to change that.

Dependency injection. This is as straightforward as it gets. If a manager needs access to a resource, just pass it into the constructor.2. Service location. This is a pattern whereby managers, after initialization, are registered into a centralized registry as pointers to themselves. If another manager needs access to a resource, just request a pointer to the manager that owns it through the service locator.Here's my question: In especially large-scale projects that involve A LOT of communication between its managers, are multithreaded, and especially do unit testing, what is the better approach: dependency injection or service location?

Something else except Python?,Kindly_Radish_8594,learnprogramming,"Short summary of my background: I worked a couple of years as C# dev and made various small (mostly personal) projects in C++ and TypeScript. During this time, my professional focus shifted away from programming and it became more of an hobby.So, I wanted to learn something new and started (of course) with Python. Long story short: Yes, it's super easy and great for prototyping but I simply can't stand the syntax and some other features. Probably too settled down in C-like languages.However, I still want to learn something new. Just for the sake of learning tbh. Since I'll (probably) stick with some personal CLI tools for automation and simple tasks I don't need languages with sophisticated GUI or ML support. Code should be running with little to no effort on both, Windows and Linux (MacOS is nice to have, but not a must)My first idea was to check out Go, since it's syntax and overall featureset seems appealing to me. Same goes for Rust although the borrow-checker is... ""something different""Question now: Do you have any input on why to go (or not go) whith the one or other language? Might something be more suited for my purposes?

1m9n8ew,Got Laid Off 12 Days Ago and Signed an Offer Today - Here's My Sankey Diagram,Yung_Carrot,cscareerquestions,"*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC >$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*I always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)I do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.As for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a ""Mandatory Meeting"" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.I did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only ""automation"" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.The first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.For context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.Of course, this is just one data point.

1mc96xi,"Unemployed since May 2023, desperately need advice!",DatEngGirl,cscareerquestions,"I graduated in May 2023 with a bachelor's degree in SWE and one QA internship. After graduation, I completed an unpaid full-stack internship, which was mainly frontend development. Since then, I’ve been actively applying to jobs across different types of companies including startups, large firms, remote, on-site and hybrid roles. Despite sending out around 50-70 applications a day, I rarely hear back. Ive even been reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn, and barely anything.I’ve revised my resume countless times. I’ve learned Spring Boot and am currently working on a backend project to showcase that. I also practice LeetCode daily.Out of desperation, I joined mthree in June, which is supposed to be a training-to-placement program, but they haven’t started training me yet. Feels like a waste of my time.Atp I feel like im doomed and unemployable. I've applied for QA, support, SWE, data scientist, even HR and solutions engineer. I just dont get it.For context, I’m applying throughout the U.S. and a bit in Canada (dual citizen).What the hell do I even pivot into atp? Ive already tried applying for adjacent tech roles.Edit 1: Since people are commenting on the 50-70 jobs, I know 50-70 sounds intense but I apply to jobs in both Canada and USA. I have over 15 job board sites I use daily, so every one hour I'm able to find 8-10 relevant entry-level roles and apply. By the end of the day I have 50-70 jobs applied to. I also avoid easy apply and apply directly on sites.Edit 2: Here is my resume: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16adhrvKm0kb0D_pN9hHNyOuiS30Tti5w/view?usp=sharingSome comments regarding my resume:My resume is a simple Word document. I reduced my bullet points down from five to three to keep things concise and less cluttered, as I was advised. Some of the technologies and tools I listed aren’t part of my projects or internship, but I do know them, I might just be a little rusty since it’s been a while since I last used some.Edit 3: Figured since this is still getting traction that I will write down what are the new changes I've been told to make:1. Contribute to open-source projects2. Bold technologies in projects/internships3. Apply to less jobs, focus on adding cover letter & tailoring cv to roles (+ make a few different CVs depending on what sort of role im targeting such as front-end, back-end, etc)4. Get rid of mthree experience5. Reduce technical skills6. Remove GPA7.

Multiple times during our bi weekly demo meetings he is hyper critical of even the most simple things. He doesnt just do it to me but some others. Last week I demoed something I was proud of I fixed a number of major issues we had and people were impressed except Bob who raked me over the coals about everything before loudly saying what I did was useless as he was going to rewrite all that stuff anyways.

I also found out a couple days after I started that the job title changed after I interviewed for a business analyst role, I only found out when I looked at an org chart.The attorney has barely said a few words to me and anytime she does it feels like she's just talking at me.

I always get conflicting instructions, one day she emails me that I need to automate things, the next day I have to justify why programming takes so long. The following day I'm told I need to only do my job title, then the next week she said I stopped programming and need to figure out how to do both.Last week, I was asked to meet with the new HR person who has been firing 2-3 people a week since she started. When I get to her office she told me she wanted to talk about my performance. She said I'm taking too long to finish my programming tasks. She said at her old company they were able to build an architecture, build complete features in 1-2 hours and an entire system in less than a year for all the departments that was even HIPAA compliant.

Don't like my team. mean tech lead, scrum master that blames people. asking questions gets uncomfortable. Tech lead gets very irritable very fast. I’d code and he’d giggle and be like “what are you doing.” Small team. This is the biggest problem. tech lead told me 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you.” I do all my user stories, communicate blockers, never caused carry over or even a defect. Received multiple certifications. 4. Disorganized leadership. ""everyone in the department do the same amount of points""(7+). Told me I didn't have to do that since that's for seniors and up, then received bad feedback for not doing that amount of points.5.

1mf26ye,Unemployed for 3 years after graduation. Advice needed.,LoLNumberFour,cscareerquestions,"I'm based in the US. For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.During my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.Lately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand?

I don’t mind studying leetcode (I like them but haven’t done them in a while) but I’m just not sure if my career gap will hinder my progress in breaking back in. I’m nearing 2 years and though my side hustle is gaining income, I’d still like to get into another SE gig now that I’m refreshed. I have another project I’d like to continue working on but I’m considering studying for leetcode again but not sure what my prospects would look like considering the time off I’ve had in this current market….like would it be worth it?

1mabvyv,My skip is blocking my growth and transfer to new team of choice,Comprehensive_Award3,cscareerquestions,"For context, I am in a junior role that is hourly paid and below average pay. I’m not a software engineer but it’s adjacent. In my job description it says I am part of a rotational training program where I will learn and gain experience on three adjacent teams in the same role, that’s why I accepted. I was put on a team with no manager and where all of the team members are remote offshore contractors. My work entailed receiving written tasks that lacked any context and with that got no training or onboarding. I was told not to talk to the requestors directly. This whole time I’ve been there I’ve basically had no manager. There is no path toward growth. With time my team warmed up to me and would help here and there but the start was extra rough. Two months ago I applied to a full time higher paid role in an adjacent department. The next day after the interview, the hiring manager said my department won’t let me go. No one in my department talked to me. The manager that was there for two months but did no managing, had already left. My tech lead gave a green light. So I assumed the hiring manager was letting me down softly or that there are some company policies, like I haven’t been there long enough. The policies in this company change whichever way suits them btw. Very recently two people in my role left an adjacent team. This team was supposed to be one of my rotations. I have been here long enough to rotate. This team is in person and the manager is a good manager and the people are knowledgeable, so I reached out to join their team. The hiring manager said yes. My tech lead gave a green light. My new manager, who also hasn’t done any managing so far, gave a green light. The HR gave a green light. During my first one on one with my manager I was told “Skip said you will either stay on your current team or will join ‘team that doesn’t exist yet and does work that is not my role’.” I was baffled. When I said “but I want to do my role and rotations are in my job description” my manager gaslighted and told me that the team I applied to doesn’t do my role. Ladies and gents, the titles are exactly the same as mine. I went to HR. HR was also baffled. Obviously I am already applying externally. But I am so upset that my chance to grow in my career was arbitrarily blocked and that now they are blatantly going against policies and my job description. It is very not palatable, I feel that I am an object, and honestly this smells of misogyny.",25,0.86,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mabvyv/my_skip_is_blocking_my_growth_and_transfer_to_new/,2025-07-27 03:11:35,2025-08-02 01:48:16

I'm at the point where I keep thinking that there's honestly zero point in even trying to get a job in the field because of how unlikely it is. Like I see no reason that given 1000+ applicants to a role, with at least a handful of those being guys that have programmed an entire OS from scratch and went to a top ten school and likely already have experience, the odds of those guys not applying or there being such a small applicant pool that the guy who had a mediocre GPA along with no internships who has farted out a middling personal project to fill out an otherwise empty resume actually gets a role seems almost astronomically low.I doompost here a lot but in my head there genuinely seems to be no real path to employment in the industry (I'm not even talking SWE either, like literally any job that requires a bachelors in CS at all) if you're not exceptional or quite literally apply to every single open position in the country and just move wherever at a whim and hope you essentially win the lottery",16,0.83,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mbygci/is_getting_a_job_with_no_internships_having/,2025-07-29 01:26:48,2025-08-02 01:48:16

1mce6wv,How to handle hostile senior dev,ice-truck-drilla,cscareerquestions,"I started at a company on a dev team a few months ago. This is my first permanent job after completing my master’s degree.Initially, I was welcomed on and had a really great time getting to know people and contribute, and my performance review was “exceeds all expectations” from everyone on my team. My boss indicated that they were seeking to have me transition into a leadership role in the future given that I have a specific background.Fast-forward a couple of months later, and one of the senior devs on my team has become somewhat hostile to me. They started calling out any critiques of my work directly in our Teams channel (that contains some senior company leadership like VPs) and during meetings in a way that I kind of take offense to. EX) “u/ice-truck-drilla seems to have done this wrong.” instead of “u/ice-truck-drilla, this doesn’t look right to me. Can you double check this?”First, I think this should be a direct message, not a company wide blast. Second, when this has happened, so far, the work being critiqued has always been correct. Of course I make mistakes, but these were not. These company-wide callouts have only happened a few times over the past few weeks, and luckily, the technical lead had my back and stated that my work was correct in front of everyone. One time, one of the VPs who was previously a dev mentioned that the work output I presented looked very accurate.I’m not sure what changed but this hostile dev used to be really pleasant to work with. I try hard and work long hours, and it feels like they’re trying to birth a negative reputation for me. Some added context is that this dev recently found out that I am not white (I’m white-passing) and my parents are immigrants. I’m not sure if this is the root cause, but it is something I’ve considered. I do not want to make any waves, and I have been thinking that the job market is way too harsh rn for me to even think about defending myself or bringing this up with anyone.

I've been coding more and more over the past few years and have realized that it's something I'm really passionate about. Naturally, I’ve been considering pursuing a degree in Computer Science.However, with all the recent discussions around AI, I’m starting to question whether a CS degree is still a good investment. I’ve seen a lot of posts about how the job market for tech is tough right now, but some people say it’s still not as bad as it was back in the early 2000s. Honestly, I’m a bit confused and unsure what to believe. I’ve talked to people about this and have received mixed results. I’ve talked to two professors who believe that the thought of AI completely replacing programmers is nonsense although it is still a very useful tool. On the other hand, I have family members that work in IT that believe that programming jobs as we know it are basically over.I’m also planning to double major in CS and Applied Math. I’m hoping that the math degree could give me some flexibility and open up other career options in case the CS job market remains difficult, what are your guys thoughts on that?Am I overthinking this?

I spent countless hours following tutorials and building small projects. Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.But I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.After graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.After two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.When the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.I was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.Then, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.Now I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding.

When they told us our new salaries I'm not sure what they were based on since the lead (who actually knows what I do) wasn't involved at all. I wasn't exactly happy with my new salary compared to my coworkers so I spoke with my manager (formerly the lead) and told him I'll take on more work/responsibility so I can get a promotion down the line. So I bust my ass for 1.5 years and finally he tells me he's submitting a request that I'm promoted with the higher ups. Fast forward *8 months*, nothing. Two performance reviews during this time and my manager doesn't really know what's going on, no updates from anyone. So I'm frustrated, burnt out, unmotivated, and feel taken advantage of.My question (skip here):In my search for a new job I have an opportunity at Stripe. Stripe pays twice what I'm paid at Trimble but the internet tells me the wlb and culture there sucks, like Amazon bad. Now I'm fine with occasionally working late but it can't be every day and I can put up with annoying coworkers if I can just focus on my work and don't deal with them much. In contrast I love my coworkers where I currently am, we're all buddies. The culture at our office is amazing, but the work itself isn't always great as I'm constantly helping other teams.

I've been under the impression all of this migrated to cloud so I should study AWS but now I'm thinking maybe I should catch up on my pre-reqs for a CS Master's at CU Boulder (Coursera)?",5,0.85,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1md5zlg/i_am_burnt_out_from_cybersecurity_how_do_i_work/,2025-07-30 13:01:19,2025-08-02 01:48:16
1mcdiw1,Considering if working on current legacy app will impact future career growth,jeddthedoge,cscareerquestions,"Hello people, I'm currently a junior with around 10 months at my current company, maintaining an application that is frankly quite old. I'm wondering if this will impact my future career growth, as I have options to jump to another company with a more modern tech stack.- most parts are still with the old .NET 4.8 Framework but some parts in .NET core. They have concrete plans for upgrading to modern .NET, but it won't be so soon (around 3 years)- CI CD pipeline using old ass tech, with plenty of environment issues (this has caused me and the team a lot of headaches and time wasted). Not containerised, but plans to be. Modernizations in this area are in the plan as well- Not a huge app, around 10 microservices- Hosted on AWS but not cloud native, still traditional server architecture- Not much scalability concerns- However, the product is highly secure and must pass stringent pentests. So plenty of security concerns- I get to work with and do the modernization, anything from code to infra migrations. Manager is highly supportive of any effort in this area- I get to touch on all areas of the albeit old application, from frontend to backend to devops and security- only one team of devs+QA of around 15 peopleWhat I will miss out on:- Scalability concerns. The product is meant to be low key b2b, there are basic scalability concerns but not big tech level where scalability is top priority.- Cloud native infra: I'm seeing most companies have already left the server architecture behind and adopt cloud native.- It feels bad still using Remote Desktop Connection and windows sucks major ass- Modern devops- Modern tech- Large company things with the big tech feel. I can't put this exactly into words but when your company has an engineering blog there is just this vibe. I feel like I'm missing out.I'd like to know if my concerns are legit.

1mccfpp,Is this company trying to screw me over?,Lanky-Ad6843,cscareerquestions,"Just got an internship offer at a startup and the contract has some clauses that feel really off:1. **I have to indemnify the company** \- basically if they ever get sued for anything related to my work, I have to pay for their legal defense?? I'm an (unpaid) INTERN.2. **3-year NDA that continues for another 3 years after it ends** \- so 6 years total where I can't talk about anything? Is that normalAm I being paranoid or is this actually predatory? I've never seen an indemnify clause before. The 6-year total NDA period also seems insane for what's probably a 6-month unpaid internship.Has anyone else dealt with this? Should I run?",4,0.75,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mccfpp/is_this_company_trying_to_screw_me_over/,2025-07-29 14:09:04,2025-08-02 01:48:16
1mc3vq5,Overworking myself for a good reason?,Seinhauser,cscareerquestions,"So this past March I was blessed with an incredible opprtunity. Great compensation, great team, great mentorship, great WLB, great name to have on the resume.The compensation is more than I've ever had. The position is fully remote. The company hasn't done any ""mass"" layoffs. The team (except one guy) has great WLB. In fact my manager has told me not to be like that guy, since he's not your average joe. The company specifically says they don't reward long hours.Yet I find this all makes me anxious. I've worked 15 hour days just because I want to feel useful. No one asks me to do this, but everything seems to point to this being a complete fluke and it can all go away in a snap. It's fully remote, in a saturated field, great benefits and pay, and many people have called it their dream company. In other words, I feel incredibly replaceable and it makes me work twice as hard.I feel like I might be on my way to burnout if I don't correct myself. Has anyone been in this position before and how did you deal with it?",4,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mc3vq5/overworking_myself_for_a_good_reason/,2025-07-29 06:13:05,2025-08-02 01:48:16
1mbi1ij,DevOps Tech Lead: New external position,personal-abies8725,cscareerquestions,I’m a DevOps tech lead with read access to the whole infra. I have PIM that gives me almost global write. I’m in the offer stage where even the lowest of the range for my new position is a significant jump. Assuming everything checks out insurance/pto I’m going to take the job. How much notice should I give my current company? They’ve been great to me. But: I am sensitive to the fact that with such access they might kick me off the same day I let them know. What’s the play here?,4,0.83,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mbi1ij/devops_tech_lead_new_external_position/,2025-07-28 14:42:18,2025-08-02 01:48:16
