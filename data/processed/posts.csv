1lvyzbc,Vibe / Citizen Developers bringing our Datawarehouse to it's knees,Swimming_Cry_6841,dataengineering,"Received an alert this morning stating that compute usage increased 2000% on a data warehouse.I went and looked at the top queries coming in and spotted evidence of Vibe coders right away. Stuff like SELECT \* or SELECT TOP 7,000,000 \* with a list of 50 different tables and thousands of fields at once (like 10,000), all joined on non-clustered indexes. And not just one query like this, but tons coming through.Started to look at query plans and calculate algorithmic complexity. Some of this was resulting in 100 Billion Query Steps and killing the Data Warehouse, while also locking all sorts of tables and causing resource locks of every imaginable style. The data warehouse, until the rise of citizen developers, was so overprovisioned that it rarely exceeded 5% of its total compute capability; however, it is now spiking at 100%.That being said, management is overjoyed to boast about how they are adding more and more 'vibe coders' (who have no background in development and can't code, i.e., they are unfamiliar with concepts such as inner joins versus outer joins or even basic SQL syntax). They know how to click, cut, paste, and run. Paste the entire schema dump and run the query. This is the same management by the way that signed a deal with a cloud provider and agreed to pay $2million dollars for 2TB of cold log storage lol The rise of Citizen Developers is causing issues where I am, with potentially high future costs.",327,0.98,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lvyzbc/vibe_citizen_developers_bringing_our/,2025-07-10 00:28:06,2025-07-12 01:49:56

I created Parquet files for each table, with the data types optimized.Here are some next steps that I want to do, and I would love anyone's comments on it:* Create a Dagster (have to learn it) pipeline that downloads and processes the data tables when they are updated (I am almost finished creating a Python Package).* Create a process that will upload the files to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (CERNs data portal) and other sites such as The Internet Archive, and Hugging Face. The data will be versioned so we will always be able to go back in time and see what code was used to create the data and how the data has changed. I also want to create a torrent file for each dataset and have it HTTP seeded from the aforementioned sites; I know this is overkill as the largest dataset is only 6.94 GB, but I want to experiment with it as I think it would be awesome for a data portal to have this feature.* Create a Python package that magically links the data tables to their geographic boundaries. This way people will be able to view it software such as QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, DeckGL, lonboard, or anything that can read Parquet.All of the code to create the data is currently in \[2\].

1lsg7gu,Building a Data Warehouse: alone and without practical experience,bukketraven,dataengineering,"Background: I work in an SME which has a few MS SQL databases for different use cases and a Standard ERP system. Reporting is mainly done via downloading files from the ERP and importing it into PowerBI or excel. For some projects we call the api of the ERP to get the data. Other specialized Applications sit on Top of the SQL databases.Problems: Most of the Reports get fed manually and we really want to get them to run automatically (including data cleaning), which would save a lot of time. Also, the many sources of Data cause a lot of confusion, as internal clients are not always sure where the Data comes from and how up to date it is. Combining data sources is also very painful right now and work feels very redundant. This is why i would like to Build a „single source of truth“.My idea is to Build a analytics database, most likely a data Warehouse according to kimball. I understand how it works theoretically, but i have never done it. I have a masters in business Informatics (Major in Business Intelligence and System Design) and have read the kimball Book. SQL knowledge is very Basic, but i am very motivated to learn.My questions to you are:1.⁠⁠is this a project that i could handle myself without any practical experience? Our IT Department is very small and i only have one colleague that could support a little with database/sql stuff. I know python and have a little experience with prefect. I have no deadline and i can do courses/certs if necessary.2.⁠⁠My current idea is to start with Open source/free tools. BigQuery, airbyte, dbt and prefect as orchestrator. Is this a feasible stack or would this be too much overhead for the beginning? Bigquery, Airbyte and dbt are new to me, but i am motivated to learn (especially the Latter)I know that i will have to do a internal Research on wether this is a feasible project or not, also Talking to stakeholders and defining processes.

1ltg0pt,Why Realtime Analytics Feels Like a Myth (and What You Can Actually Expect),ivanimus,dataengineering,"Hi there :waving_hand:I’ve been diving into the concept of realtime analytics, and I’m starting to think it’s more hype than reality. Here’s why achieving true realtime analytics (sub-second latency) is so tough, especially when building data marts in a Data Warehouse or Lakehouse:1. Processing Delays: Even with CDC (Change Data Capture) for instant raw data ingestion, subsequent steps like data cleaning, quality checks, transformations, and building data marts take time. Aggregations, validations, and metric calculations can add seconds to minutes, which is far from the ""realtime"" promise (<1s).2. Complex Transformations: Data marts often require heavy operations—joins, aggregations, and metric computations. These depend on data volume, architecture, and compute power. Even with optimized engines like Spark or Trino, latency creeps in, especially with large datasets.3. Data Quality Overhead: Raw data is rarely clean. Validation, deduplication, and enrichment add more delays, making ""near-realtime"" (seconds to minutes) the best-case scenario.4. Infra Bottlenecks: Fast ingestion via CDC is great, but network bandwidth, storage performance, or processing engine limitations can slow things down.5. Hype vs. Reality: Marketing loves to sell ""realtime analytics"" as instant insights, but real-world setups often mean seconds-to-minutes latency. True realtime is only feasible for simple use cases, like basic metric monitoring with streaming systems (e.g., Kafka + Flink).TL;DR: Realtime analytics isn’t exactly a scam, but it’s overhyped. You’re more likely to get ""near-realtime"" due to unavoidable processing and transformation delays.

I was prev working at a big tech, but it was tech support so I decided to move to the closest field possibele and that was DE. The sad part of it was that DE role had absolutely no work in the start-up idk why they even hired me but i salvaged what i could, I built basic stacks from scratch(combo of managed and serverless services), set up CDC, Data Lake-ish architecture(not how clean as i had hoped it to be) all while the data being extremely minimal like MBs, I solely did it just to learn because the CEO did not seem to care about anything at all. I'm pretty sure the lay-off was because they realised if they don't have the product or the data or the money to pay me so why need a DE at all (honestly why keep the company at all).

1lsgfqq,Data Quality for Transactional Databases,on_the_mark_data,dataengineering,"Hey everyone! I'm creating a hands-on coding course for upstream data quality for transactional databases and would love feedback on my plan! (this course is with a third party [not a vendor] that I won't name).All of my courses have sandbox environments that can be run in GitHub CodeSpaces, infra is open source, and uses a public gov dataset. For this I'm planning on having the following:- Postgres Database- pgAdmin for SQL IDE- A very simple typescript frontend app to surface data- A very simple user login workflow for CRUD data- A data catalog via DataHubWe will have a working data product as well as create data by going through the login workflow a couple times. We will then intentionally break it (update the data to be bad, change the login data collected without changing schema, and changing the DDL files to introduce errors). These errors will be hidden from the user, but they will see a bunch of errors in the logs and frontend.From there we conduct a root cause analysis to identify the issues. Examples of ways we will resolve issues is the following:- Revert back changes to the frontend- Add regex validation for login workflow- Review and fix introduced bugs in the DDL files- Implement DQ checks to run in CI/CD that compares proposed schema changes to expected schema in data catalogAnything you would add or change to this plan? Note that I already have a DQ for analytical databases course that this builds on.My goal is less teaching theory, and more so creating a real-world experience that matches what the job is actually like.",11,0.81,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lsgfqq/data_quality_for_transactional_databases/,2025-07-05 18:22:14,2025-07-12 01:49:56

1ltsbjn,Star schema - flatten dimensional hierarchy?,paulrpg,dataengineering,"I'm doing some design work where are are generally trying to follow Kimball modelling for a star schema. I'm familiar with the theory of the data warehouse toolkit but I haven't had that much experience implementing it. For reference, we are doing this in snowflake/dbt and were talking about tables with a few million rows.I am trying to model a process which has a fixed hierarchy. We have 3 layers to this - a top level organisational plan, a plan for doing a functional test and then the individual steps taken to complete this plan. To make it a bit more complicated - whilst the process I am looking at has a fixed hierarchy but the process is a subset of a larger process which allows for arbitrary depth, I feel that the simpler business case is easier to solve first.I want to end up with 1 or several dimensional models to capture this, store descriptive text etc. The literature states that fixed hierarchies should be flattened. If we took this approach:* Our dimension table grain is 1 row for each task* Each row would contain full textual information for the functional test and the organisational plan* We have a small 'One Big Table' approach, making it easy for BI users to access the dataThe challenge I see here is around what keys to use. Our business processes map to different levels of this hierarchy, some to the top level plan, some to the functional test and some to the step.I keep going back and forth as a more normalised approach - where 1 table for each of these steps and then build a bridge table to map them all together is something that we have done for arbitrary depth and it worked really well.If we are to go with a flattened model then:* Should I include the surrogate keys for each level in the hierarchy (preferred) or model the relationship in a secondary table?* Business analysts are going to use this - is this their preferred approach - they will have fewer joins to do but will need to do more aggregation/deduplication if they are only interested in top level informationIf we go for a more normalised model:* Should we be offering a pre-joined view of the data - effectively making a 'one big table' available at the cost of performance?",9,0.78,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ltsbjn/star_schema_flatten_dimensional_hierarchy/,2025-07-07 12:01:22,2025-07-12 01:49:56

1lwimpe,Seeking advice on Pipeline Optimization,Roody_kanwar,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I recently joined a new company and started this week. My first assigned task is optimizing an existing pipeline that the team has been using. However, the pipeline requires significant work.This team hasn’t had a dedicated data professional before, so they outsourced pipeline development to an offshore team. Upon reviewing the pipeline, I was shocked. There’s zero documentation, no helpful comments or method signatures, and even variable declarations are riddled with errors (e.g., indexes spelled as indekes). The function and class naming conventions are also poor. While I haven’t done extensive data engineering work before, I’m certain these are subpar coding practices. It seems the offshore team got away with this because no one technical was overseeing the work. The pipeline has broken frequently in the past, and instead of proper fixes, it’s been patched with band-aid solutions when what it really needs is a complete overhaul.# The Core Problem:The team wants a unified database where each customer has a unique primary key. However:* Data comes from 5-6 sources, none of which have primary keys for joining.* PII (and other details) for the same customer can differ across sources.* The goal is to deduplicate and unify all customer records under a single ID.I’m considering fuzzy matching, but with \~1M rows, pairwise comparisons are computationally expensive. The offshore team attempted a workaround:1. **Blocking:** Grouping potentially similar records (name variants, emails and phone numbers) to reduce comparison scope.2. **Similarity Scoring:** Running comparisons only within these blocks.I had some questions1. Is there a better approach? Have you worked on similar problems? Any recommended tools/strategies?2. Learning resources? I’m relatively new to data engineering and want to do this right. Any books, papers, or guides on large-scale deduplication?This is a critical project, and I’d appreciate any advice whether technical, procedural, or even just moral support! Thanks in advance, and feel free to ask follow-up questions.",7,0.78,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lwimpe/seeking_advice_on_pipeline_optimization/,2025-07-10 17:25:58,2025-07-12 01:49:56

So this won't work.* Row filtering is a feature in Fivetran, but only for database sources, not for Qualtrics.I'm thinking we'd need to dump all of the data into our own destination first and then sync across the filtered data to their lake...I suppose this will work, but I'm just looking for ideas in case I can avoid the multi step process.",7,0.9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lwfkkd/what_is_the_right_approach_for_selectively/,2025-07-10 15:25:30,2025-07-12 01:49:56

These two streams make up about 30MMAR monthly, and if we can move them off Fivetran, we can justify keeping Fivetran for everything else.Here are the options we're weighing for the 2 pipelines:1. Airbyte OSS (self-hosted on EC2)2. Use DLTHub for the 2 pipelines (we already have Airflow set up on an ec2 )3. Use AWS DMS to do MySQL → S3 → Snowflake via Snowpipe.Any thoughts or other ideas?

1lvhsnw,Setting up Data Pipelines,Prize-Ad-5787,dataengineering,I am currently tasked with building our first data pipeline. We are currently trying to find a solution that will be a good data engineering platform. The goal is to ingest the data into snowflake from various sources. For this first pipeline here is a simplified process: 1. File is uploaded in SharePoint Folder to be ingested 2. File is picked up and split into csv's based on sheet names (Using Python presumably)3. Those CSVs are then uploaded into Snowflake Tables4. Once in Snowflake I will trigger tasks that transform and get the data where we want it (This I've already mostly figured out). We have been leaning towards Azure Data Factory for our data pipelines as the basics are already set up but I seem to be having issues figuring out a reliable source for running python in ADF. I have seen stuff from Azure Functions and Batch Processing (which I have little experience configuring and setting up). Another solution would be to just migrate to a full python approach with Apache Airflow but that would be another system to configure...

This implies that for a 4-level B+ tree, the total number of leaf nodes will beLevel 1 - 1 Level 2 - 400 Level 3 - 400 \* 400 Level 4 - 400 \* 400 \* 400 = 64M leaf nodesEach of the 64M leaf node points to a page of size 8KB holding the actual row. Now, assuming each row is 100B long, each leaf node can hold 80 database rows.With this as our core assumption, the total number of rows this B+ tree can hold is 64M \* 80 = 5.12 billion rows. Pretty neat :)We can thus fairly assume that a typical database would not take more than 3 or 4 page reads to locate any record and then a couple more lookups to read the data stored in the heap.I also uncovered: \- Why Redis still uses hash tables (and when it makes sense) \- How major databases like Oracle secretly use BOTH structures (and why) \- How B+ trees and Hash tables works internally Read the full breakdown in my latest newsletter article.Do you think we will have more advanced indexing than B+ trees in the future?",4,0.84,0,https://dataheimer.substack.com/p/hash-tables-vs-b-trees-why-databases,2025-07-08 20:07:08,2025-07-12 01:49:56

I've followed through many tutorials, and most of them don't work out of the box, require fixes or version downgrades, and are broken with recent updates to Airflow and dbt.I'm here on a mission to find and document the best and easiest way for Data Engineers to run their dbt Core jobs using Airflow, that will simply **work out of the box**. **Disclaimer**: This tutorial is designed with a Postgres backend to work out of the box. But you can change the backend to any supported backend of your choice with little effort.So let's get started. ## Prerequisites- Docker desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)- Python 3.12 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)- Code repo (https://dbtengineer.com/airflow-with-dbt-core-tutorial/#code-repo-video-tutorial)## Video Tutorial{% embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfYuMjHQCc&ab_channel=DbtEngineer %}## Setup1. Clone the repo in prerequisites. 2. Create a data folder in the root folder on your local.3. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and create new values for all missing values. Instructions to create the fernet key at the end of this Readme.4. Rename `airflow_settings-example.yaml` to `airflow_settings.yaml` and use the values you created in `.env` to fill missing values in `airflow_settings.yaml`.5. Rename `servers-example.json` to `servers.json` and update the host and username values to the values you set above.## Running Airflow Locally1. Run `docker compose up` and wait for containers to spin up. This could take a while.2. Access pgAdmin web interface at [localhost:16543](http://localhost:16543). Create a public database under the postgres server.3. Access Airflow web interface at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Trigger the dag.## Running dbt Core LocallyCreate a virtual env for installing dbt core```shpython3 -m venv dbt_venvsource dbt_venv/bin/activate```Optional, to create an alias```shalias env_dbt='source dbt_venv/bin/activate'```Install dbt Core```shpython -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres```Verify Installation```shdbt --version```Create a `profile.yml` file in your `/Users//.dbt` directory and add the following content. ```yamldefault: target: dev outputs: dev: type: postgres host: localhost port: 5432 user: your-postgres-username-here password: your-postgres-password-here dbname: public schema: public```You can now run dbt commands from the dbt directory inside the repo.```shcd dbt/hello_worlddbt compile```## CleanupRun `Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to stop containers, and then `docker compose down`.## FAQs### Generating fernet key```shpython3 -c ""from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())""```I hope this tutorial was useful.

1lwvvkk,Are there real pain points getting alignment between business stakeholders and data team?,Away-Violinist3104,dataengineering,"Hey folks – my friend and I have been thinking a lot about the communication overhead between business stakeholders and data engineers when it comes to building data pipelines. From what we observe at our job and further validated by chatting with a couple friends in data engineering space, a lot of time is spent just getting alignment – business users describing what they want, engineers trying to translate that into something technically feasible, and a lot of back-and-forth when things aren’t clear.We’re exploring whether it’s possible to reduce this overhead with a self-service tool powered by an “AI data engineer” agent. The idea is:* Business users specify what they want (e.g., “I need a dashboard showing X broken down by Y every week”).* The AI agent builds the pipeline using the existing data stack.* If there's any ambiguity or missing context, it prompts the user for feedback. If they don’t know the answer, they can loop in a technical person, all in the same tool. Technical/data team can provide necessary context so the agent can carry forward.* After getting clarification, the agent continues building the pipeline.* Once the pipeline is built, technical/data team verify, review, edit or approve This way, non-technical users could handle more of the work themselves, and engineers can focus on higher-leverage tasks instead of ad-hoc asks.We’re super early ideation and trying to understand if this is actually a real pain point for others – or if it’s already solved well enough with existing tools, or is it just another ""imagined problem"".Would love to hear your thoughts:* Do you run into this communication gap in your org?* Would something like this be useful, or would it just add noise?* Are there any tools out there that already handle this well?Any perspectives would be appreciated!",3,0.6,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lwvvkk/are_there_real_pain_points_getting_alignment/,2025-07-11 02:52:15,2025-07-12 01:49:56

1lvbyvh,"For new coders: If you want to organically learn a lot about Javascript and coding in general, consider playing Bitburner.",cheyyne,learnprogramming,"If you haven't heard of it, Bitburner is a free coding game in which you take on the role of a hacker writing Javascript to hack computers in a cyberpunk world, earn money, and eventually do lots of things that I can't go into here.The actual 'hacking' is very simplified, the game doesn't teach you cyber security - it's more about writing code that gets things done. In the beginning of the game, you are shown examples for how to write basic things, which you can then learn to improve upon.The game naturally evolves to become a bit more complex as you play, and you are rewarded for thinking about how to make things happen more efficiently, which results in a rewarding gameplay loop that fosters learning without holding your hand, so you have creative freedom.And that's sort of the thing of it; you can muddle through using code that's 'good enough' *if you want to.* But you will more likely be inspired to find that next way to level up your code, to make it more effective, to find the inefficiency and ruthlessly eliminate it.A large part of what makes the game useful is that you are writing real code in a real language using real javascript syntax, with scripts that are really running on your computer; there is very good documentation that you can read to figure out how to improve your code yourself, and how to understand the in-game systems; and the in-game help for how you might approach newly unlocked mechanics is quite good, though not universally so (looking at you, corporate ""Smart Supply"" script example!). And if you get stuck, there is a Discord full of very helpful people who can assist you with whatever you don't understand.Anyhow, though I've done a lot in other languages, before last year I hadn't learned almost any Javascript. Now I've got almost a thousand hours in Bitburner, I've learned how to think about a lot of elementary coding problems in new ways, I've learned a lot of Javascript, and I've even come face to face with a number of Javascript's hated quirks - all from just trying to *make more damn money than I did on my last run, given my current system's limitations.*So I heartily recommend giving it a shot. You can find Bitburner on Steam, or at [https://bitburner-official.github.io/](https://bitburner-official.github.io/). You can find the documentation for all the game's commands [here, at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md). (It says NS, which just means the object which, for all intents and purposes, contains the commands and functions that you can do in the game that aren't straight javascript declarations). Expect a certain amount of exploration - once you're knee deep, you'll be checking through documentation for a given mechanic and get valuable 'Aha!' moments.**NOTE: If you are playing to learn coding, I strongly recommend -avoiding- looking up other player's solutions.** It's okay to start off with an example, but you'll only grow as a programmer by figuring out novel ways to overcome the challenges you'll face. The solution you find for yourself, even if it's less efficient, is infinitely more valuable - and you will find more and more solutions as you get better at thinking like a coder. If you really do hit a hard wall, you might ask AI how a problem could be approached - you'll find GPT has a good corpus of Bitburner dialect in its training data - but do your best to solve your problems with whatever you find in the help files and in the game's documentation. And if you do give in, you could ask on the Bitburner discord, where players will be happy to hint at the right approach without out and out solving the puzzle for you.Anyway, I hope some novice coders find this valuable and discover how fun coding can be through this game. (I have no affiliation with the game or its devs. Just a big fan.) Have fun!

1lt6qlc,How do you actually code??,Godevil4716,learnprogramming,"I'm currently in my third year of engineering, and to be honest, I haven’t done much in the past two years besides watching countless roadmap videos and trying to understand what's trending in the tech market. Now that I’ve entered my third year, I’ve decided to aim for a Java Full Stack Developer role. I know it’s a heavy-duty role, but I want to keep it as my goal even if I don't fully achieve it, at least I’ll be moving in a clear direction.Here’s the issue I’ve been facing: whenever I watch a YouTube video of someone building an end-to-end project, I expect to learn something valuable. But then I see that the actual learning requires following a long playlist. Theoretically, the concepts make sense I understand the data flow and architecture. But when I get to the implementation, especially the backend, everything becomes overwhelming.There are all these annotations, unfamiliar syntax, and configurations that feel like they just magically work and I have no clue why or how. I end up copying the code just to make it work, but in the end, I realize I’ve understood very little. It feels more like rote copying than actual learning.Truthfully, I feel lost during this process. The complexity of the syntax and the lack of clarity around what’s happening behind the scenes demotivates me.So, here’s what I really want to understand: how do people actually “learn” a tech stack or anything new in tech?Do they just copy someone else's project (like I’m doing) and somehow that’s enough to add it to their resume? I’ve watched so many roadmaps that I know the general advice—pick a language, choose a framework, build projects—but when it comes to actual implementation, I feel like without that tutorial in front of me, I wouldn’t be able to write a single line of meaningful logic on my own.Is this really how someone LEARNS in a IT Tech Industry?Just by watching playlist and rote copying?",185,0.92,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lt6qlc/how_do_you_actually_code/,2025-07-06 17:23:55,2025-07-12 01:49:57

1ls1kp8,Friendly advice to beginners: Stop obsessing over languages and start viewing them as tools.,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"I was also guilty of this when I started 3 years ago. I wanted to learn everything, because everything seemed so cool. My main goal was Backend development but I ended up starting courses on Kotlin, Go, Rust, Java, Python and Lua. I didn't see these languages as tools but as personalities, and that's a big mistake I made aswell as a lot of other beginners. Very often I'd find myself asking questions like ""How many languages should I learn?"", ""Is Java, JavaScript and Python a good stack for backend development?"", but I'd still be learning JS arrays in codecademy with only 3 projects in my directory.The answer to all those questions, in my opinion is, it does not matter. Programming != coding, so it doesn't matter how many languages you learn, the thing you should be mainly focused is learning how to solve problems using the syntax. Learn to solve problems with what you have, THAT is the important piece in my opinion.Why I think it's important that many beginners grow out of this phase ASAP: 1. When you start to view languages as what they are, you start to appreciate more what you use. In my case, I don't find JavaScript to be the most charming language, but I love it's rich ecosystem and the fact that I can use it for pretty much anything I want to do. 2. You risk burning yourself out. This was me three years ago. I had 5 courses on different languages and it polluted my mind with information that I KNEW deep down was completely useless to me in the long run. You could argue that I was getting to see new paradigms and techniques to solving problems, but that wasn't even true. I never made it far enough into ANY course to learn anything that I hadn't seen in JavaScript. It was a waste of time and it lead to me burning out and losing interest, until recently that I finally got back into programming. 3. You stop thinking and you start doing. When I finally got back into coding recently with better learning habits I started learning and creating projects faster than ever before. Because I wasn't focused on ""Hmmm, maybe I should try out Scala!"", no I was focused on ""What other Data Structures should I learn to implement?"", ""How do I solve this bug?"", ""What should be my next project?"". When you start seeing languages as tools, you'll want to use those tools.In conclusion, this is not to say that you shouldn't be curious and you shouldn't ask questions and you shouldn't experiment and you should just stick to one thing and never explore. What I'm trying to say is that, a lot of the time, beginners are so excited to learn that they forget WHY they're learning. Which is to get a job, to be successful, to create something meaningful, to be good at a hobby, etc.. And I feel like if you don't focus on creating and learning and solving, and you're always thinking about what's the future and not the present, then you'll just risk burning yourself out. There are tons of roadmaps out there for whatever you want to build, stick with it or tweak it a little along the way. But don't start a course on Python today and then tomorrow it's SQL and then the next day is HTML and CSS, no. Stick to what you want to do, once you understand the core concepts and programming as a whole, everything else will follow and everything after that will be easier to learn.",129,0.96,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ls1kp8/friendly_advice_to_beginners_stop_obsessing_over/,2025-07-05 04:35:27,2025-07-12 01:49:57
1lvnifa,Why is there so much hate for functional programming,_lazyLambda,learnprogramming,"I started with OOP and enjoyed it, I can see how to get things done ofc But then over covid I learned of functional programming and thought ah what the heck I'll try this out. I personally love it and have legitimately found that it has changed my career trajectory for the better. So many advanced concepts felt clear only when I learned Haskell. Most notably concurrent programming. I also see so many posts by users in this community that they are struggling to grasp concepts or move past beginner. Not saying it will for sure work for everyone but like it definitely worked for me? Yet if I was to speak on that experience Id be called culty and just experience pure hate for FP with no explanation. I really have never experienced this cultiness people talk about. Wouldn't this hate signal that OOP is kinda culty? Like to me a cult is like a religion in that you're not supposed to question it but I've never met a Haskell dev like that, in fact they will probably happily and curiously chat about my question with me for hours. On the OOP side I've never really heard any convincing explanation as to why we do things a certain way, there's just the ""pythonic"" way to do stuff for example. But then if I point out an issue with their logic it always becomes ""how come you dont know OOP"" or some crazy question which is weird because OOP is quite simple and it often times has nothing to do with OOP theory. Before I get attacked inevitably with questions of the same category as that, I do have experience with OOP and my past project was acquired by Xerox to help plan their sales efforts. Ive also never heard any reason why Haskell is a bad choice besides it can be hard to learn, which I do agree with to an extent, but that's a very fixable problem as its often taught by researchers who are obsessed with the most advanced aspects of the language, and there are many great resources like learn you a Haskell that make it easy as all heck to learn.",109,0.8,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lvnifa/why_is_there_so_much_hate_for_functional/,2025-07-09 16:39:02,2025-07-12 01:49:57

1lwdgnp,Do not focus on languages that much,PureTruther,learnprogramming,"Edit: This is not a ""language is not important"" post. And also this is not a suitable post for copy-paste professionals. Some dummies need to study English rather than digital electronics.I just want to share my humble opinion from what I saw and experienced. This post may not be suitable for complete beginners. I assume that you already know DS&A and can build something at least in two different languages.I see so many questions, not only in this subreddit but generally on the web, like ""which language should I choose/is good to start/should I learn,"" etc. I think this is kind of missing the idea of ""software engineering"" or development.I bet most of us were stuck in ""language hell"" before. What should I learn? C? C++? Java? Fortran? Cobol? PL/I? Python? Rust? You can extend this list.Language is usually the easiest part of programming. Because in 2025, you can just open Google and type ""xyz language syntax/libraries,"" and then you get a kabillion resources about it.If language were that important, I bet most of the computer science classes would focus on low or mid-level languages like Assembly or C and similar languages.So you (we) should focus on technology rather than the syntax. You should focus on ""how can I store/manipulate/transmit this digital data more efficiently?""When you list your languages in your CV like this:* C & C++* Java* Python* Haskell* Verilog* so onyes, it shows something but not everything or big picture. It is still too abstract and does not answer ""Are you capable of using the [ARINC 429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) standard to transfer encrypted data?"" or ""Which boards did you work on?"" or ""Have you deployed a containerized microservice on Kubernetes with Helm charts?"" or ""Can you deploy a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins?""The other issue that occurs due to focusing on languages too much is that you do not know how you should create your portfolio. Since you focused on the language, you are hanging around basic implementations like a calculator, simple USB driver, or an asynchronous web page, etc.The more experienced programmers would notice that I am pointing out the ""specialization."" Let's be honest, in 2025, industries do not need too many juniors.So rather than obsessing about languages, explore the telecommunication standards, protocols, and preferred [software architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_architecture_styles_and_patterns) and technologies you’ll actually use in your target industry, then build projects around those.

I´m stuck.,SorrySayer,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone, I have the following “problem.” I'm currently studying computer science in my sixth semester and will be finishing my bachelor’s degree in half a year (the standard duration is 7 semesters).Over the course of my studies (mostly self-taught, university only covered Java and JavaScript), I’ve programmed in various languages — Java (Spring Boot), C#, C, Python (Django), JavaScript (browser, NodeJS), TypeScript, Golang.As you can probably guess, I don’t feel like I’m really good at any of these languages (Java is my strongest). My issue is that I can’t seem to decide on one. I enjoy working with all of them, and whenever I spend a few hours coding in one language, I get the urge to switch to another cool language. Right now, I’ve got my eye on C++.I’m not sure where I want to go professionally, which makes it hard for me to choose a language, since I can’t even decide on a specific field.I find embedded systems and backend/cloud very exciting. ML also seems interesting, but probably involves too much math (I do like math, but I probably do not like it enough for that).Is there anyone here who has been in a similar situation? I’m not switching languages because I find them hard or don’t enjoy them. I love them all — and hate myself for it :(Every field and language I’ve explored is exciting to me. But now that I’m close to finishing my bachelor’s degree, I feel like I’m wasting time by constantly switching between them.I jump from one thing to another so often that I end up feeling paralyzed when it comes to making a decision — and in the end, I barely get around to actually coding anymore.",10,0.69,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lw9wf9/cant_choose_a_language_or_career_path_im_stuck/,2025-07-10 11:04:54,2025-07-12 01:49:57

I’ve now been meaning to make a portfolio for myself and not sure if I should include it on there.The reason I ask this is because I am unsure if the mobile version of the platform is up to the standard clients and employers look for. I designed the platform desktop-first, and did not have any plans for proper mobile compatibility until I was almost finished the project.I would much appreciate it if you could go onto my application on either (or both) desktop and mobile and give me advice on if I should polish it up, or if it’s good enough for a portfolio. I’d much rather spend time making another application if this one requires a large amount of polishing and refining.I just deployed the application, the url is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)Im just kidding, it’s hosted at [https://vellumi.me](https://vellumi.me)To be clear, I have no intention or interest in having any active users, this is not an advertisement.Thank you!tdlr; The desktop version of my application looks nice, but I’m unsure if the mobile version is acceptable to a client or an employer.

1lsmji6,Made an even/odd checker as my first 'project.' Can the code be improved or made more efficient?,AxelsOG,learnprogramming,"So I started up on learning Python again and have made more progress than previous attempts and I'm starting to enjoy it a bit more now. But I've started by using Grok simply as a baseline starting point because I've always had trouble ""just learning"" and if I have no structure it tends to be difficult. I understand its probably not great long term, but I'm just simply using it to guide, but I'm also relying on other documentation and other sources online beyond a baseline ""Try and do this, maybe try and implement this and go in this general direction""But anyway, the suggestion it gave me was a program that checks whether a number is odd or even. My first iteration was made because I didn't read what it was supposed to be and ended up making a program that had a list of preset numbers, picked a random number from that list and checked if it was even or odd.Since I realized that wasn't what I was 'supposed' to do, I actually realized what I should have done and made this.What it's intended to do is request a valid positive integer, and check if its even or odd. It ignores any negative integers, any numbers 'too larger' (which I added simply to continue learning new stuff), and anything that isn't a number.It also gives you 3 tries to input a valid integer before closing after too many tries. I also made it so the ""attempts remaining"" will either say ""attempts"" or ""attempt"" based on whether you have multiple attempts left, or only 1 attempt remaining.And this works exactly as intended on the user side. I may be overthinking this, but I was wondering if there was a way to optimize it or make it more 'efficient' when checking if the number is less than 0 or if the number is too large. Even though it works exactly as intended, I was wondering if this code was 'bad' even though it works. I don't want to develop any bad coding habits or make things longer/harder than they need to be. from time import sleep max_attempts = 3 #Total attempts allowed. attempts = 0 #Attempt starting value. number = None print('This program checks if a number is even or odd.') #Welcomes the user. while attempts < max_attempts:     try:         number = int(input('Enter a valid non-negative integer: '))         if number < 0:             attempts += 1             remaining = max_attempts-attempts ##Defines remaining as maximum attempts minus wrong attempts             if attempts < max_attempts:                 print(f""Invalid input!

1ltf54g,Recommendation for newbies (from a newbie),flrslva,learnprogramming,"Write your own labs (or whatever you want from scratch) It's helped me a ton. A lot of my coding assignments are pre written with #include's, main(), return0; and are extremely guided. It feels more like I'm drawing on a tracing table or bowling with bumpers than actually learning to code.The labs will tell you you need x ,y, and z. Then you type x, y, and z. Then you run it. Wow it works. But I don't always really know why it works. Why? That's more important.What I started doing was writing the assignment down and figuring out for myself what I need to write the program. If things don't run I'll check my notes, search geeksforgeeks, stack overflow etc, DONT READ THE AI OVERVIEW! That code was even more confusing. Get in the habit of reading things. Im in a C++ class so cppreference is a good source too.You'll make mistakes. You need that. Thats how you become a better programmer. I finally understood the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value parameters in functions because I had to fix my bad code. Then I could really understand what the books where saying.Side note. Grow your simple programs into something complex. I wrote a small inventory program when we were learning about loops and then I forgot about it. I picked it up again and I moved the code into a function. Then the next version I separated the function into two. A reading function and printing function. The next version will use a class and objects. Your program gets an upgrade. And leave yourself notes on what you want to add or change to your program. Another thing that helps too. It's on my GitHub if anyone wants to see. Nothing amazing but I'm proud.You do all the thinking. Thats a real test.

But now, I finally decided to write my own post to share my journey and ask for some honest advice about my career path. **If you've been through something similar or just want to share your stories, I'd really appreciate it.****Warning: wall of text.**I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Software Engineering from a university (not top tier). The program was mostly practical, not too much theory. At that time, the job market in tech was really good.I started working at a few software outsourcing companies, focused on web dev. Because of the nature of the projects, I had to work with many different technologies. I think this is one of the biggest differences between outsourcing companies and product companies. I didn't get a chance to go deep into any technology, as soon as I started to get familiar with something, I had to switch to something else.Also, many of my friends were working at big companies and making a lot of money. That made me feel peer-pressured and pushed me to switch jobs often, chasing better pay, even though my skills weren't really strong enough to match those expectations.Over time, I started feeling lost and didn't know what I was working toward anymore. I also started to lose motivation, so I made a big decision to go study abroad for 2 years, hoping to find a new direction and more opportunities. I guess this is another big mistake that I made.With how tough the job market is right now, I've spent long time doing self-reflection. I realized that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes we don't appreciate what we already have until it's gone. And I've learned that success takes real effort and time, there are no shortcuts. If I had worked continuously since graduation, I would have over 7 YOE by now, but because of many breaks and job changes, I still feel like I'm only at a mid-level, not senior yet.

1lwu5i2,Trying out different areas of programming — now I want to focus on back-end. Which language should I choose?,franzz4,learnprogramming,"So, I started learning programming last December with Python. Since then, I’ve studied several programming languages like C, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Flutter (Dart). I tried out different languages used in different areas, such as back-end (C, Rust, Python, and JavaScript), front-end (HTML/CSS and JavaScript), and mobile (Kotlin and Flutter). After testing several different areas, here’s the conclusion I came to:**Front-end and Mobile:** It’s fun and interesting, but I don’t really see myself working professionally with UI — only in personal projects. The languages are manageable, but the problem is that there are thousands of frameworks that do the same thing, and the job market expects you to know several (especially in Web). In the end, it’s hard to pick one to focus on and really master.**Back-end:** I found it really fun to work with connections, APIs, databases, JSON, and making the project work behind the scenes. The languages are good (some are hard), and there are several options as well. However, it’s easier to pick one or two languages to specialize in back-end than it is in front-end. That’s why I decided to focus on back-end.After learning the basics of programming, like: programming logic, algorithms, data structures, and Git/GitHub, I’d like to ask for your opinion — **which language do you recommend I focus on right now?** From what I’ve seen, the most recommended ones are:* Python* Java* C#* Go* RustI was thinking about going back to Python and Rust since I already have some background with them, but I’d love to hear your opinions.",5,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lwu5i2/trying_out_different_areas_of_programming_now_i/,2025-07-11 01:28:31,2025-07-12 01:49:57

Now I know that I am still young and most of the stuff I know is from youtube and those guys probably have degrees from universities and have been working in the industry for a few years so I should compare myself with them or feel bummed out cause they were laughing at me I know they probably feel really happy that they are better than a intern who has been coding for a few months now only.

Take your time. I can even pretend not to notice you obviously typing something while you “think”, maybe you are taking notes.But if I ask you about your experiences, or why you wrote what you did or said what you did, you *must* be able to answer that question. If I ask you why you used a loop there, you need to be able to explain your choice. If I ask you how you solved that bug you are bragging about, you have to be able to walk me through it.In short: I’m happy to pretend like you aren’t using an AI assist in your interviews if you can keep up the illusion. But people who have actual skills and experiences can go from pleasant high-level summaries down several layers into explaining the details of what they understand. Solving a difficult bug leaves a mark on your soul you don’t forget the details.

1lt3xf6,"Are engineers at Meta/Amazon/Apple/Google/Netflix ACTUALLY better engineers, or is it all just hype?",Easy_Aioli9376,cscareerquestions,"Something I’ve been thinking about lately and wanted to get some honest perspectives.In general, society seems to treat FAANG engineers as the pinnacle of the software world. Not just within the tech industry, but even outside it. Say you work at Google or Meta, and people automatically assume you’re smart, accomplished, probably making great money, and overall just... impressive.Even socially, there’s a noticeable difference. Whether it’s friends, family, or even on hook-up apps, having ""Software Engineer at Amazon"" in your profile seems to carry a different weight.It’s like there’s a kind of crazy prestige that comes with being in FAANG. Like you’re in a different league, not just professionally but socially too.And obviously recruiters and managers seem to be obsessed with hiring ex-FAANG engineers. It's like a guaranteed callback.The title also seems to stick with you forever. Work at Google for a year, and you are suddenly an ex-google engineer for your entire career.No doubt working at FAANG is perceived as something that is prestigious, both technically and socially. It's life changing.But is that perception actually earned?Are FAANG engineers genuinely more skilled than the average developer? Do they consistently write better code, design more complex systems, think more rigorously? Or is it just a really effective combination of brand power, selective hiring, and market perception?I’m not denying that great engineers exist outside FAANG, but it seems like people expect the best to be there. Is that just a societal illusion, or is there some truth to it?Would love to hear from folks who’ve worked both in and out of FAANG. Are the engineers really on another level, or are we just buying into the name?",755,0.89,433,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lt3xf6/are_engineers_at_metaamazonapplegooglenetflix/,2025-07-06 15:27:19,2025-07-12 01:49:58

The UI is bloated, performance is inconsistent, and the AI suggestions are more noise than help.

When CEOs start offshoring and using AI, it might seem like it's working at first. But software engineering is all about the long game. It takes proactive decisions in the present, to avoid extreme amounts of technical debt in the future. Decisions made today have vast repercussions on outcomes several months and years from now.This shortsightedness of CEOs is a joke.

A lot of them are socially awkward or really into anime and etc., and it makes it hard to connect. I feel like an outsider even though I’m in the same field. There’s no real teamwork or sense of belonging, just people working in silos and making small talk about stuff I can’t relate to.Lately, I’ve even been thinking about going back to school, but I have no idea what I’d study or what path would actually feel worth it.

I am not new to this field and even with that I am just tired of this field.I felt it might get better, but I feel it has only gotten worse. Started in this field a little before COVID hit and heard that is when things started going downhill in this field (outside that window of massive hiring for 1.5 year) around then. My experience backs this.The expectations in this field are insane and none of my friends in other fields come close to putting up with this. The interview process is out of control and much of it has nothing to do with on the job stuff. So you have to learn on your own these things to do the interviews. The expectations while you have a job are insane. You are mostly led by non-technical people who fail to grasp how complex what they are asking you to do is and unrealistic deadlines because they are too scared to tell their managers no.Also, endless learning new stupid languages and stacks because someone in the world just has to create ""another language"" for their own ego, that ultimately does not make anything easier. Just makes it a new thing you have to learn.Nevermind the horrible job market in tech specifically. Endless layoffs, one of the highest unemployment rates of any white collar job field (we are higher than the average now), and clear attempts to send any new jobs overseas. So you can't even get a chance to compete for those jobs that go abroad.Ultimately I'm just over it. I'm done. I want out.

Based on convos with the teams, WLB at Google should be solid for the foreseeable future. WLB @ Meta should be comparable for the first year or so, but it sounds like on-call could get rough after that (specifically the on-call severity may worsen next year).Complicating things, I’ve already signed with Meta.

After taking a few months off to work on a passion project, I'm realizing it's likely not going to produce income soon enough for my family, so I'm reentering the salaried job market.Prior to this I was staff engineer at a public tech company, and prior to that I was CTO of a startup which was acquired by that tech company, so I haven't done any interviewing myself for over 10 years. During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.In conversations with recruiters, I have been forthright in my inexperience interviewing, saying things like I don't expect to do well on things like LeetCode interviews. Most of the recruiters I've spoken to say ""oh, we don't do LeetCode interviews here."" You know, they want to sound _different than the other companies_. However, the very next call I have with the company will be a tech screen where I am asked to do a LeetCode style puzzle, and inevitably I bomb. There are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these ""problems"" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect ""order of operations"" even though I solve the problem).Regardless of whether the companies are saying they do LeetCode style questions or not, it seems like I have no choice but to grind it out until I can pass these silly interviews. I'm curious if that is what other people are experiencing? Like, there are obviously ways to get much better signal from candidates--and as a hiring manager for many many years I've developed my own preferences--but as a candidate it seems I can't influence the process at all. I'm curious what the fine folks here would say. Do I just suck it up and grind LC? Have people found success asking for alternative interviews like take-homes, PR reviews, peer coding, etc?

1ltuo8e,Computer Science Education for Devs without college?,LibertyEqualsLife,cscareerquestions,"I'm nearly 40, and have shifted careers several times. In my last role, I found that I enjoyed building tools for my marketing team using no-code options and some basic SQL, so I took a bootcamp to learn to code and explore that interest further. I've been working as a dev for about 5 years now(primarily RubyOnRails and simple Python micro-services), and have found myself in a more ""senior"" role for a small company, mostly due to a combination of my broader industry experience and familiarity with our core systems. The problem is that I recognize that I don't really have the depth of knowledge that would typically qualify me for a Senior Developer/Engineer role in other companies. I know our tech stack, but when I find myself in conversations about new system design, or just more technical concepts in general, I'm quickly in over my head compared to colleagues that have CS degrees, where software conversations seem to evolve into higher-order maths concepts that I've simply got no familiarity with, or understanding of. I've made it this far in life without obtaining even an associates degree, and I really have no interest in starting from the beginning on the path to a comp sci degree, but I feel like I would really benefit from a ""computer science crash course"" geared towards devs that could build a foundational knowledge base for system design.

1lt44j0,How to get out of being put into support role as a SWE?,fishteam,cscareerquestions,"I joined a fairly large company (non-tech, although they are trying to make it otherwise) as a SWE along with a few hundred other new grads as part of a cohort. We didn't interview for a specific team and were basically placed semi-randomly onto teams that asked for SWEs.I ended up on a team that is primarily a support team. The team is mostly non-SWEs and at no point has there been any SWE on the team that didn't have the position as their first job out of college. About 60-70% of the team's day to day work consists of data remediation and other manual fixes (e.g. directly modifying data in databases) for errors caused by bugs in the systems we support. These bugs have existed the entire 2 years I've been here, and apparently longer, from what I've heard. The remainder of the work might be other random tasks geared towards facilitating the first function (e.g. writing up documentation on how to do a certain kind of fix, setting up alerting based off of logs).The only ""dev"" work that I end up doing is writing basic CRUD applications used only by our team that are hosted on on-premise servers (our team has no cloud budget so I have no experience building applications in the cloud). There's no opportunity to work on any large-scale, high traffic systems. I essentially haven't worked on anything more complex than my college work.Other people that were part of my cohort were placed on teams where they are on actual engineering teams and the work is a lot more interesting, so this is primarily a team placement issue, not necessarily a company issue. However, I've become painfully aware that my skills have been stagnating hard and I need to get out of this role ASAP. The only thing is I've been a ""software engineer"" for 2 years, but having to talk about what I've been doing in my current role makes it glaringly obvious that I was a SWE in name only.

After this contract ended, they renewed it again as a Jr. Software Developer, but this time for 4 months, because the startup was failing.

During my masters I started to go down the self-taught dev route. Now I have been working for 2 years as IT consultant and software developer in an enterprise environment (Java Spring Boot). Currently self-studying CS fundamentals through teachyourselfcs.com (working through CS:APP right now). I'm aware I have some gaps in my CS knowledge, which is why I started the self-study route. Now I'm considering going back to university for a CS Bachelor's degree (would do it part-time while keeping my full-time job. Studying evenings/weekends. Would be at a ""Hochschule"" that costs 19k€).The thing is, I could spend those 3.5 years on getting the CS Bachelor's degree OR continuing self-study, building projects, gaining more work experience and getting certifications.From a career perspective, my main question is: What looks better in the (European) job market:1. Having that CS degree on paper after already working in the field2. Having no CS degree, but a few certificates and a couple personal projects and focusing more on my career in the current company.I'm genuinely torn. Part of me wants the ""proper"" CS foundation and having something to show for it, but another part thinks that time could be better invested in practical experience and targeted learning. Also I would basically just do it for the ""academic proof"" for future employers, as I think that some of the stuff learned during the CS-degree is not practical and the important topics are also learnable by self-study, as I am currently doing.Anyone been in a similar situation?

1lwkz3a,Is ending a (very long) internship to pursue another unprofessional?,twentyoneproblems,cscareerquestions,"I have been working for the state in an internship since January. From January til May I was an unpaid intern until I got hired in a paid internship position. This week I was asked if I wanted to stay in my current division for the fall because the new division I applied for did not have openings. I was kind of rushed to answer, so I agreed. My question is if I find something at some point in the fall, early or later on, will I be burning bridges by ending this internship? I was told that I could apply for the other division in the spring…so is a bad idea to leave and try and come back?I don’t think anyone in particular will have strong feelings since it’s a government agency. But I do feel bad that someone could have gotten my spot if I had left earlier.

We own no property or assets in America whatsoever, the only connection we have to the US is my citizenship. I've already been admitted to an American university and plan to attend there in pursuit of the CS major and perhaps a Business/Finance minor. My university does allow double majoring at no additional costs though. I realize that I'm a bit of an exceptional case here and more privileged in the sense that I don't have to deal with F1, H1B visa rat race at all. That said, on hearing the situation of the world, in particular the US, the job market seems extremely bad. My family lives on an Indian income and while the aid we got from my university was quite generous, we've still taken a federal loans from both the US and education loans from SBI, leasing one of the property homes that we have. This honestly puts a lot of pressure on me, like any other international student because India is all I've known and frankly I've never exceeded very well academically at all.I realize that my questions are a bit immature maybe, but I think I'd still like the opinions and discussions of people who are more knowledgeable about this than I am:* How hard do you think it'll be for people like me to find jobs/placements 4 years later when I graduate? * I've been hearing that the best way to succeed is to have connections, network and stuff. I've had very bad social skills my whole life, are there any tips or perhaps personal experiences that you think I might find helpful for someone starting from scratch?* If the job situation in the US is worse than it is in India, or well let's say I can't find a job in the US how likely it is that if I come back to family and start job hunting in India as an OCI Card Holder would give me difficulties? What should I expect? Is it recommended that I come back to India at all?* What are some contingency plans I should have? I'm not particularly passionate about anything, I chose CS because my entire family works there and so having their help would be nice, plus hearing them talk about their job and interest for it made me interested as well. If CS/IT is cooked, I'm thinking maybe Business or Finance is a better option? I've decided to pursue it as a minor. If I were to make a switch, how do you think I should make it happen so that even those career paths are open to me?Lots of questions here, but I'd really appreciate any and all help!

After a technical undergrad degree, I've worked for 10+ years, and am looking to upskill and re-focus towards ML/AI, to help with a future career pivot. My understanding is that for undergrad, and probably any non-research Master's degree, the (at least perceived) school quality/ranking is very important. What about for a PhD though? Or a research-based Master's degree? My brief understanding is that here things get blurry because it's more about finding a specific research supervisor and field of research, rather than just trying to get into the highest ranking school you can. Of course we need a criterion, so I'd say something like 'future career prospect maximization'. My concern is that as a mature student with a likely weaker applicant profile, I would probably get into a lower ranking school than my undergrad school.

I move them to 2 networks after my coworker moves them to her network first typically. She'll get a drive from the security office and then I use that drive after she's done.

I was a whole week late to finish up my part of the patches on the 2 networks I do it on.

1lttg8h,What are effective ways to transfer PhD and post industry research to industry?,emaxwell14141414,cscareerquestions,"When it comes to transferring from PhD and post PhD research in academic based institutions to industry based science, there's major discussion in terms of how everything from the pace of work to the lack of ability to ensure the best methods are being used and so on. So when it comes to adapting the skills obtained during a PhD and in me cases research assistantships past the PhD, and convincing others that you can transfer your skills, what works best?With some companies, particularly in this economic climate, they'll be looking for industry experience and that's it. It won't matter about published papers and successful projects. It won't matter if much of your research is in an applicable field such as data science. Side projects you've done independently may not even matter. It has to be experience in industry or it doesn't count. And often, it needs to be with the exact software tools, models and packages they use in addition.That said, I was wondering about what works when adapting your skills and also making the case to others about how you can do so. A primary option, I imagine, is being able to relate to them, for example how a paper and project you finished has implications that could assist them with their data handling, product development and so on.

1ls65ow,Junior Developer Paradox: Finding Niche and Doing so in Wrong Time,TemporaryBaseball915,cscareerquestions,"Hello guys, I'm writing this because I recently (with full awareness) threw myself into what seems to be still waters, the junior developer job hunt. Now, this is not just another generic web dev (not my words, the vim/arch lovers' words) crying for help. No, no, and no! This is someone who found their ""niche"" but at the wrong time. Let me tell you what I mean.So, I recently graduated from a university in the U.S. During the time I was there, I fell in love with Machine Learning (and no, it's not because it's the trend). I found myself devoting my time to research, machine learning projects, doing competitions within the lab with other PhD or Masters students, etc. I was involved in the research for 2+ years for three different labs, I had the official title of ""Research Assistant"" as an undergrad for one of the labs where I was the sole engineer to develop end-to-end solution for running experiments on our university's super computer. I have published a paper in CVPR, and got the best paper award within the workshop that we've published.Now, my life had a solid plan, but due to everything changed in the states (I'm not gonna say why because I don't wanna take a one-way trip to Central America) I was forced to derail from that path. And now I am looking for a job. And man, doesn't it fucking suck. And this is where the paradox begins:**Paradox 1: ""X+ years of experience"" for recent graduate position**Let's start with the most common paradox. Now, the definition of ""experience"" differs from company to company, but what seems to be the common thing though, is that research doesn't count toward ""experience"". I know some of the undergrads who have somewhere around 1 year of experience due to things like internships or co-op (it's like internship in Canada but better), but for a lot of other students, this is going to be their first experience. Especially for someone like me who has experience but within the University, this sucks. What sucks even more, is that for a lot of international students, getting internship is very hard due to company having to justify as to why they're hiring an international student over a citizen with the same skill set. I was one of the victims of ""logistical rejection"" and that's kind of why I devoted more time within the University system because in it, it's an equal fight. Whoever has skills wins.**Paradox 2: Master's degree or PhD is required**This is especially true for machine learning engineer jobs, but the same thing can be applied to other jobs as well. Now, in my opinion, the difference between a bachelor's and master's is that if you're getting a bachelor's, what it says is you are someone who is capable of starting something small, and finish it. Maybe you have little bit of side project here and there, but nothing crazy. If you have a master's, what it says is that you can start and finish medium-sized projects, and you can also sometimes be a leader within the project as well. PhD is just matter of scaling up from master's. Now, this is what a degree ""generally"" says about you, because if you're an undergrad, companies don't expect you to develop a niche. But here's the thing, I did. I have a lot of experience in machine learning just like I said at the beginning, but company doesn't care about that because I am not a master's student. You have publications? Doesn't matter, you're an undergrad. You developed a deep learning model by yourself? Doesn't matter, you don't have a master's.Now, for those who just thought to yourself ""just get a master's bro"", here's paradox 3. **Paradox 3: I ain't got no money like that** This might be surprising for some of you but there are people who genuinely don't have money. And surprise, surprise, I don't have money. I want to work in industry to save money to go back to a master's program, but if I want to look for a job paradox 1 and paradox 2 appear, but if I want to get a master's, I need money first to even go there in the first place. And yes scholarship is a thing and definitely helps, but I need full-ride scholarship if I want to go, but those opportunities don't easily come around.**Paradox 4: Connection matters**Now, I'm not saying this statement is the paradox, but what I hear from people who are already in the system is a paradox. When I talk about these things to people who have already established themselves, they oftentimes say ""It's not about degree"" or ""If you can show that you have the skill, that's all we care about"". Now, as an engineer, they are right. It is not about degree, as long as you have the skills. But, at the same time they are not the one who is looking at my resume, it's the HR or sometime LLMs. Now I don't have the ""experience"" so I don't know how companies work, but should engineers hire another engineer? Or I guess they don't have the time so HR exists? I don't know.**Paradox 5: It's a tough time right now**For like 4 years it has been a tough time, bro. Damn.**Paradox 6: Just find a generic soft dev job**This is usually what I get from people when I talk about these paradoxes. ""You know, the hardest part is to get your foot in the system. I think you should apply for a software engineering job first and go from there."" So I said ""bet"" and applied to a bunch (I mean a bunch) of software engineering jobs. But they all say no because I am too specialized in machine learning. Welp, wtf.These are the paradoxes that I can think of right now. And I know that I used the term ""paradox"" very loosely here, but I hope you can see my point of view. And with all the seriousness, this is why I say I found the niche at the wrong time. Because I slowly began to realize that I was going nowhere with my ML skills, because the world is not obligated to take time to see what each person is capable of. I get it, people just generally don't have time.And here comes the million dollar question: What do I do now then? I am stuck between these paradoxes and the walls around me are getting tighter and tighter. I really need help.Thanks guys for reading this far, and I really appreciate it.",4,0.6,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ls65ow/junior_developer_paradox_finding_niche_and_doing/,2025-07-05 09:42:59,2025-07-12 01:49:58
1lxac4k,Is “on-call” just a necessary part of being in IT?,Dawn_of_an_Era,cscareerquestions,"I graduated college 5 years ago, and have been with my medical tech company since. I make great pay, well above 6 figures, have 5-6 weeks of PTO, great retirement benefits and health insurance, all that boring but great stuff. But for all of my 5 years, I’ve always had an on-call rotation.In this current position, it’s 9am-9pm, Monday through Sunday, once every 4 weeks. Most times, nothing happens. But the reality is that I have to always be ready for something to happen. I’ve worked in 3 different positions since graduating, and all had on-call rotations. It feels like it’s everywhere for systems engineers.It feels so aggravating at times. For one out of every 4 weeks, I can’t go out to dinner, I can’t go to a concert, I can’t have a few drinks, and I can’t go do fun weekend activities, because I have to be within 15-30 minutes of a response time in the unlikely event that something goes wrong.Usually, everything is fine, and there are no issues. Which, I’m grateful for. But it feels tough when my friends want to plan to go to the beach with our boyfriends on a Saturday, and I have to say no because I need to be somewhere with WiFi in case things go awry.It feels like such a champagne problem; I’m making more than double what any of my other friends make, and I have more money saved for retirement than most people 10 years older than me do. So it feels incredibly entitled to be bitching about this. But I feel like I’m constantly avoiding fun things during my “free time” because I need to be ready for a server to go down that most likely will not go down.",4,0.56,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lxac4k/is_oncall_just_a_necessary_part_of_being_in_it/,2025-07-11 15:47:41,2025-07-12 01:49:58
1lx4n2k,"As A Graduated Computer Engineer, Am I Wasting my Education By Studying Cloud Computing?",iv_damke,cscareerquestions,"Hello everyone.I am graduated from one of the best engineering schools in Turkey and I received a fairly comprehensive computer engineering education, but this education was mostly about embedded systems, low-level stuff and algorithms. Now, I am applied to a school in Ireland for master in cloud computing. The problem is, applying to this university was a bit of a rush, and I hadn't researched the field very much.I started to learn the basics of cloud computing, and while I had no trouble learning, there's something bothering me. Working on the cloud is starting to feel like the comprehensive engineering education I received is being wasted. I'm not just talking about how the processor works. I feel like I won't be able to use the data structures and algorithms I've learned here at all.Do you have anything to say about that? If I continue to study cloud computing, will the engineering knowledge I've gained from my education and internships be useful to me, or will I be in the same position as someone with no IT experience? I am not underestimating people with no IT experience. It's just it bothers me to think that hard education was for nothing. A brief answer would relieve a lot of my anxiety.",4,0.7,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lx4n2k/as_a_graduated_computer_engineer_am_i_wasting_my/,2025-07-11 11:40:03,2025-07-12 01:49:58
1lwxvit,Switching to AI research at 36,k4Rlail,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone! I’ve been working as a software engineer in web development for almost 13 years now. I reached the Senior level about 8 years ago, but I’ve never really felt the urge to climb further. Management just never appealed to me.My true passion has always been astrophysics, but with limited job prospects in that field in my country of origin, and a strong interest in programming (plus the better pay), I chose software engineering as my career.Now that I’ve moved to a country with more opportunities in research, I want to carve out a new path and finally pursue real science. I’m planning to transition into AI research. I know that traditional SWE roles aren't exactly in high demand at places like NASA, but AI research feels like the perfect mix of what I love: math, programming, and science.I’ve already started going through MIT and Stanford lectures to prepare. My goal is to eventually get into the OpenAI Residency.The challenge is that in SWE, I knew exactly what to do to grow and succeed. With AI and ML, I’m still figuring out what skills are most valuable, what gives people an edge, and whether aiming for OpenAI Residency is even realistic.If anyone has made a similar transition or has experience in AI research, I’d really appreciate any advice on how to make this switch worthwhile and how to stand out.Upd: Forgot to add that I never got a higher education, which might add to the challenge of getting into OpenAI residency",4,0.55,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lwxvit/switching_to_ai_research_at_36/,2025-07-11 04:37:14,2025-07-12 01:49:58

1lwlw3r,I signed for another full-stack role but love low-level systems. Advice?,Spurs_54,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I'll keep this brief. I'm a CS student who just finished their first year of college. Due to prior college credits, I can graduate anywhere from spring 2027 to spring 2028. By a stroke of luck, I'm currently interning at C1 and have signed an offer for summer 2026 at Walmart. I'm doing generic full-stack work at C1 and will likely do the same at Walmart (if I don't renege). However, I discovered I'm far more interested low-level/systems programming through a computer systems course I took last semester. I won't be able to take relevant coursework until 2026, with parallel computing in the spring and OS in the fall.How can I pivot into systems when my resume lists only full-stack work and I have no related coursework?Any advice and personal anecdotes would be much appreciated.",3,0.81,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lwlw3r/i_signed_for_another_fullstack_role_but_love/,2025-07-10 19:33:12,2025-07-12 01:49:58
