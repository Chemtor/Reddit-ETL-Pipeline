1knixik,Is python no longer a prerequisite to call yourself a data engineer?,ttothesecond,dataengineering,"I am a little over 4 years into my first job as a DE and would call myself solid in python. Over the last week, I've been helping conduct interviews to fill another DE role in my company - and I kid you not, not a single candidate has known how to write python - despite it very clearly being part of our job description. Other than python, most of them (except for one exceptionally bad candidate) could talk the talk regarding tech stack, ELT vs ETL, tools like dbt, Glue, SQL Server, etc. but not a single one could actually write python.What's even more insane to me is that ALL of them rated themselves somewhere between 5-8 (yes, the most recent one said he's an 8) in their python skills. Then when we get to the live coding portion of the session, they literally cannot write a single line. I understand live coding is intimidating, but my goodness, surely you can write just ONE coherent line of code at an 8/10 skill level. I just do not understand why they are doing this - do they really think we're not gonna ask them to prove it when they rate themselves that highly?What is going on here?? edit: Alright I stand corrected - I guess a lot of yall don't use python for DE work.

Do data engineers remember all the steps and syntax needed to create Cloud SQL Instances or do they just reference documentation?2. Furthermore, do data engineers just memorize conceptual knowledge of SQL, Python, the terminal, etc. or do you memorize granular syntax and steps too?I assume that you just reference documentation because it seems like a lot of granular steps and syntax to memorize.

1kn2cgq,Perhaps the best transition: DS > DE,HungryRefrigerator24,dataengineering,"Currently I have around 6 years of professional experience in which the biggest part is into Data Science. Ive started my career when I was young as a hybrid of Data Analyst and Data Engineering, doing a bit of both, and then changed for Data Scientist. I've always liked the idea of working with AI and ML and statistics, and although I do enjoy it a lot (specially because I really like social sciences, hence working with DS gives me a good feeling of learning a bit about population behavior) I believe that perhaps Ive found a better deal in DE.What happens is that I got laid off last year as a Data Scientist, and found it difficult to get a new job since I didnt have work experience with the trendy AI Agents, and decided to give it a try as a full-time DE. Right now I believe that I've never been so productive because I actually see my deliverables as something ""solid"", something that no pretencious ""business guy"" will try to debate or outsmart me (with his 5min GPT research).Usually most of my DS routine envolved trying to convince the ""business guy"" that asked for me to deliver something, that my solutions was indeed correct despite of his opinion on that matter. Now I've found myself with tasks that is moving data from A to B, and once it's done theres no debate whether it is true or not, and I can feel myself relieved. Perhaps what I see in the future that could also give me a relatable feeling of ""solidity"" is MLE/MLOps. This is just a shout out for those that are also tired, perhaps give it a chance for DE and try to see if it brings a piece of mind for you. I still work with DS, but now for my own pleasure and in university, where I believe that is the best environment for DS to properly employed in the point of view of the developer.",67,0.92,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kn2cgq/perhaps_the_best_transition_ds_de/,2025-05-15 07:32:53,2025-05-22 01:40:59

1kouhgg,How do experienced data engineers handle unreliable manual data entry in source systems?,poopdood696969,dataengineering,"I’m a newer data engineer working on a project that connects two datasets—one generated through an old, rigid system that involves a lot of manual input, and another that’s more structured and reliable. The challenge is that the manual data entry is inconsistent enough that I’ve had to resort to fuzzy matching for key joins, because there’s no stable identifier I can rely on.In my case, it’s something like linking a record of a service agreement with corresponding downstream activity, where the source data is often riddled with inconsistent naming, formatting issues, or flat-out typos. I’ve started to notice this isn’t just a one-off problem—manual data entry seems to be a recurring source of pain across many projects.For those of you who’ve been in the field a while:How do you typically approach this kind of situation? Are there best practices or long-term strategies for managing or mitigating the chaos caused by manual data entry?Do you rely on tooling, data contracts, better upstream communication—or just brute-force data cleaning?Would love to hear how others have approached this without going down a never-ending rabbit hole of fragile matching logic.",25,0.96,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kouhgg/how_do_experienced_data_engineers_handle/,2025-05-17 14:36:58,2025-05-22 01:40:59

But the need — a simple, internal way to spin up data environments, turned out to be much more universal. Onyxia is now used by teams in Norway, at the UN, and in the US, among others.At its core, Onyxia is a web app (packaged as a Helm chart) that lets users log in (via OIDC), choose from a service catalog, configure resources (CPU, GPU, Docker image, env vars, launch script…), and deploy to their own K8s namespace.Highlights:- Admin-defined service catalog using Helm charts + `values.schema.json` → Onyxia auto-generates dynamic UI forms.- Native S3 integration with web UI and token-based access. Files uploaded through the browser are instantly usable in services.- Vault-backed secrets injected into running containers as env vars.- One-click links for launching preconfigured setups (widely used for teaching or onboarding).- DuckDB-Wasm file viewer for exploring large parquet/csv/json files directly in-browser.- Full white label theming, colors, logos, layout, even injecting custom JS/CSS.There’s a public instance at [datalab.sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) for French students, teachers, and researchers, running on real compute (including H100 GPUs).If your org is trying to build an internal alternative to Databricks or Workbench-style setups — without vendor lock-in, curious to hear your take.",22,0.92,3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvpNfVrxBFM,2025-05-21 09:21:39,2025-05-22 01:40:59

1kpaisy,Is it a bad idea to use DuckDB as my landing zone format in S3?,DuckDatum,dataengineering,"I’m polling data out of a system that forces a strict quota, pagination, and requires I fanout my requests per record in order to denormalize its HATEAOS links into nested data that can later be flattened into a tabular model. It’s a lot, likely because the interface wasn’t intended for this purpose. It’s what I’ve got though. It’s slow with lots of steps to potentially fail at. All that, and I can only filter at a days granularity—so polling for changes is a loaded process too.I went ahead and set up an ETL pipeline that used DuckDB as an intermediate caching layer, to avoid memory issues, and set it up to dump parquet into S3. This ran for 24 hours then failed just shy of the dump, so now I’m thinking about micro batches.I want to turn this into a microbatch process. I figure I can cache the ID, HATEAOS link, and a nullable column for the JSON data. Once I have the data, I update the row where it belongs. I could store duckdb in S3 the whole time, or just plan to dump it if a failure occurs. This also gives a way to query the duckdb for missing records in case it fails mid way.So before I dump duckdb into S3, or even try to use duckdb in s3 over a network, are there limitations I’m not considering?

1kotr7w,Advice on Data Pipeline that Requires Individual API Calls,pswagsbury,dataengineering,"Hi Everyone,I’m tasked with grabbing data from one db about devices and using a rest api to pull information associated with it. The problem is that the api only allows inputting a single device at a time and I have 20k+ rows in the db table. The plan is to automate this using airflow as a daily job (probably 20-100 new rows per day). What would be the best way of doing this? For now I was going to resort to a for-loop but this doesn’t seem the most efficient.Additionally, the api returns information about the device, and a list of sub devices that are children to the main device. The number of children is arbitrary, but they all have the same fields: the parent and children. I want to capture all the fields for each parent and child, so I was thinking of have a table in long format with an additional column called parent_id, which allows the children records to be self joined on their parent record. Note: each api call is around 500ms average, and no I cannot just join the table with the underlying api data source directlyDoes my current approach seem valid? I am eager to learn if there are any tools that would work great in my situation or if there are any glaring flaws.Thanks!",15,0.84,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kotr7w/advice_on_data_pipeline_that_requires_individual/,2025-05-17 14:03:40,2025-05-22 01:40:59

We currently have a use case where we need to seek distinct values for some fields in thousands of files, which is quite slow when done directly on S3.My manager and I were experimenting with Parquet files to achieve this. but I recently found out that Parquet files are immutable, so we can't update existing parquet files with new listings unless we load the whole file into memory.

1kr1azg,How to build an API on top of a dbt model?,bebmfec,dataengineering,"I have quite a complex SQL query within DBT which I have been tasked to build an API 'on top of'.More specifically, I want to create an API that allows users to send input data (e.g., JSON with column values), and under the hood, it runs my dbt model using that input and returns the transformed output as defined by the model.For example, suppose I have a dbt model called `my_model` (in reality the model is a lot more complex): select {{ macro_1(""col_1"") }} as out_col_1, {{ macro_2(""col_1"", ""col_2"") }} as out_col_2 from {{ ref('input_model_or_data') }} Normally, `ref('input_model_or_data')` would resolve to another dbt model, but I’ve seen in dbt unit tests that you can inject synthetic data into that `ref()`, like this: - name: test_my_model model: my_model given: - input: ref('input_model_or_data') rows: - {col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1} expect: rows: - {out_col_1: ""out_val_1"", out_col_2: ""out_val_2""} This allows the test to override the input source. I’d like to do something similar via an API: the user sends input like `{col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}` to an endpoint, and the API returns the output of the dbt model (e.g., `{out_col_1: ""out_val_1"", out_col_2: ""out_val_2""}`), having used that input as the data behind `ref('input_model_or_data')`.What’s the recommended way to do something like this?",8,0.8,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kr1azg/how_to_build_an_api_on_top_of_a_dbt_model/,2025-05-20 10:15:49,2025-05-22 01:40:59

I thought it would be a cool way to explore string matching and character encoding in Python — and I'd love to get your thoughts or improvements!## How the cipher works:- Each character is converted to its ASCII value.- That number (as a string) is searched for in the digits of π (ignoring the decimal point).- The **starting index** of the first match and the **length** of the match are recorded.- Each character is encoded as `index-length`, separated by hyphens.### Example:The ASCII value of `'A'` is `65`. If `65` first appears in π at index **7** (π = 3.141592653... → digits = 141592653...), then it's encoded as:```7-2```---## Here’s an encrypted message:```11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2```---## And here’s the Python code to decode it:```pythonfrom mpmath import mpmp.dps = 100005 # digits of πpi_digits = str(mp.pi)[2:]cipher_text = ( ""11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2"")segments = cipher_text.strip().split(""-"")index_length_pairs = [ (int(segments[i]), int(segments[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(segments), 2)]decoded_chars = []for index, length in index_length_pairs: ascii_digits = pi_digits[index - 1 : index - 1 + length] decoded_chars.append(chr(int(ascii_digits)))decoded_message = """".join(decoded_chars)print(decoded_message)```---### Tutorial FlairThis post demonstrates how to decode a custom cipher based on the digits of π.

Runtime errors. So many times I couldn't 100% understand why something I am passing is not rendering and what the console errors mean, what is a type Object Object etc and since I got tired of starting and giving up I decided randomly to do a project with Typescript instead of JS and holy shit. All type errors get underlined right away and just copy pasting to AI and asking for an explanation gets to understand things like when you're using a reference or comparing a reference instead of a value instead of learning about it once you set everything up. So while it might be more work, what got me to truly enjoy writing web stuff is learning Typescript. If you know any typed language it is super quick to pick up, and if it's your first typed language you'll need a bit more time to get it but once you do you're not going back to vanilla JS.

Yes I said drag and drop.Most people would just put on YouTube on headphones and like zombies drag and drop all day. (Wish I was making this up). These resources were used to help students in exam preparation. In the folders there where hundreds of different PDFs, PowerPoints, MCQ questions as well as thousands of csv files.She was in a perpetually panic to do this for unclear reasons. I guess they powered her website and her entire business.At the time I had no programming knowledge yet instinctively knew it could be done better. In my total ignorance I tried some some scripts in Javascript until she caught me and yelled at me to do my real job. Later I was let go for not being productive enough.I asked some nearby devs for help but they said they were too busy.Today I know an intern could have a Python script doing the main stuff inside a day with os.system, glob, a few for loops, csv libraries etc, pandas. Stick a chron job and it’s daily routine. Even better use Powershell / awk, see or grep.Better yet move everything to the cloud.The entire process could have automated inside a month when all edge cases where accounted for. There were some devs on front end but I think they hated her so much they didn’t intervene or didn’t get paid enough to care. They all left very rapidly I don’t blame them for claiming ignorance. The owner / founder was a psychotic bint.One time, a dev got validly angry about something unrelated about a development process and suddenly next week he was gone for ""operational reasons"".She paid 10-15 people minimum wage to do this drag and dropping for 2-3 years to best of my knowledge.

I love learning new things. I constantly have to learn something and I do not care if it is about a social science, scientific science or about astrology, history, feminism. So I think that coding enables me to satisfy that curiosity 2. I’m drawn to the kind of routine a programmer can have.; I like spending time in front of a computer, I like office work, remote work; I especially appreciate the flexibility that tech jobs often provide3. Although it can be hard to handle frustration, I like being challenged by a problem4. Another important reason is the financial stability that programming can offer.5.

1kowjvr,Feeling stuck as a junior dev – is this normal or is it just my company?,Apprehensive-West119,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I'm a junior fullstack developer with just under a year of experience. I work at a small software house that maintains and develops a few internal apps and services.Lately, I’ve been feeling extremely frustrated with the direction my work has taken, and I’m not sure if I’m just being unrealistic or if this is genuinely a toxic environment. I’d love some outside perspective.When I started, I was trained in the company's main stack – NestJS (Node) and React – and I was excited to grow in that tech. But for the past few months, I’ve been doing tasks that have almost nothing to do with fullstack development:* Creating automations in low-code tools* Researching integrations with outdated platforms* Working in an 8-year-old PHP project (I had zero experience in PHP before)To make it worse, the PHP project has no proper security practices (e.g., passwords stored in plaintext in the database), and my suggestions for refactoring or rewriting it in our actual stack have been ignored.I'm currently split across 3 different projects and constantly bombarded with tasks from all sides. Meetings eat up a lot of time, and I’m falling behind. There’s barely any code review or mentorship, and I feel like I’m not learning or growing in the direction I want.On top of all that, I’m working for minimum wage in my country, which makes it even more discouraging -I’m putting in real effort but I feel like I’m getting very little in return, both in terms of compensation and career growth.I do have a backup plan (a non-IT job I could return to), but I’m hesitant to give up on development just yet. That said, the junior job market is rough, and I’m worried that if I leave now, I might end up searching for months before I find another dev position.So I'm stuck in this limbo — should I just accept that this is how things are in smaller companies and try to push through? Or is this a sign that I should look for a better environment?Would really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through something similar.

1krdg5h,Want to start a new career programming,Sea-Journalist2524,learnprogramming,"About 2 years ago, I found a process at work using a Google Sheet way too complicated and wanted to automate it, so I started with playing about in Apps Script and solved that problem at work, found out I really liked this stuff and that I'm good at logical problem solving.I've since learned quite a bit of JavaScript and automated a bunch more stuff at work using the API's that our systems offer, to the point where I basically came up with the idea to create a centralised software that connects all of our systems together using all their API's and data. I did not do that personally, our IT guy did, but I came up with the vision etc and I put in a few lines of code myself but will not take credit for what he's done.I've completed Foundational C# with Microsoft/freeCodeCamp and I'm like halfway through Harvard's free CS50 course.I'm still quite unfamiliar with Git or GitHub, but I kind of know how it's used and what it's purposes are.I really feel like I would be happy doing this as a career, but I am now 31 and I don't have a CS degree under my belt, I have a music production degree instead.

Most of the time, I ended up just following what was shown, without actually understanding *why* we were doing something a certain way. The basics never felt clear, and I was always left with questions like “why exactly is this done like this?”So now, I’ve decided to start fresh — this time with a proper focus on understanding things deeply, step by step. My main preference is to **read books or documentation** rather than watching videos. I feel like books allow me to go at my own pace, re-read things, and properly think about what I’m learning. I’ve also heard from others that books usually explain things in more detail and depth compared to many tutorials.Here’s how I’m planning to approach it:1. First, I want to learn **general programming concepts** — like how code works, what happens behind the scenes, how computers interpret programs, memory, logic, etc.2. Then I’ll move on to **Python**, relearn it properly with all the basics and get confident with it.3. After that, I want to get into **C++**, so that I can understand things on a lower level and get better with performance, system-level thinking, etc.I'm also planning to go into **data structures and algorithms** in between, once I have a decent hold on Python.So I’m mainly looking for **book recommendations** (or any really well-explained resources) for:* Basics of coding and general programming logic* Beginner to intermediate Python* DSA (preferably in Python, but general ones are okay too)* A good path to learn C++ after Python* Clean code, writing good code, and long-term coding habitsIf there are any **video courses that explain things really well and in depth**, I’m open to them too, but my first preference will always be books.If anyone here has gone through a similar journey or prefers reading like me, I’d love to hear your experience and suggestions.

1kom4ek,The myth of the STEM talent shortage,SingleInSeattle87,cscareerquestions,"https://issues.org/stem-workforce-shortage-data-hira/Data doesn't lie. Why is whenever I hear justification for H1B and STEM-OPT everywhere on mainstream media, and even codified in US law, court transcripts and policy discussions: they keep saying there's a shortage of STEM workers, especially tech workers and we need more immigrants to fill those roles. Why do we hear this all the time, but it's never actually supported by data?Further, the department of labor actually has a list of jobs known to be in shortage and it doesn't use biased industry reports to determine them: it uses its own data as well as BLS data. This list is called ""Schedule A"" and it allows employers to fast track immigrant visas into these occupations without needing to go through the H1B process.But the INA has this weird thing where if a prospective job pays under $60k the employer must recruit US workers first, but it does not offer that protection to jobs that pay over $60k or if the job requires a masters degree. Congress justified this, as saying jobs paying over $60k or requiring a masters is a reasonable proxy to a job that is in shortage. But it's not. Schedule A has existed for just as long as the H1B came about in 1990. This makes me question the purpose of the H1B in the first place.If the DOL has the ability to analyze the labor market and determine certain jobs are in dire need, and need skilled immigrant labor, and our those on a dynamic list every year, why do we have ""H1B"" at all? Why can't the actual jobs in shortage, be listed, and the jobs not in shortage have to prove they couldn't find a qualified US citizen before hiring an immigrant?It seems congress relied on industry lobbying and their ""facts"" rather than our own DOL and BLS.",430,0.9,206,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kom4ek/the_myth_of_the_stem_talent_shortage/,2025-05-17 06:09:20,2025-05-22 01:41:01

For example specialize entirely on mobile code using something like swift and show a specialization in this language. I feel like everyone’s learning java and python, myself included so would learning a specialized language be more desirable? Or should I just stick with something like a MERN stack and pump out projects that are “more complex” with more universal technologies.

Could I make this its own section where I say I have contributed to 10+ open source projects with a link to my github for them to check themselves.

I make a sizeable amount of money, I work hybrid, and I get plenty of vacation. And yet I'm miserable.As the layoffs started, the company culture immediately rotted. I found myself pushing back on others' nonsensical, perf-driven demands. I was making decisions not for technical excellence but for less stressful approvals. I was constantly fighting off attempts to steal scope or credit. Then a coworker sabotaged my work and advertised to L7's how he already had a great plan to fix ""my"" mistakes. (He was promoted for this.)**I realized that a career in tech is not about good work or good skills. It's about politics, and it gets worse the more senior you get.** I spoke to some mid-level and senior friends, and they've all told me the same, with many of them questioning their careers too.I started not caring anymore about scalable architectures or sensible design decisions. I went looking for other jobs, then I realized nearly every big company is like this now, not just Amazon. I also realized quickly that all my cold applications were getting trashed without a look; only recruiter calls mattered. (Condolences to all the entry-level folks, it really is rough out there.)**More importantly, I started questioning the point of it all.** I pursued tech because I liked coding and designing. I liked the idea of working with others to build great things. And I liked the prospect of working anywhere in the world, and not being tied to a single company.But above all I wanted to make an impact. I wanted to build software that improved millions of lives. I planned to work my way up to senior in the private sector, save a lot of money, then take a pay cut to go work for the government or a public contractor. Then Elon Musk destroyed that path.Now, I was studying so hard to get an offer to do... what? Squeeze out 0.02% more ad revenue? Get more people addicted to gambling? Exploit more vulnerable children? Or build tools to let other companies better do those things? Because that's what most big tech companies are, and why they pay the big bucks.In college, I was a premed as well as a CS major. I had everything from lab research to volunteer hours, from the courses to the MCAT—all I had to do was send the med school applications. Then I chose to pursue tech instead. After years in the real world, I'm doubting my choice.**I'm not building things that matter.

1knzvpt,"Don't Get Categorized as The ""Person That Always Helps"" or The ""Go-To Person""",EngineerDoge00,cscareerquestions,"Three and a half years ago I graduated college and was pulled into a startup as the only US dev in a US startup for a full-stack position. The other two devs before me were in India. I was the only dev in the US (during working hours) for over a year before finally getting a second US full-stack dev (then a third and fourth front-end). Today, the small startup where I knew everyone's' name ended up getting bought out and had money pumped into it that ended up making it grow exponentially. Now I only see maybe 5% of who work in my company regularly. Because of my circumstanced, I have been categorized as the ""Go-To Person"" for getting stuff fixed or done in my company during the working hours.Before we were bought out, I already had that reputation, being the longest standing dev on the US side. I would get pings from people every couple hours that needed assistance in something they were working on, or needed someone with ""expert knowledge"" on the software in a quick meeting. I was able to balance this with my own work decent enough to still be able to get my work done in a reasonable time. But since our side of the company got exponentially bigger since being bought out, now I get pings ever 15 - 30 min some days and my schedule has been loaded with meetings that require that dev with ""expert knowledge"", even though most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I'm good at figuring it out though).Because of this, my productivity is shot. Tickets that should take 2 - 3 days are taking a week or more sometimes. I've talked to my manager over the last year about this and we have made an ""Ask a Dev"" channel for questions that aren't urgent (which has filtered out the obvious and obviously dumb questions that are asked from being asked), urgent stuff now gets filtered through the scrum master which she divides up between me and the only other full-stack that works during the workday, and we've preached, multiple times to not contact any dev directly, even though this only lasts for a little while before everyones ""Super Urgent!"" problem finds its way to my teams chat directly... again...So take this as a warning. Don't become the ""Go-To Person"" of your company/division/team if you want to keep your sanity. Edit: Spelling/grammer errors.

Our customers don't like it when they realize that the person they're asking for help actually has no idea because they're a software dev cosplaying as a store employee. ""What type of item do you need to do ABC? I have no idea but let me ask a real store employee, 1 sec.""2. I've had store employees treat me harshly upon meeting me because I'm a fake store employee just there for a day, I'm taking time away from them doing their regular stuff while they explain stuff to me, etc... and I also think some resent the salary discrepancy. Sometimes someone will tell me that their family member makes X amount of money and I don't say anything but I'm thinking ""I never asked, I'm just here to comply and keep my job"".3. None of the things that the store employees complain about are something that I even have any power whatsoever to change or fix. It's just not something that my team or department works on. And instead of me being there, why can't it just be an email from them directly to management? and how many more times am I going to have to keep doing this?After completing one of these visits I'm given an opportunity to fill out a survey which I always do, but then in the future I'm still told basically ""do it or you're fired"".

1kqmlek,"""Not an Engineer"" - Limited Growth Opportunities Because of CS Degree Title",SouthMouth79,cscareerquestions,"I graduated in May 2023 with a Computer Science degree from a well respected program. Like many others in my class, it was tough landing a full-time role in this market. I did some contract work for a while until I was recently hired full-time as a “Controls and Automation Specialist”. A basic summary of what my division in the company does is that we install and program factory computers.I didn’t think much of the title of the role before starting; it wasn’t heavily stressed as a distinguishing factor in the interview, job posting, or any further correspondence with the company. It wasn’t until I started that I came to understand that there is a significant distinction between “Specialists” and “Engineers” in my division. Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, not just computer related, but from my current understanding, C+A Engineers have more career mobility within the company as well as higher salaries, even in entry-level roles.When I asked about the difference, I was told that because I have a “Computer Science” degree, I’m not considered an engineer and can’t be billed to clients as one. I thought this might be a regional thing, that software engineering isn’t yet considered “real” engineering in the southeast. But today I found out that one of our interns is titled an engineer but is pursuing a degree in Software Engineering; a degree that differs from Computer Science at their university by a single required course (Software Security).I have plenty of CS grad friends that went on to become Software Engineers, so I didn’t expect the wording of my degree to limit my role like this. I really like my coworkers, the work that I do, and the company I work for. I genuinely pictured myself being part of the company for the long-term. But it’s been hard not to feel like I’m missing out on long-term growth simply because of a technicality in how my education is labeled.Has anyone else run into this kind of title/pay/growth ceiling based on your degree title? Would love to hear how others have navigated this or similar situations, or just general suggestions or opinions on how to proceed.TLDR:CS grad working in controls/automation was told I can't hold an ""Engineer"" title, or access related pay and growth, because my degree isn’t labeled “Engineering,” despite doing similar work.

I was hired as developer in a project for a client from finance/fintech industry. The project was postponed or never started, and I've spent my entire time in there doing absolutely nothing, however I was told that they will find replacement project for me eventually, then 1 month before the end of my employment contract I was suggested to look for another job as they won't extend my employment. Can't say that I didn't expect that after few months of doing nothing, but I was really pissed off. At the time I could already be part of some nice project, get the know-how and be really productive in some other company.**2024 was my worst year in the industry in terms of looking for a new job, I was unemployed for few months after that company.**Now my current position - the same story. Very similiar IT Indian company, I won't give you any names but there is a few of them so you can probably figure it out.

I know that sometimes you just sit on the bench as a contractor, but this is other situation and often after some time you just stop getting paid.

1krqwwm,Possible Ray of Hope in Trying Times: Let’s Build Our Own Opportunity,Redgeraraged,cscareerquestions,"I was reflecting on [u/SnooTangerines9703](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooTangerines9703/)'s [post on building startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kq8hq3/fk_it_lets_build_startups/). It's something that’s been on my mind for a while. I used to think it was too tedious or far-fetched, but lately, desperation and a deep hunger to make something real have completely overridden that imposter syndrome I carried. Reading their post was like hearing my own thoughts said out loud made me hyperfocus on it.So here’s what I’m proposing (and may even build myself if I get enough support behind me):**One group. One community.** Let’s stop being divided and conquered in a dog-eat-dog grind. Let’s build *together*. Learn together. Grow together.The idea is to start a community, on Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, Reddit, wherever there's traction where anyone who's serious about learning and building can join. No gatekeeping, just mutual accountability.**How it would work:*** Each member logs their learning journey with a start and end date, plus their chosen path (e.g. [`MOOC.fi`](http://MOOC.fi) `Java => Java Internship (3 months) & Java II (3 months)`, `Harvard CS50 => (3 months) => w: Web Dev Internship, ai: AI Internship`, etc.).* Proof of completion is required (certs, GitHub commits, demo videos). This isn’t about fluff, it’s about **real growth*** Every Thursday or Friday we could have a community event like DSA Thursday/Friday* After internship, or if you want to skip it would be **Entry-Level** (the initial commitment would be **6 to 12 months**)* Everyone begins by building a **personal project** to set a baseline and gauge their current level.* If possible, everyone at this stage is assigned an accountability buddy, preferably one that isn't on the same team so that one person isn't doing the work of another. * After that, we begin and transition into **collaborative projects** run in an agile team format. Everyone keeps their main role they want and rotates any unused/unsure roles: designer, dev, PM, tester, to build real-world skills.# The exposure strategy:Once a project is finished, we create a **video breakdown** and post it on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, or wherever else makes sense. Each person is credited for their work and gets the exposure they deserve.Let’s be real: Most of us are **introverts**. Some of us are **highly skilled**. And many of us are **still unemployed**, even while being more capable than folks earning six figures.This isn't just about skill, it's about being **seen**. We need a system that clears the dust off our shine. Many of us are grasping at straws. **Maybe this is what we actually need: real experience, real proof, and real support.**# Long-term vision:* After 6+ months, or if your **personal project** stands out, you transition into a **junior developer role** within the group.* You start to take on leadership responsibilities and begin developing those soft skills like communication, initiative, and mentoring.* By then, or even earlier, you should be ready for a paid role. If not, you’ll still have a strong portfolio, exposure, and momentum to start freelancing or even launch your own thing.# What a full journey might look like (if starting from zero):1. **Internship Phase (Learning Phase):** * Java I & II (MOOC.fi), or Full-Stack, or Python, or 2x+ CS50 courses, etc. * \~6 months total (self-paced) * Initial project (\~1 month) * Career development + feedback2. **Entry-Level Phase** * 3 to 12 projects built with team * Weekly GitHub updates, project demos, and social proof * Lasts 6 to 12 months3. **Junior Phase** * \~6+ months of group work and possible freelancing * Exposure, mentorship, and leadership opportunitiesIn total, you’d have **about 2 years of experience**, real-world projects, team collaboration skills, leadership development, and consistent exposure. With that kind of portfolio and growth, **you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t hire you**.I may start this, but I obviously can’t do it alone. If you’re interested, or if you have suggestions to improve the idea, **drop a comment or DM me**. Please share this with anyone you think may benefit from this style of rigor, discipline and community.Let's stop moping and wallowing away our best years in self pity.Let’s stop waiting for experience and start **building it**.",22,0.74,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1krqwwm/possible_ray_of_hope_in_trying_times_lets_build/,2025-05-21 06:17:27,2025-05-22 01:41:01

1kpjo1q,My internship is offering me an ambitious full-time role and I’m nervous,motuwed,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Interned at a non-tech company for 1.5 years, recently got offered a part-time-to-full-time software dev role on their AI use case team. Super excited, but nervous since there’s no real junior dev pipeline or formal training, and I’m jumping straight from student to full-time dev in a small team that mostly hires experienced people.I interned at this company for about 1.5 years with 8 moths full-time and the rest part-time.During that time, I worked on a pretty wide range of stuff: manually testing new software, creating architectural diagrams, documenting codebases, and toward the end, helping a new AI team build web apps with AI-driven features.It’s been about two months since the internship ended. When I wrapped up, there was talk of a full-time offer closer to graduation (which is in August). But recently, they reached out and said they’d actually like to offer me a position now—starting part-time, then moving to full-time after I graduate. I asked about the role, and they said “AI Developer,” which basically just means I’d be a software dev on the AI use case team (so not data science or ML).I’m super excited because I loved the team environment and like most of us our dream is software dev. That said, I’m also nervous.This company isn’t a tech company, it’s actually pretty far from one. And because of that, the structure is a bit different. There’s not really a formal junior engineer pipeline or training program. Most people get hired with several years of experience already under their belt. I do know a couple folks who came in a year or two after graduating, but even then, it was through a setup where they’d already been doing independent contract work for a while.I know I’m a strong developer, and I learn quickly, but I also know I benefit a lot from structure and guidance. Obviously working with the team towards the end of my internship did give me SOME experience, but I still feel like the jump from student to full time dev is massive and I’m worried about working in an environment that might not have that change in the forefront of their mind. Especially given that the team I’d join only has a handful of developers (maybe 3).",19,0.85,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kpjo1q/my_internship_is_offering_me_an_ambitious/,2025-05-18 13:12:48,2025-05-22 01:41:01

Generally work on applying LLM and graph neural networks to social science problems. Applied for a PhD research intern position.1. Got OA, it was dumb as fuck. Had to download and play games in Roblox. They're basically iq tests where you had to do like factory optimization and design cars to cross obstacle courses or whatever. I was just like fuck it and got basically a 0 on the first game and gave up on the rest because it wasn't worth the effort lol. 2. Recruiter schedules a call with me and basically tells me I'm moving on to the interview calls. Tells me to just redo the OAs for completion and basically that the scores don't matter. I guess they do resume screening before OA results and if your experience is relevant enough they don't care lmao. 3. Get a crappy score on the second game, and third OA segment is a bunch of behavioral scenarios, like ""your boss is wrong about something, how do you approach the situation"". No coding OA, interestingly. 4. Had a thirty minute behavioral round with pretty standard questions, ""tell me about a project where you had a different approach than stakeholders wanted"", etc etc. 5. 45 minute coding round. Really easy? I feel like I've seen other internship reports where people are getting LC hards, maybe they make it easier for the research positions. Question was basically valid parentheses but you also had to handle quote strings. Seemed like it focused more on like communication and figuring out how to handle edge cases. 6. Then they scheduled a ML deep dive with the hiring manager. 1 hour, I basically presented a few of my papers and they asked pretty detailed questions about how I made specific training/dataset/evaluation questions. Lots of reflection on what I could've done differently etc. I really enjoyed this round, it felt like a very good way to measure expertise and ML depth. 7. Whole process took place over 2-3 weeks, very efficient, quick feedback and scheduling of next rounds. I got the official offer 3 business days after the last round. Overall very good process! Much easier than I expected, but it's possible they identified a research fit and wanted to hurry the process along a bit lol.

I can spin my current role as a programming role but it’s sorta limited and not impressive.My question is how long do I have to find an actual engineering role before I’m past the point of no return?

Ended up taking a job doing insurance claims because the pay was better than the entry- level CS jobs and because most employers didn't really take my expensive, but largely worthless, degree all that seriously...Then I moved to another state where there were no insurance companies, so I did various jobs until landing on a freelance writing gig that I did until ChatGpt put that company out of business. Now I'm looking for work and I'm considering trying to get a degree in something from a legit college, but I'm not sure how hard it is to find an entry level job period, let alone find an entry level job at 50 in the tech field.The school I'm considering will count the degree I have toward the common core stuff, so basically I'd need just the classes specific to my major.

Even the silly aptitude test thing they make new students take at the University recommends it and frankly, my impression of the tech field has always been that it's crowded, being heavily outsourced and potentially negatively impacted by AI in the same way my old profession as a writer has been. So, the point of this post was to find out from people who actually work in the field if my impression was wrong and all the people recommending it are right or full of shit.

I was scheduled to begin work at Fort Meade this year prior to the federal hiring freeze. Once I found out my clearance had transferability I made a profile on clearance jobs and got a fair bit of outreach.At this point I’ve been through a dozen or so phone screens and have a handful of conditional offer letters. They’re all in relatively the same location and all are full time upon placement(not contract to hire). The two considerations I’m struggling with the most are:1. Tech stack. I’ve largely been full stack with JavaScript(React) and Python(Django). Some roles have some python, others have a smattering of full stack but most are Java roles. I did a lot of Java in undergrad and early in my career but Java 8 is about the last time I really was Java heavy. Trying to weigh roles with tech I’m comfortable in against immersing myself in Java to insulate against future job searches. 2. Pay discrepancy between large and small contractors. I’ve had offers from Booz Allen and Leidos along with multiple small contractors(<50 employees). The smaller companies have routinely offered ~20-30% more total compensation. I’ve considered asking the larger contractors to match but I doubt they will.

So not only do I have to interrupt the logic thread which is necessary for a coherent, correct solution, I also need to translate it into English language to be presentable and make sense, on the fly. But also keep enough reference of the logic to have something to return to once I explain a point. The result is both threads are interrupted frequently and produce incoherent responses. On top of the pressure of being watched and judged for it.That’s why I can program a solution in whole, then I can explain it well after it’s all done. Each thread can complete one by one without loss of context mid execution.Does anyone have any advice? Ideally if you used to be bad at this, but got significantly better?

My situation is complicated, and I don’t want to come across as someone who quits easily.My first job was a six-month contract that didn’t get renewed—not because of my performance, but because the deputy director informed all contract staff that we would be ""released to the market on our knowledge."" I worked around the clock to deliver my assignments, but there was nothing I could do to secure a renewal.Afraid that I wouldn’t find another opportunity quickly, I accepted my next offer without much hesitation—only to discover that the company had almost no real software development expertise. The local team was constantly misled by overseas developers, and the leadership, despite lacking technical knowledge, refused to acknowledge the gaps. It was like watching The Emperor’s New Clothes play out in real life.To make matters worse, my new team lead in the last government linked company sabotaged me. After completing my assignments and demonstrating my work to the project manager and team lead, he withheld key information from the project director. He told her that I didn’t know how to import libraries—but he didn’t mention that I had already finished the task successfully. Because the project director lacked technical expertise, she dismissed me based on that remark.Additionally, I had assumed that a ""senior software engineer"" in the team before i joined the new team would have solid technical knowledge. Instead, she was actually a business analyst, and actively made my life difficulty by constantly given me wrong infor that I need to point out to her. They actually insisted the correct way of pushing your code up is git diff.Given all of this, how should I explain my work history in interviews?

1kpsd5w,"got a job at my previous employer after having left for a contracting role, should i take it ?",Famous-Help-3572,cscareerquestions,"about 6 months or so ago, I left my previous company because i was put on a CP (coaching plan). So while i was on the CP, a company had reached out to me indicating that they wanted to interview me. however the company was a contracting company with the possibility of conversion being pretty high. however, they have told me that conversion is probably not possible anymore. However, while i was job hunting my previous company had reached back out to me and indicated that they wanted to interview me. I ended up getting the job and it is a fulltime gig. Should i go ahead and just take it ? would that make the most sense since I have a contracting role and the role is about to end in september ? i was thinking of using my offer as leverage to get a FT role but was hoping to get an idea of what the community thought thanks !",5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kpsd5w/got_a_job_at_my_previous_employer_after_having/,2025-05-18 19:35:02,2025-05-22 01:41:01
1kpncam,Are QE/SDET roles advisable for early careers/new grads?,Real_nutty,cscareerquestions,"I hear a lot of terrible things on the internet, but also wonder if many of these were during the mass hiring era. I can see that the job and tasks itself will be quite different from SWE, but it seems like during my interview, I found the team members to be nice and the manager and senior manager to be supportive of career transition in the future.

1kosjp5,Fall AmazonSDE intern in Seattle vs Summer Madrid AI start up,Renaliunsult,cscareerquestions,"Posting for a friend who recently joined Reddit but doesn’t have the min. 10 karma to post.Incoming senior CS major and I have to make a decision between taking a fall 2025 SDE internship at Amazon and missing my senior fall semester. This would mean missing a full year of classes, as I’m currently studying abroad spring semester this year. I’ll still graduate on time, but it will be difficult, and it’s unfortunate to lose a year of the college experience when I have the rest of my life to work in the industry.On the other hand, I could reject the offer and work at a startup over the summer. While the experience would still be valuable, the startup is in Spain, so unlikely I could work there after I graduate. Additionally, Amazon carries more weight in terms of future recruitment. But I could complete my senior year at my university and have a manageable schedule.I’m leaning toward rejecting the offer since I don’t want to miss another semester of college, but at the same time, I feel like I’d be giving up a valuable opportunity.Any guidance from people working in software would be super helpful.
