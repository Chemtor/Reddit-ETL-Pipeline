1jvwwcy,Tried to roll out Microsoft Fabric… ended up rolling straight into a $20K/month wall,Embarrassed_War3366,dataengineering,"Yesterday morning, all capacity in a Microsoft Fabric production environment was completely drained — and it’s only April. What happened? A long-running pipeline was left active overnight. It was… let’s say, *less than optimal* in design and ended up consuming an absurd amount of resources.Now the entire tenant is locked. No deployments. No pipeline runs. No changes. Nothing.The team is on the $8K/month plan, but since the entire annual quota has been burned through in just a few months, the only option to regain functionality before the next reset (in \~2 weeks) is upgrading to the $20K/month Enterprise tier.To make things more exciting, the deadline for delivering a production-ready Fabric setup is tomorrow. So yeah — blocked, under pressure, and paying thousands for a frozen environment.Ironically, version control and proper testing processes were proposed weeks ago but were brushed off in favor of moving quickly and keeping things “lightweight.”The dream was Spark magic, ChatGPT-powered pipelines, and effortless deployment. The reality? Burned-out capacity, missed deadlines, and a very expensive cloud paperweight.And now someone’s spending their day untangling this mess — armed with nothing but regret and a silent *“I told you so.”*",639,0.95,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jvwwcy/tried_to_roll_out_microsoft_fabric_ended_up/,2025-04-10 12:40:01,2025-04-13 02:54:53
1jx0xpa,My 2025 Job Search,deal_damage,dataengineering,"Hey I'm doing one of these sankey charts to show visualize my job search this year. I have 5 YOE working at a startup and was looking for a bigger, more stable company focused on a mature product/platform. I tried applying to a bunch of places at the end of last year, but hiring had already slowed down. At the beginning of this year I found a bunch of applications to remote companies on LinkedIn that seemed interesting and applied. I knew it'd be a pretty big longshot to get interviews, yet I felt confident enough having some experience under my belt. I believe I started applying at the end of January and finally landed a role at the end of March.I definitely have been fortunate to not need to submit hundreds of applications here, and I don't really have any specific advice on how to get offers other than being likable and competent (even when doing leetcode-style questions). I guess my one piece of advice is to apply to companies that you feel have you build good conversational rapport with, people that seem nice, and genuinely make you interested. Also say no to 4 hour interviews, those suck and I always bomb them. Often the kind of people you meet in these gauntlets are up to luck too so don't beat yourself up about getting filtered.If anyone has questions I'd be happy to try and answer, but honestly I'm just another data engineer who feels like they got lucky.",448,0.97,62,https://i.redd.it/n2653y9vs9ue1.png,2025-04-11 21:19:34,2025-04-13 02:54:53

1jved6i,Is this normal? Being mediocre,pixel_pirate1,dataengineering,"Hi.I am not sure if it's a rant post or reality check.I am working as Data Engineer and nearing couple of years of experience now.Throughout my career I never did the real data engineering or learned stuff what people posted on internet or linkedin.Everything I got was either pre built or it needed fixing. Like in my whole experience I never got the chance to write SQL in detail. Or even if I did I would have failed. I guess that is the reason I am still failing offers. I work in consultancy so the projects I got were mostly just mediocre at best. And it was just labour work with tight deadlines to either fix things or work on the same pattern someone built something. I always got overworked maybe because my communication sucked. And was too tired to learn anything after job.I never even saw a real data warehouse at work. I can still write Python code and write SQL queries but what you can call mediocre. If you told me write some complex pipeline or query I would probably fail.I am not sure how I even got this far. And I still think about removing some of my experience from cv to apply for junior data engineer roles and learn the way it's meant to be. I'm still afraid to apply for Senior roles because I don't think I'll even qualify as Senior, or they might laugh at me for things I should know but I don't. I once got rejected just because they said I overcomplicated stuff when the pipeline should have been short and simple. I still think I should have done it better if I was even slightly better at data engineering. I am just lost. Any help will be appreciated.

But need some real feedback, please.A friend and I are building a real-time data stream analytics engine, optimized for high performance on limited hardware (small VM or raspberry Pi).

Income from support and extra features down the road if this is actually useful.---Performance so far:- 1k+ stream queries/sec on an AWS t4g.nano instance (AWS price \~$3/month)- 800k+ q/sec on an AWS c8g.large instance. That's \~1000x cheaper than AWS Managed Flink for similar throughput.---Now the big question:Does this solve a real problem for enough folks out there?

1jslwf2,Suggestions for building a modern Data Engineering stack?,r3manoj,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I'm looking for some suggestions and ideas around building a data engineering stack for my organization. The goal is to support a variety of teams — data science, analytics, BI, and of course, data engineering — all with different needs and workflows.Our current approach is pretty straightforward: **S3 → DB → Validation → Transformation → BI**We use Apache Airflow for orchestration, and rely heavily on **raw SQL** for both data validation and transformation. The raw data is also consumed by the data science team for their analytics and modeling work.This is **mostly batch processing**, and we don't have much need for real-time or streaming pipelines — at least for now.In terms of **data volume**, we typically deal with datasets ranging from **1GB to 100GB**, but there are occasional use cases that go beyond that. I’m totally fine with having **separate stacks** for smaller and larger projects if that makes things more efficient — lighter stack for <100GB and something more robust for heavier loads.While this setup works, I'm trying to build a more solid, scalable foundation from the ground up. I’d love to know what tools and practices others are using out there. Maybe there’s a simpler or more modern approach we haven’t considered yet.I’m open to alternatives to Apache Airflow and wouldn’t mind using something like **dbt** for transformations — as long as there’s a clear value in doing so.**So my questions are:*** What’s your go-to data stack for cross-functional teams?* Are there tools that helped you simplify or scale better?* If you think our current approach is already good enough, I’d still appreciate any thoughts or confirmation.I lean towards **open-source** tools wherever possible, but I'm not against using **subscription-based solutions** — as long as they provide a clear value-add for our use case and aren’t too expensive.Thanks in advance!",27,0.94,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jslwf2/suggestions_for_building_a_modern_data/,2025-04-06 04:22:00,2025-04-13 02:54:53
1jvgdwr,Is it still so hard to migrate to Spark?,Wrench-Emoji8,dataengineering,"The main downside to Spark, from what I've heard, is the pain of creating and managing the cluster, fine tuning, installation and developer environments.

We are just trying to migrate to a horizontally-scalable processing tool to deal with our sporadic larger-than-memory data, not having to impose low data size limits on our application. We have done what we could with Polars for the past two years to keep everything light but our need for a flexible and bullet proof tool is clear now, and it seems we can't keep running from distributed alternatives.Dask seems like a much easier alternative, but we also worry about integration with different languages and technologies, and Dask is pretty tied to Python.

1jusby0,Best way to handle loading JSON API data into database in pipelines,fetus-flipper,dataengineering,"Greetings, this is my first post here. I've been working in DE for the last 5 years now doing various things with Airflow and Dagster. I have a question regarding design of data flow from APIs to our database.I am using Dagster/Python to perform the API pulls and loads into Snowflake.My team lead insists that we load JSON data into our Snowflake RAW\_DATA in the following way:ID (should be a surrogate/non-native PK) PAYLOAD (raw JSON payload, either as a VARCHAR or VARIANT type) CREATED\_DATE (timestamp this row was created in Snowflake) UPDATE\_DATE (timestamp this row was updated in Snowflake)Flattening of the payload then happens in SQL as a plain View, which we currently autogenerate using Python and manually edit and add to Snowflake.He does not want us (DE team) to use DBT to do any transforming of RAW\_DATA. DBT is only for the Data Analyst team to use for creating models.The main advantage I see to this approach is flexibility if the JSON schema changes. You can freely append/drop/insert/reorder/rename columns. whereas a normal table you can only drop, append, and rename.On the downside, it is slow and clunky to parse with SQL and access the data as a view. It just seems inefficient to have to recompute the view and parse all those JSON payloads whenever you want to access the table. I'd much rather do the flattening in Python, either manually or using dlt. Some JSON payloads I 'pre-flatten' in Python to make them easier to parse in SQL.Is there a better way, or is this how you all handle this as well?",26,1.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jusby0/best_way_to_handle_loading_json_api_data_into/,2025-04-08 23:56:12,2025-04-13 02:54:53

1jwas79,Bend Kimball Modeling Rules for Memory Efficiency,trianglesteve,dataengineering,"This is a broader modeling question, but my use case is specifically for Power BI. I've got a Power BI semantic model that I'm trying to minimize the memory impact on the tenant capacity. The company is cheaping out and only wants the bare minimum capacity in PBI and we're already hitting the capacity limits regularly. The model itself is already in star schema format and I've optimized the tables/views on the database side to refresh the dataset quick enough, but the problem comes when users interact with the report and the model is loaded into the limited memory we have available in the tenant. One thing I could do to further optimize for memory in the dataset is chain the 2 main fact tables together, which I know breaks some of Kimball's modeling rules. However, one of them is a naturally related higher grain (think order detail/order header) I could reduce the size of the detail table by relating it directly to the higher grain header table and remove the surrogate keys that could instead be passed down by the header table. In theory this could reduce the memory footprint (I'm estimating by maybe 25-30%) at a potential small cost in terms of calculating some measures at the lowest grain. Does it ever make sense to bend or break the modeling rules? Would this be a good case for it?Edit:There are lots of great ideas here! Sounds like there are times to break the rules when you understand what it’ll mean (if you don’t hear back from me I’m being held against my will by the Kimball secret police). I’ll test it out and see exactly how much memory I can save on the chained fact tables and test visual/measure performance between the two models.I’ll work with the customers and see where there may be opportunities to aggregate and exactly which fields need to be filterable to the lowest grain, and I will see if there’s a chance leadership will budge on their cheap budget, I appreciate all the feedback!",16,0.94,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jwas79/bend_kimball_modeling_rules_for_memory_efficiency/,2025-04-10 22:33:14,2025-04-13 02:54:53

Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy).

No crazy regex, awk, grep, …I know logs typically prioritize human readability. Why does that typically mean we just regurgitate text to standard output? Usually, logging is done with the idea that you don’t know when you’ll need to look at these… but they’re usually the last resort. Audit access, debug, … mostly adhoc stuff, or compliance stuff. I think it stands to reason that logging is a preventative approach to problem solving (“worst case, we have the logs”). Correct me if I am wrong, but it would also make sense then that we plan ahead by not making it a PITA to work with the data. Not by modeling a database, no, but by spending 10 minutes to build a centralized logging module that accepts parameter used input and produces an effective TSV output (or something similar… it doesn’t need to be TSV).

Go the dbt freshness route and add an `updated_at` timestamp column to each row in the model. Then find the `MAX` of that in the last 7 days (or just be a little sloppy at get timestamp from newest partition and be OK with unnecessarily reloading a partition now and then.)2. Create a new table that is a **transaction log of the model runs**. Log a start and end timestamp in there and use that very small table to get a last run timestamp.3.

1jttqd5,GizmoSQL: Power your Enterprise analytics with Arrow Flight SQL and DuckDB,Adventurous-Visit161,dataengineering,"Hi! This is Phil - Founder of [GizmoData](https://gizmodata.com). We have a new commercial database engine product called: [GizmoSQL](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \- built with Apache Arrow Flight SQL (for remote connectivity) and DuckDB (or optionally: SQLite) as a back-end execution engine.This product allows you to run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remotely) - harnessing the power of computers in the cloud - which typically have more CPUs, more memory, and faster storage (NVMe) than your laptop. In fact, running GizmoSQL on a modern arm64-based VM in Azure, GCP, or AWS allows you to run at terabyte scale - with equivalent (or better) performance - for a fraction of the cost of other popular platforms such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks SQL.**GizmoSQL** is self-hosted (for now) - with a possible SaaS offering in the near future. It has these features to differentiate it from ""base"" DuckDB:* Run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remote connectivity)* Concurrency - allows multiple users to work simultaneously - with independent, ACID-compliant sessions* Security * Authentication * TLS for encryption of traffic to/from the database* Static executable with Arrow Flight SQL, DuckDB, SQLite, and JWT-CPP built-in. There are no dependencies to install - just a single executable file to run* Free for use in development, evaluation, and testing* Easily containerized for running in the Cloud - especially in Kubernetes* Easy to talk to - with ADBC, JDBC, and ODBC drivers, and now a Websocket proxy server (created by GizmoData) - so it is easy to use with javascript frameworks * Use it with Tableau, PowerBI, Apache Superset dashboards, and more* Easy to work with in Python - use ADBC, or the new experimental Ibis back-end - details here: [https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql](https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql)Because it is powered by DuckDB - GizmoSQL can work with the popular open-source data formats - such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, Parquet, and more.GizmoSQL performs very well (when running DuckDB as its back-end execution engine) - check out our graph comparing popular SQL engines for TPC-H at scale-factor 1 Terabyte - on the homepage at: [https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \- there you will find it also costs far less than other options.We would love to get your feedback on the software - it is easy to get started:* Download and self-host GizmoSQL - using our Docker image or executables for Linux and macOS for both x86-64 and arm64 architectures. See our README at: [https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public](https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public) for details on how to easily and quickly get started that wayThank you for taking a look at GizmoSQL.

1jw9im6,Is Databricks right for this BI use case?,TimeBomb006,dataengineering,"I'm a software engineer with 10+ years in full stack development but very little experience in data warehousing and BI. However, I am looking to understand if a lakehouse like Databricks is the right solution for a product that primarily serves as a BI interface with a strict but flexible data security model. The ideal solution is one that:- Is intuitive to use for users who are not technical (assuming technical users can prepopulate dashboards)- Can easily, securely share data across workspaces (for example, consider Customer A and Customer B require isolation but want to share data at some point) - Can scale to accommodate storing and reporting on billions or trillions of relatively small events from something like RabbitMQ (maybe 10 string properties) over an 18 month period. I realize this is very dependent on size of the data, data transformation, and writing well optimized queries- Has flexible reporting and visualization capabilities- Is affordable for a smaller company to operateI've evaluated some popular solutions like Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, and other smaller tools like Metabase. Based on my research, it seems like Databricks is the perfect solution for these use cases, though it could be cost prohibitive.

Bit overwhelmed",stop_the_entropy,dataengineering,"Context: I’m actually a food engineer (28), and about a year ago, I started in a major manufacturing CPG company as a process and data engineer. My job is actually kind of weird, it has two sides to it. On one hand, I have a few industrial engineering projects: implementing new equipment to automate/optimize processes. On the other hand: our team manages the Data pipelines, data models and power bis, including power apps, power automates and sap scripts. There are two of us in the team.We use SQL with data from our softwares. We also use azure data explorer (sensors streaming equipment related data (temp, ph, flow rates, etc) Our tables are bloated. We have more than 60 PBIs. Our queries are confusing. Our data models have 50+ connections and 100+ DAX measures. Power queries have 15+ confusing steps. We don’t use data flows, instead each pbi queries the sql tables, and sometimes there’s difference in the queries. We also calculate kpis in different pbis, but because of these slight differences, we get inconsistent data. Also, for some apps we can’t have access to the DB, so we have people manually downloading files and posting them to share point.I have a backlog of 96+ tasks and every one is taking me days, if not weeks. I’m really the only one that knows his way around a PBI, and I consider myself a beginner (like I said, less than a year of experience). I feel like I’m way over my head, just checking if a KPI is ok is taking me hours, and I keep having to interrupt my focus to log more and more tickets.I feel like writing it like this makes this whole situation sound like a shit job. I don’t think it is, maybe a bit, but we’ll, people here are engineers, but they know manufacturing. They don’t know anything about data. They just want to see the amount of boxes made, the % of time lost grouped by reason and etc… I am learning a lot, and I kinda want to master this whole mess, and I kinda like working with data. It makes me think.But I need a better way of work. I want to hear your thoughts, I don’t know anyone that has real experience in Data, especially in manufacturing. Any tips? How can I improve or learn? Manage my tickets? Time expectations? Any ideas on how to better understand my tables, my queries, find data inconsistencies? Make sure I don’t miss anything in my measure? I can probably get them to pay for my learning. Is there a course that I can take to learn more?Also, they are open to hiring an external team to help us with this whole ordeal. Is that a good idea?

1jwf1z3,Is This What Internships Are Like Now? Because I Feel More Lost Than Ever,soumyadyuti_245,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, So I’m in my 2nd year of college and recently landed a backend engineering internship. It sounded super exciting at first—cool tech stack like WebRTC, Mediasoup, AWS, Docker, NGINX, etc. The internship is 4 months long, and we were told the first month would be for training. I was really looking forward to learning all this industry-level stuff.Well… that didn’t really happen the way I thought it would.They gave us an AWS “training” on literally day two, but it was just a surface-level overview—stuff like “this is EC2, this is S3,” and then moved on. Then like 4 days in, they dropped us into the actual codebase of their project (which is like a Zoom/Google Meet alternative), gave us access to a bunch of repos, and basically said, “Figure it out.”I was still pumped at this point. I dove into the code, started learning the tools they’re using, and I even told them I’m still learning AWS but I’m 100% willing to put in the effort if someone can guide me a bit. I wasn’t expecting hand-holding, just *some* support.Then came this task: me and another intern were asked to deploy one of their websites on an AWS EC2 instance. Sounds simple, right? Yeah, it wasn’t. It involved changing environment variables, working with existing instances, setting up Docker containers, and doing a sort of “redeployment” on a live setup. And we weren’t even trained for any of this.It’s been three days now, and we’ve been stuck. Trying to figure things out through tutorials, trial and error, asking questions. But the people assigning the task just keep saying “This is a simple task, you should be able to do this.” No real help, no troubleshooting, just passive-aggressive comments about how we’re not capable if we can’t get it done.They say they want us to “learn by doing,” but at this point it doesn’t feel like learning—it feels like being set up to fail. Oh, and they also want us to document the entire experience, like a reflection on what we learned… but how am I supposed to reflect when I’m stuck the entire time and no one’s guiding us?What’s really messing with me is that this wasn’t even part of the actual project work. This was just some side task they threw at us. Meanwhile, my college work is piling up, my sleep schedule’s shot, and honestly, it’s getting hard to stay motivated when it feels like I’m not being given a fair chance to succeed.I’m not afraid of hard work. I *want* to learn. But this whole “sink or swim” approach with no support is just burning me out. And it makes me feel like if I fail at this one task, they’ll label me as someone who doesn’t know AWS—which isn’t even fair because I’m *literally* just starting out.So yeah, I don’t know. Maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe this is just how things are. But it’s starting to feel more like they care about the results than actually mentoring or helping us grow.Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is this normal? Or are they actually just mishandling the whole internship thing?",144,0.93,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jwf1z3/is_this_what_internships_are_like_now_because_i/,2025-04-11 02:09:17,2025-04-13 02:54:54

Like not just “how to use it,” but how it’s implemented under the hood, what every line does, why it was written that way, etc.And honestly, it’s exhausting.I don’t think I’m autistic or have OCD or anything -- I’ve never been diagnosed -- but there’s something in me that just *won’t* let go of the tiniest unknown.

But it kind of sucks the joy out of coding sometimes.Everyone says being detail-oriented is a good thing in the long run, but in the moment, it feels like a curse. I spend hours obsessing over stuff that probably doesn’t matter, and as a result, I make barely any progress. It’s frustrating, and it makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong.Does anyone else experience this? If so, how do you deal with it?

1jxjt0v,Does is actually matter that Python is a simple language?,Golem_of_the_Oak,learnprogramming,"I started learning software development in my early thirties, but as soon as I started I knew that I should have been doing this my whole life. After some research, Python seemed like a good place to start. I fell in love with it and I’ve been using it ever since for personal projects.One thing I don’t get is the notion that some people have that Python is simple, to the point that I’ve heard people even say that it “isn’t real programming”. Listen, I’m not exactly over here worrying about what other people are thinking when I’m busy with my own stuff, but I have always taken an interest in psychology and I’m curious about this.Isn’t the goal of a lot of programming to be able to accomplish complex things more easily? If what I’m making has no requirement for being extremely fast, why should I choose to use C++ just because it’s “real programming”? Isn’t that sort of self defeating? A hatchet isn’t a REAL axe, but sometimes you only need a hatchet, and a real axe is overkill.Shouldn’t we welcome something that allows us to more quickly get our ideas out into the screen? It isn’t like any sort of coding is truly uncomplicated; people who don’t know how to code look at what I make as though I’m a wizard. So it’s just this weird value on complication that’s only found among people that do the very most complicated types of coding.But then also, the more I talk to the rockstar senior devs, the more I realize that they all have my view; the more they know, the more they value just using the best tool for the job, not the most complex one.",77,0.83,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jxjt0v/does_is_actually_matter_that_python_is_a_simple/,2025-04-12 15:26:39,2025-04-13 02:54:54

She really enjoys just listening to me and her mother talk, and that gave me an idea to help keep her calm while I code. That idea was to just explain everything I’m working on as I do it to her. Building a database schema? I explain every step out loud to her. An API endpoint? Same thing. What I’ve realized in doing this is that I’m retaining information exponentially better than I was. There’s something about saying it all out loud, and pretending that I’m legitimately teaching her how to do what I’m working on, that has made learning and retaining information so much easier. So the moral is talk out loud about what you’re doing. Explain it to your dog, your significant other (if they’re willing to listen), your cat, goldfish, child, or whatever/whoever you have that will listen.

Is this normal?",Numerous-Smile-8780,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone. This is more of a story than a question (though I could really use some advice at the end).I graduated in Civil Engineering because, honestly, I could never find something I truly enjoyed doing—or maybe I just lacked the discipline and drive (lazy, you might say). I got my degree in 2020, worked a bit during the pandemic, but was constantly unhappy.In September 2021, I joined a gym, changed my diet, shifted my mindset, and started studying programming during my lunch breaks at work (and sometimes even during work hours, not gonna lie).By April 2022, I quit my job to study full-time. In September 2022, I joined a 3-month .NET training program offered by a consulting company and got hired afterward. I worked mostly with backend—mostly .NET, some TypeScript/NestJS, and various short-term projects. I constantly felt like I wasn't good enough or like I wasn't on the right path, but I tried not to overthink it. I just kept pushing forward, learning every day.Then in January 2024, a friend invited me to join his startup. I worked both jobs (my full-time and the startup) until October 2024. The tech stack at the startup was Flutter + Python. I learned a lot of new things and used AI extensively to help me. Because of that, I sometimes feel like I didn’t *really* learn, if that makes sense?In August 2024, I was promoted in my full-time job (mid dev, earning \~BRL 6000). But in January 2025, I felt the need for change and started applying to companies abroad. On March 12, 2025, I was hired by a Canadian company (they have an office here in Brazil), and now I'm earning more than I did with both previous jobs combined—plus way better benefits.Here’s the problem: The company is very process-heavy and bureaucratic. I’ve been here almost a month and haven’t been able to look at code for more than two straight days. I’ve done tiny tweaks here and there, but most of my time is spent trying to find something to do. And this feeling of uselessness, of not doing enough, is driving me crazy.It got so bad that I even considered changing careers again (my therapist thankfully helped me back off that ledge). But I started catastrophizing—thinking I have no future in tech, that I don’t belong, and that I’m a total fraud.So here I am, asking you: Is this feeling normal? Has anyone else gone through something like this?I think my journey has been pretty fast for a self-taught career changer. But maybe *because* I’m self-taught, and I’ve leaned so heavily on AI, I constantly question whether I really know anything—and whether I belong here at all.Thanks for reading this far, if you did.

And I'm almost 100% sure that this is what I want for my life...However, I always had a problem: Starting projects and never finishing them.I think it's because within the programming don't know how to decide which area to choose...What I've already tried: Game Dev (3D and 2D), web development, application development, and nothing...All these projects end because: Patience to create the rest that has nothing to do with programming (3D objects, 2D drawings, etc.), in the case of Web development, I hate HTML and CSS...I recently tried WPF with .NET 8.0, and guess what... The same thing happened...The solution for me would be a project/area that doesn't use anything I don't like... But what would that be? I can't think of anything!Something that is purely code would be really nice! I was thinking about learning OpenGL, DirectX, but they are kind of advanced things.I just don't want to be without programming, I don't want to stand still, I want to create something.

So i'll try to make this post as short as possible, all while giving you necessary Context to help me. I am genuinely desperate for help, so please bear with me.**I'm a 25F from a small, rural North African town. I, since my first year at primary school, used to be the top of my class . I was always praised for my behavior, bright grades, creativity, and passion. But depression hit hard two years before high school graduation.I barely scraped through (even if i ranked third in my highschool, it wasn't enough nationally). I gave up my dream of becoming a doctor, and pragmatically pivoted to computer science.Somehow I got into a prestigious university. But my mental health collapsed. I took a gap year then failed my second year, not once, not twice but *four freaking* times. I prioritized healing, not grades, andI don’t regret that, even if the lost time still stings a bit..Now I’m finally about to graduate this June, mentally stronger than ever. I am stable, way more confident, optimistic and genuinly happierBut here’s the kicker: I feel like an imposter. I’ve forgotten nearly everything I learned. I’m struggling in my internship; basic coding, algorithms, data structure... it all feels alien. I am now horrible at math and it breaks my freaking heart !I’m still dealing with the ""leftovers"" of depression: horrible memory, poor focus, and difficulty learning. I love programming, but I’m slow, scattered, and unsure where to even begin rebuilding.Looking ahead, I fear technical jobs will be a nightmare. I know *a little bit* of everything, but not enough to hold my own as a software engineer.Everyone around me believe in me, my family, friends, even my uni professors. They keep saying I'am smart and capable of great things, but I feel like a fraud.Should I relearn from scratch? Pursue a master’s with a shaky academic record? Self-study? I just don’t know what to do next. I'm desperate for direction.If you made it so far! Thank you kind stranger.*Ps : I've never been forced to study. My parents have always been incredibly supportive, never judging me for failing a class, or even for failing university. But i still feel like I've let them down!

No frameworks, no build steps. He made all the graphics himself and also recorded all the audio.Note that both parents are programmers so he has lots of hints and guidance along the way. He also leverages Google Gemini to answer coding questions (syntax, how to do something, etc), but the LLM isn’t coding for him and it isn’t available to him directly in his editor.For the blog post, we talked about the target audience and came up with an outline.  He then dictated his blog post directly into Google Docs.  Finally, we went through a few rounds of feedback/edits (for more clarity, more words, etc).Other links:v1 Game Link: [https://www.armaansahni.com/game](https://www.armaansahni.com/game-v2)v1 Blog Post: [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-coded-a-game-using-ai/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-coded-a-game-using-ai/)v1 Discussion Thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1elfo3q/my\_son\_9\_years\_old\_coded\_a\_game\_in\_plain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1elfo3q/my_son_9_years_old_coded_a_game_in_plain/)",13,0.89,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jug6mo/back_with_v2_my_son_still_9_years_old_updated_the/,2025-04-08 15:21:38,2025-04-13 02:54:54

For example, recently I’ve coded a tip calculator (a challenge from the 100 days of code by Angela Yu)On this particular challenge- I didn’t struggle with the coding aspects, but instead with understanding the math formulas to calculate tip and percentage. Which I took it upon myself to learn through the internet. My main question would be, since I am very bad at maths, would it be best for me to re-learn maths on the side also? Or learn the math formulas as I encounter them through the journey of learning to code?

Here are my specific questions:* How would you approach learning to program properly when tutorials alone don’t work anymore?* How do you build discipline when you often lose motivation or feel stuck early on?* Would you still recommend finishing the last 2 years of a CS bachelor if programming doesn't come naturally to you?* Are there any beginner-friendly project ideas that helped *you* break the tutorial cycle?* Do you think making a Minecraft mod (or something similar I personally enjoy) is a good way to get into coding?* How do you push through when you're in that “I want to learn, but I suck at it” phase?Any personal stories, tough love, or practical tips would really help me out.Thanks in advance!",7,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jvb8a3/how_would_you_approach_becoming_good_at/,2025-04-09 17:17:22,2025-04-13 02:54:54

1juni23,Whats going on with unions... exactly?,AbyssalRemark,learnprogramming,"Tldr; what is the cost of using unions (C/C++). I am reading through and taking some advice from Game Engine Architecture, 3rd edition. For context, the book talks mostly about making game engines from scratch to support different platforms. The author recommends defining your own basic types so that if/when you try to target a different platform you don't have issues. Cool, not sure why int8_t and alike isn't nessissarly good enough and he even brings those up.. but thats not what's troubling me that all makes sense. Again, for portability, the author brings up endianess and suggests, due to asset making being tedious, to create a methodology for converting things to and from big and little endian. And suggest using a union to convert floats into an int of correct size and flipping the bytes because bytes are bytes. 100% agree. But then a thought came into my head. Im defining my types. Why not define all floats as unions for that conversion from the get go? And I hate that idea. There is no way, that is a good idea. But, now I need to *know* its a bad idea. Like that has got to come at some cost, right? If not, why stop there? Why not make it so all data types are in unions with structures that allow there bytes to be addressed individually? Muhahaha *lightning strike accompanied with thunder*. I have been sesrching for a while now and I have yet to find something that thwarts my evil plan. So besides that being maybe tedious and violating probably a lot of good design principles.. whats a real, tangible reason to *not* do that?",6,0.76,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1juni23/whats_going_on_with_unions_exactly/,2025-04-08 20:20:27,2025-04-13 02:54:54

But sometimes I just don’t understand what exactly he’s trying to teach us.Like, one of his first rules was: never use modulus or division. At first, it kind of made sense. For simple programs like printing even numbers, instead of using %, he made us use basic arithmetic to understand what’s happening under the hood. That part was kinda cool, and I respected it. it forced me to think deeper.But now its getting out of hand. He wants us to write more complex programs without using modulus and division, and its becoming super confusing. I can maybe get around % if I really push, but doing everything without /? My brain starts to melt.Sometimes I wonder if this is actually the ""right"" way to learn C at a deeper level, and I’m just behind the rest of the class.

1jx4ywi,Where to go from here? Feel like I'm stuck in Limbo,soelsome,learnprogramming,"Hello, I've been working as a junior software engineer for a year and a half. I got the job because I was already at the company, taught myself the basics of web development, and then expressed interest. The company was a startup. My leadership at the time pushed for me to get on the engineering team, and it eventually happened. No tech interview. No degree.I've been able to handle most tickets assigned to me without issue. With research, LLMs, and some Udemy courses after work, I've managed to get by. But I feel like I'm severely lacking. Since I didn't go to school, and my self-taught journey didn't really touch on the fundamentals of computer science, I feel like I'm grossly underprepared and destined to fail. I feel like I know syntax well for the languages I use, and I understand at a basic level the technologies we use, such as docker, but I don't feel like I'm a good programmer. For example, I don't know data-structures and algorithms at all. I've heard of Big O in passing and that's about it. I haven't really ever had to employ any design patterns, so I haven't learnt about them for the most part. I never had to grind leet code or anything like that. I put together a few simple React applications before this job and that's it. Granted, I've learnt things on the job, such as separating the UI layer from the business logic and data layer, but I just don't know what direction I should go to get better. Should I start learning the basic, fundamental stuff I kind of skipped? Should I start grinding leet code even though I already have a job? I'm planning on getting into a school next year and getting a degree, but what should I be doing in the meantime? Any and all advice would be super appreciated.

I have this weird thing where I say, okay - for my job (as a PM now, but i used to code years ago) it would be valuable to know python well and lets say some DS libraries. Problem is, as soon as I start, I get bogged down in saying.. well how does an interpreter work? How does python deal with executables and interacting with the OS? How exactly does an OS work? Assembly? Should I spend some tike writing assembly and building up from there?I think its a weird of kind of OCD / obsession where, over my life I have idolised people you see out there who are just brilliant. They worked on building operating systems, writing drivers, crazy graphics interfaces, rewriting literal compilers and toolkits themselves. Whenever I start to get productive with high level tools, I feel like a “cop out” because im basically only as smart as a monkey. I can write code in high level languages, but im inferior to those who wrote the very tools to enable to me code. This drives me to spend hours and hours researching the lower level (and dont get me wrong, i do enjoy it) - but at the end of the day it wont help me in my life or career.How does you guys get to a point where you are totally okay blocking out the significant amount of work for these tools below? I cant help but feel everything I pick up, to be “smart” you need to know the “why”. This means even using python libraries i start opening them up trying to figure out how they are made. Any advice or another way to think about it? I just remind myself that all these others arent smarter.. they just worked as part of big full time teams who built this stuff over years and years.

1jtktv0,What are the ultimate method names for great UX?,the-e2rd,learnprogramming,"I want to define the best method names for building a user interface. Something like JS has `alert` (None output), `prompt` (str), `confirm` (bool). But these three are too limited.Currently, I have: `alert, ask, ask_number, choice, form, is_yes, is_no`Now, to the problems:`alert` – Just to display a text. Might be `msgbox` etc.`ask` – Get an arbitrary str output.`ask_number` – The same but with the number validation.`choice` The first big problem. Choice is a substantive, whereas the other are verbs. Would it be better to call it `select` as in HTML?If so, I to give a name for ① the value and for ② an alias used in situations when this value must be picked of given options.Like, for paths the value name is `PathTag`, for colors, `ColorTag`, for `datetime`, `DatetimeTag`. Now, I have the method `choice`, alias `Choices` and value name is `EnumTag`.`form` Like a HTML form, accepts and returns arbitrary values. I think it is no problem that this is a substantial, as the other methods outputs a single return value, whereas this returns whole form.`is_yes` Buttons Yes/No, it user clicks Yes, it returns True.`is_no` That's the problem. I need a name for method that raises the same dialog as in `is_yes`, the buttons Yes/No, returning True for the Yes button, but with the exception, the initial focus is on the No button. Useful for dialogs like: ""Do you really want to delete the files?"" But the name `is_no` implies, it returns True for the No button which is not my intention. I came up with following substitutes, which one do you prefer?* `not_no` – short but might be counterintuitive it does not starts with the verb as the others* `isnt_no` – Is this convenient?* `is_not_no` – double negation, it seems confusing to me* `is_yes_from_no` – I like that it starts too with `is_yes`. Is this comprehensible?* `is_yes_to_no` – The same, is this comprehensible?* `is_si` – amazing, short, clever, my preferred option – but as an English speaker, would you understand the `si`?

1jvk5td,Why I left big tech and plan on never coming back.. EVER.,Nice-Internal-4645,cscareerquestions,"I used to think landing a job at a big tech company would be the peak of my career. Everyone made it sound like once you got in, your life was set. Prestige, money, smart people, meaningful work. I bought into the whole thing. I worked my ass off to get there. Leetcode, system design prep, referrals, rejection after rejection. And when I finally got the offer, I remember feeling like I had won the lottery.That feeling didn’t last long.What I stepped into was one of the most toxic, mentally draining environments I’ve ever experienced. It didn’t happen all at once. It crept in. The first few weeks were exciting, but then the cracks started to show. The pressure was insane. The deadlines were borderline delusional. There was this unspoken expectation to be available at all times. Messages late at night. Work bleeding into weekends. No one ever said it out loud, but if you wanted to be seen as serious, as someone who ""got it,"" you had to sacrifice everything else.The culture was a constant performance. I couldn’t just do my job. I had to sell it. Everything I worked on needed a narrative. Every project had to be spun into something that could fit neatly into a promotion packet or a perf review. I wasn’t building software. I was building a case to not be forgotten. Because every quarter, someone got labeled as underperforming. It didn’t always make sense who it was. Sometimes it was the quietest person on the team. Sometimes it was someone who just had the wrong skip manager. Everyone smiled in meetings but no one felt safe.The politics were unbearable. Influence mattered more than clarity. Visibility mattered more than functionality. Everything had to be socialized in just the right way to just the right people. One wrong Slack message or a poorly timed piece of feedback could nuke months of work. And if you didn’t know how to play the game, it didn’t matter how smart or hardworking you were. You were dead in the water.Work-life balance was a joke. I was constantly anxious, constantly behind, constantly checking messages like something was going to blow up if I missed a ping. I stopped sleeping properly. I stopped seeing friends. I stopped caring about things I used to love. My weekends were spent recovering from the week and bracing for the next one. And the whole time I kept telling myself it was temporary. That it would get better. That if I just made it to the next level, it would all be worth it.But it never got better. The pressure just got worse. The bar kept moving. The layoffs started. The reorganizations. The endless leadership changes. Half my team vanished in one cycle. I remember joining a Zoom call one morning and realizing I didn’t even know who my manager reported to anymore. People were disappearing mid-project. Morale was a punchline. Everyone was scared but pretending they weren’t. Everyone was tired but still smiling in team standups. I started to feel like I was losing my grip.When I finally left, I didn’t feel free. I felt broken. It took months before I stopped checking my calendar every morning out of reflex. I still have dreams about unfinished sprints and last-minute roadmap changes. I still flinch when I see a Slack notification.People glamorize these jobs because of the compensation and the brand names. But no one talks about the cost. I gave that place everything and it chewed through me like I was nothing. Just another seat to fill. Just another cog in the machine. I left with more money, sure. But I also left with burnout, insomnia, and a genuine hatred for the industry I used to be passionate about.I don’t know if I’ll go back to big tech. Right now I’m just trying to feel like a human again.",2663,0.94,411,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jvk5td/why_i_left_big_tech_and_plan_on_never_coming_back/,2025-04-09 23:38:44,2025-04-13 02:54:55

1jtnfta,So I just got screwed over AFTER getting the job offer,Cosmodocus,cscareerquestions,"So I just went through an interview process with Hays for a Frontend developer contract role at Loblaws Digital. I went through 2 round of interviews with 2 interviewers, and I got the news that they offered me the role essentially 2 hours after completing the final round.The role wanted someone ASAP, and I knew I had to resign as soon as I could. I asked them multiple times if I was safe to send in my resignation letter to my current job, and 2 agents reassured that there was no issue once I received my onboarding process(which I did).So I resigned, and the next day, they told me the client doesn’t want to continue anymore. I can’t know why since it apparently has to do with some “compliance” issues between the agency and Loblaws Digital. So now, I’m left jobless and they’re saying the process is just left on hold with no definite resolution or answer. I feel Miserable. How can something like this happen?? I’ve never heard of anything like this happening before, going through the whole process and getting the worst outcome in the end. I’m so ashamed to try and return to my job after telling everyone I got a new job and sending my letter in.What am I suppose to do?**EDIT:**Name and shame purposes: Hays agency + Loblaws DigitalA lot has happened since I posted this. I reached back out to my old job, and they actually offered me a raise as an incentive to stay longer. I'll be starting again next week. I no longer care about the agency or loblaws as they said they ""may"" continue. Quite frankly they've lost my trust and it's their loss as I believe I'm a talented frontend engineer.To those saying it's ""common sense"" not to resign early, clearly it's not so obvious. Others have shared similar stories and were able to avoid the same mistake after reading this post, so I'm glad it helped some people.Even though the situation sucked, I feel more confident as a developer. I was capable of passing their interview and very likely handling the role itself.

1jw55rp,"Just received multiple excellent offers - even though I had a long career gap and suck at typical algorithmic, system design, and live coding questions! (5 yoe)",weirdcompliment,cscareerquestions,"I hope this post can help others. I am thrilled and relieved. I have had many periods of hopelessness throughout this process and I hope that sharing my experience can renew some hope for some folks who are in a similar position as I was.Recently, I received multiple remote offers. I went with one paying a 145-160k salary with a Fortune 500 company. I am keeping this post a little vague to hide any identifying details.I was not targeting super elite companies or positions, and nothing FAANG, so this may not be as relevant if you are. I am in the US.Sorry for my nearly stream-of-consciousness bullet points!* I have \~5 years of experience in a full stack capacity with a popular tech stack, all at the same small and unknown company* No portfolio, side projects, or certs* I was laid off >6 months and <1 year ago.* I started job hunting (besides some half-hearted applications to keep unemployment) 2-3 months ago. Before that, I was going through a very difficult time mentally and had done *nothing* to brush up on my technical skills.* I was ""open to work"" on LinkedIn during this time (without the banner), but scarcely got any recruiter messages (perhaps 1 every 2 months).* For about the first month of job hunting, I sent out cold applications on Indeed, LinkedIn, and company websites. I did get two interviews for hybrid roles in my area, but nothing for remote roles.* I do have a well-formed resume and perform excellently with any kind of behavioral question. * My favorite resource for behavioral interviewing has been Austen McDonald's substack. [This](https://thebehavioral.substack.com/p/using-the-carl-method-to-structure) post was the most helpful for me, but I would recommend checking out the other posts as well!* I do think I do excellent work in a real job setting, but I am pretty bad at leetcode and system design, and get horribly nervous when live-coding in an interview setting!* After the first month of job hunting, I said, ""Fuck it"" and put the obnoxious green #OPENTOWORK banner on my LinkedIn profile photo. I had always heard it makes people look ""desperate"", so I had never tried it. Y'all, **my inbox exploded** the *day* after I did this, and recruiters even mentioned that they were reaching out to me *because* they had noticed it. I'm talking 1 recruiter message per month at best, to 10 the next day, and \~10-15 per week after that. I did get sent a handful of irrelevant positions, but nothing I couldn't sift through. * I cannot emphasize how much this is worth trying. Maybe it deters some recruiters, but it attracts a lot of worthwhile ones too, at least for the non-elite positions I was targeting.* I updated my LinkedIn headline and bio to have a bunch of keywords. I edited my bio once a week, even just to reword it a little bit. I suspected that this helped keep me higher in recruiter searched results. Not sure if that was true or not, but it didn't hurt.* I had some bites from continuing to cold-apply, and some of them were remote positions too - but these interviews were much harder and the recruiters for these were much flakier and less enthused overall.* I got a ton of traction from the recruiters in my inbox. The offers I later received all stemmed from recruiters in my inbox. There are definitely a lot of companies that rely entirely on recruiters and don't even bother with making job listings.* In the interviews for the companies that then gave me an offer - there was no leetcode and no typical system design. Besides behavioral questions, some of the technical portions involved questions about domain knowledge, OOP, design patterns, ""how would you approach this problem"" kind of questions, and some code reviews. I answered them well, but definitely not perfectly, and had some misses as well. Despite that - I was told by all of my interviewers that they loved me as a candidate!* Most interviewers did not give a single shit about my time off. Some did ask, but totally understood when I said it was a layoff. If they then asked me about the gap, I explained it as being due to grief, and also taking some time to do a non-tech (but cool and unique) project to support a family member. I emphasized that I only began to job hunt seriously in the past 2-3 months. * For those who have been hunting for longer - maybe it's worth considering making the beginning of that gap sound intentional rather than like you've been getting rejected for a long time? YMMV* Having multiple final interviews resulting in multiple offers on the same day felt very serendipitous (and gave me great leverage for negotiating), but the end-of-the-quarter timing probably factored in.Thanks for reading, and good luck!---Edit: copying-and-pasting a comment I left about behavioral/general interviewing tips for more visibility:*Definitely would recommend the substack I mentioned above (*[*here's the top posts*](https://thebehavioral.substack.com/archive?sort=top)*) - honestly such a great and free resource. I have found all of his posts helpful!**Before interviews I do a little meditation with* [*4-7-8 breathing*](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417) *and it helps calm my nerves. This was a tip from my therapist. Sometimes I will take 100 mg of*[ *l-theanine* ](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1053/theanine)*with my morning coffee too, I find it helps with anxiety without dulling my alertness.**Having the attitude of a good coworker goes a long way - arguably it's even more important than being technically competent. Imagine the kind of person that you would want to work with. Show that you are humble, willing to admit when you don't know something, curious, not afraid to ask questions, proactive, easygoing, focused on the big picture/business impact, and have a growth mindset.**Find a list of common questions, take some notes on how you would plan on answering them, and actually practice answering them out loud to yourself, or even better, to a friend. Practice until it's like muscle memory. There are some software interviewing discords (try the search bar), where I bet you could find some people to practice mock interviews with if you don't have anyone in your personal life. Have a few stories prepared that could apply to multiple questions with a little tweaking.**When answering questions, I try to find little opportunities to show off my knowledge and experience even if doing so isn't the most straightforward way of answering the question - e.g. I will connect the question to a project I did or a problem I have solved before, will mention a relevant case study to show that I keep up with industry trends, will mention a quirk of the domain that shows high-level understanding, etc. Don't go on a huge tangent if it's not directly answering the question, but an offhand sentence or two is okay. I've gotten some great reactions and feedback from interviews from doing this.**I always send a thank-you email after the interview too, with some details specific to what they had shared with me about the position and the company.*---Note: This was originally posted in r/ExperiencedDevs, where the mods removed it for being ""general"" career advice that could apply to any career...lolEdit: I'm paranoid and won't share the company names or my resume, sorry.

1ju6vb5,"Honestly, what makes the difference between someone stuck in a low-mid tier company, vs people who get into top companies?",Visual-Chef-7510,cscareerquestions,"Hey guys. I just got a job offer as a new grad sde in a bank, it is like decent pay and benefits for my area but nothing exciting. Given the job market (especially in Canada), I can't turn it down. But I'm a little bit sad to have ended up here.I did an internship in this company before and found the atmosphere to be somewhat grim and soulless. Basically, almost everyone here has been working here for 10-25+ years. Many people are not happy with the job but aren't able to leave, so they are stuck. People are anti social because they don't like their job or coworkers and make just enough to get by. I was unhappy there too, it was a corporate environment where no one believed in the work they do and hard work is not rewarded. In contrast, I also did an internship in a big tech company, but it was so different there because people were full of hope. My coworkers eat together every day, and regularly discuss their intended promotions. Many believe their salary will at least double in 5 years. Everyone is just very sociable and happy in general. Many people were young, most have hobbies and pursue things they don't have to do just for fun. They suggest new ideas at work and sometimes work overtime to make it happen, and they have energy to give the intern a few pointers. I didn't get a return offer. Yes it hurts lol. I did my best and finished my project and stretch goal, but many of my fellow interns were absolutely cracked. I'm also not as naturally charismatic as any of them and I think I got on the bad side of my boss. I am afraid I will get stuck at my new job too, just like all my unhappy coworkers. Even over the interview I feel the same grim and bleak mood from all 5 interviewers except the manager.

1jxczax,Is stack overflow headed for extinction?,wbcm,cscareerquestions,"I used to be active on SO around 10 years ago and it was generally great, mostly helpful and insightful but only a little rough around the edges. Fast forward to the last month and I started being active there again and... using it over the last month has been a dumpster fire. It really feels like the point of the site has gone from providing answers/solutions to being more of a game of clout and academic trivialities. After really reviewing the current rules of the site and the culture that has formed on it, it seems like SO is trying to extinct itself. There are two big problems I see.1: The culture is designed and empowered to be horribleComing back to answering questions after so many years I was really surprised to see the same one or two dozen people across nearly everything I was answering. The small group of power users or moderators have an uncanny ability to be posting or editing things on there all day. They also seem to be the ones who are more eager to downvote answers or close questions with little regard for the community, or even following the conversations. The way the points system works basically means that you cannot interact with anything in the community until amassing a lot of points, which is normally gate-kept by these power users. Other people can also upvote your posts, but in order to get the ability to upvote it seems like newer users have to endure a lot of bullying to get there, if they get there at all. If you are new and get a couple downvotes on your posts you are not allowed to post anything again until your existing posts get more upvotes, but there is no robust way for that to organically happen in most of the site that only sees under a 100 views per question. This has created a weird vacuum where the power users kind of have the ability to knight newer users or essentially permanently disable newer user's accounts. On top of this, the culture seems to really prize putting people (and their questions and answers) down. The first couple of times someone would leave a single sentence comment on my answer basically saying ""you're wrong"", I was more eager to engage with it to see what I was missing. Over time the majority of such engagements turned out to be someone who would continue to say ""you're wrong"" but not want to elaborate, or missing understanding on the question/answer that was relevant. Over time, I realized that this was just the culture that is there. Unsurprisingly, I have began to recognize certain power users usernames and saw them bullying newer people in the questions and answers. This is alienating a huge group of people who are either new to programming and SO, or are experienced programmers that are new to SO. AKA, not many new people want to stay on the site. This massively reflects in the lowering number of questions coming in and the speed in which they are answered. This is only worsened by the expanding prevalence of LLMs. It is hard to see the next generation of programmers preferring the high likelihood of waiting a long time to be bullied on SO, vs an LLM who can instantly offer any type of information for your question and will not be toxic. 2: [duplicate] It is good to not let a question get asked for the millionth time in a row, but I saw so many questions that were immediately closed as duplicates and the provided duplicates were either many years out of date or only partially related. At a certain point all the programming questions that people can ask, will have been asked... unless new programming languages or software versions allow for substantively new questions to be asked. There was no good globally centralized place to ask programming questions before SO, and so there was at least 30 years of programming questions that needed to be satiated. As time goes on, more and more questions will either legitimately be duplicates or, more likely, a mod is gonna mark it as duplicate since one part of the question overlaps with one part of another that was asked since the inception of SO. At this point, SO reads more like an encyclopedia than a lively place of discourse. Take somewhere like reddit, quora, or even the comment section of a youtube video where you are learning something, these all feel like they are much more engaging and are great places to connect and ask questions. SO on the other had feels like a good place to get your question turned away. Talking to some newer programmers I know, they have a shared sentiment that SO is a bad place to ask questions and prefer reddit and LLMs instead. There seemed to be a shared experience between all of them that any time they google a question that SO is often towards the top, which exposed them to it often, but when they made accounts and started trying to be active there they were met with bad experiences. This kind of reinforces the feeling like SO is heading towards being an encyclopedia/ghost town rather than a community. In any case, these are just my loose thoughts around being active on SO after having not been after almost a decade. I used to remember it as being a great place and have just generally been surprised about how dumb and toxic it feels to be on there now. Do other people feel this way? Or did I somehow just jump back into the wrong parts of it?",130,0.9,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxczax/is_stack_overflow_headed_for_extinction/,2025-04-12 08:52:59,2025-04-13 02:54:55

1jxv1dg,"Formal written HR warning by manager after 2 ""failed"" sprints, been at this startup for 1.5 months",Neurprise,cscareerquestions,"I recently joined this startup near the middle/end of February for a new backend team they were building for a new product. At the same time as me joined a manager, older guy who's worked in startups for 20 years, as well as a coworker who worked at a big tech company.After two ""failed"" sprints, I had a 1:1 yesterday, as we usually do weekly on Fridays, and he basically told me that he had performance concerns about me and that I need to improve for the next sprint or two or ""things will get messy (implying termination)."" Soon after the conversation, he and HR send me a letter I had to sign essentially saying what he said in the call. Some details on the situation:- He said that in all his 20 years of working for startups, not once has he failed a sprint (and he defined failing one as not having any tickets roll over to the next sprint), yet since we started, he has failed every single one (when we first started, there was one ticket that blocked us and it rolled over, and he considered that a failure and wrote a big email about how he's sorry he failed). - Manager comes from a culture that emphasizes working long hours. Now I come from the same culture (I'm sure you can guess what it is) but I was born here instead so I don't have the same sort of expectations as he does.- Coworker is an overachiever who has spent considerable time at a big tech and brought a super convoluted [microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ) architecture that is very difficult to grasp. The way it's set up, you essentially can't even fully run it locally as it uses dev containers and there's some issue with the ports overlapping when you try to work on multiple services at once, and you also essentially need one IDE window open for each service as they're all in different repos of course. He has so many PRs, it's even hard to follow for me to be productive, so, to be fair, I'm not as productive as I could be, but it's more me not being able to deal with this overcomplicated codebase. Since joining only 1.5 months ago, there was essentially no ramp up period for me to learn the new codebase and architecture that the overachieving coworker built in a week.- Together they essentially work at all hours of the day, most recently they were working at 10 pm working on some issue and I saw the Slack conversation only once I opened my laptop the next day. The manager during one of the standup calls said he was up around 5 or 6 am from the night before trying to debug some build issue.- I was dealing with a longer running illness and took 2 sick days a few weeks ago and then 2 earlier this week. The coworker took over my tickets that I had in progress and just finished them himself.- Manager said they are dealing with deadlines imposed on them from above, wanting to get a full backend and frontend MVP out by the end of next month, so it seems some of this stuff is him trying to deflect issues onto performance concerns on me, but funnily enough we have a separate frontend team and they seem a lot more chill, they essentially haven't done much as the designs themselves have not been finalized.The multi-page letter itself essentially mentioned some of these points and implied that I didn't work on enough tickets last sprint and none this sprint (due to coworker finishing them) and said that while they understood I had an illness, I essentially should have completed them by the end of the sprint anyway. The letter literally had a *day-by-day* account of every day of the sprints that I had failed to finish a ticket and that I should have communicated what I was doing that day. Never in my professional life had I seen such minute detail and I honestly don't know how the manager spent so much of their own time to draft this up. At the end of this section, he essentially implied that I lied about what I was doing every day and it said ""dishonesty is not tolerated at this company.""I brought up all of these sorts of concerns (overachieving coworker, hard to grasp codebase, illness) multiple times to my manager previously in 1:1s and he kinda acted like he sympathized but essentially said tough shit you gotta finish your work (like he acted nice in the video call and said it diplomatically but then on the letter it was harshly worded).At the end, the manager said that I should think about all this over the weekend and give it a ""fresh start"" on Monday, implying improving massively over the next few weeks. Is this essentially a PIP? Should I actually try working on this or start looking for new roles? Problem is this role pays quite well, at least 15% higher than other roles I've been seeing in the market so wondering if that's worth it or not (or maybe they'll just fire me anyway after a month).",117,0.97,101,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxv1dg/formal_written_hr_warning_by_manager_after_2/,2025-04-13 00:05:31,2025-04-13 02:54:55

1jxldo8,"Got offer recently, here what you can expect at a Senior level",Idiot_Pianist,cscareerquestions,"I've been interviewing for a while now, mostly out of curiosity. I rarely send direct applications so it's all outreach. The out-reaches for which I was unqualified ended quickly, the others ended up to 2 position or offer. I am not decided to accept or not at this time.I am doing this post because I see all of you focusing on coding, and mainly on coding aspects that are irrelevant to the job. A job is the software industry is much more than that.Here is some feedback for those who are curious:* I had no Leetcode at any point. I had a few home assignments which could be considered Leetcode Easy. Do not underestimate them. An assignment should be treated as a full scale project that will go into production. They could ask you to design a function that adds two numbers, the point is not here. Focus on: * Write your requirements and assumptions in a document * Make sure the project is usable out of the box. If setup is required describe it: if they ask you to develop in Python, make sure to package it using Poetry/Uv or whatever you want but simply shipping the function is not acceptable * Write clear code, respect conventions, take care of the architecture, think about the user * Be consistent in all aspects: in documentation, and in coding. Example: Don't separate somes lines by a ',', some others by a '.' and others by nothing. Chose one and stick to it * Document your code: do not comment it, code should be self explanatory, if its not rework it, write actual Doxygen/XML documentation or whatever is the standard for the targeted langage * Provide a unit test suite * If you have time, showcase your project by integrating it into Github CI or Equivalent * OA are an occasion to showcase your work practices and general knowledge, the problem itself is irrelevant, don't focus on it too much* SD interview: had my first and only SD interview and passed. Your design is not important at all, providing you are not proposing absurd solutions. Focus on: * Communicating. Explore all possibilities, even the obviously dumb ones, but CRITICIZE them. What's expected from an engineer is not someone who has an answer to everything but someone who can think, is creative, and is then capable of weeding out their ideas * Always clarify functional and non-functional requirements. You are in control, make sure to select a sub-set of functional requirements that works good for you and is easy to design. Mention the more complex requirements and just state you won't take them into account. For instance, if they ask you do design a messaging app, focus on 1:1 conversations, emojis, read recipes and files exchange. You may want to discuss group messaging to show-off. Don't. Mention it, don't design it * QPS values are not important. Once again it's all about thought process. The number themselves are irrelevant. Make sure to target realistic order of magnitude. You do not design YT for 10 users, but maybe assuming 10M a day is enough even though we all know the real number are hundred of times higher * Ask for closed-feedback regularly. Once again an engineer is not someone who has all answer by themselves but someone who can communicate, listen to others, and find team approved solutions * Keep things simple* Technical questions: * It is ok you do not know. Do NOT invent an answer and assert it like its true. Simply states: ""Well I do not know that, but I guess we COULD do something like this, what do you think about it ? How would you approach this"" * You should never have absolute answer to anything, unless its an academic question. The objective of those questions is to understand how you think and how you are going to interact with the team. You are already in a team, you + the interviewers form a work team. Keep it in mind. * An interview is a discussion, not an exam, even if its on the question/answer format* Behavioral: * Do not invent/memorize dumb stories, be them generated by ChatGPT or else. * Those questions are to understand how you behave on a human an in a team, your answer should be clearly constructed, show the value of your work, and how you make impact/drive a team direction * Don't trust the examples shown on Rainforest LP/STAR video, this is pure BS. **No one ever** walked into a project that was in shambles, sit and drafted a plan, and magically the plan solved all the roadblocks and the company earned 200M$ just thanks to this man \\o/. This is pure BS and as an interviewer someone who answers to me in this way will not pass to the next round. * Always place value in the team. There's no self made man, when you were ""faced with a challenge"" it's not just you but the entire team. While you had individual actions that are important to highlight during those questions, as an interviewer this is when we see if someone appropriates the success or if they understand the value the entire team brought. You probably had project you lead alone, use them in those rounds, but always give credit to the team in other example, use that to illustrate how you can drive team decisions * It is OK to take examples where you failed. Failing is part of the game. Use that to show how you reflect, what you learned, and what you are now doing differently * Be yourself, aka **do not invent stories**, there's no point in not being a good cultural fit, it will only lead to regret on your end: I was once told in an interview they already had someone internally but that person was too introvert for the role they were interviewing me, and that my first decision would probably be to fire or not this person. I answered to them that my values are more about finding the strengths of a person and empowering them, rather than trying to have them fit in boxes they don't want to belong to. That person was a good employee who simply wanted to be directed in their work instead of leading change by themselves. They did not pass me to the next round and that was the right decision for all of us.I know that some companies are trying to transform the interview process in a theatrics show, but it's not what it is about. It's about connecting and showing that you can interact with multiple people on multiple teams, reflect on your ideas, and understand the ones coming from others.",27,0.68,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxldo8/got_offer_recently_here_what_you_can_expect_at_a/,2025-04-12 16:36:32,2025-04-13 02:54:55

1juqz76,Anyone else obsess over every tiny detail when coding? It’s driving me crazy.,Popular_Shirt5313,cscareerquestions,"Hey, I’m not sure if this is something others go through, but I’ve been thinking about it a lot.So whenever I’m programming -- whether it’s using a library, writing a function, or even just learning how to use APIs -- I feel this intense need to understand *everything*. Like not just “how to use it,” but how it’s implemented under the hood, what every line does, why it was written that way, etc.And honestly, it’s exhausting.I don’t think I’m autistic or have OCD or anything -- I’ve never been diagnosed -- but there’s something in me that just *won’t* let go of the tiniest unknown. Maybe it’s perfectionism? Maybe it’s just anxiety? I don’t know. But it kind of sucks the joy out of coding sometimes.Everyone says being detail-oriented is a good thing in the long run, but in the moment, it feels like a curse. I spend hours obsessing over stuff that probably doesn’t matter, and as a result, I make barely any progress. It’s frustrating, and it makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong.Does anyone else experience this? If so, how do you deal with it?

Before that I was planning about what to do after graduation, looked for jobs, and had expectations on what I will become. But things did not seem to go as planned. I was faced with rejections from jobs that I want (software engineer) from companies and also got job offers from small ones at a minimum rate. But because of financial aspects, living in rural area, lack of decent job opportunities, and the cities nearby is about 20km and 30km from us, I accepted an offer that is not on my list of preferred jobs but still aligned with my degree. I thought it's better than not working and at least I have a little source of income. I stayed for 6 months then moved to a public office that is only 10minutes away which is my current job. But I am never satisfied.I don't like what I am doing currently with my job, I don't feel any improvement since there's not much to do. I mostly just assist users, teach them how to use MS office, very little troubleshooting tasks. Nothing, just doing boring, admin tasks. Add to that the annoying co-workers who only know to talk and joke about their se* life and doing nothing. Then when it's payday, I feel like a failure because I am earning minimum wage despite my degree and achievements back in college. Maybe it has to do with me being used to the academic system vs. how my life without a system and consistency works. Now, I don't have deadlines, nothing to procrastinate about, no one ordering me to get me going, no adrenaline. Just plain cycle of waking up, go to work to do basically nothing, go home, repeat until weekend. I have a hobby too, I practice piano (self-taught) and video games, but I always have this guilt in the back of my mind that instead of doing this, I should be making portfolio, getting certifications and improve my skills in tech. The challenge is I can't get myself to learn without a mentor or someone ordering me, I can't learn on my own but I don't have anyone to teach me. Youtube is not enough because I need someone to discuss my new knowledge with as well as correct what I may be doing wrong.

I was doing this type of _trial period_ in which I was supposed to implement a feature in the new application they were working on. While I was able to make it work the first time, my code made some violations to the architecture. That's fine and it was my mistake, but my boss (who's also the owner of the startup) was beyond mean in his review on my PR, asking me if I even read the code and very harsh stuff, which I really found unnecessary since it was my first time working with that app. From that point I just felt pressured to stop feeling like I was embarrassing myself as opposed to trying to deeply learn the app, so I made a couple more of fixes and again, same feedback, which wasn't constructive at all. The closest thing to constructive criticism I received was when he told me to look at how one of the files did the job, which I wonder, why not do that from the beginning? At the end he said he didn't want to continue as my work was _completely unacceptable_, and what's funny about that is that he made a comment in my very first PR about a technique I used and he labeled it as _something you should never be doing in the industry_, and yet, I actually had taken that logic from the already existing code that he himself had either written or reviewed before, since it was on the master branch.I guess the question is, do all startups expect you to get everything right from the start and basically offer no mentorship, even when the job description listed 2 years of experience?

The responses:>Imagine how annoyed you would be as a hiring manager if every candidate did this. It might actually hurt your chances as you will be seen as anxious and neurotic. No one wants to work with people who can’t just chill a little bit and wait.and>I can confirm that it's annoying as shit & I just ignore itIdk who the first response is by, but the second response was supposedly by an engineering manager. I know each manager is different and may not want to be messaged, but if you’re being messaged, you probably have a contact that people can find. I think it’s fine if the manager ignores such messages, but I don’t know how you can get annoyed by people messaging you if you have a job posting for your team and your contact is up somewhere online.

I have what many would consider a ""great job"": Good pay, WFH, very few meetings, a supportive and cool team, no sprints or storyboards, normal hours. I'm basically left alone to write and review code.Despite this, I am struggling to care at all about my job. I sit down every morning and the last thing I want to do is write more code. I've removed all distractions from my desk (no phone, no internet scrolling) yet my mind wanders for many hours per day, increasingly all 8 of them.I worry that the abstract problem solving needed to program is just too taxing for me. It's not that I'm not intelligent enough to solve the problems, but the process of solving them is exhausting, if that makes sense.When I started this job I found it tiring but rewarding. I was surprised how good it felt to accomplish work, even if the business use for the software was not overly interesting. Now I just find it tiring, but given the idealness of the arrangement I have little faith changing companies would help long-term. I could try a new career, but I have near-term plans to take advantage of my flexibility and salary to move to a bigger city. And more generally, the pay and benefits of this industry are strong incentives for me to make this work, at least for another 5-10 years. Time off helps somewhat, but I always seem to regress back into this state.This is a bit of a vent, but to ask some specific questions: Does this experience resonate with anyone?

I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Software Engineering, with a minor in Environmental Science (I just think it's fun) and I intend to get another minor in Applied Data Science, just to diversify a little bit. I'm not particularly privileged, and I wouldn't be able to afford a degree at this university, but I am an employee there so I get multiple free courses each year and I am definitely using that benefit to the maximum extent I can while I work full time and save money. Outside of work, I do have a very strong interest in electronics, engineering, computer science, etc; I find it fascinating, so as I progress through this degree, I won't have any issue building a portfolio outside of assigned projects. I have plenty of things I would love to do on my own that I just haven't acquired the knowledge for, with one of the main reasons being that I operate best when I have direction. Many of these projects (like setting up a home server with a connection to custom-made voice recognition software; basically building my own Alexa because I don't trust Amazon or Google) are things that I just don't have the toolset to even really get started with teaching myself easily. But smaller things, like refurbishing a boombox from the late 80's and adding a bluetooth remote, are things I have done because that tends to be smaller scale.All of this is just to help show, I don't see this as a ""get rich quick"" scheme, and I'm not pursuing something I hate just to get the benefits; I'm just trying to maximize my return with a field that I have a natural interest in. But, beyond my B.S. and probable M.S., I'm really not sure what my ideal path would look like. Should I start looking for big companies to work for, to build up reputation? Is it enough to continue building a portfolio with private freelance projects, and if so, how would I even start to find those sorts of projects? What general field would be the most likely to work for this goal (full-stack development, network security consulting, etc)? I know looking at all of this less than halfway through my B.S. is maybe a little ambitious, but I would rather get started on the right path sooner rather than later; I don't just want to coast through my degree with no real game plan afterwards, if that makes sense.

1jvdg82,MSFT L60 SWE – Trying to be SD2-ready at another company by next year,tturner3316,cscareerquestions,"Hi! I’m hoping to get some perspective on whether I’m where I should be in my career, and what I should be focusing on over the next year.I graduated in 2022 and joined Microsoft as an L59 new grad. I got placed on a random Azure team doing pretty low-level, super product-specific work. Barely did any coding—most of my time went into looking at logs and tracing through old C++ systems. I wasn’t really building transferable skills, and I didn’t get much experience with C# or .NET either. This was super frustrating but it was what was it was.Late last year I was able to switch teams after getting promoted to L60. My new team works on an internal website and it’s been a WAY better fit. I’ve been doing mostly backend stuff and finally getting to get some exposure to coding in .NET. I’ve picked up a lot—dependency injection, JWTs, RBAC, separation of concerns, etc. I do rely on the VS/VS Code Copilot when I’m stuck or just don’t know how to start, and this frankly does worry me a lot. I try to dig in and understand what I’m doing, and I’ve learned a ton from my teammates, but I do worry about my ability to perform without it. On this team I’ve been able to handle tons of entirely different projects with plenty of success and I’ve ramped up very quickly since joining, and a big part of that has been using Copilot effectively to help me understand what I need to know and to at least provide a skeleton for me to iterate on. It adds to the frustration from the previous team since essentially none of the hard skills i’m using today were things I was exposed to then so in many ways it feels like I’m starting from scratch.That said, my last stock vests in March 2026, and I’m planning to move cities and switch jobs. That’ll be 3.5 years in, and I’d like to be ready for SD2 roles by then. I might get promoted to L61 this fall, but even if I do I’m not confident I’d be able to thrive as an SD2 at a company like Meta or Google.To prep, I’m planning to:•Grind LeetCode consistently•Go through Effective Java and Designing Data-Intensive Applications•Keep learning from my current team and writing as much code as I canBut it does still worry me that I’m behind where I should be and that if I make the switch I’ll be exposed. For anyone who’s made the jump to SD2 or switched companies around the 3-4 year mark—what helped you feel actually ready?Any advice on how I can close the gap in the next year? I get that some of this may be imposter syndrome, and i’ve struggled with that in the past, but I feel like on this team I’ve seen so many concrete examples of things I should know by now but don’t.Appreciate any thoughts.",7,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jvdg82/msft_l60_swe_trying_to_be_sd2ready_at_another/,2025-04-09 18:46:37,2025-04-13 02:54:55

1jxwjzl,"US employees, are you saving more aggressively?",dhekurbaba,cscareerquestions,"My philosophy for savings has been to keep a year's worth of expenses in a savings account, and invest the rest however I see fit, like paying off loans early.With the economy and a recent firstborn, I stopped paying off loans early and focusing on at least doubling my savings account.I have only a few years of experience so my 401k and savings are quite young.Anyone else in a similar boat?EDIT: Apologies if this fits r/personalfinance only and does not fit here, I thought it fits this sub better.",9,0.74,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxwjzl/us_employees_are_you_saving_more_aggressively/,2025-04-13 01:29:17,2025-04-13 02:54:55
1jxf5cu,Boston vs London vs Zurich for Software Engineering,sylar99994444,cscareerquestions,"Im a PhD level educated Software Engineer with EU and british nationality living in the UK. I’ve travelled to most of Europe and US and the cities I like the most are Boston, Zurich and London, in this order.Which of them do you think would be best for finding a balance between work, salary, life, good weather, and family (with 2 children) as a Software Engineer? Note that my partner works in IT support.Moving to Zurich is not that difficult with my EU nationality. In Zurich, except Google, and very few others, pay is quite low compared to the cost of living. Moving here is risky, as I dont want to bet my entire life on Google. Also, in Zurich healthcare is private, and can cost a lot for an entire family. Children are also expensive in Zurich. The chances of buying a flat in Zurich (around 1 milion CHF) are slim. I’d rather have a smaller salary and own my home, as my net worth would be effectively higher. Also, I’d have to learn swiss german, and my children would have to go to school and speak swiss german. They would probably not integrate properly in swiss society with parents that barely speak swiss german.In London, there are so many options. There are more jobs than in Boston, Zurich, actually its the city with almost the most CS jobs in the world. Lots of companies offer 150k salaries. The problem in London is the tax system, as between 100k and 125k we are effectively taxed at ~61% and after 125k we are taxed at 45%. Buying a house in London is not as difficult as in Zurich, and there are many options of nice homes. London is a bit unsafe tho, and raising a family comes with additional challenges. Also the weather is too overcast, as Id rather live somewhere colder but sunnier, instead of somewhere with mild weather but cloudy and overcast.Moving to Boston would be the most difficult. It is feasible as I have a PhD and many first author research papers at reputable venues, so I could get an EB2 NIW green card visa. Buying a flat in Boston would be the easiest compared to London and Zurich. Boston is safer than London. Boston has the most high paying jobs compared to London and Zurich. It also has the most sunshine compared to London and Zurich. However, healthcare is private and I assume it would be expensive for an entire family. Also, I would have very little annual leave in Boston, as in Europe there are about 5 weeks of annual leave each year",7,0.82,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jxf5cu/boston_vs_london_vs_zurich_for_software/,2025-04-12 11:27:14,2025-04-13 02:54:55

1jugp97,Would you recommend getting a degree in CS field if you are already working in IT?,NoWeather1702,cscareerquestions,"So the question is in the title, but I would like to give more details. If a person already working as a developer for several years, but doesn't have CS degree, would you consider it good or beneficial in nowadays to spend money and time and get that degree?I guess that I would like to return to university, study CS and get the degree, but also I understand that it will cost me a lot of money and time. And most certainly I won't be able to work and study simultaneously, at least at the current pace. And current job market tells me that most of the time working experience is more important than education.

1jx29tx,Best advice for new grad,24Gokartracer,cscareerquestions,"In less than a month from now, I will be graduating and have my computer science degree as well as a cyber security certificate from my university. Going forward this summer. I’m looking for advice on the best way to go about pursuing a job. I currently have probably applied to over 100 places And will continue to keep applying. That being said as I approach this summer, I will no longer have school and have a lot of free time and want to know what you guys think the best way to use it would be. Should I be focusing on personal projects and making myself a more skilled developer and focus less on the Applications? Or should I be focusing on quantity over quality and just applying to as many positions that I see myself fit into with my current skill set? Looking through the sub I see so many people waiting months or years just to finally be employed so I’m wondering which way I should go about all of this Any help or advice is appreciated",6,0.87,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jx29tx/best_advice_for_new_grad/,2025-04-11 22:19:48,2025-04-13 02:54:55

1jvw2pb,I quit after 10 months and I’m spiraling looking for perspective,SourceAwkward,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, A friend recommended I post here. I recently gave notice at my job after 10 months, and I’m really second-guessing myself even though I *know* it was the right move.I worked at a small startup in a small tech ecosystem. I liked the people a *lot*, but I just never clicked with the product. It started affecting my energy, focus, and general drive—I’d show up late, avoid work, and just felt completely disconnected. That’s really not like me.Today, I gave my 30 days' notice to the CTO. She was disappointed and said I should’ve raised a flag earlier and that 10 months isn’t enough time to evaluate a job. And… maybe she’s right. That part’s really weighing on me. But who want to raise a flag? it's like saying fire me next?To be clear, I wasn’t fired. I left on good terms I found another opportunity at a company I actually care about (coincidentally the one that acquired my old company a while back). They offered me more money and a better fi so logically, things are working out.But emotionally? I feel like crap Really! Like I bailed too early. Like I failed some invisible test. Like I burned a bridge.Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you move past the guilt and doubt? Is leaving after 10 monthss really that bad in tech anymore?Would love to hear any thoughts.",6,0.69,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jvw2pb/i_quit_after_10_months_and_im_spiraling_looking/,2025-04-10 11:55:49,2025-04-13 02:54:55
1jukaj6,Is it worth learning Flutter? Or just learn React instead.,cooleobeaneo,cscareerquestions,"Currently doing a side project building an app in Flutter. I am enjoying it and dart is a great language I was wholly unfamiliar with. But I am wondering, is it worth even learning flutter when the job market seems to mainly prefer React? My original mindset before this project was that Flutter was a niche job market which might make me more valuable as a candidate to employers, however, I’m slowly second guessing that decision and am wondering if after this project I should just make the switch to learning React Native or maybe even an entirely different framework for mobile app development. Any experience with both these frameworks?
