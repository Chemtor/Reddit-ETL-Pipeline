1knixik,Is python no longer a prerequisite to call yourself a data engineer?,ttothesecond,dataengineering,"I am a little over 4 years into my first job as a DE and would call myself solid in python. Over the last week, I've been helping conduct interviews to fill another DE role in my company - and I kid you not, not a single candidate has known how to write python - despite it very clearly being part of our job description. Other than python, most of them (except for one exceptionally bad candidate) could talk the talk regarding tech stack, ELT vs ETL, tools like dbt, Glue, SQL Server, etc. but not a single one could actually write python.What's even more insane to me is that ALL of them rated themselves somewhere between 5-8 (yes, the most recent one said he's an 8) in their python skills. Then when we get to the live coding portion of the session, they literally cannot write a single line. I understand live coding is intimidating, but my goodness, surely you can write just ONE coherent line of code at an 8/10 skill level. I just do not understand why they are doing this - do they really think we're not gonna ask them to prove it when they rate themselves that highly?What is going on here?? edit: Alright I stand corrected - I guess a lot of yall don't use python for DE work.

1kmq1ew,Is it really necessary to ingest all raw data into the bronze layer?,Maradona2021,dataengineering,"I keep seeing this idea repeated here:> **“The entire point of a bronze layer is to have raw data with no or minimal transformations.”**I get the intent — but I have multiple data sources (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.), where each object already comes with a well-defined schema. In my ETL pipeline, I use an automated schema validator: if someone changes the source data, the pipeline automatically detects the change and adjusts accordingly.For example, the Product object might have 300 fields, but only 220 are actually used in practice. So why ingest all 300 if my schema validator already confirms which fields are relevant?People often respond with:>> **“Standard practice is to bring all columns through to Bronze and only filter in Silver. That way, if you need a column later, it’s already there.”**But if schema evolution is automated across all layers, then I’m not managing multiple schema definitions — they evolve together. And I’m not even bringing storage or query cost into the argument; I just find this approach cleaner and more efficient.Also, side note: why does almost every post here involve vendor recommendations? It’s hard to believe everyone here is working at a large-scale data company with billions of events per day. I often see beginner-level questions, and the replies immediately mention tools like Airbyte or Fivetran. Sometimes, writing a few lines of Python is faster, cheaper, and gives you full control.

1klpzaf,Do you rather hate or love using Python for writing your own ETL jobs?,CootNo4578,dataengineering,"Disclaimer: I am not a data engineer, I'm a total outsider. My background is 5 years of software engineering and 2 years of DevOps/SRE. These days the only times I get in contact with DE is when I am called out to look at an excessive error rate in some random ETL jobs. So my exposure to this is limited to when it does not work and that makes it biased.At my previous job, the entire data pipeline was written in Python. 80% of the time, catastrophic failures in ETL pipelines came from a third-party vendor deciding to change an important schema overnight or an internal team not paying enough attention to backward compatibility in APIs. And that will happen no matter what tech you build your data pipeline on.But Python does not make it easy to do lots of healthy things like ensuring data is validated or handling all errors correctly. And the interpreted, runtime-centric nature of Python makes it - in my experience - more difficult to debug when shit finally hits the fan. Sure static type linters exist, but the level of features type annotations provide in Python is not on the same level as what is provided by a statically typed language. And I've always seen dependency management as an issue with Python, especially when releasing to the cloud and trying to make sure it runs the same way everywhere.And yet, it's clearly the most popular option and has the most mature ecosystem. So people must love it.What are you guys' experience reaching to Python for writing your own ETL jobs? What makes it great? Have you found more success using something else entirely? Polars+Rust maybe? Go?

I am currently learning Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Once I firmly know GCP, I will then learn Azure. Within my GCP training, I am currently creating OLTP GCP Cloud SQL Instances.

1kn2cgq,Perhaps the best transition: DS > DE,HungryRefrigerator24,dataengineering,"Currently I have around 6 years of professional experience in which the biggest part is into Data Science. Ive started my career when I was young as a hybrid of Data Analyst and Data Engineering, doing a bit of both, and then changed for Data Scientist. I've always liked the idea of working with AI and ML and statistics, and although I do enjoy it a lot (specially because I really like social sciences, hence working with DS gives me a good feeling of learning a bit about population behavior) I believe that perhaps Ive found a better deal in DE.What happens is that I got laid off last year as a Data Scientist, and found it difficult to get a new job since I didnt have work experience with the trendy AI Agents, and decided to give it a try as a full-time DE. Right now I believe that I've never been so productive because I actually see my deliverables as something ""solid"", something that no pretencious ""business guy"" will try to debate or outsmart me (with his 5min GPT research).Usually most of my DS routine envolved trying to convince the ""business guy"" that asked for me to deliver something, that my solutions was indeed correct despite of his opinion on that matter. Now I've found myself with tasks that is moving data from A to B, and once it's done theres no debate whether it is true or not, and I can feel myself relieved. Perhaps what I see in the future that could also give me a relatable feeling of ""solidity"" is MLE/MLOps. This is just a shout out for those that are also tired, perhaps give it a chance for DE and try to see if it brings a piece of mind for you.

1kkip1h,For those who have worked both in data engineering and software engineering....,thro0away12,dataengineering,"I am curious what was your role under each title, similarities and differences in knowledge and which you ultimately prefer and why?I know some people say DE is a subset of SWE, but I don't necessarily feel this way about my job. I see that there is a lot of debate about the DE role itself, so I'm not sure if there is a consensus of this role either. Basically, my DE job entails creating SQL tables, but more so than that a ton of my time just goes into trying to figure out what people want without any proper guidance or documentation. I don't interact with the stakeholders but I have colleagues who are supposed to translate to me what the stakeholders want. Except that they don't...they just tell me to complete a task with my only guiding documents being PDFs, data dictionaries, other documents related to the projects. Sometimes, my only guidance is previous projects, but when I use those as templates I'm told I can't rely on that since every project is different. This ends up just being a constant back and forth stream and when there is a level of concensus reached as to what exactly the project is supposed to accomplish, it finally becomes a clean table in SQL that is frequently used as the backend data source for a front-end application for stakeholders to use (I don't build this application). I have touched Python very rarely at my job. I am supposed to get a task where I should be doing more stuff in Python but I'm not sure if that's even going to happen. I'm kind of more a technically minded person. When my job requires me to find solutions by writing code and developing, I feel like I can tolerate my job more. I'm not finding my current responsibilities technical enough for my liking. The biggest gripe I have is that the person who should be helping guide me with business/stakeholder needs is frequently too busy to communicate properly with me and never tells me what exactly the project is, what the stakeholders want and keeps telling me to 'read documents' to figure it out, documents that have zero guidance as to the project. When things get delayed because I have to spend forever trying to figure out what exactly I should be doing, there's a lot of frustration directed at me. I personally think I'd be happier as a backend SWE, but I am uncertain and would love to hear from others what they preferred between DE and SWE and why. I would consider changing to a different DE role but with SQL being the only thing I use (I do have experience otherwise in Python and JavaScript, just not at my current job), I'm afraid I'm not going to be technically competitive enough for other DE roles either. I don't know what else to consider if I want to switch jobs.

Their thinking behind this is that this gives the greatest flexibility when it comes to different asks by the business. For example if tomorrow the business wants to create another report, you are not locked down to the data types enforced in staging for the needs of the first use case. Personally I find this a bit of an odd decision but would like to hear your thoughts on this.

1kpaisy,Is it a bad idea to use DuckDB as my landing zone format in S3?,DuckDatum,dataengineering,"I’m polling data out of a system that forces a strict quota, pagination, and requires I fanout my requests per record in order to denormalize its HATEAOS links into nested data that can later be flattened into a tabular model. It’s a lot, likely because the interface wasn’t intended for this purpose. It’s what I’ve got though. It’s slow with lots of steps to potentially fail at. All that, and I can only filter at a days granularity—so polling for changes is a loaded process too.I went ahead and set up an ETL pipeline that used DuckDB as an intermediate caching layer, to avoid memory issues, and set it up to dump parquet into S3. This ran for 24 hours then failed just shy of the dump, so now I’m thinking about micro batches.I want to turn this into a microbatch process. I figure I can cache the ID, HATEAOS link, and a nullable column for the JSON data. Once I have the data, I update the row where it belongs. I could store duckdb in S3 the whole time, or just plan to dump it if a failure occurs. This also gives a way to query the duckdb for missing records in case it fails mid way.So before I dump duckdb into S3, or even try to use duckdb in s3 over a network, are there limitations I’m not considering?

1kotr7w,Advice on Data Pipeline that Requires Individual API Calls,pswagsbury,dataengineering,"Hi Everyone,I’m tasked with grabbing data from one db about devices and using a rest api to pull information associated with it. The problem is that the api only allows inputting a single device at a time and I have 20k+ rows in the db table. The plan is to automate this using airflow as a daily job (probably 20-100 new rows per day). What would be the best way of doing this? For now I was going to resort to a for-loop but this doesn’t seem the most efficient.Additionally, the api returns information about the device, and a list of sub devices that are children to the main device. The number of children is arbitrary, but they all have the same fields: the parent and children. I want to capture all the fields for each parent and child, so I was thinking of have a table in long format with an additional column called parent_id, which allows the children records to be self joined on their parent record. Note: each api call is around 500ms average, and no I cannot just join the table with the underlying api data source directlyDoes my current approach seem valid?

Therefore, we are instead entering our metadata into dbt YAML files (a macro propagates the dbt metadata to Snowflake metadata). However, there are no UI options available (other than spreadsheets) for entering metadata into dbt which means data engineers will have to be directly involved which won't scale. What can we do? Does dbt cloud ($$) provide a way to keep dbt metadata and Snowflake-entered metadata in sync BOTH WAYS through object recreations?",12,0.81,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kmk8lw/dbt_and_snowflake_keeping_metadata_in_sync_both/,2025-05-14 16:54:15,2025-05-19 01:45:32
1kmch5u,Advice needed for normalizing database for a personal rock climbing project,KookyCupcake6337,dataengineering,"Hi all,**Context:**I am currently creating an ETL pipeline. The pipeline ingests rock climbing data (which was webscraped) transforms it and cleans it. Another pipeline extracts hourly 7 day weather forecast data and cleans it. The plan is to match crags (rock climbing sites) with weather forecasts using the coordinate variables of both datasets. That way, a rock climber can look at his favourite crag and see if the weather is right for climbing in the next seven days (correct temperature, not raining etc.) and plan their trips accordingly. The weather data would update everyday.To be clear, there won't be any front end for this project. I am just creating an ETL pipeline **as if** this was going to be the use case for the database. I plan on using the project to try to persuade the Senior Data Engineer at my current company to give me some real DE work.**Problem**This is the schema I have landed on for now. The weather data is normalised to only one level while the crag data being normalised into multiple levels. I think the weather data is quite simple is easy. It's just the crag data I am worried about. There are over 127,000 rows here with lots of columns that have many 1 to many relationships. I think not normalising would be a mistake and create performance issues, but again, it's my first time normalising to such an extent. I have created a star schema database but this is the first time normalising past 1 level. I just wanted to make sure everything was correctly done before I go ahead with creating the database [Schema for now](https://preview.redd.it/q4x72hcicq0f1.png?width=2501&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69f68a2b52d63aa5ce42a36a6330873ab371ed2)**The relationship is as follows:**crag --> sector (optional) --> routecrags are a singular site of climbing. They have a longitude and latitude coordinate associated with them as well as a name. Each crag has many routes on it. Typically, a single crag has one rocktype (e.g. sandstone, gravel etc.) associated with it but can have many different types of climbs (e.g. lead climbing, bouldering, trad climbing)If a crag is particularly large it will have multiple sectors, each sector will have many routes. and each sector has a name associated with them. Smaller crags will have only have one sector, called: 'Main Sector'.Routes are the most granular datapoint. Each route has a name, a difficulty grade, a safety grade and a type.I hope this explains everything well.

1ko2h06,Using Parquet for JSON Files,ItsHoney,dataengineering,"Hi!Some Background: I am a Jr. Dev at a real estate data aggregation company. We receive listing information from thousands of different sources (we can call them datasources!). We currently store this information in JSON (seperate json file per listingId) on S3. The S3 keys are deterministic (so based on ListingID + datasource ID we can figure out where it's placed in the S3). Problem:My manager and I were experimenting to see If we could somehow connect Athena (AWS) with this data for searching operations. We currently have a use case where we need to seek distinct values for some fields in thousands of files, which is quite slow when done directly on S3.My manager and I were experimenting with Parquet files to achieve this. but I recently found out that Parquet files are immutable, so we can't update existing parquet files with new listings unless we load the whole file into memory. Each listingId file is quite small (few Kbs), so it doesn't make sense for one parquet file to only contain info about a single listingId.

I’ve become particularly interested in working with data in cloud environments – in the past, I’ve worked with SQL databases and also had some exposure to OLAP systems. To prepare for this role, I’ve completed several courses and built a few non-commercial projects using cloud services such as Databricks, ADF, SQL DB, DevOps, etc.Right now, I’m applying for Cloud Data Engineer positions in Azure, especially those related to ETL/ELT. I’d like to understand what everyday work in commercial projects actually looks like, so I can better prepare for interviews and get a clearer sense of what employers mean when they talk about “commercial experience.” This post is mainly addressed to those who already work in such roles.Here are some optional guiding questions (feel free to use them or just describe things your way):* What does a typical workday look like for a data engineer working with ETL/ELT tools in the cloud (Azure/GCP/AWS – mainly Data Services like Databricks, Spark, Virtual Machines, ADF, ADLS, SQL Database, Synapse, etc.)?* What kind of tasks do you receive? How do you approach them and how much time do they usually take?* How would you classify tasks as easy, medium, or advanced in terms of difficulty – could you give examples?* Could you describe the context of your current project?* Do you often use documentation and AI? What is the attitude toward AI in your team and among your managers?* What do you do when you face a problem you can’t immediately solve? What does team communication look like in such cases?* Do you take part in designing the architecture and integrating services?* What does the lifecycle of a task look like?* How do you usually communicate – is it constant interaction or more asynchronous work, e.g. through Git?I hope I managed to express clearly what I’m looking for. I also hope this post helps not only me but other aspiring data engineers as well.

1kpybzt,ELI5: What exactly are ACID and BASE Transactions?,trolleid,dataengineering,"In this article, I will cover ACID and BASE transactions. First I give an easy ELI5 explanation and then a deeper dive. At the end, I show code examples.## What is ACID, what is BASE?When we say a database supports _ACID_ or _BASE_, we mean it supports _ACID transactions_ or _BASE transactions_.### ACIDAn ACID transaction is simply writing to the DB, but with these guarantees;1. Write it _all or nothing_; writing A but not B cannot happen.2. If someone else writes at the same time, make sure it still works properly.3. Make sure the write stays.Concretely, ACID stands for:A = Atomicity = _all or nothing (point 1)_ C = Consistency I = Isolation = _parallel writes work fine (point 2)_ D = Durability = _write should stay (point 3)_### BASEA BASE transaction is again simply writing to the DB, but with weaker guarantees. BASE lacks a clear definition. However, it stands for:BA = Basically available S = Soft state E = Eventual consistency.What these terms usually mean is:- _Basically available_ just means the system prioritizes availability (see CAP theorem later).- _Soft state_ means the system's state might not be immediately consistent and may change over time without explicit updates. (Particularly across multiple nodes, that is, when we have partitioning or multiple DBs)- _Eventual consistency_ means the system becomes consistent over time, that is, at least if we stop writing. Eventual consistency is the only clearly defined part of BASE.### NotesYou surely noticed I didn't address the C in ACID: consistency. It means that data follows the application's rules (invariants). In other words, if a transaction starts with valid data and preserves these rules, the data stays valid. But this is the not the database's responsibility, it's the application's. Atomicity, isolation, and durability are database properties, but consistency depends on the application. So the C doesn't really belong in ACID. Some argue the C was added to ACID to make the acronym work.The name ACID was coined in 1983 by Theo Härder and Andreas Reuter. The intent was to establish clear terminology for fault-tolerance in databases. However, how we get ACID, that is ACID transactions, is up to each DB. For example PostgreSQL implements ACID in a different way than MySQL - and surely different than MongoDB (which also supports ACID). Unfortunately when a system claims to support ACID, it's therefore not fully clear which guarantees they actually bring because ACID has become a marketing term to a degree.And, as you saw, BASE certainly has a very unprecise definition. One can say BASE means _Not-ACID_.## Simple ExamplesHere quickly a few standard examples of why ACID is important.### AtomicityImagine you're transferring $100 from your checking account to your savings account. This involves two operations:1. Subtract $100 from checking2. Add $100 to savingsWithout transactions, if your bank's system crashes after step 1 but before step 2, you'd lose $100! With transactions, either both steps happen or neither happens. All or nothing - atomicity.### IsolationSuppose two people are booking the last available seat on a flight at the same time.- Alice sees the seat is available and starts booking.- Bob also sees the seat is available and starts booking at the same time.Without proper isolation, both transactions might think the seat is available and both might be allowed to book it—resulting in overbooking. With isolation, only one transaction can proceed at a time, ensuring data consistency and avoiding conflicts.### DurabilityImagine you've just completed a large online purchase and the system confirms your order.Right after confirmation, the server crashes.Without durability, the system might ""forget"" your order when it restarts. With durability, once a transaction is committed (your order is confirmed), the result is permanent—even in the event of a crash or power loss.## Code SnippetA transaction might look like the following. Everything between `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT` is considered part of the transaction.```sqlBEGIN TRANSACTION;-- Subtract $100 from checking accountUPDATE accountsSET balance = balance - 100WHERE account_type = 'checking' AND account_id = 1;-- Add $100 to savings accountUPDATE accountsSET balance = balance + 100WHERE account_type = 'savings' AND account_id = 1;-- Ensure the account balances remain valid (Consistency)-- Check if checking account balance is non-negativeDO $$BEGIN IF (SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_type = 'checking' AND account_id = 1) < 0 THEN RAISE EXCEPTION 'Insufficient funds in checking account'; END IF;END $$;COMMIT;```## COMMIT and ROLLBACKTwo essential commands that make ACID transactions possible are COMMIT and ROLLBACK:### COMMITWhen you issue a COMMIT command, it tells the database that all operations in the current transaction should be made permanent. Once committed:- Changes become visible to other transactions- The transaction cannot be undone- The database guarantees durability of these changesA COMMIT represents the successful completion of a transaction.### ROLLBACKWhen you issue a ROLLBACK command, it tells the database to discard all operations performed in the current transaction. This is useful when:- An error occurs during the transaction- Application logic determines the transaction should not complete- You want to test operations without making permanent changesROLLBACK ensures atomicity by preventing partial changes from being applied when something goes wrong.Example with ROLLBACK:```sqlBEGIN TRANSACTION;UPDATE accountsSET balance = balance - 100WHERE account_type = 'checking' AND account_id = 1;-- Check if balance is now negativeIF (SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_type = 'checking' AND account_id = 1) < 0 THEN -- Insufficient funds, cancel the transaction ROLLBACK; -- Transaction is aborted, no changes are madeELSE -- Add the amount to savings UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_type = 'savings' AND account_id = 1; -- Complete the transaction COMMIT;END IF;```## Why BASE?BASE used to be important because many DBs, for example document-oriented DBs, did not support ACID. They had other advantages. Nowadays however, most document-oriented DBs support ACID.So why even have BASE?ACID can get really difficult when having distributed DBs. For example when you have partitioning or you have a microservice architecture where each service has its own DB. If your transaction only writes to one partition (or DB), then there's no problem. But what if you have a transaction that spans accross multiple partitions or DBs, a so called _distributed transaction_?The short answer is: we either work around it or we loosen our guarantees from ACID to ... BASE.## ACID in Distributed DatabasesLet's address ACID one by one. Let's only consider partitioned DBs for now.### AtomicityDifficult. If we do a write on partition `A` and it works but one on `B` fails, we're in trouble.### IsolationDifficult. If we have multiple transactions concurrently access data across different partitions, it's hard to ensure isolation.### DurabilityNo problem since each node has durable storage.### What about Microservice Architectures?Pretty much the same issues as with partitioned DBs. However, it gets even more difficult because microservices are independently developed and deployed.### SolutionsThere are two primary approaches to handling transactions in distributed systems:#### Two-Phase Commit (2PC)Two-Phase Commit is a protocol designed to achieve atomicity in distributed transactions. It works as follows:1. **Prepare Phase**: A coordinator node asks all participant nodes if they're ready to commit - Each node prepares the transaction but doesn't commit - Nodes respond with ""ready"" or ""abort""2. **Commit Phase**: If all nodes are ready, the coordinator tells them to commit - If any node responded with ""abort,"" all nodes are told to rollback - If all nodes responded with ""ready,"" all nodes are told to commit2PC guarantees atomicity but has significant drawbacks:- It's blocking (participants must wait for coordinator decisions)- Performance overhead due to multiple round trips- Vulnerable to coordinator failures- Can lead to extended resource lockingExample of 2PC in pseudo-code:```// Coordinatorfunction twoPhaseCommit(transaction, participants) { // Phase 1: Prepare for each participant in participants { response = participant.prepare(transaction) if response != ""ready"" { for each participant in participants { participant.abort(transaction) } return ""Transaction aborted"" } } // Phase 2: Commit for each participant in participants { participant.commit(transaction) } return ""Transaction committed""}```#### Saga PatternThe Saga pattern is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates a single node. After each local transaction, it publishes an event that triggers the next transaction. If a transaction fails, compensating transactions are executed to undo previous changes.1. **Forward transactions**: T1, T2, ..., Tn2. **Compensating transactions**: C1, C2, ..., Cn-1 (executed if something fails)For example, an order processing flow might have these steps:- Create order- Reserve inventory- Process payment- Ship orderIf the payment fails, compensating transactions would:- Cancel shipping- Release inventory reservation- Cancel orderSagas can be implemented in two ways:- **Choreography**: Services communicate through events- **Orchestration**: A central coordinator manages the workflowExample of a Saga in pseudo-code:```// Orchestration approachfunction orderSaga(orderData) { try { orderId = orderService.createOrder(orderData) inventoryId = inventoryService.reserveItems(orderData.items) paymentId = paymentService.processPayment(orderData.payment) shippingId = shippingService.scheduleDelivery(orderId) return ""Order completed successfully"" } catch (error) { if (shippingId) shippingService.cancelDelivery(shippingId) if (paymentId) paymentService.refundPayment(paymentId) if (inventoryId) inventoryService.releaseItems(inventoryId) if (orderId) orderService.cancelOrder(orderId) return ""Order failed: "" + error.message }}```## What about Replication?There are mainly three way of replicating your DB. Single-leader, multi-leader and leaderless. I will not address multi-leader.### Single-leaderACID is not a concern here. If the DB supports ACID, replicating it won't change anything. You write to the leader via an ACID transaction and the DB will make sure the followers are updated. Of course, when we have asynchronous replication, we don't have consistency. But this is not an ACID problem, it's a asynchronous replication problem.### Leaderless ReplicationIn leaderless replication systems (like Amazon's Dynamo or Apache Cassandra), ACID properties become more challenging to implement:- **Atomicity**: Usually limited to single-key operations- **Consistency**: Often relaxed to eventual consistency (BASE)- **Isolation**: Typically provides limited isolation guarantees- **Durability**: Achieved through replication to multiple nodesThis approach prioritizes availability and partition tolerance over consistency, aligning with the BASE model rather than strict ACID.## Conclusion- ACID provides strong guarantees but can be challenging to implement across distributed systems- BASE offers more flexibility but requires careful application design to handle eventual consistencyIt's important to understand ACID vs BASE and the whys.The right choice depends on your specific requirements:- Financial applications may need ACID guarantees- Social media applications might work fine with BASE semantics (at least most parts of it).",20,0.77,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kpybzt/eli5_what_exactly_are_acid_and_base_transactions/,2025-05-19 00:08:18,2025-05-19 01:45:32

With this in mind, we're excited to introduce four new capabilities enabling you to better manage hundreds of pipelines all in one place:**Diagnose sync errors with AI**We’ve expanded AI support in Cloud Team to allow you to quickly diagnose and fix failed data pipeline syncs Instantly analyze Airbyte logs, connector documentation and known issues to help you identify root cause, and get actionable solutions, without any manual debugging required.

This helps you quickly track down intermittent failures, and easily drill in for more information to help you resolve sync or performance issues.https://preview.redd.it/w79dsro83t0f1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=4707858cd6cc36d7481d38ee515f81e6599bbac6**Organize pipelines with connection tags**Connection Tags help to visually group and organize your pipelines, making it easier than ever to find the connections you need. You can use tags to organize connections based on any set of criteria you like: 'department' in the case of different consuming teams, 'env' for indicating if they are running in production, and anything else you like.https://preview.redd.it/12lnnj3a3t0f1.png?width=2836&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8dfbbbebbc4a9776d5b1b650172094cf138da93**Identify schema changes in the Connection timeline**The [Connection timeline now includes events for any connection settings update](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/cloud/managing-airbyte-cloud/review-connection-timeline): whether these be a schedule update, or a change in the connection schema. For Cloud Teams users, you can use this in conjunction with AI logging to easily diagnose why sync behavior or volumes have suddenly changed.https://preview.redd.it/p4oqcbgb3t0f1.png?width=2746&format=png&auto=webp&s=248babfb9b142aad7a5a88fc6bd2bf555d750b61# Manage Connectors as Infrastructure with Airbyte's Terraform ProviderData movement is an integral part of your application and infrastructure. We've heard plenty of feedback from users requesting better ease of use for our Terraform Provider. We are excited to announce new capabilities making it easier than ever to manage all of your connectors using the Airbyte Terraform provider to roll out changes programmatically to your dev, staging, and production environments.When building a connector in the Airbyte UI, you will now find a **Copy JSON** button at the bottom of connector configuration. You can quickly use this to export the the configuration of a connector to Terraform. This takes into account version-specific configuration settings, and can also be repurposed for configuring connectors with PyAirbyte, the Python SDK or the Airbyte API.https://preview.redd.it/eib6twxc3t0f1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4902d63dbc6a47f22f7f1cf10ba387f0f6474d# Create custom connectors directly from YAML or Docker images[New endpoints and resources have also been added](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/v-1.6#create-custom-connectors-from-yaml-or-docker-images-using-the-api-and-terraform) to the APIs and Terraform provider to allow you create and update custom connectors using a Connection Builder YAML manifest or Docker image. These endpoints do not allow you to modify Airbyte’s public connector configurations, but if you have custom endpoints within your organization and are running OSS or self-managed versions of Airbyte, these additional capabilities can be used to programmatically spin up new connectors for different environments.If you need to manage API custom connectors in infrastructure, we now recommend you build your custom connector using the Connector Builder, test it using the in-app capability for verifying your connector, then export the configuration YAML. You can then easily pass in the YAML as part of a connector resource definition in Terraform:https://preview.redd.it/5loabk9e3t0f1.png?width=3036&format=png&auto=webp&s=d732b93ad24c43e79a3c3f70766135b23bbf7488Together, these two changes will make it significantly easier to manage your entire catalog of connectors as infrastructure in code, if this is preference for you and your team.

1kmnscz,"Been coding for 5ish years, talked to about a dozen beginners here - some real talk",SmopShark,learnprogramming,"Hi,I've been chatting with a bunch of beginners from this sub over the past couple months (like 12 of you lol), and thought I'd dump some thoughts on what actually matters when ur starting out. Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.**Stop obsessing about languages**Everyone's like ""which language should I learn???"" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff. JS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.**What companies acutally look for**I've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough. Your starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch. One of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**One legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes. If you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af? As for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.**Find ppl who get it**You need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click. Stack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better! I was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.**Just. Pick. Something**""People keep saying mixed things about X"" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru. Every ""wrong"" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time. Also don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.**The secret sauce**Consistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways. I still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like ""damn I'm good at this"". It's normal. Hit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.Edit 1: Wow, I did not know all these people would be interested!

We used csv-files now, but I want to do it using an embedded sqlite-database. Because using csv-files is something we did in every practice so far, and it's nothing new at this point. While with csv-files, the problem was to make sure you don't have redundancies, the problem with a database is now the other way around. Here is a simplified layout without any m:n:Product(id as PK, name, price) LineItem(id as PK, volume, product as FK) Sale(id as PK, lineitem as FK)Products need to be able to be updated, because you can edit them. But LineItem and in the end, Sales should not be able to change. With this normalized setup, changing the price of a product, would also change them in all line-items and sales from the past. That obviously must not happen. So what would be the best practice to save a ""history"" of Sales? Save the price in the LineItem? But what if the name changed. So saving the entire Product in the LineItem? But what if the Product becomes bigger, then I'd end up with a lot of columns in Line item, which are also not referencing.Not really sure how this should be handled.

Here’s my approach:**First 2 months**:* Learn Python basics (variables, loops, functions, data types, file handling).* Focus on NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.* Understand basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.).**Next 2 months**:* Deepen knowledge of data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.* Learn SQL for database management.* Work with APIs to practice fetching and manipulating data.**Final 2 months**:* Study machine learning basics using Scikit-learn.* Build small projects, such as data analysis or prediction models.* Practice coding problems on LeetCode or HackerRank.I also plan to start applying for entry-level jobs and internships by month 6, aiming to transition into a full-time role in tech.**Platform Questions**:* What’s the best way to learn: Udemy, YouTube, or other platforms?* Should I pay for courses on Udemy, or can I learn everything I need from free resources like YouTube or blogs?* Do I need certifications (e.g., from Coursera or Google) to get hired?* How long does it typically take from beginner to landing a job?* Has anyone here transitioned into tech through self-study?

I thought it would be a cool way to explore string matching and character encoding in Python — and I'd love to get your thoughts or improvements!## How the cipher works:- Each character is converted to its ASCII value.- That number (as a string) is searched for in the digits of π (ignoring the decimal point).- The **starting index** of the first match and the **length** of the match are recorded.- Each character is encoded as `index-length`, separated by hyphens.### Example:The ASCII value of `'A'` is `65`. If `65` first appears in π at index **7** (π = 3.141592653... → digits = 141592653...), then it's encoded as:```7-2```---## Here’s an encrypted message:```11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2```---## And here’s the Python code to decode it:```pythonfrom mpmath import mpmp.dps = 100005 # digits of πpi_digits = str(mp.pi)[2:]cipher_text = ( ""11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2"")segments = cipher_text.strip().split(""-"")index_length_pairs = [ (int(segments[i]), int(segments[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(segments), 2)]decoded_chars = []for index, length in index_length_pairs: ascii_digits = pi_digits[index - 1 : index - 1 + length] decoded_chars.append(chr(int(ascii_digits)))decoded_message = """".join(decoded_chars)print(decoded_message)```---### Tutorial FlairThis post demonstrates how to decode a custom cipher based on the digits of π.

Yes I said drag and drop.Most people would just put on YouTube on headphones and like zombies drag and drop all day. (Wish I was making this up). These resources were used to help students in exam preparation. In the folders there where hundreds of different PDFs, PowerPoints, MCQ questions as well as thousands of csv files.She was in a perpetually panic to do this for unclear reasons. I guess they powered her website and her entire business.At the time I had no programming knowledge yet instinctively knew it could be done better. In my total ignorance I tried some some scripts in Javascript until she caught me and yelled at me to do my real job. Later I was let go for not being productive enough.I asked some nearby devs for help but they said they were too busy.Today I know an intern could have a Python script doing the main stuff inside a day with os.system, glob, a few for loops, csv libraries etc, pandas. Stick a chron job and it’s daily routine. Even better use Powershell / awk, see or grep.Better yet move everything to the cloud.The entire process could have automated inside a month when all edge cases where accounted for. There were some devs on front end but I think they hated her so much they didn’t intervene or didn’t get paid enough to care. They all left very rapidly I don’t blame them for claiming ignorance. The owner / founder was a psychotic bint.One time, a dev got validly angry about something unrelated about a development process and suddenly next week he was gone for ""operational reasons"".She paid 10-15 people minimum wage to do this drag and dropping for 2-3 years to best of my knowledge.

But for the past few months, I’ve been doing tasks that have almost nothing to do with fullstack development:* Creating automations in low-code tools* Researching integrations with outdated platforms* Working in an 8-year-old PHP project (I had zero experience in PHP before)To make it worse, the PHP project has no proper security practices (e.g., passwords stored in plaintext in the database), and my suggestions for refactoring or rewriting it in our actual stack have been ignored.I'm currently split across 3 different projects and constantly bombarded with tasks from all sides. Meetings eat up a lot of time, and I’m falling behind. There’s barely any code review or mentorship, and I feel like I’m not learning or growing in the direction I want.On top of all that, I’m working for minimum wage in my country, which makes it even more discouraging -I’m putting in real effort but I feel like I’m getting very little in return, both in terms of compensation and career growth.I do have a backup plan (a non-IT job I could return to), but I’m hesitant to give up on development just yet. That said, the junior job market is rough, and I’m worried that if I leave now, I might end up searching for months before I find another dev position.So I'm stuck in this limbo — should I just accept that this is how things are in smaller companies and try to push through? Or is this a sign that I should look for a better environment?Would really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through something similar.

With that, my friend and I would like to know how long it would possibly take to learn sql if we were to dedicate the next few weeks into it.

1knud5r,How do a junior software engineer progress if there isn't a mentor in your company?,No_Driver372,learnprogramming,"**The question is as the title.**I just graduated and have limited experience in programming a legacy code project.I have been with the company for a month. Recently, they have started to push the project process because there are too many live projects that can't give the clients the final products.**Here is the dilemma I faced:**The project is complex and unfriendly to maintain and solve clients' new requirements. I have no idea how to use the breakpoint to figure out the problem and update new features for the clients' new requirements, because:1. The legacy project lacks **documents**, **a UML diagram**, **user instructions**, and an **ER diagram,** and leaves a complex programming structure. For example, the former software engineer, already quit, used the MVC structure to construct the basic project model, but they didn't follow the whole design pattern. They use SQL to do business logic (call several tables to insert or join a new table). The logic is quite similar but deployed in different classes.2. Moreover, they use their own inner library and API for certain functions in this project. Unfortunately, I can't find the source code because of limited assessments, or the source code is already encapsulation in the slt or lib files, which results in an ambiguous understanding of the whole project, especially the way that they transfer, store, and use their data in no matter website or hardware device.**Here is the way I try to solve:**1. Read the articles on the different engineering discussion platforms like CSDN, Stack Overflow, and research the code and library application definition to understand the basic know-why.2. Read NLog to find out the error in my project.3. Ask for the API source code assessment to research the way they transfer data.**But...**1. NLog can't find out the data problem while there is a thread function or a SQL transaction. The complex structure is also a challenge to locate bugs because it calls the same functions in different places (some of them are already abandoned in early versions, but are still left in the code).2. I have no other resources to trace the problem. It's probably because my knowledge is limited.**Here is the plan:**Keep doing it the way I mentioned above.**Is there any other suggestion except for quitting this job?**",11,0.92,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1knud5r/how_do_a_junior_software_engineer_progress_if/,2025-05-16 06:45:06,2025-05-19 01:45:33

1kpy798,Hobbyist bored out of my mind,nobodynoticethefly,learnprogramming,"Most of the programming I've done or learned has been in the context of robotics. From today to when I first touched Python to send signals to a Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins on a breadboard, it's been about 5 years. I rediscovered my love for programming after taking a bare-bones robotics class that just so happened to allow programming in Python. Since that ended, I've been trying to get back into the practice as a hobby only to discover I am bored out of my goddamn mind. I've been trying to learn to make little games, but even trying to recreate Pong in Lua makes my eyes glaze over less than 50 lines in. I can't look at an empty shell without getting a pit in my stomach. I like to look at source code to see what makes games tick, and it always feels like I'm learning something, but I always get that same numb feeling if I ever do anything beyond very simple tasks. Anything a more perceptive programmer would be able to see just seeps right through me. The last ""big"" project I ever completed generated bingo boards from a template with random numbers for a friend's project. It felt good to have a problem and slowly figure out how to solve it, and it was the most fun I've had programming in years. How do I get that feeling of euphoria again?

Most of the time, I ended up just following what was shown, without actually understanding *why* we were doing something a certain way. The basics never felt clear, and I was always left with questions like “why exactly is this done like this?”So now, I’ve decided to start fresh — this time with a proper focus on understanding things deeply, step by step. My main preference is to **read books or documentation** rather than watching videos. I feel like books allow me to go at my own pace, re-read things, and properly think about what I’m learning. I’ve also heard from others that books usually explain things in more detail and depth compared to many tutorials.Here’s how I’m planning to approach it:1. First, I want to learn **general programming concepts** — like how code works, what happens behind the scenes, how computers interpret programs, memory, logic, etc.2. Then I’ll move on to **Python**, relearn it properly with all the basics and get confident with it.3. After that, I want to get into **C++**, so that I can understand things on a lower level and get better with performance, system-level thinking, etc.I'm also planning to go into **data structures and algorithms** in between, once I have a decent hold on Python.So I’m mainly looking for **book recommendations** (or any really well-explained resources) for:* Basics of coding and general programming logic* Beginner to intermediate Python* DSA (preferably in Python, but general ones are okay too)* A good path to learn C++ after Python* Clean code, writing good code, and long-term coding habitsIf there are any **video courses that explain things really well and in depth**, I’m open to them too, but my first preference will always be books.If anyone here has gone through a similar journey or prefers reading like me, I’d love to hear your experience and suggestions.

A con of the new job is that even though the work is interesting it seems I would have to put alot more hours and have to re-create relationships"".It shows how for alot of people, they never make enough money. Im victim of this too. I just think that at a certain point deciding between 170k or 200k isn't much diffnerent. I dont think that 30k is going to change your life by that much. It's nice to have that extra money but why risk possibly hvaing terrible work life balance, leaving a job that you have known for years and values you to a job that you may need to spend years re-building that trust.

1kom4ek,The myth of the STEM talent shortage,SingleInSeattle87,cscareerquestions,"https://issues.org/stem-workforce-shortage-data-hira/Data doesn't lie. Why is whenever I hear justification for H1B and STEM-OPT everywhere on mainstream media, and even codified in US law, court transcripts and policy discussions: they keep saying there's a shortage of STEM workers, especially tech workers and we need more immigrants to fill those roles. Why do we hear this all the time, but it's never actually supported by data?Further, the department of labor actually has a list of jobs known to be in shortage and it doesn't use biased industry reports to determine them: it uses its own data as well as BLS data. This list is called ""Schedule A"" and it allows employers to fast track immigrant visas into these occupations without needing to go through the H1B process.But the INA has this weird thing where if a prospective job pays under $60k the employer must recruit US workers first, but it does not offer that protection to jobs that pay over $60k or if the job requires a masters degree. Congress justified this, as saying jobs paying over $60k or requiring a masters is a reasonable proxy to a job that is in shortage. But it's not. Schedule A has existed for just as long as the H1B came about in 1990. This makes me question the purpose of the H1B in the first place.If the DOL has the ability to analyze the labor market and determine certain jobs are in dire need, and need skilled immigrant labor, and our those on a dynamic list every year, why do we have ""H1B"" at all? Why can't the actual jobs in shortage, be listed, and the jobs not in shortage have to prove they couldn't find a qualified US citizen before hiring an immigrant?It seems congress relied on industry lobbying and their ""facts"" rather than our own DOL and BLS.",383,0.9,143,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kom4ek/the_myth_of_the_stem_talent_shortage/,2025-05-17 06:09:20,2025-05-19 01:45:34

Totally feel like I wasted my potential. How do I rebound, specifically how do I make myself undeniable to employers.People often say to create a project with users or contribute to open source. What do you guys think would be the best things to have on your resume nowadays with no work experience, but a CS degree from 2021. I have worked multiple different industries and jobs since then but idek if its worth keeping those on my resume as it relates nothing to tech. I have coding knowledge and basic projects but I know thats not enough. I feel like I need to focus my energy on something with more potential for a positive return aka a job lol.Here are some ideas Ive had , Making a “complex” project in a not popular language. For example specialize entirely on mobile code using something like swift and show a specialization in this language. I feel like everyone’s learning java and python, myself included so would learning a specialized language be more desirable? Or should I just stick with something like a MERN stack and pump out projects that are “more complex” with more universal technologies. If contributing to open source, idek how to put that into my resume? “I added three new functions that reduced latency by .5 ms” . Could I make this its own section where I say I have contributed to 10+ open source projects with a link to my github for them to check themselves. Would focusing on open source for experience to pad my resume be a good idea?Are there any certifications worth getting? AWS or Azure fundamentals? Agile or scrum certs? Cisco or A+ IT certs (even though I dont want to do IT) Anything for hiring managers to look more fondly on me?What are ways to become undeniable to employers that can be achieved through hard work, that most others arnt going to put the time into?I know its alot, appreciate any responses!

1klbjft,"PIP'd for not talking enough in meetings, apparently",cscqthrowaway16661,cscareerquestions,"I was hired at this company a few months ago, it's a larger startup with a few hundred employees, and I got in via the referral of a friend who works there, although he's in a different department. I was hired as a senior SWE but the impression I'm getting is that they basically wanted me to be a lead SWE instead. We have a principal on our team as well as a few juniors and midlevel, and essentially, they hired me not as an IC but I guess more of a manager of the juniors? The principal is too busy on multiple other teams and projects to really participate in our team, although he does sometimes.This all came to a head when a few weeks ago on the 1:1 the manager said I wasn't acting like I was the second in command so to speak, but I told them I felt hired as more of an IC and for the past few months before that, no one had communicated anything regarding managerial type work at all. Nevertheless, we agreed on some action items like me being more present in the Slack, doing more code reviews, mentoring the juniors (all of which I was doing already but I just started documenting them in a work log then), as well as creating tickets and assigning and delegating work, even if that means I do less overall IC work myself (but, isn't that what the managers and scrum masters are supposed to do? Why am I responsible for that part?). The 1:1 the week after that, they presented a PIP. The PIP itself is quite vague, it wants me to take more ""ownership"" and ""leadership"" of the project as I'm the only one on the team who can since the principal is so busy, part of which is talking more in meetings apparently. When I presented the action items I was already doing, they said it was a good start but I needed to do more, but they were very vague on what that actually meant, they couldn't really define it at all since it had nothing to do with concrete performance metrics like ""finished or didn't finish X tickets per sprint.""It said PIP on the document but I didn't sign anything and they didn't ask me to, they didn't even CC HR like a traditional PIP would be. It's a 30 day one so I have to improve in the next 4 weeks apparently but I honestly don't get what they even want from me and every time I ask, they can't tell me anything more concrete. Essentially I think they hired me as a senior SWE when they really wanted to hire a lead (or even an engineering manager), and now they're trying to make me do lead/principal level work for senior pay (I'd need probably another 50k for that to happen). It all seems so sudden, like only a couple weeks ago they tell me about these sudden new ""performance"" problems when the several months before since I joined, there had been no complaints in the 1:1s.So now I'm just injecting myself in the meetings and asking questions no matter how dumb they sound, and it seems like the manager is pleased but it's all just so dumb, they literally said that they don't know if I understand things when I'm not talking in the meetings; I'm not talking so I can listen to what the more experienced team members are saying (we have some outside contractors and the full time devs were hired to eventually replace them, but in domain knowledge, the contractors know more than we do, so I also think the manager is comparing us to them too).Edit: I think people here are assuming I'm not doing senior level ticket cutting and talking often to the principal on architecture and code choices, etc, I am, it's that they seem to want even more people management type work in that they want me to essentially manage the work of the juniors and check in with them every couple days which is fine and which is something I've been doing but somehow they want even more management out of me.",320,0.89,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1klbjft/pipd_for_not_talking_enough_in_meetings_apparently/,2025-05-13 02:59:04,2025-05-19 01:45:34

Then he asked - When can you join - I told him, give me 2 weeks to think about it, the CEO said No, give me an early response. Then the CTO told him to atleast tell me about the company. Then he talked about the company. After it, I was desperate so I joined it.First day - They didn't even gave me any offer letter, just onboarded me on their payroll system, they didn't even gave me company laptops. So I started the day at 10 am, get every system access(github, backend) access around 11am-12 pm, they have already assigned me a ticket. Around 3 pm, the CTO asked me whether I am done, which I said No because they have hired me as an AI engineer position and their work/tickets assigned were for backend development. Then CEO came around 5 pm, started asking me whether I am done, then he further asked me around 7 pm- How much percentage I am done of the first ticket. I was really exhausted after 7:30 pm so I left, the ticket was still assigned. Also, second ticket was also assigned around nighttime to me.Meanwhile, at the same night, he called the other developer and asked him- How was my performance on the first day.I thought a bit at the same night, and then I told them I can't work there. All of my friends are saying that I should have stayed there, and I am behaving like an entitled Gen-Z and startups are run like this only and I should have collected atleast few paychecks.

I make a sizeable amount of money, I work hybrid, and I get plenty of vacation. And yet I'm miserable.As the layoffs started, the company culture immediately rotted. I found myself pushing back on others' nonsensical, perf-driven demands. I was making decisions not for technical excellence but for less stressful approvals. I was constantly fighting off attempts to steal scope or credit. Then a coworker sabotaged my work and advertised to L7's how he already had a great plan to fix ""my"" mistakes. (He was promoted for this.)**I realized that a career in tech is not about good work or good skills. It's about politics, and it gets worse the more senior you get.** I spoke to some mid-level and senior friends, and they've all told me the same, with many of them questioning their careers too.I started not caring anymore about scalable architectures or sensible design decisions. I went looking for other jobs, then I realized nearly every big company is like this now, not just Amazon. I also realized quickly that all my cold applications were getting trashed without a look; only recruiter calls mattered. (Condolences to all the entry-level folks, it really is rough out there.)**More importantly, I started questioning the point of it all.** I pursued tech because I liked coding and designing. I liked the idea of working with others to build great things. And I liked the prospect of working anywhere in the world, and not being tied to a single company.But above all I wanted to make an impact. I wanted to build software that improved millions of lives. I planned to work my way up to senior in the private sector, save a lot of money, then take a pay cut to go work for the government or a public contractor. Then Elon Musk destroyed that path.Now, I was studying so hard to get an offer to do... what? Squeeze out 0.02% more ad revenue? Get more people addicted to gambling? Exploit more vulnerable children? Or build tools to let other companies better do those things? Because that's what most big tech companies are, and why they pay the big bucks.In college, I was a premed as well as a CS major.

Over the summer my team hired some interns and this one annoyed me to no end. Every word that came out of his mouth was filtered through a layer of buzzwords and asskissing to the point i had to mute my audio while he's talking. I counted down the day before he left and thought that was the end of it. The first workday of the new year is when our boss announced that this intern would be returning fulltime. My first issue with him was when i refactored a file in our codebase that he was also working on. He released a PR that undid everything i fixed in my refactor, but i was patient and told him when there are merge conflicts it's expected to meet with the other author to resolve it together. This happened just before i took a week of PTO and where i returned to find he blindly pushed his PR overwritting all my changes. My refactor got deprioritized for a couple weeks, but i finally got to remaking my changes only for him to try and do the same thing before being caught by another developer. At first all my complaints about him were about his personality, but after seeing more of his pull requests its become obvious he doesn't know how to code and is just copy/pasting AI responses without any thought as long as they accomplish the job.

1klkljz,"US Devs: Check Your ""The Work Number"" Report",Candid-Progress-1184,cscareerquestions,"When writing your resume and negotiating pay, be mindful that Equifax operates a database called The Work Number that contains info on past employers, titles, pay, etc for a huge number of employees in the US. I recently discovered my report was wrong: it claimed I was a 'payroll specialist' rather than a 'computer systems engineer' at a previous employer because the person filling out the form put their own title instead of mine... About half my previous employers have entered data into it, and I have a feeling it might be integrated into modern HR tooling and ERP systems.Definitely check your report and make sure no one jacked up your previous title, pay, etc. Receiving a copy of any consumer credit report, including these ones, is free. My current employer tells them about every single one of my paychecks, so keep in mind future employers might literally be able to see when you got your raises too. If you're as cautious as I am, you probably want to make sure the titles listed on your resume at least bear a passing resemblance to the ones in the report so it doesn't set off alarm bells for HR folks who don't understand tech title equivalence. If you're considering overemployment, note that both roles could show up on the report.There are many other organizations that claim to provide info like this: I contacted the top 100 and no one else had any data on me, so I think The Work Number is far and away the most popular.It's possible to freeze your report just like any other credit report, but keep in mind this might look suspicious.Anyway, just be mindful that this stuff is out there and people have easy access to it. I think employers are technically supposed to tell you when the contents of a credit report are used against you, but it's impossible to enforce since they can just say nothing. You can get bad data removed for free as long as the employer either agrees it was wrong or just doesn't respond when Equifax contacts them.Stay safe and aware out there, folks.EDIT: Turns out they still have to get your consent before pulling this info, which occurs as part of the background check phase. Thanks to u/mediocreDev313 for the clarification!EDIT2: I just pulled up my report to double-check what all is on it. The report can include:Union affiliation, worker's comp award dates, reason for termination, base pay, overtime, commission, bonuses, holiday pay, pension income, severance, vested stock, stick and vacation pay, tips, hours worked for each individual pay period, garnishments, cafeteria plan fees, next projected date and amount of pay increase, last date and amount of pay increase, payroll deduction for insurance coverage, reasons for insurance ineligibility, insurance coverage level, number of covered dependents on insurance, and COBRA participation.EDIT3: Here's the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's list of consumer reporting agencies, contact details, and links to freeze your various reports: [files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb\_consumer-reporting-companies-list\_2023.pdf](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-reporting-companies-list_2023.pdf)",117,0.93,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1klkljz/us_devs_check_your_the_work_number_report/,2025-05-13 12:25:40,2025-05-19 01:45:34
1knfuzq,Manager is going to lay off a colleague and told me not to tell him about it. I feel conflicted.,sola_ine,cscareerquestions,I work as a vendor/on a contract with a big tech company. Our team is made up of 1 FTE and 3 of us contractors working under her. Today my manager pulled me into a call to tell me her contracting budget has been cut (I had a mini heart attack) and she has decided to let one of our team members go. He joined late last year and is technically still new to the team. He’s been working on some new things and she wants me to start learning everything he’s working on (telling him it’s just as backup) as she’s going to let him go next quarter. I’m pretty shaken by this.. the way she mentioned it felt too casual. Her exact words were “between the two of you I’ve decided to let him go”. Our third teammate who is also not FTE is her “special” employee - and to his defence he really is talented. I know professionally I need to just get work done but I feel like I’m stuck in an icky situation. A part of me feels like telling this guy he’s going to be laid off but I know professionally that might hurt me and that this is just part and parcel of corporate life. How do I deal with this feeling? Would it be wise to let my colleague know - even via subtle hints?

1knzvpt,"Don't Get Categorized as The ""Person That Always Helps"" or The ""Go-To Person""",EngineerDoge00,cscareerquestions,"Three and a half years ago I graduated college and was pulled into a startup as the only US dev in a US startup for a full-stack position. The other two devs before me were in India. I was the only dev in the US (during working hours) for over a year before finally getting a second US full-stack dev (then a third and fourth front-end). Today, the small startup where I knew everyone's' name ended up getting bought out and had money pumped into it that ended up making it grow exponentially. Now I only see maybe 5% of who work in my company regularly. Because of my circumstanced, I have been categorized as the ""Go-To Person"" for getting stuff fixed or done in my company during the working hours.Before we were bought out, I already had that reputation, being the longest standing dev on the US side. I would get pings from people every couple hours that needed assistance in something they were working on, or needed someone with ""expert knowledge"" on the software in a quick meeting. I was able to balance this with my own work decent enough to still be able to get my work done in a reasonable time. But since our side of the company got exponentially bigger since being bought out, now I get pings ever 15 - 30 min some days and my schedule has been loaded with meetings that require that dev with ""expert knowledge"", even though most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I'm good at figuring it out though).Because of this, my productivity is shot. Tickets that should take 2 - 3 days are taking a week or more sometimes. I've talked to my manager over the last year about this and we have made an ""Ask a Dev"" channel for questions that aren't urgent (which has filtered out the obvious and obviously dumb questions that are asked from being asked), urgent stuff now gets filtered through the scrum master which she divides up between me and the only other full-stack that works during the workday, and we've preached, multiple times to not contact any dev directly, even though this only lasts for a little while before everyones ""Super Urgent!"" problem finds its way to my teams chat directly... again...So take this as a warning. Don't become the ""Go-To Person"" of your company/division/team if you want to keep your sanity. Edit: Spelling/grammer errors.

In 2006 I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in computer engineering, but I hated my classes (especially the EE circuits and signal processing ones) and was totally burned out by the time I graduated. Instead of joining the formal workforce, I've spent the last 20 years being an unpaid family caregiver for sick relatives. I literally haven't written a single line of code since graduation, and the only programming languages I've used were BASIC as a kid, Perl during an internship between high school and college, and C and C++ during school - and C++ was only taught as ""C with classes"" with no mention of the Standard Template Library or any other library besides ""iostream.h"", so if I wanted to try to get a job in tech, I'd need to learn something people actually use today, such as Python, Java, or perhaps even R for data science and statistics. (I'm within commuting distance of NYC and the finance industry hires a lot of computer people.) I've also used SQL but forgotten almost all of it.Anyway, all the sick relatives I'd been taking care of died last year (including my wife :sad_but_relieved_face:), so I need to find something else to do with my life. I have enough financial leeway that I won't actually need to work for quite a while, and I thought that if I wanted to pursue programming as a career, a (hopefully reputable) bootcamp might be a good option, because it would help me get up to speed on modern development and create a portfolio to show to potential employers. I'm also not particularly self-motivated or disciplined, so trying to learn on my own, without a structured program that has deadlines, wouldn't be my first choice of approach; if going to a physical classroom is an option, I would really prefer it over an online-only program because I'd be less likely to flake.

1knxfuz,Got paid for doing nothing TWO JOBS in a row - how common is that?,internet-person-777,cscareerquestions,"# tldr: Twice in the past year I was hired in companies (employed on full time and paid) while doing absolutely nothing (never put on any project).Hi, I'm backend/fullstack developer with experience of just few years.Last year I spent 6 months doing absolutely NOTHING in the big IT company from India. I was hired as developer in a project for a client from finance/fintech industry. The project was postponed or never started, and I've spent my entire time in there doing absolutely nothing, however I was told that they will find replacement project for me eventually, then 1 month before the end of my employment contract I was suggested to look for another job as they won't extend my employment. Can't say that I didn't expect that after few months of doing nothing, but I was really pissed off. At the time I could already be part of some nice project, get the know-how and be really productive in some other company.**2024 was my worst year in the industry in terms of looking for a new job, I was unemployed for few months after that company.**Now my current position - the same story. Very similiar IT Indian company, I won't give you any names but there is a few of them so you can probably figure it out. I was hired as backend dev at the beginning of the year, and so far I had few internal interviews for the various projects, but I don't even get feedback from them.**As I learned from my previous experience I have found another job as the contractor in the bank and I'm doing great here.**My employment in the do-nothing-company terminates in few months and I'm not resigning until they actually try put me on a project. I don't feel like I am cheating because this is second time that someone wastes my time. I'm still a beginner in the industry and in this very crowded market on every single interview everyone asks me about my experience in all the companies I've been working for - **I don't want to lie on my resume, but I also don't want to tell my interviewer that professionally I was not engaged in any project/team since the end of 2023, and why I am jumping between companies after barely 6 months of employment.**So, do you have experience like this? I know that sometimes you just sit on the bench as a contractor, but this is other situation and often after some time you just stop getting paid. Here I was full time employed, got paid and contributed absolutely nothing, twice. I probably won't even mention my current do-nothing-company on my CV.I'm sick of companies that are looking for developer while not having any position for them. And I completely understand that this is kind of a privilige nowadays and sounds like a dream job for many people, but in IT every year of your experience counts, and If you was hired on paper but got nothing from it, then it's going to turn out terribly for you in the future. Of course in both of those companies I tried to utilize my time and try to learn/work with new things on my own, but this is not the same.

I would probably get a part-time job in the meantime to help myself but not take so much of my time. Thinking about this since I don't want to get stuck deeper into a career that I loathe - I am quite miserable albeit financially secure, and leveling up in an area of my interest is more important to me than money beyond basic survival.

Make them either descope work, extend deadlines, or hire more people if they have unrealistic deadlines. Do not work overtime for a company that is not going to pay you extra to do so and will lay you off even if you work extra time for them.Second, I think most companies would be better off if they automated away most of these positions.

1kpjo1q,My internship is offering me an ambitious full-time role and I’m nervous,motuwed,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Interned at a non-tech company for 1.5 years, recently got offered a part-time-to-full-time software dev role on their AI use case team. Super excited, but nervous since there’s no real junior dev pipeline or formal training, and I’m jumping straight from student to full-time dev in a small team that mostly hires experienced people.I interned at this company for about 1.5 years with 8 moths full-time and the rest part-time.During that time, I worked on a pretty wide range of stuff: manually testing new software, creating architectural diagrams, documenting codebases, and toward the end, helping a new AI team build web apps with AI-driven features.It’s been about two months since the internship ended. When I wrapped up, there was talk of a full-time offer closer to graduation (which is in August). But recently, they reached out and said they’d actually like to offer me a position now—starting part-time, then moving to full-time after I graduate. I asked about the role, and they said “AI Developer,” which basically just means I’d be a software dev on the AI use case team (so not data science or ML).I’m super excited because I loved the team environment and like most of us our dream is software dev. That said, I’m also nervous.This company isn’t a tech company, it’s actually pretty far from one. And because of that, the structure is a bit different. There’s not really a formal junior engineer pipeline or training program. Most people get hired with several years of experience already under their belt. I do know a couple folks who came in a year or two after graduating, but even then, it was through a setup where they’d already been doing independent contract work for a while.I know I’m a strong developer, and I learn quickly, but I also know I benefit a lot from structure and guidance. Obviously working with the team towards the end of my internship did give me SOME experience, but I still feel like the jump from student to full time dev is massive and I’m worried about working in an environment that might not have that change in the forefront of their mind. Especially given that the team I’d join only has a handful of developers (maybe 3).",14,0.84,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kpjo1q/my_internship_is_offering_me_an_ambitious/,2025-05-18 13:12:48,2025-05-19 01:45:34

1knlhub,Roblox PHD ML internship reflection,vanishing_grad,cscareerquestions,"Roblox PhD Internship interview reflectionI'm a third year PhD student at a t20, no visa sponsorship required. Generally work on applying LLM and graph neural networks to social science problems. Applied for a PhD research intern position.1. Got OA, it was dumb as fuck. Had to download and play games in Roblox. They're basically iq tests where you had to do like factory optimization and design cars to cross obstacle courses or whatever. I was just like fuck it and got basically a 0 on the first game and gave up on the rest because it wasn't worth the effort lol. 2. Recruiter schedules a call with me and basically tells me I'm moving on to the interview calls. Tells me to just redo the OAs for completion and basically that the scores don't matter. I guess they do resume screening before OA results and if your experience is relevant enough they don't care lmao. 3. Get a crappy score on the second game, and third OA segment is a bunch of behavioral scenarios, like ""your boss is wrong about something, how do you approach the situation"". No coding OA, interestingly. 4. Had a thirty minute behavioral round with pretty standard questions, ""tell me about a project where you had a different approach than stakeholders wanted"", etc etc. 5. 45 minute coding round. Really easy? I feel like I've seen other internship reports where people are getting LC hards, maybe they make it easier for the research positions. Question was basically valid parentheses but you also had to handle quote strings. Seemed like it focused more on like communication and figuring out how to handle edge cases. 6. Then they scheduled a ML deep dive with the hiring manager. 1 hour, I basically presented a few of my papers and they asked pretty detailed questions about how I made specific training/dataset/evaluation questions. Lots of reflection on what I could've done differently etc. I really enjoyed this round, it felt like a very good way to measure expertise and ML depth. 7. Whole process took place over 2-3 weeks, very efficient, quick feedback and scheduling of next rounds. I got the official offer 3 business days after the last round. Overall very good process! Much easier than I expected, but it's possible they identified a research fit and wanted to hurry the process along a bit lol. If they didn't make people do the silly games, I'd say it was a nearly perfect process.",15,0.9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1knlhub/roblox_phd_ml_internship_reflection/,2025-05-15 22:37:14,2025-05-19 01:45:34

I maintain middleware backend web services for my large finance company's mobile apps (mobile BFF architecture) in TypeScript. I've gotten good at TS, can implement whatever's given to me, the job's stable and secure. I'm fortunate in many ways.The problem is... the architecture means I've got no experience with DBs. Not even ORMs. We don't really roll our own infra, rarely we'll change an IAC config file somewhere. No gRPC. No real system design skills to speak of. Node+TS on the backend is also a weird place to be in this market where companies want you to fit to a T, it's in the intersection of front and backend.We basically get together, talk about the future states of some parts of the mobile app, get the data from downstream services and just add business logic so that our REST endpoints have XYZ fields. It's gotten too easy, I don't feel like I'm growing and I'm worried about the skills I have vs those I *should* have on paper. The current market is also making it hard to switch jobs to get more breadth/depth.

Maybe it’s my job search strategy, or maybe there’s something off with my applications. But after submitting somewhere between 3,500 and 5,000 applications over the last eight months, I’m burned out.A few months ago, I was still getting some traction, mostly unpaid or internship roles (I’m in one now). But lately, even those have dried up, despite leveling up my skills. Eight months ago, I had a solid foundation in Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, along with frameworks like React and Spring Boot. Since then, I’ve added multi-cloud experience, DevOps, and AI concepts like RAG.Very rarely I’d gone through complete interview processes: submissions, interviews, take-homes, technical rounds, only to get ghosted or declined. One company was at least honest and told me I needed another year of experience, and that their policy prevented them from hiring me.I recently got into a strong Master’s program.

This has been my first job out of university (and first job ever in my life) so I've never had to quit a job and it's heavily stressing me out. I joined when there was like 10 people and now we've grown to about 25 in the last 4 years. I'll also be the first one to ever voluntarily leave the company. Everyone in the company is an amazing human. I've had no issues, no politics, nothing. Reading this sub I feel like my experience has been incredibly rare. They respect our time and never have asked me to stay past 5 and they've never questioned me if I've needed to take a day off or time off to do errands or whatever. I'm also friendly with all the C-suite folks and I've been to our CEOs house and we literally send memes to each other.With all that said, the only reason I'm leaving is money. I make more than the median but I'm pretty underpaid and the company is fully bootstrapped (0 investors) so I know they can't offer to pay me more money. The new role is at FAANG+ and will almost 2.5x my salary and in this economy, I need all the money I can get.I just feel so bad because it was always implied that we would all stay till we sold the company. The growth has been pretty good but not nearly what they were expecting. I think they're still well on their way to sell the company but this was a golden opportunity that I got so I signed with them.With all that said, how do I go about it? I plan to either tell them tomorrow (Fri) or on Monday. On one hand, I don't want to 'ruin' their weekend and feel like I should say it on Monday but on the other hand, I want to get it off my chest. We're also a remote company so I was thinking of asking people to hop on a call starting with my manager, then CEO, then rest of the team, then formally tell the whole company (or whatever the CEO suggests). Does that sound reasonable? Also, how should I go about explaining the ""why""? Should I just straight up say it's the money? They may ask/wonder why I never asked for a raise but I know there's 0% chance they can match the offer so should I mention my new salary or mention that it's over double what I'm making? Should I also mention that I'm willing to make this a smooth transition and I'm willing to continue to work more than the needed two weeks? My new job starts in 5 weeks so I have quite a bit of time.I really want to leave on good terms because I love these people and I want to stay in touch with them if possible.Basically any help in wording all this and advice on how to leave on good terms will be appreciated.

1kmlvqm,"I'm the only dev in a small firm, with a CS degree and 2 YoE overall. I think I'm going to have to try to jump ship after only 3 months in my new job. Any advice / suggestions?",double-happiness,cscareerquestions,"I'm 52, not from a STEM background and only graduated in CS at age 49 (full backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11g5wjf/graduated_in_cs_at_age_49_but_ive_ended_up_doing/)). After circa 800 applications and about a dozen interviews I finally got a role with the UK Civil Service for nearly 2 years, initially as a Trainee Software Engineer on a fixed-term contract at £22K, but managed to get a slight promotion into another fixed-term contract as Junior Software Engineer and was on £27K by the time my contract was due to expire. (There was no chance of renewal as it was maternity cover). I made over 100 applications but only had one offer, this time as Software Engineer for a small firm in the renewable energy installation sector. The range was stated to be £35K - £50K; they only offered £36K but with no other offers and only 1 week left of my contract I thought I had better take what I could get. (Worth bearing in mind that AFAIK Scotland and the North doesn't tend to offer anything like the salaries one tends to get in London anyway though).On my very first day they made 5 people redundant but I was told not to worry as my salary was paid for out of grant money. Obviously that raises the question what's going to happen when the grant money runs out. I should say I am the only SWE and there are no IT staff at all, just installers, operations, and sales people basically. My supervisor and myself didn't hit it off very well and things were a bit tense trying to work out exactly what they wanted me to do. It was all quite nebulous and completely different from the Civil Service as you might expect. No tickets, no version control in place, basically just 'here's your laptop and this is what we want'. They want me to build an API aggregator that brings together API services from a number of different renewable energy manufacturers (that's what the grant money is for). I was sharing an office with an 'actual' engineer (i.e. an electrical engineer), but he left for another firm that was going to give him better training / certs. Seemingly they wouldn't give him a £3K raise and amazingly it turned out he was on even less than me, even though he had far more responsibility and went out on jobs and all sorts.I have built this whole web application for them in TS/JS/Node/React/Express. I have used a certain amount of AI (mainly Claude, also Perplexity) to help me along, but in fairness I now have no senior dev to turn to for advice. I have actually found it helps my learning quite a bit and I ask it tons of learning questions instead of just blindly copy-pasting. In fact I sometimes tell it *not* to give me any code, but just advice/guidance. I have pushed it all to a GitHub repo but so far it has not been deployed. It is about 100 or so files, thousands of lines of code, takes in 3 different APIs, does both local and browser DB stuff, and has a lot of unit tests written in Jest. If I say so myself it is pretty neat and everyone who has seen it has been impressed. It is dead fast and has a lot of error handling. The UI is only so-so as that's not really my forte, but I've seen worse.The problems are many though. The low salary, almost total lack of job security, no bank holidays (WTF?), and now my supervisor has really started to become quite unpleasant. Yesterday he totally bit my head off because I had the temerity to ask if I had now got through my probation OK, since that was due to finish on the 10th. He accused me of being 'irritable', said I must have been 'dwelling on it', and that apparently I should have been 'proactive' and mentioned it earlier. The last I think is total nonsense as I was patiently waiting for him to tell me the probation was done. To my mind it could have come across as quite premature to bring it up prior to the date. When I showed him some code I had written he said 'there must be an easier way of doing it than that', which I thought was tantamount to saying I had gone about it the long way. OFC he never stated what the easier way might be. Seemingly he did some MATLAB back in the day but doesn't like other languages because they use 0-indexing for arrays (SMH). Yesterday he came in, I asked him how he was, but he didn't reciprocate and said nothing at all to me for 3-4 hours, literally not a word. It was only when I asked him about the probation he then kicked off.The owner (who sits in the office next to mine) is fine and I get along with him no problem. The other office staff are OK but I feel totally out of it as they are focussed on sales and installations, and I just have almost no sense of being part of a team like I at least somewhat had in CS. There I had so little to do, I felt like a substitute sat on the bench on the sidelines, but at least I was around other devs who were mainly very supportive in my 'learning journey'. Being an older entrant into the IT sector (I couldn't even afford a PC until I got a hand-me-down in my late 20s) is not always easy, as you might imagine.So WTH am I gonna do? Try to brush up [my CV](https://i.imgur.com/JzEFPuP.png) and just start applying, I guess? Trying to move on after 3 months seems like a big ask. There are only limited opportunities in southern Scotland and fully remote, and I am not at all willing to sell my home (again), especially after only 7 months here. I use all [these sites](https://i.imgur.com/g8ggTlb.png) and find LinkedIn never even gets me so much as an interview. I have previously sent a lot of CVs to recruiters and built up a quite big list of their contacts.

1klqtq7,Offered a team lead position,Huge-Leek844,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I’m currently an embedded software engineer at a large multinational, but for the past year or so I’ve mostly been doing quality and verification work—not actual development. Recently, I was offered a team lead role for a QA/verification-focused project. On paper, it sounds like a promotion, but in reality:It’s still not development work, which is what I actually want to be doing.The team is pretty demotivated, and the general vibe is low energy.There’s a 5-hour timezone difference, making collaboration and leadership more challenging.I’m also feeling super demotivated myself and have started interviewing elsewhere because I feel stuck and like I’m not growing anymore.I appreciate being considered for leadership, but I don’t think this is the right move for me, especially with everything else going on. How can I say no to this without raising red flags or burning bridges.Is there a chance to prove myself and get better oportunidades internally?Would it be better to just accept it temporarily while I job hunt, or is there a way to professionally decline without torpedoing my standing?",6,0.88,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1klqtq7/offered_a_team_lead_position/,2025-05-13 16:46:10,2025-05-19 01:45:34
1klggds,What resources (paid or free) are best to study System Design as a mid-level software dev?,non_NSFW_acc,cscareerquestions,"I want to get into FAANG/MAANG companies as a mid-level software developer (full-stack).

I would like to make sure I make the right decision financially and not waste any time.**Some website/resources/courses I found, I will mention here**: SystemDesignSchool, HelloInterview, ByteByteGo, DesignGurus Grokking the Modern System Design Interview, Educative Grokking the Modern System Design Interview, DonneMartin - System Design Primer.**Does anyone have any suggestions on what resource is the best to use to study and go through and learn from?**If it helps, I am a mid-level full stack software developer aiming for FAANG, and I would like to ideally cover and go through System Design - at least the main stuff - in 2-3 weeks (I can always practice more after timeframe that too, if needed).

1kle15m,Is offshoring/AI impacting some parts of tech more than other's?,False_Secret1108,cscareerquestions,Are the rise of AI and offshoring being more disruptive in some parts of tech more than others? For example I assume web development in general can be offshored easily since it's on the web whereas I imagine embedded development would be more difficult to offshore. I also imagine things like cybersecurity and devops aren't something that you want someone outside of your country to generally touch for security reasons. What about QA/SDET?

I enjoy going into the office because of them.* The work is easy as I gotten comfortable with the codebase and processes. The industry is in education so it's been fun and interesting through it all.**New Position:** * 130k Salary* Hybrid - In office Tue, Wed and Thu* It would be about a 45 minute - 1 hour commute both ways* It's up in the air if I would get along with my team as much I did in my current position. I've met a couple people I would be working with in the interviews but honestly I won't know this until I'm there. * The work will definitely be more tedious and difficult based off what was said in the interviews. The industry is in insurance and I feel like it might be a bit more dull compared to my current position.What would you guys do in this position? I think the longer commute and the extra day in office will take a toll on me since I have gotten so used to the schedule I have now.

1kncpq1,Stuck with some seriously old code bases but not in a position to switch. Advice?,mellow_cellow,cscareerquestions,"I have around 4 years of on the job experience as a c# dev. My new company I've been with for about 6 months works on some legacy tech and move slow to new tech. Web forms, dotnet 4.7, TFVC, and lots and lots of projects. It's... Confusing. And I'm still feeling quite new. I'm struggling to find information that isn't fifteen years out of date and that doesn't start with ""find somewhere else to work"". As nice as that sounds, I'm a bit stuck and I suddenly lost my last job so I'm a bit attached to this dry land I've found. We're thinking of moving to Git for the first time in a few years, and this has earned complaints from some members of our team, for reference on where we're at. I'm not opposed to making an escape plan, but I have JUST started, and it was a scary few months of silence when I lost my job so I'm not eager for that again. I don't hate my team, but I don't see things getting better anytime soon, and I'm scared of getting stuck with this tech (I do like C#, but I hate so much of the process of working with legacy tech like this). Any suggestions or thoughts on keeping my sanity? I know there's always the thought that the grass is greener elsewhere, but this is already weighing on me and I constantly feel a communication gap with my boss over these things. Then again, I like them all. And abandoning them when I just got started and they've already paid for some books to get me up to speed. I appreciate the lax environment.
