1orwym9,Polars has been crushing it for me … but is it time to go full Data Warehouse?,Particular-Goat-7579,dataengineering,"Hello Polars lads,Long story short , I hopped on the Polars train about 3 years ago. At some point, my company needed a data pipeline, so I built one with Polars. It’s been running great ever since… but now I’m starting to wonder what’s next — because I need more power. :high_voltage:We use GCP, and process hourly over 2M data points arriving in streaming to pub/sub, then saved to cloud storage.

1owxk6b,Why is transforming data still so expensive,Hofi2010,dataengineering,"In an enterprise setting we spend $100k+, in bigger orgs even $xM+ for transforming data at scale. To create the perfect data source for our business partners. Which often or most of the time is under utilized. To do this we use a data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake) or lakehouse (Databricks, ADF, …). The new platform made it easier to handle the data, but it comes with a cost. They are designed for big data (TB’s to PB’s of data), but arguably in most organization most data sources are a fraction of this size. Those solutions are also designed to lock you in with proprietary compute and data formats as they say necessary to provide the best performance. Whenever our Redshift Datawarehouse struggled to keep up AWS’s answer was, “oh your cluster head node is not keeping up with the demand you should upgrade to the next bigger instance type” problem solved and cost was doubled. But now with cheap object storage and open data formats like iceberg it should be possible to get the same performance than Snowflake, Redshift and Databricks at a fraction of the cost. But in order to transform your data you need compute and your data need to be ingested into the compute, transformed and written back in the transformed format to your datalake. The object storage and network speed between storage and compute is usually your bottleneck here. I made some experiments with different EC2 instances and duckdb (just saying I am not affiliated with the product). I had a 85GB timeseries data stream (iceberg) that needed to be pivoted and split into 100 individual tables. On a regular general purpose compute instance t3g.2xlarge that took about 6-7 hours to complete. Then I used i4g memory optioned instances with more memory and network bandwidth up 25 Gbps and it halfed the time. Then I found these new instances network optimized c8gn and they managed to do all 100 tables in 20 mins. Compare this to databricks (Databricks was reading from s3), which took 3 hours. Databricks cost for this transform was $9.38 and the EC2 instance did it for $1.70. So huge savings with a bit of engineering.Wanted to share this and wanted to hear some stories from others in their pursuit of cheaper data transformation options",48,0.88,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1owxk6b/why_is_transforming_data_still_so_expensive/,2025-11-14 14:13:07,2025-11-15 01:37:39

For example, say I’m reading a 1 TB CSV file — Spark somehow figures out all the column names and types *before* I call any action like `show()` or `count()`. So how is that possible if it’s supposed to be lazy? Does it partially read metadata or some sample of the file eagerly?Also, another question that came to mind — both Python (Pandas) and Spark can store data in memory, right? So apart from distributed computation across multiple nodes, what else makes Spark special?

And what would make me confident in such tool?Since dbt became popular, we can roughly define a transformation as:* a SELECT statement* a schema definition (optional, but nice to have)* some logic for materialization (table, view, incremental)* data quality tests* and other elements (semantics, unit tests, etc.)If we had a standard we could move a transformation from one tool to another, but also have mutliple tools work together (interoperability).Honestly, I initially wanted to start building a tool, but I forced myself to sit down and first write a standard for data transformations. Quickly, I realized the specification also needed to include tests and UDFs (this is my pet peeve with transformation tools, UDF are part of my transformations).It’s just an initial draft, and I’m sure it’s missing a lot.

1ox84x9,"Sanity check: am I crazy for feeling like my ""data engineering"" position is a dead end?",lostmyway573,dataengineering,"Obvious throwaway account is obvious.My job is a data engineer for a medium-ish sized company, been here for just over 4 years. This is my first ""data"" job, but I learned a good bit about SQL in previous roles. Our department / my team manages our BI data warehouse, and we have a couple of report developers as well. When I read and study about modern data engineering practices, or modern development practices / AI usage, I feel like I'm a caveman rubbing sticks together while watching flying cars go by me every day. I'm considering switching to a DevOps position in my company because I enjoy working with Linux and smaller applications, but also because I feel like this position is a complete dead end - I have no room to exert creativity or really learn anything on the job because of the reasons I'll detail below.Until about 2 years ago, our data warehouse was basically one large SQL database (MS SQL). Standard Kimball-style facts/dimensions, with a handful of other nonstandard tables scattered here and there. We also have a few separate databases that act as per-department ""sandboxes"" for business analysts to build their own stuff, but that's a whole separate story. The whole thing is powered by SSIS packages; OLTP data transformed to a star schema in most cases. Most of it appears to be developed by people who learned SSIS before SQL, because in almost every process, the business logic is baked into transformations instead of scripts or code. I expected this from a legacy setup, and shortly after I started working here it became known that we were going to be migrating to the cloud and away from this legacy stuff, so I thought it was a temporary problem that we'd be walking away from.How naive I was.Problem #1: We have virtually no documentation, other than the occasional comment within code if I'm lucky. We have no medallion architecture. We have no data dictionary. Pretty much all the knowledge of how a majority of our data interacts is tribal knowledge within my department and the business analysts who have been here for a long time. Even the business logic of our reports that go to the desks of the C-levels gets argued about sometimes because it's not written down anywhere. We've had no standard code practices (ever) so one process to the next could employ a totally different design approach.Problem #2: Enter the cloud migration phase. At first, this sounded like the lucky break I was hoping for - a chance to go hands-on with Snowflake and employ real data engineering tools and practices and rebuild a lot of the legacy stuff that we've dealt with since our company's inception. Sadly, that would have been way too easy... Orders came down from the top that we needed to get this done as a lift-and-shift, so we paid a consulting company to use machine learning to convert all of our SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory pipelines en masse. Since we don't have a data dictionary or any real documentation, we really had no way to offer test cases for validating data after the fact. We spent months manually validating table data against table data, row by row. Now we're completely vendor-locked with ADF, which is a massive pile of shit for doing surgical-level transformations like we do. Problem #2A: Architecture. Our entire architecture was decided by one person - a DBA who, by their own admission, has never been a developer of any sort, so they had no idea how complex some of our ETL processes were. Our main OLTP system is staying on-prem, and we're replicating its database up to Snowflake using a third-party tool as our source. Then our ADF processes transform the data and deposit it back to Snowflake in a separate location. I feel like we could have engineered a much simpler solution than this if we were given a chance, but this decision was made before my team was even involved. (OneLake? Dynamic Tables?)Problem #3: Project management, or the lack thereof. At this inception of this migration, the decision to use ADF was made without consulting anyone in my department, including our manager. Similarly, the decision to just convert all of our stuff was made without input from our department. We were also never given a chance to review any of our existing stuff to determine if anything was deprecated; we paid for all of it to be converted, debugged it, and half of it is defunct. Literal months of manpower wasted. Problem #4: Looking ahead. If I fast forward to the end of this migration phase and look at what my job is going to be on a daily basis, it boils down to wrestling with Azure Data Factory every day and dissecting tiny bits of business logic that are baked into transformations, with layers upon layers of unnecessary complexity, let alone the aforementioned lack of code standardization.This doesn't feel like data engineering, this feels like janitorial code cleanup as a result of poor project planning and no foresight. I'm very burned out and it feels hopeless to think there's any real data engineering future here. I recently picked up the Snowflake SnowPro Core certification in my downtime because I really enjoy working with the platform, and I've also been teaching myself a bit about devops in my spare time at home (built a homelab / NAS, stood up some containers, gonna be playing with K3S this weekend). Am I crazy, or is this a shitshow? Would anybody else stay here, or how would anyone else proceed in this situation? Any input is welcomed.edit: for clarity, current architecture boils down to: source OLTP > replicated to Snowflake via third-party tool > ADF for ETL/ELT > destination Snowflake",24,0.83,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox84x9/sanity_check_am_i_crazy_for_feeling_like_my_data/,2025-11-14 20:49:34,2025-11-15 01:37:39

We're clocking this at **\~$0.75 per query**.The feature will roll out to **\~5,000 users**. Even with a conservative **20% DAU** (1,000 users) asking just **5 queries/day**, the math is alarming: \*(1,000 DAUs \* 5 queries/day \* 20 workdays \* $0.75/query) = **\~$75,000/month.**\*This turns a feature into a major COGS problem. How are you justifying/managing this? Are your numbers similar?**2. The Data Conflict Problem:** Honestly, this might be worse than the cost. The agent has to query multiple internal systems *about* the customer's data (e.g., their usage logs, their tenant DB, the billing system).We're seeing conflicts. For example, the **usage logs** show a customer is using an ""Enterprise"" feature, but the **billing system** has them on a ""Pro"" plan. The agent doesn't know what to do and might give a wrong or confusing answer. This reliability issue could kill the feature.**My Questions:*** Are you all just eating these high API costs, or did you build a sophisticated middleware/proxy to aggressively cache, route to cheaper models, and reduce ""ping-pong""?* How are you solving these data-conflict issues? Is there a ""pre-LLM"" validation layer?* Are any of the observability tools (Langfuse, Helicone, etc.) actually helping solve this, or are they just for logging?Would appreciate any architecture or strategy insights.

It's pulling data from a source systems, cleans it, applies some transformations and presents the output to the user for approval. Afterwards the transformed data is being written into another DB and injected to our ERP. We're using Pandas for the database connection and transformations and streamlit as the UI.

1ovb4ww,Organizing a climate data + machine learning research project that grew out of control,thiago5242,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I’m data scientinst and master’s student in CS and have been maintaining, pretty much on my own, a research project that uses machine learning with climate data. The infrastructure is very ""do it yourself"", and now that I’m near the end of my degree, the data volume has exploded and the organization has become a serious maintenance problem.Currently, I have a Linux server with a /data folder (\~800GB and growing) that contains:* Climate datasets (NetCDF4, HDF5, and Zarr) — mainly MERRA-2 and ERA5, handled through Xarray;* Tabular data and metadata (CSV, XLSX);* ML models (mostly Scikit-learn and PyTorch pickled models);* A relational database with experiment information.The system works, but as it grew, several issues emerged:* Data ingestion and metadata standardization are fully manual (isolated Python scripts);* Subfolders for distributing the final application (e.g., a reduced /data subset with only one year of data, \~10GB) are manually generated;* There’s no version control for the data, so each new processing step creates new files with no traceability;* I’m the only person managing all this — once I leave, no one will be able to maintain it.I want to move away from this “messy data folder” model and build something more organized, readable, and automatable, but still realistic for an academic environment (no DevOps team, no cloud, just a decent local server with a few TB of storage).What I’ve considered so far:* A full relational database, but converting NetCDF to SQL would be absurdly expensive in both cost and storage.* A NoSQL database like MongoDB, but it seems inefficient for multidimensional data like netcdf4 datasets.* The idea of a local data lake seems promising, but I’m still trying to understand how to start and what tools make sense in a research (non-cloud) setting.I’m looking for a structure that can:* Organize everything (raw, processed, outputs, etc.);* Automate data ingestion and subset generation (e.g., extract only one year of data);* Provide some level of versioning for data and metadata;* Be readable enough for someone else to understand and maintain after me.Has anyone here faced something similar with large climate datasets (NetCDF/Xarray) in a research environment? Should I be looking into a non-relational database?Any advice on architecture, directory standards, or tools would be extremely welcome — I find this problem fascinating and I’m eager to learn more about this area, but I feel like I need a bit of guidance on where to start.",16,0.85,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ovb4ww/organizing_a_climate_data_machine_learning/,2025-11-12 17:15:53,2025-11-15 01:37:39

Does anyone have experience or recommendations for handling monitoring and failure tracking in such a setup? Is a tool like Sentry enough?We have also looked into orchestration tools like Dagster and Airflow, but we are concerned about the operational overhead.

Searching for what should be a standard entity ""Order"" returns dozens of tables with confusing names and varying content.

There's a lack of centralized reference tables that give us basic information about our clients and the services we offer them (it's technically not crucial to the architecture of the tools) and each client is configured differently so running queries on all our data is complex.The company is still growing and made it this far despite this, **so is it urgent to address this right now?** I don't know.

We're an independent charter school and since we'd just split with our previous network we are rebuilding. Though the admin doesn't seem to understand the amount of repetitive, mindless, and repetitious work that is done on a daily basis for everything from the lack of basic workflows, automations, and the consolidation of all of the data we acquire on attendance, grades, standardized test scores, behavior, etc. could both benefit our school and alleviate a lot of work for a lot of individuals. Does anyone know of any resources, information, or quite literally any helpful ideas for determining where to begin? I am well versed in excel and sheets, I'm moderately capable with basic automations and workflows, although I haven't spent much time yet learning how to use app scripts, API's, nor how to go about developing a system of data consolidation in which the data is being collected using different platforms. For instance our LMS is Powerschool which also serves as our SIS although we use a platform called Dean's list for behavioral monitoring. Additionally our standardized test scores come from 2 different sources. Any help, direction, etc would be incredibly helpful. If I wasn't swamped and overwhelmed with all of my other duties I would take the time to learn it all on my own but we operate so stupidly and in such disorganization most hours of my day are spent doing things that could easily be incorporated into workflows, if I could figure out how to use the API's to allow data to be shared with various platforms(google workspace, Powerschool, Dean's list, etc).",4,0.71,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1owkwp9/in_need_of_infosupportdirection_for_high_school/,2025-11-14 02:46:27,2025-11-15 01:37:39
1ovxzl7,How does your team handle debugging with production data across regions (esp. EU vs non-EU)?,LankyImpression8848,dataengineering,"I keep running into conflicting opinions on this, so I’m curious how other teams actually handle it in practice.Context: think of a product with **EU customers and non-EU engineers**, or generally a setup where data residency / GDPR matters and you still need to debug real issues in production.I’d love to hear how your org does things around:**1. Where you are vs where the data is*** Which country/region are *you* working from?* Where is your main production DB / warehouse for that data (EU region, US, multiple regions, etc.)?**2. Who gets to touch production data*** Do individual engineers have **direct access** to prod DBs/warehouses/logs, or is it mostly through internal tools / dashboards?* Is access **permanent** (e.g. read-only role you always have) or **on-demand / temporary** (someone grants it when needed)?* Are credentials shared (team accounts, jump boxes) or strictly individual + SSO?**3. Debugging real issues**When you hit a bug that *only* shows up with real production data, what do you actually do?* Point a debug build at prod?* Query the prod DB/warehouse directly?* Ask a DBA / data / platform team to pull what you need? How often does this happen for you (roughly per week / month)?**4. Data residency / regional rules in practice**If you’re **outside** the region where the data “should” live (e.g. you’re in the US/UK, data is “EU-only”): what’s the real process?* You still query it directly (VPN/bastion/etc.)* Someone *in-region* runs queries / exports for you* You rely on pre-built tooling / dashboards and never see raw rows Are there any “unofficial” workflows (Slack messages like “hey can you run this query for me from EU?”)?**5. Guardrails & horror stories*** Do you have masking / RLS / separate views specifically for debugging?* Any guardrails like time-limited accounts, strict audit logs, approvals, etc.?* Have you seen any near-misses or incidents related to prod access (accidental UPDATE without WHERE, GDPR concerns, etc.)?**6. If you could change one thing*** If you had a magic wand, what’s the first thing you’d fix in your current “debugging with prod data” setup? (Could be policy, tooling, process, anything.)Feel free to anonymize company names, but rough industry and team size (e.g. “EU fintech, \~50 engineers” or “US B2B SaaS, mixed EU/US users”) would be super helpful for context.Really curious how different teams balance “we need real prod data to fix this” with “we don’t want everyone to have God-mode on prod”.",5,0.73,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ovxzl7/how_does_your_team_handle_debugging_with/,2025-11-13 10:48:31,2025-11-15 01:37:39

I needed:\- handles ""real-world"" CSV including edge cases such as double-quotes in the middle of values with no surrounding quotes, embedded newlines, different types of newlines, data rows that might have a different number of columns from the first row, multi-row headers etc\- fast and memory efficient. None of the python CSV packages performed remotely close to what I needed. Certain C based ones such \`mlr\` were also orders of magnitude too slow. xsv was in the right ballpark\- compiles for any target OS and for web assembly\- compiles to library API that can be easily integrated with any programming languageAt that time, SIMD was just becoming available on every chip so a friend and I tried dozens of approaches to leveraging that technology while still meeting the above goals. The result is the zsv parser which is faster than any other parser we've tested (even xsv).With parser built, I added other parser nice-to-haves such as both a pull and a push API, and then added a CLI. Most of the CLI commands are run-of-the-mill stuff: echo, select, count, sql, pretty, 2tsv, stack.Some of the commands are harder to find in other utilities: compare (cell-level comparison with customizable numerical tolerance-- useful when, for example, comparing CSV vs data from a deconstructed XLSX, where the latter may look the same but technically differ by < 0.000001), serialize/flatten, 2json (multiple different JSON schema output choices). A few are not directly CSV-related, but dovetail with others, such as 2db, which converts 2json output to sqlite3 with indexing options, allowing you to run e.g. \`zsv 2json my.csv --unique-index mycolumn | zsv 2db -t mytable -o my.db\`.I've been using zsv for years now in commercial software running bare metal and also in the browser (for a simple in-browser example, see [https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/](https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/)), and we've just tagged our first release.Hope you find some use out of it-- if so, give it a star, and feel free to post any questions / comments / suggestions to a new issue.[https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv)",4,0.83,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ouf9je/zsv_a_fast_simdbased_csv_parser_and_cli/,2025-11-11 17:16:06,2025-11-15 01:37:39

1ox4uvz,Need tips on a hybrid architecture for both real-time BI and ML,overwhelmed_and_shy,dataengineering,"Hello everyone,I’m a CTO of a small startup in South America (limited budget, of course) with a background in software development. While I have academic knowledge in Machine Learning, AI explicability, and related topics, I’ve never worked on a professional data team or project. In most academic projects, we work with ready-to-use datasets, so I’ve never had to think about creating datasets from scratch.We’re a 60-person company, with only 5 in tech, working in the accounting industry. We have four main applications, each with its own transactional Postgres database:- Backend: Serves a hybrid mobile/web app for customers and a back-office application for employees. It handles resources for customer enterprises and our in-house CRM.- Tasks: An internal task and process orchestration app (using Camunda).- CMS: A content system for website campaigns, offers, landing pages, etc.- Docs: An internal Wiki with markdown files documenting processes, laws, rules, etc.The databases are relatively small for now: Backend has 120 tables, Tasks has 50, and most tables have around 500k rows from 4 years of operation. We’ve plugged all of them into Metabase for BI reporting. We have some TVs around the office with real-time dashboards refreshing every 30s (for example for the sales team tracks daily goals and our fiscal team tracking new urgent due tasks). Employees also use detailed tables for their day-to-day needs, often filtering and exporting to Excel.We’ve hit some bumps in our performance and need advice on how to scale efficiently. Most BI reports go through a view in the Backend database that consolidates all customer data, which contains many joins (20+) and CTEs. This setup works well enough for now, but I’m starting to worry as we scale. On top of that, we have some needs to keep track tasks in our Camunda system that are late but only for delinquent customers, so I have to join the data from our Backend database. I've tried Trino/Presto for that but it had a really bad performance and now we are using a Postgres Foreign Data Wrapper and its working well so far... Joining data from our Camunda system with the Backend database to track late tasks, the query performance takes a big hit since it's going through the same consolidated view (it was either that or repeat the same joins over and over again). To address this, we’ve decided it’s time to create a Data Warehouse to offload these heavy queries from the databases. We’re using read replicas, indexes, etc., but I want to create a robust structure for us to grow.Additionally, we’re planning to integrate data from other sources like Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads, partner APIs (e.g., WhatsApp vendor), and PDF content (tax guides, fiscal documents, bank reports, etc.). We’d like to use this data for building ML models and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), etc.We’ve also been exploring the idea of a Data Lake to handle the raw, unstructured data. I’m leaning toward a medallion architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold layers) and pushing the ""Gold"" datasets into an OLAP database for BI consumption. The goal would be to also create ML-ready datasets in Parquet format.Cost is a big factor for us. Our current AWS bill is under USD 1K/month, which covers virtual machines, databases, cloud containers, etc. We’re open to exploring other cloud providers and potentially multi-cloud solutions, but cost-effectiveness is key.I’m studying a lot about this but am unsure of the best path forward, both in terms of architecture and systems to use. Has anyone dealt with a similar scenario, especially on a budget? Should we focus on building a Data Warehouse first, or would implementing a Data Lake be more beneficial for our use case? What tools or systems would you recommend for building a scalable, cost-efficient data pipeline? Any other advice or best practices for someone with an academic background but limited hands-on experience in data engineering?Thanks in advance for any tip",2,0.63,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox4uvz/need_tips_on_a_hybrid_architecture_for_both/,2025-11-14 18:44:04,2025-11-15 01:37:39

I soon realized how unrealistic the implementation of it was, especially if you have multiple collections with millions of records each. That's when I started the journey of learning how databases are implemented.After a few weeks of research and coding, I've completed the first version of my file-based database. This version is append-only, using LSN to insert, update, delete, and locate records. It also uses a B+ Tree for collection entries, allowing for fast ID:LSN lookup. When the B+ Tree reaches its max size (I've set it to 1500 entries), the tree will be encoded (using my custom encoder) and atomically written to disk before an empty tree takes the old one's place in-memory.I'm sure I'm there are things that I'm doing wrong, as this is my first time researching how databases work and are optimized. So, I'd like feedback on the code or even the concept of this library itself.Just wanna state that this wasn't vibe-coded at all.

1oucznb,Tips for managing time series & geospatial data,beiendbjsi788bkbejd,dataengineering,"I work as a data engineer in a an organisation which ingests a lot of time series data: telemetry data (5k sensors with mostly 15 min. intervals, sometimes 1. min. intervals.), manual measurements (couple of hundred every month), batch time series (couple of hundred every month with 15 min. interval) etc. Scientific models are built on top of this data, and are published and used by other companies.These time series often get corrected in hindsight, because they're calibrated, find out a sensor has been influenced by unexpected phenomena, or have had the wrong settings to begin with. How do I deal best with this type of data as a data engineer? Putting data into a quarantine time agreed upon with the owner of the data source, and only publishing it after? If data changes significantly, models need to be re-run, which can be very time consuming.For data exploration, the time series + location data are displayed in a hydrological application, while a basic interface would probably suffice. We'd need a simple interface to display all of these time series (also deducted ones, in total maybe 5k), point locations and polygons, and connect them together.

1oxamdy,Monitoring: Where do I start?,General_Treat_924,dataengineering,"TLDRDBA here, in many years of career, my biggest drama to fight were always metrics or lack of.Places always had a bare minimum monitoring scripts/applications and always reactive. Meaning only if it’s broken, it alerts.I’m super lazy and I don’t want to be awake 3am to fix something that I knew was going to break hours, days ahead. So as a side gig, I always tried to create meaning metrics. Today my company relies a lot on a grafana+prometheus setup I created because the our application as a black box. Devs would rely on reading logs and hoping for the best to justify a behaviour that maybe was normal, maybe was always like that. So grafana just proved it right or wrong.Decisions are now made by people “watching grafana”. This metric here means this, this other means that. And both together means that.While it still a very small side project, now I have been given people to help me to leverage that to the entire pipeline, which is fairly complex from the business perspective, and time consuming, given I don’t have a deep knowledge of any of these tools and infrastructure behind it and I learn as I find challenges.I was just a DBA with a side project hahaa.Finally my question:Where do I start?

1ox5kta,Would using Azure Data Factory in this Context be Overkill?,Sea_Manufacturer2244,dataengineering,"I work for a small organization and we have built an ETL pipeline with Python and SQL for Power BI dashboards. Here is the current process:There are multiple python scripts connected to each other by importing in-memory dataframes. One script runs multiple complex SQL queries concurrently and there are other scripts for transforming the data and uploading to SQL server. The pipeline transfers 3 MB of data each time since it queries the most recent data and takes 2 to 3 minutes to execute each day.This is hard to automate because the databases require VPN which needs 2fa. So we have been working with the IT solutions team to automate the pipeline.The easiest way to automate this would be to deploy the code onto a VM and have it run on a schedule. However, the solutions team has proposed a different approach with Azure Data Factory:* ADF orchestrator invokes ""Copy Data"" activity via self-hosted IR via to the source DB* Data is copied into Azure Blob Storage* Function App executes transformations in the Python scripts* Self-hosted IR invokes ""Copy Data"" with Source as transformed data and the SQL Server as the sinkThe IT solutions deparment said this is the best approach because Microsoft supports PaaS over IaaS and there would be overhead of managing the VM.I am just wondering if this solution would be overkill because our pipeline is very small scale (only 3 MB of data transferred on each run) and we are not a large company.The other problem is that nobody on the team knows Azure. Even though the IT solutions team will implement everything, it will still need to be maintained. The team consists of a business analyst who only knows SQL and not Python, a co-op student who changes every 4 months and myself. I am just a student who has worked here on many co-op and part time roles (currently part time). The business analyst delegates all the major technical tasks to the co-op students so when I leave, the pipeline will be managed by another co-op student who will only be there for 4 months.Management currently support the ADF approach because it is Microsoft best practice. They believes that using a VM will not be best practice and they will need to hire another person to fix everything if it breaks. They also want to move to Fabric in the future for its AI/ML capabilities even though we can just build ML pipelines in Python.I am not sure if I am overthinking this or the ADF solution is truly overkill. I am fine with learning Azure technologies and not opposed to it but I want to build something that can be maintained.",2,0.76,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ox5kta/would_using_azure_data_factory_in_this_context_be/,2025-11-14 19:10:54,2025-11-15 01:37:39

I am nearing completion of my software engineering degree, and my net salary is $1,500 USD per month, which is a competitive salary for a Junior role in my country.The CDO recently informed me that the company plans to hire either a Director of Business Intelligence (BI) or a Senior Data Scientist. Crucially, the final hiring decision is contingent upon the career path I choose to pursue within the company, based on my current responsibilities.Team Structure and ResponsibilitiesOur current technical data team consists of three individuals: the CDO, myself, and a colleague focused on dashboarding and visualization, who will soon be transitioning to another sector within the organization.For the past four months, I have been solely responsible for the conception and implementation of our data infrastructure architecture, including the deployment of all initial ETL pipelines. A substantial amount of work remains, with numerous ETL pipelines still needing to be developed. If I choose to handle this volume of work entirely on my own and maintain my current pace, there is a risk of significant burnout.To elevate my expertise and ensure I am making robust technical decisions, I plan to obtain the GCP Data Engineer Certification in the coming months.I am proficient in programming, system integration, problem-solving, and I am growing confident in pipeline implementation. However, I occasionally question this confidence, wondering if it stems from the repetitive nature of the process or the current absence of a direct manager to provide supervision and critical technical oversight.I was quite concerned when the CDO asked me to define the role I should assume starting next month, given the upcoming senior hire. * Should I assume the leadership risk and position myself to manage the new senior hire (e.g., as a Team Lead or BI Manager)? * Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role? * What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path?*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?I think they see me with leadership potential but I definitely think that I need to improve as a DE to have more confidence in myself.

I’ve been searching for a job for 5 months now, after having worked full-time for some months on an entrepreneurial project involving market research, business management courses, and company operations, which meant a period without pure data work.My background is a mix of formal education and a lot of self-learning. I’ve worked on entrepreneurial projects (which didn’t succeed yet but taught me a lot) and have technical skills including Python, SQL, Airflow, dbt, PowerBI, and I’m currently learning Cloud and Spark. I also have experience in machine learning and deep learning, though I realize my business knowledge and cloud skills still need improvement.For the last 5 months, I’ve been applying in France. I personalize every application and cover letter to the job offer, but the competition is fierce. According to a KPMG study, over 85% of job openings require strong experience, which is hard to accumulate as a junior. I had a few offers initially, but I made some bad decisions like waiting too long or hesitating between opportunities, which I now regret.Given this, I’m seriously considering moving abroad, particularly Canada or other countries where the tech market seems more open and where I might have better chances. I’d love to hear from anyone who has tried this path: is it a good idea for a junior to seek opportunities abroad?

Over the years, one truth keeps proving itself:**Programming isn't about code. It's about clarity.** Early in my career, I thought skill meant knowing everything: frameworks, syntax quirks, cloud configs, you name it. But the developers who actually made things happen weren't the ones who typed fast or memorized docs. They were the ones who could think clearly about problems. When you learn to:* Define the problem before touching the keyboard* Explain your code out loud and make it sound simple* Name things precisely* Question assumptions instead of patching symptoms...you start writing code that lasts, scales, and earns trust. If you're early in your journey, here's my best advice:* Don't chase tools, chase understanding.* Don't fear being wrong, fear not learning from it.* Don't copy patterns blindly, know why they exist.Everything else.. frameworks, AI tooling, languages will follow naturally. *What's something you've learned the hard way that changed how you code?*",1716,0.93,217,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1osvg1m/20_years_in_tech_and_heres_the_one_thing_id_tell/,2025-11-09 21:32:55,2025-11-15 01:37:40

1orvzhm,"The most effective way to learn programming is to want to build something, and then to try and build it.",RockaBabyDarling,learnprogramming,"I shared this with some of my most senior software developer buddies and they said dude you need to share this again but in a better time window where more people will see it because it got lost too soon, so I'm doing that. I know I could probably go look at several analytics websites but I feel like midday on Saturday is probably a good time. The rest is my original post.I've been programming for nearly two decades, and the way I got my start, the way many of my most talented friends got their start, was not through a 16-week boot camp. Although I'm not saying there's no value there. Having a goal and moving through each of several key areas in a full-stack SDLC, they do well enough.If you're trying to learn all the things you need to know to be even a junior to mid-level engineer, it can be difficult to glue all those pieces together in your mind. It can feel like you're learning HTML, but it looks like crap, so then you learn CSS. But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript. Now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work, but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like React or Angular. But then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard-coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so it's not hard-coded, so you learn some backend framework. Now you've got APIs, but you're still hard-coding, so then you learn how to stand up a database. All along the way, there are all these choices and decisions to make, pros and cons, and it's always changing.I've gone through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, Spring Boot and Java, the MEAN stack with Angular 1, and then Angular 2 (which wasn't even the same thing as the first), the MERN stack, all the little frameworks and libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object-oriented versus functional or GraphQL vs REST, and it keeps changing. It keeps going: one thing gets simpler, the next gets more complicated. If you don't have some central thing you can use to glue all these concepts together, they come and go and you've never really learned much. You learned kind of how to touch Kubernetes one day and then never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you could do because you're actually on something worse than k8s. But I digress.If you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice after being a software engineer forever is to do these things:**1. Think of the coolest, most badass thing you can think of that you would like to go try and build.**Take as long as you need here. This is the most important part. It really has to resonate as ""you know what, holy shit, I would actually like to build this,"" and you start getting amped about it. That energy is going to get you through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together. You can look back and say, ""Oh yeah, I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mixins combined with the other features of the language. I just dropped plain CSS and LESS overnight. Oh yeah, I've heard of Tailwind. I dabbled with it. It's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly,"" etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.**2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it with, because I promise you the chances that you're going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea through analysis paralysis are going to be astronomical.**Do some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, and patterns are for whatever it is you're trying to build. I recommend a full-stack JavaScript stack, or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge in complexity and the learning curve when just starting out, mainly because it reduces having to learn two languages when context-switching from the frontend to the backend if you're looking to be full-stack. People ask me what the best programming language is, and I always tell them it's the one you've spent five years learning. You can do just about anything with just about any language out there. Some of them are hyper-specialized like Erlang or Rust or Go, but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share. If it's popular, that means people are hiring for it, it means people like it, and that there's support out there for it. Whichever you pick, you'll be fine. You're getting an education either way.**3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you.**Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there, building out the UI, learning how to make a mockup, and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you.**4. You are going to change your mind about things. People who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from six months ago and say to yourself ""what was I thinking here?"" then you're not growing.**Don't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or becoming paralyzed because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale. So now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12-factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale while you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join. These are just growing pains. There's so much reading out there, so many opinions, different patterns, different hills that people will die on. Pick yours. Look at it like building out your own custom set of opinions. I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck. That's the nature of it.Lastly, if you find that your passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure you still want to go in that direction, but you're thinking ""okay, there's this whole other direction that's actually really cool,"" that's fine. The likelihood that you're going to change is just as likely as the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner. I've not been bored in almost two decades of programming. Each day it's more of the same but nothing is the same. No two days are alike. You get to express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely.So if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build. Immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day, even if it's just updating the README every single day until you pick a framework. Start building that part of your resume right away. Show you're active. Try to open a pull request on an open-source project. Go try to build up your HackerRank. Have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do. It'll make all the difference in holding this together for you. Best of luck to you out there.",272,0.97,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1orvzhm/the_most_effective_way_to_learn_programming_is_to/,2025-11-08 18:01:12,2025-11-15 01:37:40

This is my pragmatic breakdown of monads in practice.In essence there are two distinct topics that concern monads:* Purity* Chaining of operations / compositionKey points i have gathered so far, correct me please:* Monads wrap around other ""things""* The ""thing"" the monad wraps around can be operated on within the monad * This operation can also be a ""chain of operations"", monads can do many things internally while appearing to be ""one abstract step"" on the outside* Monads that ""do something"" (= arent simply context), like IO, are ""lazy"". They are representation for computations that are yet to run (unrelated to lazy vs strict languages)* The ""result"" of the monad can be retrieved/calculated and we call that retrieval ""unwrapping""* Making, baking, and eating the monad are pure operations, from an outside perspective, while the inside of the monad *could* practically do whatever impure nonsense it wants * They always are 100% pure ""representations of 1) a value within a context or 2) an operation that produces a value"" * Some have impure operations. For example doing I/O * The impure operation is abstracted away (into oblivion) so the process that ""runs"" the monad does not have to and cannot care about the purity implications of the operation, it simply cares about ""in -> out""If all above points are correctly describing them, monads are not ""that difficult to understand"", so I have to have missed something, right?I guess the biggest hurdle towards understanding monads stems from them coming in many different flavors... Maybe *seems different* from IO when looking from the side, But looking each of them straight in the face they both ""let you get a value, no matter what they have to do to get that value"".",11,0.92,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ot3bss/ignoring_the_burrito_analogy_breaking_down_monads/,2025-11-10 03:27:59,2025-11-15 01:37:40

So, what can I do?Ideally, I would only allow the backend to be requested from inside the app itself, not as a separate thing, but I haven't heard of a way to do that.I suppose what I'm getting at is: if your project has some API on the backend that you want to protect, what can you do about it?

If someone using Interview Coder performs like a top 1% developer, should we consider that ""cheating,"" or does it suggest that our interview process was never as robust as we thought?

1orwkei,The feasibility of creating a small-scope 3D multiplayer game using C and Vulkan.,Lotheye,learnprogramming,"Hello. I come seeking advice.I'm attempting to make a game with C and Vulkan (no engine). It will be low scope. It has a low-mid poly aesthetic, fairly involved mechanics, and will be multiplayer, supporting a handful of servers with lobbies with a max pop of \~16.I'm adequate with C, with a fairly robust knowledge of it's more advanced topics, although I know nothing of networking/multiplayer. Just from cursory research, I hear a lot of nightmare stories of how adding multiplayer could add years of dev time, compounded with using C, it is seen as potentially unfeasable unless you are some kind of savant, which I am not.Now, I did end up getting reasonably far from a first attempt, just implementing the foundations of Vulkan, having an interactable, 3D play area, and moderately advanced game state and mechanic stuffs. Then, my old computer shat the bed, so I am starting from scratch. So, I definitely can at least create the non-multiplayer aspects of the game, but multiplayer is defnitely the big hurdle. I am 100% completely willing to learn this as well.I want to tackle this in a smart way. My plan is to create a single player version first, with all the non-multiplayer related systems in it so that I can at least have a workeable product in case the multiplayer thing doesn't pan out. Yet, the code base will be designed in such a way as to use a simulated pseudo-server, so that I can both at least dip my toes into the water, and when I finally gain a working knowledge of complex networking/multiplayer using C, I can implement it without having to rewrite entire systems from scratch. I'm making this plan without knowing if this is even best practice for this kind of scenario, or workable at all.So, am I being foolish here? Should I bother doing things this way, or should I just jump straight into the deep end and implement networking/multiplayer as I am learning it? Is my plan actually viable, or am I completely misunderstanding just what implementing networking/multiplayer looks like? Is this really such a giant headache with C, at my slightly above average skill level, that I should just not bother at all, and make the game single player?As a short note, I understand that one of the canned responses is to just start with small projects first, but I have never worked this way. I said that I have adequate knowledge of C, but Python was my first language (C is my 4th), and I gained a sufficient mastery over it by doing the complete opposite of that piece of advice. Jumping into the deep end with my grand project of choice is how I learn best. I am just worried if multiplayer would be beyond me by making the development time balloon to the point of making it a non-viable option.",5,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1orwkei/the_feasibility_of_creating_a_smallscope_3d/,2025-11-08 18:23:53,2025-11-15 01:37:40

1osyycp,Hard truth: AI can't do most of our jobs yet a lot of us will get cut because C Suite execs don't understand wtf AI can actually do and live in a dream world.,scoopydidit,cscareerquestions,"Just need to rant this.My company recently laid off 3k people because of ""AI productivity""... what the fuck is going on? We can sit around and say ""AI can't replace us yet"" and although that may be true, if your CEO is being fed absolute bullshit, you're losing your job regardless. This is a hard truth we all need to start grasping.I know my job is not replaceable using any form of AI right now. I kind of wish there was an assistant to help me because I feel overworked like crazy tbh. But there isn't. I don't do a huge amount of coding... I work more so in the cloud infrastructure space and connecting services together but implementing security controls. I'm paid for more my problem solving than any implementation.Despite the above, I still feel a layoff happening soon for my job. Some CEO will say that AI can replace me but it just can't and it's not even nearly at that level. I'm coming to terms with this by saving as much money as I can so I can continue to pay bills... But God...this area of work is so grim nowadays.My moral to do my job is at an all time low.

1osy1dv,Two tweaks to my job hunting process that landed me a new job,JagoffAndOnAgain,cscareerquestions,"**tl;dr** 1. Paid an expert to redo my resume, and 2. Ignored LinkedIn/Indeed completely. Bookmarked and applied directly through company Careers/Jobs pages for brand new positions only.---In 2023, I was laid off from a full stack job I loved and was at for 9 years. The severance package provided some ""career coaching and resume assistance"" via Randstad. So I used them to redo my resume which I had always done entirely myself with no external help, including AI. I thought it was a lot better.I was wrong. Throughout the next 6 months in the spring and summer of 2023, I applied to 171 jobs (with 13 YoE at the time). I heard back from 12 (7%), was ghosted by 5 of those and rejected by 4 more. When I accepted my contract position, I ended two other interviews.Cut to this summer 2025. I was thankful for the contract position but wasn't particularly interested in the domain. Also, I got cabin fever working remotely. My new apartment's home office is a lot sadder than the old one. I need to get out of the house and see the sun which I don't do when WFH. I totally understand why most people love WFH- I did it for years. It's just not great for me personally long term. For all this reasons, I began hunting despite the doom and gloom around the current job market.For a few months, I stuck to my old habits. I added my current position to my resume but kept it basically the same as before. I applied to LinkedIn posts along with hundreds of other people. And I was back to my 2023 numbers. In fact, it was worse. I was only hearing back 5% of the time (which this time was only one job) and they ghosted me after one interview. Fuckers.---**1.** I realized I needed a change. I had a gut feeling my resume wasn't great. It wasn't getting me the first look. I'm a software engineer, not a resume expert. These are two entirely different skillsets. A younger me scoffed at the idea of resume writing being valuable: ""I write great code on cool systems, that should be easy enough for anyone to glean from my resume!"" Idiot. I searched ""software engineer resume coach"" and found one with great TrustPilot reviews. I spent $300 for someone to take my old resume, ask me clarifications, and return a brand new resume back to me about a week later.I cannot tell you how much of an upgrade the second resume is. The first one looks like dogshit by comparison. My old resume was a massive wall of text combining some tech keywords with the resume guidance of the late 2000's (my college era when I learned to write a resume). This new version had largely the same information, but it was presented in a much more impressive way. I was impressed by my own resume. It also surprisingly gave me a new sense of confidence going into interviews. It had way more metrics and quantitive points than I had on there.My callback rate when from 5% to 25%. Post-resume glow up, I applied to 12 positions and heard back from 3. Pretty stunning turnaround.But an improved resume wasn't the only thing I changed in this round of job hunting. I changed my application tactics.---**2.** In 2023 and part of my 2025 hunt, I spent a lot of time on LinkedIn applying to jobs according to filters and advanced searches. This just never felt particularly useful. You're adding another layer of software between your resume and a human being's eyes. Also, I just hate LinkedIn. People are so strange and phony on there. So I abandoned it.Instead, I started searching for lists of companies based in my city. I would then bookmark their Careers or Jobs pages in a folder in my browser. By the end of my hunt, I bookmarked about 55 pages. And a few times per week, I would spent about half an hour looking at every single one.I was looking for jobs posted within the last 48 hours but ideally that day. If a day was posted longer than 3 days ago, I considered it a dead end. You want to be in the first 50 in a stack of resumes.Job posting aggregators are a wasteland. I think these days HR looks at the stack of applications in their domain first, then looks to LinkedIn and Indeed if they see nothing promising.---With these two tactics, I interviewed with a few places, narrowed it down to two, and chose the one I was most excited about. It's been off to a good start so far.Anyways, that is my advice from my past few years of job hunting in the frustrating market/economy/country/existence. Good luck!When I posted this to r/experienceddevs I got accused of being an ad almost instantly, so FYI I will not be recommending the resume service I used. Just search around and I'm sure you'll find someone capable. This is merely advice for what seemed to work for me.",175,0.87,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1osy1dv/two_tweaks_to_my_job_hunting_process_that_landed/,2025-11-09 23:19:01,2025-11-15 01:37:41

I was laid off in the last week of 2024 and have been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for the past 10 months. I have 5 years of experience at a FAANG company and consider myself good at selling myself because I consistently make it to final interview rounds, but I’ve not landed a single offer all year. Now it’s November and I just got the ‘no offer’ emails after final rounds with two more companies (I think I have failed 12 final loops now). What do I do now? I am lucky to be financially secure but I feel as if my career is dead. While I know my situation can’t be unique I have not found any information about what do here. Things I have tried/am considering:- I’ve worked on personal projects to fill out my resume. They fill the page out well but are always ignored in actual interviews- I’ve applied to smaller companies and startups, but in my experience it is both harder to find job listings for smaller companies and I am ghosted more often by startups than mid-large companies - I’ve considered going back to school to pursue a masters or change fields, but hesitated when seeing grad schools require recommendations from employers. It could be an option but I’d need to hope my managers that I haven’t kept in touch with would recommend me- I could seek underemployment. Not ideal but better than not accomplishing anything - I can keep applying. Obvious but I dread when the gap on my resume has grown so much I stop getting interviewsAny advice or stories about similar situations appreciatedEdit: I appreciate the honest replies. It seems the general recommendation is to improve my interviewing skills and keep applying. I don’t normally post on social media but getting to discuss this anonymously with others has been very helpful. As many have pointed out, my interview skills are not perfect, and I when I get feedback it’s generally about the system design round.

I converted the test partitioning logic too as we have different tests for different databases, but I presume im doing this wrong.I tried asking help from a colleague who had previously done this and he told me to check his repo and that he'll write an article about how to convert the versions.I spoke to another colleague who helped me a bit but hasn't helped me further than just adjusting the pom.xml and I feel like im dragging it out telling him again and again that the tests fail in pipelines.It's been almost 2 months im tasked with this, and I don't know exactly where im stuck (if it's really even the partitioning logic that's messing it up), and my daily standups feel like a humiliation ritual repeating the same thing to my team. I tell my manager about the bugs and what my approach is to fix it, but he said he doesn't know the logic either as he has workload of his own (and to just speak with other colleagues) and probably just gave me this ""simple"" task which i can't even resolve.

1ot149w,[PSA] RSUs leave you holding a lot of stock in a single asset. Diversified portfolios help mitigate risk. Not investment advice.,ObjectBrilliant7592,cscareerquestions,"I know lots of developers that are heavily invested in their own companies, due to never cashing their company stock, received through RSUs as part of their compensation package. Many of my friends have done very well on these stocks throughout the last tech bubble and refuse to sell, even though some of their company stocks have since taken a dip. They believe they will make back their unrealized gains. Some of their reasoning is:> It will bounce back, tech stocks are still in a bull market!> I work for the company and things are going really well right now!> It's performed really well in the past!*None of this matters.* Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Most companies that were listed on stock exchanges 100 years ago are *gone*. Many tech stocks today have high P/E ratios and other indicators that suggest they are overvalued. If the AI bubble bursts, it is highly likely that your company's stock will take a hit, regardless of how you perceive their level of exposure to that area.Imagine having a large percentage of your net worth tied up in one stock you picked. This is what you have, effectively. I'm not going to give people here a full rundown on basic investing, but a diversified portfolio is always a strong choice. Speak with an investment professional. Over the long term, a diversified portfolio is always the smart move. Being a bagholder isn't fun.

My last job was in a big household name company but not one known for tech (more publishing) in Java. I never felt I was more than mediocre, and then I got sick with nebulous undiagnosable long covid, which made my performance worse, and I became an easy budget cut. After a few months of inactive burnout (where I lost a lot of muscle memory), and a few months of sending out CVs, I had pretty much given up on getting any significant interviews any time soon and was pretty much just messing around with ones I didn't care about and building my portfolio as much as possible, with an aim of just learning out loud and then leveraging that in my next round of applying. I was making a language learning app with some NLP elements in python for the last couple months. I haven't written much Java since April, and even then, my last position was fullstack and they had me on a lot of frontend in the final year. I haven't done any leetcode since June (and most DSA I haven't revisited since I got hired at my last place >2 years ago). Studying up on the systems design I'm starting to be expected to understand better as a now potential mid was in my backlog.Suddenly, two days ago I got an email from a big tech company (not FAANG but close, and in an adjacent field to my last company) I had applied to a month or more ago. I remember filling in the application form thinking ""I don't know why I am doing this, I should definitely wait until I have improved myself and have an actual chance. They're going to think this application is pathetic"". I expected no response and honestly forgot entirely about the job position or what I even wrote in that form.

Don't believe that a person could easily learn a new tool, even though the he/she has shown the history of tooling adaptability. Or overvaluing those skills/tools and then making it as a hard requirement.2. Any newly invented tool/process is assumed to be a must-have, no matter how shitty or irrelevant it is, then puts it in the requirement.3. Requires ""expertise"" in unproven or immature areas of technology4. Requires extensive experience in super niche areas that has only popular within the recent year. Then even asking for a certificate or even degree.5. ""N many years of experience"" is a must. So if the requirement is 6 years but you only have 5.75 years, then auto-disqualified.6. Asks for corporate experience from fresh grads.7. Worse, ask for both extensive commercial as well as extensive academic experiences. Especially, in data science/ML. ""Cool, you simple baseline model bring X revenue? But did you also spend amount of time outside main work for reading academic paper about new algo ?..."" or ""Tell me the interesting academic paper you've read recently..."". While a lot of time simple baseline in production out-performs the complexity in the long run. Probably ""we need the complexity to sell our solution to be relevant...""8.

Looking for advice",jajinpop91,cscareerquestions,"I’m 32, originally from Eastern Europe, and moved to the U.S. about ten years ago. I taught myself front-end development in 2017 while living off savings, and during that time I started using weed heavily to cope with stress. It turned into a long-term dependency. I’m not functional when high. My focus and code quality drop and that has definitely slowed my growth. I’ve also struggled with anxiety and burnout cycles along the way.My first job was rough: I was the only front-end dev, no mentorship, no code reviews, just figuring things out alone. Since then, I’ve mostly worked in digital agencies doing CMS-heavy work. I’ve stayed employed and I can ship features, but I feel like my foundational skills never solidified. **My code works, but the quality often isn’t good** it feels like I’m assembling things rather than understanding them at a deeper level (architecture, state management, patterns, testing, etc.).On top of that, **my career progression has been slow and has gaps field with very questionable freelance work.** Some people move from junior to senior/tech lead in 3–4 years. In my case, after \~7–8 years, I’ve only just reached mid-level. I know why — lack of mentorship, inconsistent learning habits, mental health struggles, and the weed dependency but it still leaves me with the fear of becoming *stuck* or even **unemployable** if I don’t level up soon.I’m trying to cut down on weed, rebuild discipline, and take my growth seriously.

1otfdox,Nine months into a Vue dev job and I feel like I’m failing. Any advice from those who have experienced this?,HYV_Empathy,cscareerquestions,"For context, I'm 27m and I used to work as a team lead for high-level FE development (HTML/JS/CSS only work, basically). My role was basically Technical Project Manager (who sometimes writes code or makes websites) by the end of it, and I was hating it. I wanted to leave management and get back to development, so I self-taught Vue and React basics to the point of being able to pass an interview and learn on the job.About 9 months ago, I got a new job as a Vue developer. During the interview process, my now-boss said that she understood the level to which I understood Vue was below what they'd expect of an employee, but they were willing to train me.Perfect! That's exactly what I was looking for, especially since the money was a significant increase compared to what I was earning in my old role as a team lead, so I thought I'd struck gold. And for the first 6 months, it felt that way.Going from knowing Vue at a hobby/passing activity level to a professional level was a difficult climb, but I felt like I was still making progress each day.Lately, however, I have felt like a wasted paycheck and a burden to the team. My main mentor figure changed departments as experienced resource was needed elsewhere, and while I have people I can still reach out to for help, I just keep hitting block after block and feel over-reliant on them.We use Sentry for bug management, and I absolutely cannot stand it. I keep trying to investigate issues, get stuck, reach out to a colleague only for them to say ""Oh, that's likely due to xyz"" when ""xyz"" never even crossed my mind.It feels like I've been plateaued for months now, and I can't get past it. I asked my now-boss for help a while back, and she's given me the advice of ""When you encounter something you don't understand, research the technology."" along with ""Create a simpler, working version of the part that's broken, then try and apply that logic.""This advice is great...for simple issue that can be Googled or technology I understand the concepts of. If I see ""Axios error 123"" or ""Apollo error: this is what's wrong..."" then brilliant! I can read the documentation!But for more vague issues like ""This is our component that's nested in 13 other components, it's not working as intended, figure out why."" I can SOMETIMES get to the bottom of it, but I have just kept hitting walls of bugs where someone who wrote the system is needed because they understand how it works (the company seems entirely averse to adding comments explaining their code).What I'm struggling with is I just don't know if I enjoy this anymore. A few months ago, I LOVED my job - I'd hit the gold mine and life was going great.Lately though...I have spoken to a therapist and three separate GPs who signed me off for the last two weeks due to ""Acute stress reaction"" (probably not allowed to go into detail on this sub). I'd done a lot of thinking and soul-searching over the last two weeks, hit today (my first day back) with a positive attitude, and yet within 4 hours I'd returned to my habit of crying at my desk.It doesn't help that I work from home, since I'm alone in my room all the time. We go to the office once a week, but I'm the only one from my department and actually works on this codebase who goes in, so I just end up working in a room full of people who are more intelligent and experienced than me, but have never looked at a single line of code that I'm responsible for working on.I just feel stuck. I want to love this job and this career, but the way this job has made me feel lately...it's not living.Has anyone else experienced this? Going from light FE work (HTML, JS, and CSS only) to Vue/React development, picking up the basics, and then just hitting a brick wall 9 months later?Does anyone have any advice?P.S. My therapist has recently advised she thinks I have ADHD, and that perfectionism and unreasonable standards for myself are some of my symptoms and trigger my mental overload/shutdown when I hit my fifth brick wall of the day.

It's something I've wanted to do for awhile.* build an MVP, deploy some ML-powered APIs, maybe onboard a some pilot usersIf later I want to return to full-time employment, is it acceptable to list my startup as real experience (e.g., *ML Engineer at \[Startup Name\]*) with bullet points describing the technical work I did?I wouldn’t exaggerate funding or success, but I would be doing real engineering, ML, and product work.Is this a normal thing to do in tech? Would recruiters see this as legitimate experience or as a red flag?Again, money is not a concern for me or my family. I'm also at a point where money don't mean as much to me compared to other things. I just need a good idea to not let the gap hurt me in a presumably tough job market 6 month or a year from now, if my startup don't take off.Thanks",12,0.93,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1own9o4/im_thinking_about_quitting_my_job_for_personal/,2025-11-14 04:43:42,2025-11-15 01:37:41

He said that he understood, but in the last year or so I keep getting shifted off projects and I am not able to acclimate myself to a single workflow.* Before this I was doing OS automated testing in Python with Pytest.* I was switched to a new team which does Python testing with Squish. So I was brought up to speed on that.* One of the other testers introduced a new way to run our automated tests through Jenkins. So I was brought up to speed on that and got a Jenkins pipeline we as testers could deploy from for verifying changes we did to our branches before merging to master. Eventually having to update existing tests because they were having issues running through Jenkins.* There was some drama from management and the testers on workflows. Not going into it, but it led to a lot of flip flopping between the old and new workflows.* The last PI there was a high priority project that needed assistance and I was told to assist for 6 weeks on manually running complex test scenarios that hadn't been automated yet.* I feel adrift, useless, and unproductive.

1ostt8g,How Will We Protect Computer Science After The Backlash?,IcyMove601,cscareerquestions,"I am a tech guy with over 10 years of experience. I got my PhD in CS from a good US school, and perhaps just as relevant for the topic, I got a minor in history. I worked in tech in the US, Germany, UK, the Netherlands, and visited China many times for work.To various extents, I've seen the the development of AI, dot-com bubble (indirectly), big data boom, cloud revolution, the Bitcoin inception, the LLMs, and a few side-hypes like the quantum computing.I'm also well-aware of the overall crisis of science, especially with respect to publishing and funding, that spans far beyond the boundaries of Computer Science. Nevertheless, I would argue that no major scientific discipline is in a worse danger than CS, and I'm proceeding to expand on that.Tech has generated an unprecedented amount of wealth over the last three decades. That wealth produced the political power that influenced the society. Unlike some other historically influential movements, this one chose an unsubtle method of societal influence that generates unprecedented amount of discontent, and therefore I denote the people who hold this power as ""moguls."" Worse even for the tech community, the moguls hid their ideological underpinnings and political ambitions behind their ""tech nerd"" images. History teaches us that the majority of the upcoming backlash will center around the images the moguls perpetuate and not their chosen ideologies. Although one could argue that a scientific or engineering discipline may spontaneously evaporate upon fulfilling its historical role, I assume that CS is not at that stage. That is to say that there still exist problems that CS can help humanity with.Under the above assumption, how do we defend CS (and tech) as a discipline once the ""shit hits the fan,"" pardon my French? How do we argue that it's not tech that is evil, but the ideologies fueling the tech moguls?",9,0.53,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ostt8g/how_will_we_protect_computer_science_after_the/,2025-11-09 20:27:57,2025-11-15 01:37:41

I’m pursuing Senior SWE position(s). Through my recruiter screening and technical phone parts, I believe I’ve shown that I’m technically strong, and I think they know through my introductions that I haven’t mentored or led projects. That’s why I’m curious about what expectations I should anticipate when speaking with the hiring manager.This market is tough, so I’m taking all the help I can get. I’m self-aware that socializing isn’t my strongest skill. In past hiring processes for SWE II roles, I tended to succeed at companies that emphasized LeetCode-style technical assessments. But at places where the behavioral portion carried weight, I often fell short—partly because I optimized only for the technical side.Now I’m focused on building strong behavioral stories. I’ve read advice online suggesting it’s okay to “fake it till you make it,” which I interpreted as exaggerating my impact or responsibilities. My assumption was that as long as I know the details well enough to answer follow-up questions, I could frame my contributions more strongly.Overall, I’d love tips on how to frame stories and strategies to present myself effectively to the hiring manager.

Get held up by permissions and access constantly, and have to submit an IT ticket that gets put on the back burner for weeks.2. Find out that I need to use the approved by IT tools/resources which are often completely ass and hold no real world value, and hinder progress, because people making these decisions are looking at safety and budget, not actual function. Looking at you Power Automate flow, the worst platform I have ever had the displeasure of using in my entire life… all because my company won’t allow anyone not directly on the software team to create an actual web application outside of Power App and Power automate flow.3. Deal with management misunderstanding priorities and getting caught up on their grandiose visions of ML/AI which is just literally a buzz word at this point and they have no understanding of what is actually meant by these words. I had a boss that wanted me, by myself, to implement a way to monitor FSE’s , with AI, who are working on the tool to ensure they’re installing the parts outlined in procedures… sir… what?! He pressed us to do this for months despite telling him it isn’t attainable, and he just kept saying, “figure it out.” Until finally he left the he company.4. Management or stakeholders who want a detailed, image based, representation of every single change you accidentally mention instead of just making discretely. I had a manager for a while who, for example, in one meeting I mentioned I have to change the data type of a column on my not even proof of concept project yet, and he had me spend 6 days making DAGs, picture based PowerPoints, and tons of other documentation, because he wanted to understand better… this was a guy who bragged about lying on his resume to get a tech job management position and was previously just monitoring processes and creating tickets when processes failed for wafer runs in the fab…. Needless to say, he was shortly thereafter demoted lol.And so many other things.The point is, exercise, go for walks, meditate, or some thing else to build resilience and clear your mind, and learn patience, because the biggest thing I have learned in the last 3-4 years in this industry is that you will run into so many absurd issues or requests that are in no way based in logic, and are purely emotional, and if you let it eat at you, it’s going to destroy your mental health, work relationships, etc.Godspeed y’all.

1orfl4l,Ideal time to have first job switch?,harsh1588,cscareerquestions,"I’ve been working for around 1.5 years now post grad and have been curious about when it’s expected for someone to make their first job hopIm not a huge fan of the current location and my team is a little toxic if I’m being honest, but the brand name is a household one and it has a strong rep. I was a little worried that I would be considered a job hopper for leaving, but I wanted some input on that. I was wondering what the general consensus around this is?I also don’t know if it matters but my school was T-20ish for cs (not really sure lol) and the company is a pretty strong brand name one, however they aren’t doing super hot atm, layoffs may be on the horizon?

1ow81hu,How to make big useful projects and not useless projects,shade_blade,cscareerquestions,"I don't know what to do, I don't know how to come up with big giant project ideas that will have big impact. I feel like it's pointless to make a project anymore unless it's going to get a lot of people using it, like I could make a Docker project or pay money I don't have for a server but if nobody wants to use the project then recruiters will always see it as a dumb toy project? I have to make something where every part of it has impact or metrics or it doesn't count (so it doesn't matter if I implement some CI/CD pipeline unless I can point to a dollar amount it saved or something like that)I'm having trouble looking for project ideas like that that demonstrate real effort (so they don't look like dumb toy projects thrown together in a day or whatever). All the stuff I keep seeing is mostly stuff that doesn't seem like it would help me at all. I don't think using AI in 50 different ways in an app nobody ever uses is going to make recruiters think highly of me. It's feeling like the requirements are so high for a ""real project""? I have to pay for a server (free server = ""toy project"" because no real company uses free servers), I have to make real money somehow and build something so big it needs a CI/CD pipeline (so big that it makes sense I'm doing that instead of just manually uploading the new builds). And then every single part needs to have big impact and metrics to put on a resume so somehow my CI/CD implementation needs to be so good it generates money in of itself somehow?I'm also trying to actively stop myself from getting distracted by the ""fun"" projects I wasted my time on for so long but I sometimes get pulled back in, making ""fun"" stuff is not helping me so those projects are all useless wastes of time. Maybe I need people to give me more harsh words enough to push me to delete the entire project so I can't waste even more time on them. I already deleted the github but I can't bring myself to delete the folder yet.Maybe I should give up on software development entirely? People are getting hired somehow but I can't get any positive response at all so that is a pretty obvious sign my qualifications are garbage?

1ovpfuy,"Need some advice, 5 YOE and went through a layoff",dontdoxme33,cscareerquestions,"I've got a solid 5 years of software development experience under my belt, I worked for two companies in office both for roughly 2 and half years each. I used C# as my primary language in both jobs, my first job was on a team of 5 in office. I worked on ASP.NET, .NET Core and a fairly large SQL database, there was some react involved as well for a new application we built. I left that company to take my second job which was on a team of two working with Microsoft Dynamics, we were building an application that interfaced with MS Dynamics in office. Application was a .NET Core app and a react frontend. Both of these positions were enjoyable but unfortunately COVID hit and the last company I was at was acquired and I was subsequently laid off, MS Dynamics was to be replaced with Salesforce and the project was scrapped. Ive since worked a contract but I've been laid off since 2022 when that contract expired.I've been living off of savings in the meantime, but would like to get back to work sooner rather than later. With my five years should I be aiming for senior level positions or should I try my hand at junior level roles, ones asking for 3+ YOE. I don't care much about salary and would really just like to be back to work. I'm just in a weird spot where I don't know if I'm senior enough to really be applying to some of these 5+ YOE roles.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Currently, I'm not working professionally but rather pursuing programming as a hobby, and I am learning the Rust programming language. In this process, I decided to purchase and read **M. Morris Mano's ""Computer System Architecture""** book to better understand computer systems and, particularly, memory management as I learn Rust.

I'm the third FE dev hired to help modernize legacy applications to React. We recently lost one front-end dev, and the rest of the 20-30 people on our team are Java devs who have been leading the React work. I'm also the only developer without 5+ yoe.The current situation is an unmitigated disaster. * The team doesn't have a shared linter or formatter, doesn't conduct code reviews, devs commit directly to the main branch, and there is zero oversight for adding unmaintained dependencies. * The codebase lacks a coherent directory structure, naming conventions, and is riddled with with monolithic components doing too many things. There is a significant amount of duplicated logic/JSX, and components are often built more than once. The applications I've seen currently ""work"" but are going to be a nightmare to maintain.This environment feels toxic for learning how to be a good developer, as I am essentially being trained in anti-patterns.
