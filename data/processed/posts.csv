Data engineers determining what the stakeholders truly need. * The context of ""what data could we possibly consume"" is a vast space that would require such a large context window that it's unfeasible * Deeply understanding the business * Retrieval augmented generation is getting better at understanding the business but connecting all the dots of where the most value can be generated still feels very far away * Logical / Physical data modeling * Connecting the conceptual with the business need allows for data engineers to anticipate the query patterns that data analysts might want to run.

1m9xbk5,Primary Keys: Am I crazy?,bengen343,dataengineering,"TLDR: Is there any reason *not* to use primary keys in your data warehouse? Even if there aren't any legitimate reasons, what are your devil's advocate arguments against using them?Maybe I am, indeed, the one who is crazy here since I'm interested in getting the thoughts of actual humans rather than ChatGPT, but... I've encountered quite the gamut of warehouse designs over the course of my time, especially in my consulting days. During this time, I've come to think of primary keys as ""table stakes"" (har har) in the creation of any table. In all my time, I've only encountered two outfits that didn't have any sort of key strategy. In the case of the first, their explanation was ""Ah yeah, we messed that up and should probably fix that."" But, now, in the case of this latest one, they're treating their lack of keys as a legitimate design choice. This seems unbelievable to me, but I thought I'd take this to the judgement of the broader group: is there a good reason to avoid having any primary keys?I think there are ample reasons to have some sort of key strategy:* Data quality tests: makes it easier to check for unique records and guard against things like fanout.* Lineage: makes it easy to trace the movement of a single record through tables.* Keeps code DRY (don't repeat yourself): effective use of primary/foreign keys can prevent complex \`join\` logic from being repeated in multiple places. * Not to mention general \`join\` efficiency* Interpretability: makes it easier for users to intuitively reason about a table's grain and the way \`join\`s should work.I'd be curious if anyone has any arguments against the above bullets or keys in data warehouses, specifically, more broadly.Full disclosure, I may turn this discussion into a blog post so I can lay out my argument once and for all.

Software engineer for 10+ years, switched to data engineering in 2021 after discovering it via business intelligence/data warehousing solutions I was helping out with. I thought it was a great way to get off the dev treadmill and write mostly SQL day to day and it turned out I was really good at it, becoming a tech lead over the next 18 months. I'm trying to go back to dev now. So much stuff as a data engineer is completely out of your control but you're expected to just fix it. People constantly question numbers if it doesn't match their vibes. Nobody understands the complexities. It's also so, so hard to test in the same concrete way as regular services and applications.Data teams are also largely full of non-technical people. I regularly have to argue with/convince people that basic things like source control are necessary. Even my fellow engineers won't take five minutes to read how things like Docker or CI/CD workflows function.I'm looking at a large pay cut going back to being a dev but it's worth my sanity.

Advice?,WasabiBobbie,dataengineering,"Hey all,I’m in a bit of a weird spot and wondering if anyone else has been through something similar.I’m about to put in my two weeks at a company where, honestly, I’m the only one who knows how most of our in-house systems and processes work. I manage critical data processing pipelines that, if not handled properly, could cost the company a lot of money. These systems were built internally and never properly documented, not for lack of trying, but because we’ve been operating on a skeleton crew for years. I've asked for help and bandwidth, but it never came. That’s part of why I’m leaving: the pressure has become too much.Here’s the complication:I made the decision to accept a new job the day before I left for a long-planned vacation.My new role starts right after my trip, so I’ll be giving my notice during my vacation, meaning 1/4th of my two weeks will be PTO.I didn’t plan it like this. It’s just unfortunate timing.I genuinely don’t want to leave them hanging, so I plan to offer help after hours and on weekends for a few months to ensure they don’t fall apart. I want to do right by the company and my coworkers.Has anyone here done something similar, offering post-resignation support?How did you propose it?Did you charge them, and if so, how did you structure it?Do you think my offer to help after hours makes up for the shortened two-week period?Is this kind of timing faux pas as bad as it feels?Appreciate any thoughts or advice, especially from folks who’ve been in the “only one who knows how everything works” position.",82,0.85,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1maloa5/leaving_a_company_where_im_the_only_one_who_knows/,2025-07-27 12:59:37,2025-07-28 01:57:55
1m8vf1g,What's your opinion on star schema approach in Analytics?,Kukaac,dataengineering,"Dear Fellow Data Engineer,I've been doing data for about 15 years (mostly in data analytics and data leadership - so not hardcore DE, but had DEs reporting to me). Recently, I joined a company that tries to build data models with full star schema normalization, as it was a transactional database.For example, I have a User entity that can be tagged. One user can have multiple Tags.They would create * the User entity* the Tag entity, which only contains the tag (no other dimension or metric)* a UserTag entity that references a many-to-many relationship between the twoAll tables would be SCD2, so it would be separately tracked when the Tag was first recognized and when the Tag has changed.Do you think this approach is normal, and I've been living under a rock? They reason that they want to build something long-term and structured. I would never do something like this, because it just complicates simple things that work anyway.I understand the concept of separating dimensions and fact data, but, in my opinion, creating dedicated tables for enums is rare, even in transactional models.Their progress is extremely slow. Approximately 20 people have been building this data lakehouse with stringent security, governance, and technical requirements (SCD2 for all transformations, with only recalculated IDs between entities) for over two years, but there is still no end-user solution in production due to slow velocity and quality issues.",62,1.0,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m8vf1g/whats_your_opinion_on_star_schema_approach_in/,2025-07-25 10:17:21,2025-07-28 01:57:55

A lot of times recursive CTEs hide data modeling issues underneath - using the RANK window function Skipping ranks is never needed and causes annoying problems.

After a lot of effort, I got an offer from a known consulting company. The role was labeled as Data Engineer, and it sounded like the kind of step up I had been looking for — better tools, better projects, and a brand name that looked solid on paper.Fast forward ~9 months, and honestly, I regret the move almost every single day.There’s barely any actual engineering work. The focus is all on meeting strict client deadlines (which company usually promise to clients), crafting stories, and building slide decks. All the company cares about is how we sell stories to clients, not the quality of the solution or any meaningful technical growth. There’s hardly any real engineering happening — no time to explore, no time to learn, and no one really cares about the tech unless it looks good in a PPT.To make things worse, the work-life balance is terrible. I’m often stuck working late into the night working (mostly 12+ hrs). It’s all about output and timelines — not the quality of work or the well-being of the team.For context, my background is:•~3 years working with SQL, Python, and ETL tools ( like Informatica PowerCenter)•~1 year of experience with PySpark and Databricks•Comfortable building ETL pipelines, doing performance tuning, and working in cloud environments (AWS mostly)I joined this role to grow technically, but that’s not happening here.

1m5miwq,Update: Attempting vibe coding as a data engineer,roey132,dataengineering,"Continuing my latest post about vibe coding as a data engineer.in case you missed - I am trying to make a bunch of projects ASAP to show potential freelance clients demos of what I can make for them because I don't have access to former projects from my workplaces.So, In my last demo project, I created a daily patch data on AWS using Lambda, Glue, S3 and Athena.using this project, I created my next project, a demo BI Dashboard as an example of how to use data to show insights using your data infra.Note: I did not try to make a very insightful dashboard, as this is a simple tech demo to show potential.A few takes from the current project:1. After taking some notes from my last project, the workflow with AI felt much smoother, and I felt more in control over my prompts and my expectations of what it can provide me.2. This project was much simpler (tech wise). Much less tools, most of the project is only in python, which makes it easier for the AI to follow on the existing setup and provide better solutions and fixes.3. Some tasks just feels frustrating with AI even when you expect it to be very simple. (for example, no matter what I did, it couldn't make a list of my CSV column names, it just couldn't manage it, very weird.)4. When not using UI tools (like in AWS console for example), the workflow feels more right. you are much less likely to get hallucinations (which happened A LOT on AWS console)5. For the data visualization enthusiasts amongst us, I believe making graph settings for matplotlib and alike using AI is the biggest game changer I felt since coding with it. it saves SO MUCH time remembering what settings exists for each graph and plot type, and how to set them correctly.Github repo: [https://github.com/roey132/streamlit\_dashboard\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/streamlit_dashboard_demo)Streamlit demo link: [https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/](https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/) I believe this project was a lot easier to vibe code because its much smaller and less complex than the daily batch pipeline. that said, it does help me understand more about the potential and risks of vibe coding, and let's me understand better when to trust AI (in its current form) and when to doubt it's responses.to summarize: when working on a project that doesn't have a lot of different environments and tools (this time, 90% python), the value of vibe coding is much higher. also, learning to make your prompts better and more informative can improve the final product a lot, but, still, the AI takes a lot of assumptions when providing answers, and you can't always provide it with 100% of the information and edge cases, which makes it provide very wrong solutions. Understanding what the process should look like and knowing what to expect of your final product is key to make a useful and steady app.I will continue to share my process on my next project in hope it can help anyone!

Best practices?,SurroundFun9276,dataengineering,"I'm currently working with a medallion architecture inside Fabric and would love to hear how others handle the **raw → bronze** process, especially when mixing **incremental and full loads**.Here’s a short overview of our layers:* **Raw**: Raw data from different source systems* **Bronze (technical layer)**: Raw data enriched with technical fields like `business_ts`, `primary_hash`, `payload_hash`, etc.* **Silver**: Structured and modeled data, aggregated based on our business model* **Gold**: Smaller, consumer-oriented aggregates for dashboards, specific departments, etc.In the **raw → bronze** step, a colleague taught me to create two hashes:* `primary_hash`: to uniquely identify a record (based on business keys)* `payload_hash`: to detect if a record has changedWe’re using Delta Tables in the bronze layer and the logic is:* **Insert** if the `primary_hash` does not exist* **Update** if the `primary_hash` exists but the `payload_hash` has changed* **Delete** if a `primary_hash` from a previous load is missing in the current extractionThis logic works well *if* we always had a full load.But here's the issue: our source systems deliver **a mix of full and incremental loads**, and in incremental mode, we might only get a tiny fraction of all records. With the current implementation, that results in **95% of the data being deleted**, even though it's still valid – it just wasn't part of the incremental pull.Now I'm wondering: One idea I had was to **add a boolean flag** (e.g. `is_current`) to mark if the record was seen in the latest load, along with a `last_loaded_ts` field. But then the question becomes: **How can I determine if a record is still “active” when I only get partial (incremental) data and no full snapshot to compare against?**Another aspect I’m unsure about is **data retention and storage costs**. The idea was to **keep the full history of records** permanently, so we could go back and see what the data looked like at a certain point in time (e.g., *""What was the state on 2025-01-01?""*). But I’m concerned this could lead to **massive storage costs over time**, especially with large datasets.How do you handle this in practice?* Do you keep historical records in Bronze or move history handling to Silver/Gold?* Do you archive older data somewhere else?* How do you balance auditability and cost?Thanks in advance for any input!

1madx18,Company’s AWS environment is messy as hell.,DeluIuSoIulu,dataengineering,"Joined a new company recently as a data engineer, this company is trying to set up a data warehouse or lake house and is still in the process of discussing. They have AWS environment that they are intending to set up the data warehouse on, but the problem is there are multiple people having access to the environment. In there, we have resources that are spin up by business analysts, data analysts and project managers. There is no clear traceability for the resources as they weren’t deployed using iaac and instead directly on aws console, just imagine a crazy amount of resources like S3, EC2, Lambdas all deployed in silos with no code base to trace them to projects. The only traceable ones are those that are deployed by the data engineering team. My question is, how should we be dealing with the clean up for this environment before we commence with the set up of data warehouse? Do we still give access to the different parties or we should revoke their access to govern and control our warehouse? This has been giving me a big headache when I see all sorts of resources, from production to pet projects to trial and error things in our cloud environment.",32,0.93,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1madx18/companys_aws_environment_is_messy_as_hell/,2025-07-27 05:04:53,2025-07-28 01:57:55

Use 3 layers of spelling corrections using words from a bag of clean words with: word2vec, 2 layers of Levenshtein distance2. Create a master table of all degrees out there over 600 degrees3. Tokenize the free text input column, the degrees column from master table, crossjoin them and creacte a match score with the amount of matching words from the text column against the master data column4. To this point for each row it will have many cnadidates, so we're picking the degree name in which has the highest amount of matching words against the text column5. The output of this method tested with a portion of 500k records, and with 600 degrees in master table, we got over 75% matching score which means we found the equivalent degree name for 75% of the text records, it can be improved by adding more degree names, modify confidence %, and train the model with more dataThis method combines 2 ML models, and finds the best matching degree name against each lineThe output would be like this: id, degree 1, technician in public relations, degree in public relations 2, bachelor in business management, bachelors degree in business management 3, high school diploma, high school degree 4, php, degree in software development 5, dgree in finance, degree in finance 6, masters in cs, masters degree in computer science 7, mstr in logisticss, masters degree in logisticsI made it as a Python library based on PySpark which doesn't require any comercial LLM AI APIs ... fully open source, so that anyone that struggles with the same issue can use the library directly to save time and headachesYou can find the library on PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/](https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/)Or install it directly`pip install pynlpclassifier`I made an [article ](https://medium.com/@hamzahbdeveloper/introducing-pynlpclassifier-correct-the-spelling-and-categorize-large-free-text-input-data-using-da1a93408f30)explainning in depth the library, the functions, and an example of use caseI hope you found my research work helpfull and that can be useful to share with the community.",23,0.88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m5ee4x/i_made_a_python_library_that_corrects_the/,2025-07-21 09:31:59,2025-07-28 01:57:55

1m9c42u,"Modernizing our data stack, looking for practical advice",Ahmouu,dataengineering,"TL;DR We’re in the parking industry, running Talend Open Studio + PostgreSQL + shell scripts (all self-hosted). It’s a mess! Talend is EOL, buggy, and impossible to collaborate on. We're rebuilding with open-source tools, without buying into the modern data stack hype.Figuring out:* The right mix of tools for ELT and transformation* Whether to centralize all customer data (ClickHouse) or keep siloed Postgres per tenant* Whether to stay batch-first or prepare for streaming. Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.\---Hey all!We’re currently modernizing our internal data platform and trying to do it without going on a shopping spree across the modern data stack hype.# Current setup:* PostgreSQL (\~80–100GB per customer, growing \~5% yearly), Kimball Modelling with facts & dims, only one schema, no raw data or staging area* Talend Open Studio OS (free, but EOL)* Shell scripts for orchestration* Tableau Server* ETL approach* Sources: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, APIs, flat filesWe're in the parking industry and handle data like parking transactions, payments, durations, etc. We don’t need real-time yet, but streaming might become relevant (think of live occupancies, etc) so we want to stay flexible.# Why we’re moving on:Talend Open Studio (free version) is a nightmare. It crashes constantly, has no proper git integration (kinda impossible to work as a team) and it's not supported anymore.Additionally, we have no real deployment cycle, we do it all via shell scripts from deployments to running our etls (yep... you read that right) and waste hours and days on such topics.We have no real automations - hotfixes, updates, corrections are all manual and risky.We’ve finally convinced management to let us change the tech stack and started hearing words ""modern this, cloud that"", etc... But we’re not replacing the current stack with 10 overpriced tools just because someone slapped “modern” on the label.We’re trying to build something that:* Actually works for our use case* Is maintainable, collaborative, and reproducible* Keeps our engineers and company market-relevant* And doesn’t set our wallets on fire# Our modernization idea:* Python + PySpark for pipelines* ELT instead of ETL* Keep postgres but add staging and raw schemas additionally to the analytics/business one* Airflow for orchestration* Maybe dbt for modeling / we’re skeptical* Great Expectations for data validation* Vault for secrets* Docker + Kubernetes + Helm for containerization and deployment* Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring/logging* Git for everything - versioning, CI/CD, reviews, etc.All self-hosted and open-source (for now).# The big question: architectureStill not sure whether to go:* Centralized: ClickHouse with flat, denormalized tables for all customers (multi-tenant)* Siloed: One Postgres instance per customer (better isolation, but more infra overhead)Our sister company went full cloud using Debezium, Confluent Cloud, Kafka Streams, ClickHouse, etc. It looks blazing fast but also like a cost-heavy setup. We’re hesitant to go that route unless it becomes absolutely necessary.I believe having one hosted instance for all customers might not be a bad idea in general and would make more sense than having to deploy a ""product"" to 10 different servers for 10 different customers.# Questions for the community:* Anyone migrated off Talend Open Studio? How did it go, and what did you switch to?* If you’re self-hosted on Postgres, is dbt worth it?* Is self-hosting Airflow + Spark painful, or fine with the right setup?* Anyone gone centralized DWH and regretted it? Or vice versa?* Doing batch now but planning for streaming - anything we should plan ahead for?* Based on our context, what would your rough stack look like?We’re just trying to build something solid and clean and not shoot ourselves in the foot by following some trendy nonsense.Appreciate any advice, stories, or “wish I had known earlier” insights.

The current architecture is that we replicate the production Postgres DB to another RDS instance which is considered our data warehouse. - I create views in Postgres - use Logstash to send that data from DW to Kibana- make basic visuals in KibanaWe also use Tray.io for bringing in Data from sources like Surveymonkey and Mixpanel (platform that captures user behavior)Now the thing is i haven't really worked on the mainstream tools like snowflake, redshift and haven't worked on any orchestration tool like airflow as well. The main business objectives are to track revenue, platform engagement, jobs in a dashboard. I have recently explored Tableau and the team likes it as well. 1.

1m7gzmh,Snowflake: Way for analysts to enter object metadata without transferring full OWNERSHIP of objects,nosebrocolli,dataengineering,"Snowflake provides very nice UIs for entering metadata on tables, views and columns (with the option of AI text generation). But in order to use these nifty metadata UIs, the Snowflake analysts must use a role that has been transferred OWNERSHIP of the objects. Unfortunately, having OWNERSHIP also allows these analysts to drop, create and alter objects which are inappropriate privileges for most of them. Also, transferring ownership of Snowflake objects to many new roles is complicated and can effectively break views for end users and change our ""future"" role assignments. I wish there was a METADATA privilege that was dedicated to allowing the creation and management of object metadata, but there isn't. Does anyone know of a work-around?

1m9nykt,Data Quality Profiling/Reporting tools,Kojimba228,dataengineering,"Hi,When trying to Google for the tools matching my usecass, there is so much bloat, blurred definitions and ads that I'm confused out of my mind with this one. I will attempt to describe my requirements to the best of my ability, with certain constraints that we have and which are mandatory. Okay, so, our usecase is consuming a dataset via AWS Lakeformation shared access. Read-only, with the dataset being governed by another team (and very poorly at that).Data in the tables is partitioned on two keys, each representing a source database and schema from which a given table was ingested. Primarily, the changes that we want to track are: 1. count of nulls in columns of each table (an average would do, I think; reason for it is they once have pushed a change where nulls occupied majority of the columns and records, which went unnoticed for some time :smiling_face_with_tear:)2. changes in table volume (only increase is expected, but you never know)3. schema changes (either Data type changes, or, primarily, new column additions)4. Place for extended fancy reports to feed to BAs to do some digging, but if not available it's not a showstopper. To do the profiling/reporting we have the option of using Glue (with PySpark), Lambda functions, Athena. This what I tried so far:1. Gx. Overbloated, overcomplicated, doesn't do simple or extended summary reports, without predefined checks/""expectations"";2. Ydata-profiling. Doesn't support missing values check with PySpark, even if provided PySpark dataframe it casts it to pandas (bruh). 3. Just write custom PySpark code to collect the required checks. While doable, yes, setting up another visualisation layer on top, is surely going to be a pain in the ass. Plus, all this feels like redeveloping the wheel. Am I wrong to assume that a tool exists that has the capabilities described?

1m8yuyv,Newbie question | Version control for SQL queries?,HotDamnNam,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,Bit of a newbie question for all you veterans.We're transitioning to Microsoft Fabric and Azure DevOps. Some of our Data Analysts have asked about version control for their SQL queries. It seems like a very mature and useful practice, and I’d love to help them get set up properly. However, I’m not entirely sure what the current best practices are.So far, I’ve found that I can query our Fabric Warehouse using the MSSQL extension in VSCode. It’s a bit of a hassle since I have to manually copy the query into a `.sql` file and push it to DevOps using Git. But at least everything happens in one program: querying, watching results, editing, and versioning.That said, our analysts typically work directly in Fabric and don’t use VSCode. Ideally, they’d be able to query and version their SQL directly within Fabric, without switching environments. From what I’ve seen, Fabric doesn’t seem to support source control for SQL queries natively (outside of notebooks). Or am I missing something?Curious to hear how others are handling this, with and without Fabric.Thanks in advance!Edit: forgot to mention I used Git as well, haha",9,0.91,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m8yuyv/newbie_question_version_control_for_sql_queries/,2025-07-25 13:14:38,2025-07-28 01:57:55

1m81i0v,Liquibase best practices,tech-man-ua,dataengineering,"I am building a Liquibase foundation for one of our repositories and have a couple of questions in mind. I went through the official 'best practices' page multiple times, Liquibase forum and other pages, but still can't get complete answers. I am using community edition + PostgreSQL. I am a backend engineer, not a DB person.1. >Unless you are grouping several changes as a single transaction, we strongly encourage you to specify only one change per changeset. This approach makes each change ""atomic"" within a single transaction.I understand the reasoning behind this: some DBMS, including Postgre I use, auto-commit DDL statements such as *createTable, createTrigger,* so if I have multiple DDLs in a single changeset and error happens on the later one, Liquibase does not mark the whole changeset as ""RUN"", but because every successful DDL is going to be auto-committed, this creates a conflict whenever I retrigger the update.What is unclear to me is if I should **ALWAYS** create single 'atomic' changesets for DDL operations? I do createTable that should have a Foreign Key index so the next command would be createIndex on that FK. Logically, createTable and createIndex should be considered as a single operation so it makes sense to group them. But because they are DDLs, should I split them up?2. I am following Liquibase recommendation to have a separate changelog for rerunnable (runOnChange = true) logic such as functions / triggers. That is going to be similar question to #1. Because my trigger/function declarations have DROP IF EXISTS or CREATE OR REPLACE, I could group them under the same changeset. But is it correct? databaseChangeLog: - changeSet: id: periods-log-trigger author: XYZ runOnChange: true changes: - sqlFile: path: db/functions/periods-log.function.sql - sqlFile: path: db/triggers/periods-log.trigger.sql rollback: - sql: sql: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS periods_log_function()3. Back to table and its trigger. createTable has auto-rollback out-of-the-box. Because trigger does not make sense without a table, when table is dropped, trigger is dropped automatically. Although I still need to drop the function used in the trigger.Because createTable and trigger changelog are two separate changesets, how should one manage rollback? Do I always need to write a rollback for trigger even though it is going to be dropped if table is dropped?Thanks everyone!",7,0.78,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m81i0v/liquibase_best_practices/,2025-07-24 11:09:28,2025-07-28 01:57:55

1m5cioo,Inserting audit record with dbt / Snowflake,backend-dev,dataengineering,"What is a good approach when you want to insert an audit record into a table using dbt & Snowflake? The audit record should be atomic with the actual data that was inserted, but because dbt does not support Snowflake transactions, this seems not possible. My thoughts are to insert the audit record in the post-hook, but if the audit record insert fails for some reason, my audit and actual data will be out of sync.What is the best approach to get around this limitation.I did try to add begin transaction as the first pre-hook and commit as the last post-hook, but although it works, it is hacky and then locks the table if there is a failure due to no rollback being executed.EDIT: Some more infoMy pipeline will run every 4 hours or thereabouts and the target table will grow fairly large (already >1B rows). I am trying strategies for saving on cost (minimising bytes scanned, etc).The source data has an updated_at field and in the dbt model I use: select from source where updated_at > (select max(updated_at) from target). The select max(updated_at) from target is computed from metadata, so is quite efficient (0 bytes scanned).I want to gather stats and audit info (financial data) for each of my runs. E.g. min(updated_at), max(updated_at), sum(some_value) & rowcount of each incremental load. Each incremental load does have a unique uid, so one could query from the target table after append, but that is likely going to scan a lot of data.To mitigate against having to scan the target table for run stats, my thoughts were to stage the increment using a separate dbt model ('staging'). This staging model will stage the increment as a new table, extract the audit info from the staged increment and write the audit log. Then another model ('append') will append the staged increment to the target table. There are a few issues with this as well, including re-staging a new increment before the previous increment was appended. But I have ways around that, but it relies on the fact that audit records for both the staging runs and append runs are correctly and reliably inserted. Hence the question.",7,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m5cioo/inserting_audit_record_with_dbt_snowflake/,2025-07-21 07:31:42,2025-07-28 01:57:55

1m7a7ti,From Architecture to Product design vs data analytics,AmbitiousMagazine846,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I’ve been working in architecture and urban planning for about 6–7 years now, and honestly, I’m burnt out. The environment is draining, the market is saturated, the pay is low, and growing into senior roles feels nearly impossible unless you tolerate long-term toxicity, unpaid competitions, and constant deadline stress.I studied and worked in Germany, and I’m at a point where I’m seriously considering a shift. I’ve always had an interest in:•Coding•Data•Trends and analysis•Logical thinkingAt the same time, I’ve always had a creative eye. I care a lot about user experience — not just in buildings or cities, but in how people interact with things in general. That’s what drew me to look into Product Design and Data Analytics as possible career paths.The thing is, job listings for data analytics seem higher in Germany. Product design roles are fewer, which makes me nervous. But I’m worried:•Will product design be just another draining, underpaid creative field like architecture?•Will data analytics be too dry or rigid long term?•And realistically, which path is better for career growth and salary in the long run?I’m not expecting overnight success, but I also don’t want to be stuck at a junior/mid salary range forever. I’m trying to find something where I can grow steadily, have a healthier work-life balance, and still enjoy what I do.If anyone here has made the leap from architecture to either field (or knows someone who did), I’d love to hear what made the difference for you, and what you’d recommend.Thanks in advance :folded_hands_medium-light_skin_tone:",4,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m7a7ti/from_architecture_to_product_design_vs_data/,2025-07-23 14:07:23,2025-07-28 01:57:55

1marnw3,Dimensional Modeling Periodic Snapshot Standard Practices,Boltonet12,dataengineering,"Our company is relatively new to using dimensional models but we have a need for viewing account balances at certain points in time. Our company has billions of customer accounts so to take daily snapshots of these balances would be millions per day (excluding 0 dollar balances because our business model closes accounts once reaching 0). What I've imagined was creating a periodic snapshot fact table where the balance for each account would utilize the snapshot from the end of the day but only include rows for end of week, end of month, and yesterday (to save memory and processing for days we are not interested in); then utilize a flag in the date dimension table to filter to monthly dates, weekly dates, or current data. I know standard periodic snapshot tables have predefined intervals; to me this sounds like a daily snapshot table that utilizes the dimension table to filter to the dates you're interested in. My leadership seems to feel that this should be broken out into three different fact tables (current, weekly, monthly). I feel that this is excessive because it's the same calculation (all time balance at end of day) and could have overlap (i.e. yesterday could be end of week and end of month). Since this is balances at a point in time at end of day and there is no aggregations to achieve ""weekly"" or ""monthly"" data, what is standard practice here? Should we take leadership's advice or does it make more sense the way I envisioned it?

1ma19ck,App Integrations and the Data Lake,Full_Metal_Analyst,dataengineering,"We're trying to get away from our legacy DE tool, BO Data Services. A couple years ago we migrated our on prem data warehouse and related jobs to ADLS/Synapse/Databricks. Our app to app integrations that didn't source from the data warehouse were out of scope for the migration and those jobs remained in BODS. Working tables and history are written to an on prem SQL server, and the final output is often csv files that are sftp'ed to the target system/vendor. For on-prem targets, sometimes the job writes the data directly in.We'll eventually drop BODS altogether, but for now we want to build any new integrations using our new suite of tools. We have our first new integration we want to build outside of BODS, but after I saw the initial architecture plan for it, I brought together a larger architect group to discuss and align on a standard for this type of use case. The design was going to use a medallion architecture in the same storage account and bronze/silver/gold containers as the data warehouse uses and write back to the same on prem SQL we've been using, so I wanted to have a larger discussion about how to design for this.We've had our initial discussion and plan on continuing early next week, and I feel like we've improved a ton on the design but still have some decisions to make, especially around storage design (storage accounts, containers, folders) and where we might put the data so that our reporting tool can read it (on-prem SQL server write back, Azure SQL database, Azure Synapse, Databricks SQL warehouse).Before we finalize our standard for app integrations, I wanted to see if anyone had any specific guidance or resources I could read up on to help us make good decisions.For more context, we don't have any specific iPaaS tools, and the integrations that we support are fine to be processed in batches (typically once a day but some several times a day), so real-time/event-based use cases are not something we need to solve for here. We'll be using Databricks Python notebooks for the logic, unity catalog managed tables for storage (ADLS), and likely piloting orchestration using Datbricks for this first integration too (orchestration has been using Azure up to now).Thanks in advance for any help!",3,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ma19ck/app_integrations_and_the_data_lake/,2025-07-26 18:56:38,2025-07-28 01:57:55

I knew the syntax. I could explain concepts. But I couldn't *build* anything meaningful without a step-by-step guide.Sound familiar? I've come to call this the competent imposter phase - where you understand enough to recognize good code, but not enough to produce it independently.# The Gap No One Talks AboutI've noticed a pattern in programming education that no one seems to address directly: there's a massive cognitive leap between understanding code and generating it. It's like knowing all the rules of chess but having no strategic intuition. You know how the pieces move, but you can't see the patterns that make a good player.After months of frustration, I decided to approach this problem systematically. Here's what I discovered works:# 1. Reverse Engineering > TutorialsInstead of watching more tutorials, I started downloading open-source projects that were *just* beyond my skill level. Not massive frameworks, but small utilities with 300-1000 lines of code.The process: Run the program to understand what it does Read through the code without judgment Delete small sections and try to reimplement them Gradually expand what I deleted until I could recreate substantial portionsThis forced me to think like the original developer rather than just consuming their finished work.# 2. The Tiny Feature TechniqueOne of my breakthroughs came when I stopped trying to build complete applications. Instead, I focused on adding tiny features to existing code:* Take a simple calculator app and add a history feature Add dark mode to a static website Implement a simple search function in a list appThis approach gave me the scaffolding to work within while still requiring creative problem-solving.# 3. Deliberate Debugging PracticeI started intentionally breaking working code, then fixing it. This might sound counterproductive, but it taught me to read error messages properly and understand how the pieces fit together.I'd introduce a bug, wait 24 hours (so I'd forget exactly what I changed), then come back and fix it. This simulated the real-world experience of debugging unfamiliar code.# 4. The Explain It To A Beginner TestAfter implementing something, I forced myself to write an explanation as if teaching it to someone who just started coding. This revealed gaps in my understanding that weren't apparent when I was just following along with tutorials.If I couldn't explain a concept clearly, I knew I needed to revisit it.# 5. Embracing Uncomfortable ToolsI noticed I was avoiding certain technologies because they felt intimidating. For me, this was working with APIs and asynchronous code.So I created a rule: at least once a week, I'd work on something that made me uncomfortable. Not to master it immediately, but to reduce the anxiety around it.# The Mental Shift That Changed EverythingThe biggest change came when I stopped thinking of programming as knowing things and started seeing it as figuring things out.Experienced developers aren't successful because they've memorized everything - they're successful because they've developed robust mental models for approaching new problems. They know how to break down complex tasks, research effectively, and test their assumptions.# My Practical Advice1. **Create a Learning Project** \- A single, evolving project you keep enhancing as you learn new concepts. Mine was a personal book tracking app that grew from a command-line tool to a web app over 6 months.2. **Code Review Yourself** \- After completing something, wait a week, then review your own code as if it was written by someone else. Be critical but constructive.",500,0.96,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m5lmth/breaking_through_the_tutorial_hell_plateau_what_i/,2025-07-21 15:16:08,2025-07-28 01:57:56

1m7okmf,How do I teach programming to high-schoolers with only 40 mins of class a week??,ShlomoCh,learnprogramming,"So I'm a relatively new teacher at a high school (15-17 y/o's), and I teach programming. The subject only has one 40-minute class a week per group, **with no option for giving them homework or anything outside of class hours**.I first learned programming with Unity and C#, and that's what I want to try with them. I think static typing and having an interface is a good way to teach programming, and game dev simply sounds more fun. I tried it already for a few months last year, it didn't really work out, it was too confusing for them. But I still want to give it a shot. (Especially now that I'm actually going to have a fucking projector so they can see my screen). (Hopefully). (Yes this is not a very high-budget school).The idea is to teach them the very basics C# (variables, conditionals, functions, maybe arrays and loops), and have them play with the basic Unity components (sprites, colliders, rigidbodies, and basic GUI). No OOP (except to interact with components). No 3D. No fuss. But even that sounds like too much for our restrictions, with my limited experience.So, how would you approach giving a class like that? I don't know if this is the right place, but I really don't know where else to post this.I'm not married to the idea of Unity or gamedev though, I'm open to suggestions. But it has to be something interactive and graphical so they're interested. Bear in mind these are high-schoolers, most of them aren't interested in programming, and the class is only there to kind of teach them how computers work and how to think systematically.Some other things I've thought of:* Tkinter: don't love the idea of dynamically-typed Python, and not that engaging* Godot: interface more confusing than Unity's imo* Pygame: even if it's simpler, no GUI at all is arguably way harder* Arduino: really cool idea and easier programming, but obviously we'd need Arduinos, which we don't have, and emulators like TinkerCAD just aren't the same* Java forms on NetBeans: not that engagingI'd love to hear any insight or suggestions whatsoever, especially if any of you have been teachers.",96,0.91,225,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m7okmf/how_do_i_teach_programming_to_highschoolers_with/,2025-07-23 23:22:11,2025-07-28 01:57:56

Overall, I think Codefinity is a pretty solid platform for beginners. The interface is simple, and the lessons are broken down into small steps that make it easy to follow along without feeling overwhelmed. I really like that you can write and test code directly in the browser, which saves time switching between different tools. The built‑in AI assistant has also been helpful when I get stuck or need a quick explanation, and that feature makes the learning experience feel more interactive than just watching videos or reading articles.That said, there are some things to keep in mind. The pricing is not very clear at the start, and you only see some details after signing up. A few lessons in the beginning feel too basic if you already have some knowledge, but they do get more interesting as you move forward. I wouldn’t say it is perfect, but it has kept me motivated to practice regularly, which is something I struggled with on other platforms.Just to clarify I’m mainly using it to learn Python and get a stronger foundation in programming before moving on to data analysis and maybe web development later.I’m curious to hear from others who have tried Codefinity for a longer time.

1m92r9a,Getting a CS Degree while already being in the industry? Need an advice.,Delicious-Detail-118,learnprogramming,"I am 24 and have an associate's degree (2 years) in Computer Science. I've been working as a developer in a non-tech company for 4 years making 78k CAD. I am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years. I love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education. However, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities. The reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.So I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.TL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job.

At least I'll have a major and a double minor instead of a double major--my other minor incidentally enough is also one of my favorite hobbies.

So, I would expect that the latest codes will not be defined, as Unicode has not yet used all the available numbers for the 4-byte range. So for now, I'll just check the latest available one and update my code in new Unicode versions.Now, here is the bizarre thing... For some reason, there are undefined codes BETWEEN sets! For some reason, the people who design and implement Unicode decided to leave some codes empty and then, continue normally! For example, the codes between [adlam](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#adlam) and [indic-siyaq-numbers](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#indic-siyaq-numbers) are not defined. What's even more crazy is that in some sets themselves, there are undefined codes. One example is the set [ethiopic-extended-b](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#ethiopic-extended-b) which has about 3 codes not defined.Because of that, what would be just a simple ""start/end"" range check, it will now have to be done with an array that has different ranges. That means more work for me to implement and worse performance to the programs that will use that code.With all that in mind, unless there is a reason that they implemented it that way and someone knows and can tell me, I will have my code consider the undefined codes as valid and just be done with it and everyone that has a problem can just complain to the Unicode organization to fix their mess...",6,0.81,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m5g9ls/why_are_there_so_many_undefined_characters_in/,2025-07-21 11:22:31,2025-07-28 01:57:56

I liked it so much that I switched my major and college just to study CS.My 13 year old brother has recently been interested in programming, mostly because he's intrigued with how a computer works (same reason that made me start CS). He asked for some advice to start, and my plan was this:First, a university (not bootcamp) intro course. I was thinking CS61a but it will probably be too difficult, so maybe CS50x or MIT's intro class (I read SICP so I could help him). Second, at the same time, a quick guide on Lua or some language that will allow him to mod games, or maybe PyGame. I'm skipping Scratch as he wants to actually write code. Another option would be starting with Scheme (the language), as after learning basic Python I read up The Little Schemer and SICP which were crucial to my development as a Computer Scientist.How does all that sound? I like the idea of the uni course over other methods as it's structured, more difficult, they focus on the fundamentals, and I could probably help him if certain parts are too difficult. For those with kids who wanted to learn CS, what did you guys do? Would an intro uni course be too difficult? Also, how did you guys learn CS?

1m7mzt0,Four steps to improving your learning from tutorials,Paxtian,learnprogramming,"There's a lot of talk about being stuck in Tutorial Hell, and I agree, it can definitely be a trap. However, you can get much more out of tutorials if you do more than just simply follow along and do what they tell you to do. Here are my recommended steps to improving what you take away from tutorials, regardless of what you may be trying to learn.First: Follow the tutorial, but stop regularly. After each new concept is introduced (that you're not yet familiar with), whether that's a function, API, keyword, whatever, as soon as the concept is introduced, jump to a Notes document (wherever you happen to take notes: Notepad, CherryTree, Word Doc, Google Doc, whatever it is), and write down the name of the thing. Once the tutorial finishes with that concept, pause it. Go look up whatever it is in the relevant documentation. Read the documentation on that thing. In your notes, write down (in your own words) what you understand about that concept under it: how it's used, arguments, when you used it, what you understand the documentation to mean, etc. Continue in this way until you finish the tutorial. Reread all your notes once the tutorial is over.Second: Do the tutorial again. But start completely fresh. This time, when you get to each new concept, pause the video and try to finish that section completely on your own. Refer to your notes as necessary. If you can't get it working, go back to the tutorial and watch it and do it the way it says. If you make a mistake, revise your notes so that they more clearly explain the concept. If you get it right, rewatch that section of the tutorial and see if your predicted way of getting it to work is the same, or if you did it in a slightly different way. If you did it differently but it still worked, make note of this as an alternative way that also worked. Once the tutorial is over, reread all your notes again.Third: Use each concept from the tutorial in a completely independent way. If you learned 30 concepts, make 30 micro projects focused on those concepts. Use them for something completely different. If two or more concepts depend on each other, combine them as needed. But review the docs and see if they can be used independently, or combined in different ways. Fourth: Do a big, similar project completely on your own that uses the concepts you've learned but in a different way. Review your notes and the documentation as necessary. If you do future tutorials, jump right to the second step: as you do them, rather than following along mindlessly, for each new concept, try to do it on your own. As a new concept starts to be introduced, pause it and try to think about how you'd do it. If you can't, review your notes and see if anything jumps out. If there's still nothing, treat it as going back to the First Step, and watch the tutorial and update your notes, review the documentation, etc. Otherwise, have two parallel projects going: the way this new tutorial does it, and the way you'd do it. For the ""your way"" version, keep it going with your way as long as you can, even if it diverges significantly from the ""tutorial way"" version. If at some point your version just won't work anymore, delete it, copy the tutorial version over, and make that one the new ""your version"" and proceed on with trying to do it your own way. And of course, keep updating your notes as you go, revising and updating and reviewing the documentation as needed. If an existing concept is added to, update it. If new concepts are introduced, add them. Once this new tutorial is done, repeat the third and fourth steps, but with the twist of trying to make a full project that combines both the stuff you learned from previous tutorial(s) and this new tutorial.",3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1m7mzt0/four_steps_to_improving_your_learning_from/,2025-07-23 22:15:25,2025-07-28 01:57:56

For this round, he asked me to implement OpenAI API for text analysis of reviews and auto-suggestions based on customer feedback.

We then did more in-depth technical interviews.Funnily enough, out of the 3 that ended up getting hired, 2 were recommended internally by other coworkers (we have a referral bonus to incentivize them + wanted to hire people who have previously worked with someone on the team who can vouch for their skills) and 1 was hired because they cold DM'd the CEO on twitter (with a surprisingly comprehensive memo on how they'd improve our platform and their relevant experience). So yeah, 500+ applications only to hire people we already kinda knew._If you're getting into CS_: Attend hackathons/conferences, network aggressively during your internships, contribute to popular open-source projects if only to expand your connections, stay in touch with people from your school and former colleagues, hit up your network to reach out if they've a role you'd be a fit for, take initiative and cold DM people. Whatever it takes to build your network and get your foot through the door.__AI slop has fried the brains of a lot of new grads.__Look, I like cursor/claude code as much as anybody else and have no shame in admitting it has boosted my productivity a ton. But interviewing people has made me _very_ glad I graduated before LLMs took off.This is because a lot of candidates were either (a) blatantly cheating during the interview using some sort of AI tool (could tell from their eye movement and/or how they arrived at the correct answer but couldn't justify how they got there at all) OR (b) didn't have the intuition you'd expect from a software engineer who has spent years coding by throwing stuff at the wall and looking things up (""learning how to learn"").I'm personally starting to think AI is a net negative for new grads in that it both nerfs your reasoning muscles (unless u know how to use it properly, i.e as a resource to speed up your learning process wrt core concepts, instead of a black box u mindlessly copy + paste from) AND also forces employers to put higher weight on credentialism (prestige of your school/internships/full time jobs/networking) given the rampant amount of cheating it enables during a remote technical interview.Wouldn't be surprised if in-person interviews became the norm again, which is unfortunate because that would reduce the amount of economic mobility available to someone w/o much experience who say went to a no name school and lives in the middle of nowhere.Good luck!",879,0.94,319,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m7fc13/we_filled_3_roles_at_my_startup_in_2_weeks_heres/,2025-07-23 17:22:35,2025-07-28 01:57:57

1m9n8ew,Got Laid Off 12 Days Ago and Signed an Offer Today - Here's My Sankey Diagram,Yung_Carrot,cscareerquestions,"*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC >$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*I always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)I do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.As for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a ""Mandatory Meeting"" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.I did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only ""automation"" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.The first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.For context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.Of course, this is just one data point.

I found a job at a law firm, which I've been regretting ever since I started. There were a lot of red flags when I started. I found out on the first day that I was a contract worker and not a w-2 employee, this was not mentioned in the interview. I also found out a couple days after I started that the job title changed after I interviewed for a business analyst role, I only found out when I looked at an org chart.The attorney has barely said a few words to me and anytime she does it feels like she's just talking at me.

I always get conflicting instructions, one day she emails me that I need to automate things, the next day I have to justify why programming takes so long. The following day I'm told I need to only do my job title, then the next week she said I stopped programming and need to figure out how to do both.Last week, I was asked to meet with the new HR person who has been firing 2-3 people a week since she started. When I get to her office she told me she wanted to talk about my performance. She said I'm taking too long to finish my programming tasks. She said at her old company they were able to build an architecture, build complete features in 1-2 hours and an entire system in less than a year for all the departments that was even HIPAA compliant.

I have been working extremely hard grinding leetcode, focusing on personal projects, and practicing interviews. I applied to at least 500 jobs and only got called for an interview from 6. Even when my interviews went well, there was always someone better in their eyes. I went to college in a different part of the country, so I don't really have access to those resources anymore. Worst part is how recruiters react when they hear I've been unemployed for 7 months: they either scoff and outright ghost. These all have been taking an extreme toll on my mental health. I've had a few resume reviews 4-5 months ago and all I got were ""it's not you but the current market or ""your profile is extremely strong, keep applying"" but it's only gone downhill from there. I had 4 internships at prestigious companies and all ended with excellent final reports but no return offers due to budget cuts. I'm sending cold messages on LinkedIn constantly but no one responds anymore. All my friends have started ghosting me as well so I can't ask for referrals from them. I can't express how depressed I've been watching all of my peers working at FAANG while I'll be happy to just take any SWE/ML job. I'm happy for them but also upset as I have no idea how to get help. The last call I got from a recruiter, she outright asked me why I don't have a job yet in an extremely condescending manner although that requisition was for someone who graduated within the last year.I'm also a US citizen, so I don't think immigration/visa issues are relevant.I just don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has tips on expanding my network, getting referrals, or anything really, I'd really appreciate it.Tldr; 7 months since graduation and no prospects of new grad roles.

Don't like my team. mean tech lead, scrum master that blames people. asking questions gets uncomfortable. Tech lead gets very irritable very fast. I’d code and he’d giggle and be like “what are you doing.” Small team. This is the biggest problem. tech lead told me 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you.” I do all my user stories, communicate blockers, never caused carry over or even a defect. Received multiple certifications. 4. Disorganized leadership. ""everyone in the department do the same amount of points""(7+). Told me I didn't have to do that since that's for seniors and up, then received bad feedback for not doing that amount of points.5. Seemingly little interest in growing me as a professional or if I even like it here. Getting 60 bucks for a bus ticket to a tech event required a whole written document.

1mabvyv,My skip is blocking my growth and transfer to new team of choice,Comprehensive_Award3,cscareerquestions,"For context, I am in a junior role that is hourly paid and below average pay. I’m not a software engineer but it’s adjacent. In my job description it says I am part of a rotational training program where I will learn and gain experience on three adjacent teams in the same role, that’s why I accepted. I was put on a team with no manager and where all of the team members are remote offshore contractors. My work entailed receiving written tasks that lacked any context and with that got no training or onboarding. I was told not to talk to the requestors directly. This whole time I’ve been there I’ve basically had no manager. There is no path toward growth. With time my team warmed up to me and would help here and there but the start was extra rough. Two months ago I applied to a full time higher paid role in an adjacent department. The next day after the interview, the hiring manager said my department won’t let me go. No one in my department talked to me. The manager that was there for two months but did no managing, had already left. My tech lead gave a green light. So I assumed the hiring manager was letting me down softly or that there are some company policies, like I haven’t been there long enough. The policies in this company change whichever way suits them btw. Very recently two people in my role left an adjacent team. This team was supposed to be one of my rotations. I have been here long enough to rotate. This team is in person and the manager is a good manager and the people are knowledgeable, so I reached out to join their team. The hiring manager said yes. My tech lead gave a green light. My new manager, who also hasn’t done any managing so far, gave a green light. The HR gave a green light. During my first one on one with my manager I was told “Skip said you will either stay on your current team or will join ‘team that doesn’t exist yet and does work that is not my role’.” I was baffled. When I said “but I want to do my role and rotations are in my job description” my manager gaslighted and told me that the team I applied to doesn’t do my role. Ladies and gents, the titles are exactly the same as mine. I went to HR. HR was also baffled. Obviously I am already applying externally. But I am so upset that my chance to grow in my career was arbitrarily blocked and that now they are blatantly going against policies and my job description. It is very not palatable, I feel that I am an object, and honestly this smells of misogyny.",21,0.83,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mabvyv/my_skip_is_blocking_my_growth_and_transfer_to_new/,2025-07-27 03:11:35,2025-07-28 01:57:57

1ma938h,Junior Dev Acting as Scrum Master,Luistreakkk,cscareerquestions,"Hey folks, **I’m a junior full-stack developer (1 year of experience - 21M) in a brand-new team (for a new product) in a large company**. We’re starting a greenfield product with no customers yet, just groundwork for now, some initial development, and a basic backlog started. There are two other teams that have been working on early components, but in a few months, we’ll fully own the product.My main role is as a developer, but I’ve also been asked to serve as Scrum Master (SAFE Setup) since no one else on the team is available or interested in the role.Here’s the current team setup:* **PDA - PO** with 10 years of experience, new in the company.* **PDA - Ex-PO/SM** with 16 years of experience, who explicitly doesn’t want to take either role again.* **QA** with 4 years of experience, focused on testing, new in the company.* **Designer** with 10 years of experience, new in the company.* **Intern** (no experience)* **Another junior dev** (part-time), new in the company.* And me: junior dev (1 year), but full-time and with prior leadership experience (university + team projects), also new in the company (1.5 months).I feel confident handling daily Scrum stuff: dailies, retros, keeping the board clean, etc. But what worries me is the larger-scale part of the role, like:* Participating in my **first PI Planning*** Representing the team in **Scrum of Scrums*** Collaborating with **more experienced SMs** across the companyAlso, I’m a bit worried about my time management, since I know I will have to balance the DEV work with the SM one. We’re only 6–7 people now, so the process still feels informal, but it’ll get more structured soon, the team will grow in the next 3 months as they will start allocating more resources to this new project (it is part of the stablished roadmap).**I know this is a rare and valuable opportunity this early in my career**, and I’m genuinely excited to grow into it. That said, I can’t help but feel a bit anxious about the expectations, balancing both development and Scrum Master responsibilities is a lot, and I worry about the impact if I don’t perform well in either.I’ve been clear from the start that this will be a learning process, and thankfully my manager has been very supportive. He’s encouraged me to make mistakes, learn quickly, and not stress about the consequences as long as I’m acting with good intentions and seeking guidance. That mindset helps, but I still want to do my best and make sure I’m not holding the team back. **I also can’t shake the feeling that if I lose this opportunity, I might not get another like it for a long time, at least not until I’ve gained many more years of experience since I think I'd like to evolve into more management related positions in the future. That adds some pressure, because I know how rare it is to be trusted with this kind of responsibility so early in a career.**Any advice from people who’ve started as Dev Scrum Masters in small teams inside big organizations would be really appreciated, especially tips on how to **gain confidence in large-scale ceremonies** and not feel lost.Thanks in advance!",14,0.65,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ma938h/junior_dev_acting_as_scrum_master/,2025-07-27 00:46:59,2025-07-28 01:57:57

A little background, I have a Bachelor's degree in CS and I graduated in 2021. I was unemployed for a little over two years due to having to take care of my family + my own mental health issues. Since then, I've had a full-time job in the biopharmaceutical industry. I don't do anything with tech or CS really at my current job, besides a little bit database management (Not that I'm writing the SQL or anything). I've been working here for almost two years now. I mostly work on the equipment in our lab and do a good amount of troubleshooting/small engineering stuff on the robotics in the lab. I'm kind of burning out of this place and don't like my current job too much. I want to break into the tech industry. It doesn't have to be a SWE position or anything, just something tech-related or CS adjacent.I was wondering what steps I can take in my situation to start learning again and be ready to apply to CS Jobs? I honestly forgot like 95% of what I learned about programming and my other CS courses from just not doing it consistently since I graduated, but I would be willing to take online courses or put in a lot of time to learning again. Unfortunately, I don't have any internship experience related to CS as I switched to CS later in my college career and just rushed to finish the degree in a shorter time so I wouldn't have to take out more in student loans.Where do you think a good starting point is to get back into it? What kind of projects can I make that would help me stand out? And is there a larger demand for full-stack engineers or data analysts in the healthcare/biopharma industry?

My manager messaged us saying that leadership wants ai to take over all code production very soon and that we should be rapidly working towards that by the end of the year.Of course none of us, including my manager, think that’s possible.

However, he gave us advice that we should present ourselves as AI experts right now. He said we could do that by learning how to use the AI tools to take over small tasks as much possible and teaching others to do the same.So the question is, where do I go from here? Based on these estimates, I could stay at that FAANG company for a few more years and then job hop to a company that hasn’t migrated to AI software.

1m92s7t,Getting a CS Degree while already being in the industry? Need an advice.,Delicious-Detail-118,cscareerquestions,"I am 24 and have an associate's degree (2 years) in Computer Science. I've been working as a developer in a non-tech company for 4 years making 78k CAD. I am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years. I love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education. However, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities. The reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.So I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.TL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job.

Will just share that I am an ex-solo founder with <3 years of experience and non-technical background.* I am a US citizen living in a US tech hub.* I spent approximately 1 month in the job hunt.* Nearly 100% of my interviews were for early-stage AI startups.* Applications were 90% LinkedIn. No cover letters or personalized messages.* Step 1 was typically vetting call from recruiter or an intro from a founder.* Step 2 was typically a technical assessment or take home project.* Step 3 was typically a culture fit or technical discussion (eg. system design).* Step 4 was typically an onsite (culture fit, system design, problem solving).Some reflections:* There is a new wave of AI startup funding, which provides opportunities for people who are willing to learn quickly.* I'm a builder. My chances were significantly higher if there was a take home project involved.* Startups almost never ask LeetCode problems directly.* If startups really like you in one way, they can look past your weaknesses in other areas.* Startups hire quickly. If you vibe well and pass everything, an offer can made very quickly.My advice for anyone interested in working in the startup space for this new AI wave of funding, especially from non-traditional backgrounds:* Try to build your own company. This is literally the saying, ""Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."" This immediately shows culture alignment. They are looking for people who have tolerated high risk situations.* Practice system design, especially the problem: ""If you're given 10,000 PDF documents, how do you build a chatbot to answer questions about these documents?"" Almost every startup right now is working on some variation of this problem.* Both technical and behavioral questions are assessing your ability to tolerate ambiguity.
