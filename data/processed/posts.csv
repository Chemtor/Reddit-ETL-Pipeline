1l3x7vk,A disaster waiting to happen,kerokero134340,dataengineering,"TLDR; My company wants to replace our pipelines with some all-in-one “AI agent” platformI’m a lone data engineer in a mid-size retail/logistics company that runs SAP ERP (moving to HANA soon). Historically, every department pulled SAP data into Excel, calculated things manually, and got conflicting numbers. I was hired into a small analytics unit to centralize this. I’ve automated data pulls from SAP exports, APIs, scrapers, and built pipelines into SQL Server. It’s traceable, consistent, and used regularly.Now, our new CEO wants to “centralize everything” and “go AI-driven” by bringing in a no-name platform that offers:\- Limited source connectors for a basic data lake/warehouse setup\- A simple SQL interface + visualization tools\- And the worst of it all: an AI agent PER DEPARTMENTEach department will have its own AI “instance” with manually provided business context. Example: “This is how finance defines tenure,” or “Sales counts revenue like this.” Then managers are supposed to just ask the AI for a metric, and it will generate SQL and return the result. Supposedly, this will replace 95–97% of reporting, instantly (and the CTO/CEO believe it).Obviously, I’m extremely skeptical:\- Even with perfect prompts and context, if the underlying data is inconsistent (e.g. rehire dates in free text, missing fields, label mismatches), the AI will silently get it wrong.\- There’s no way to audit mistakes, so if a number looks off, it’s unclear who’s accountable. If a manager believes it, it may go unchallenged.\- The answer to every flaw from them is: “the context was insufficient” or “you didn’t prompt it right.” That’s not sustainable or realistic\- Also some people (probs including me) will have to manage and maintain all the departmental context logic, deal with messy results, and take the blame when AI gets it wrong.\- Meanwhile, we already have a working, auditable, centralized system that could scale better with a real warehouse and a few more hires. They just don't want to hire a team or I have to convince them somehow (bc they think that this is a cheaper, more efficient alternative).I’m still relatively new in this company and I feel like I’m not taken seriously, but I want to push back before we go too far, I'll switch jobs probably soon anyway but I'm actually concerned about my team.How do I convince the management that this is a bad idea?",206,0.97,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l3x7vk/a_disaster_waiting_to_happen/,2025-06-05 11:52:01,2025-06-11 01:44:19

We just recently started using GIT for our SQL development and while the team is technically adapting to it, they're not really embracing it. There's a strong resistance to anything that might be seen as ""overhead"" like data orchestration, basic testing, good modelling, single definitions for business logic, etc. Things like QA or proper reviews are not treated with much importance because the priority is speed, even though it's very obvious that our output as a team is often chaotic (and we end up in many ""emergency data request"" situations).The problem is that the work we produce is often rushed and full of issues. We frequently ship dashboards or models that contain errors and don't scale. There's no real documentation or data lineage. And when things break, the fixes are usually quick patches rather than root cause fixes.It's been wearing on me a little. I care a lot about doing things properly.

There are many students enrolled now, and very few coaches are available. Sometimes, the availability of the coaches is more than 2 weeks away.- Coaches and their teams response time is quite slow. Sometimes the coaches don’t even respond. Only 1:1 was a good experience.- Sometimes the group sessions gets cancelled with no prior information, and they provide no platform to check if the session will begin or not.- Job application process and their follow ups are below average. They did not follow the job location preference and where just randomly appling to any DE role irrespective of which level you belong to.- For the job applications, they initially showed a list of referrals supported, but were not using that during the application process. Had to intervene multiple times, and then only a few of those companies from the referral list were used. - Had to start applying on my own, as their job search process was not that reliable.————————————————————————Overall, except the 1:1 with the coaches, I felt there was no benefit.

I asked some of my senior colleagues if they had same, but all of them do not have an online accessible portfolio aside from Github to showcase their work. Still, I believe that github is a bit difficult to navigate for non-tech people (as HR) an dthe only insight they can easily get is how active you are on it, which I personally do not believe is equal to your expertise. For instance when I was still a newbie, I would just Update [README.md](http://google.com) to reflect I was active for the day, daily.I want to ask how fellow data engineers showcase their expertise visually. I believe that we work on sesitive company data which we cannot share openly, so I wanna know how you were able to navigate on that, too, without legal implications...My blog is still in development (so I can't share it) and I wanna showcase my certificates there as well.

1l7quka,Career pivot advice: Data Engineering → Potential CTO role (excited but terrified),Ok-Comfortable7656,dataengineering,"TL;DR: I have 7 years of experience in data engineering. Just got laid off. Now I’m choosing between staying in my comfort zone (another data role) or jumping into a potential CTO position at a startup—where I’d have to learn the MERN stack from scratch. Torn between safety and opportunity.Background:I’m 28 and have spent the last 7 years working primarily as a Cloud Data Engineer (most recently in a Lead role), with some Solutions Engineering work on the side. I got laid off last week and, while still processing that, two new paths have opened up. One’s predictable. The other’s risky but potentially career-changing.Option 1: Potential CTO role at a trading startup• Small early-stage team (2–3 engineers) building a medium-frequency trading platform for the Indian market (mainly F&O)• A close friend is involved and referred me to manage the technical side, they see me as a strong CTO candidate if things go well• Solid funding in place; runway isn’t a concern right now• Stack is MERN, which I’ve never worked with! I’d need to learn it from the ground up• They’re willing to fully support my ramp-up• 2–3 year commitment expected• Compensation is roughly equal to what I was earning beforeOption 2: Data Engineering role with a previous client• Work involves building a data platform on GCP• Very much in my comfort zone; I’ve done this kind of work for years• Slight pay bump• Feels safe, but also a bit stagnant—low learning, low riskWhat’s tearing me up:• The CTO role would push me outside my comfort zone and force me to become a more well-rounded engineer and leader• My Solutions Engineering background makes me confident I can bridge tech and business, which the CTO role demands• But stepping away from 7 years of focused data engineering experience—am I killing my momentum?• What if the startup fails? Will a 2–3 year detour make it harder to re-enter the data space?• The safe choice is obvious—but the risk could also pay off big, in terms of growth and leadership experiencePersonal context:• I don’t have major financial obligations right now—so if I ever wanted to take a risk, now’s probably the time• My friend vouched for me hard and believes I can do this. If I accept, I’d want to commit fully for at least a couple of yearsQuestions for you all:• Has anyone made a similar pivot from a focused engineering specialty (like data) to a full-stack or leadership role?• If so, how did it impact your career long-term? Any regrets?• Did you find it hard to return to your original path, or was the leadership experience a net positive?• Or am I overthinking this entirely?Thanks for reading this long post—honestly just needed to write it out.

Hello everyone! I was looking around this Reddit and thought it would be a good place to ask for some advice. Long story short I am a dashboard-developer who also for some reason does programming/pipelines for our scripts that run only on schedule (no events). I don’t have any prior background on data engineering but on our 3 man team I’m the one with the most experience in Python. We had been using Prefect which was going well before they moved to a paid model to use our own compute. Previously I had about 25 scripts that would launch at different times to my worker on our company server using prefect. It sadly has to be on my local instance of our server since they rely on something called Alteryx which our two data analysts use basically exclusively. I liked prefects UI but not the 100$ a month price tag. I don’t really have the bandwidth or good-will credits with our IT to advocate for the self-hosted version. I’ve been thinking of ways to mimic what we had before but I’m at a loss. I don’t know how to have something ‘talk’ to my local like prefect was when the worker was live. I could set up windows task scheduler but tbh when I first started I inherited a bunch of them and hated the transfer process/setup. My boss would also like to be able to see the ‘failures’ if any happen. We have things like bitbucket/s3/snowflake that we use to host code/data/files but basically always pull them down to our local/ inside Alteryx.

Legacy business that does great work, but hasn't changed in roughly 15-20 years. We have some rockstar DBA's, but they're older and have basically never touched cloud services or ""big"" data. Integrations are SSIS packages and scripts that are kind of in version control, data testing is manual, data analysts have no ability to define or alter tables even though they know the SQL. The business is expanding! It's a good place to be. As we expand, it's challenging our existing model. Our speed of execution is showing the bottlenecks around the DBA team, with one Hero Dev doing the majority of the work. They're wrapped up in application changes, warehouse changes, and analytics changes, and feel like they have to touch every part of the process or else everything will break (because again, tests are manual and we're only kind of doing version control).I'm working with the team on how we can address this. My plan is something like:* Break responsibility apart into the different teams * Application team is responsible for the application DB * DBA team is responsible for the system of record data warehouse and integrations and consults on design decisions * Analytics team is responsible for reports, \*including any underlying SQL and reporting warehouse structure\** Advocate for my Hero Dev to take a promotion towards a data architect and design consulting role bridging the teams, with other DBA's taking on more of the development.* Work on adding automated testing to our existing SSIS packages, then work towards having them built into a CI/CD process* Work with the analyst team on having their own server + database where they can use a framework or even Fabric to manage their tables and semantic layer themselves.I acknowledge this is a super high-level plan with a lot of hand-waving.

Particularly when you don't have a mandate to implement a top-down master data management approach?Off the top of my head the solutions I've read are:1. Implement a top-down master data management approach. This authorizes you to compel the owners of the source data stores to conform their master data to some standard (e.g., everyone must conform to System X regarding the list of Departments)2. Implement some kind of mdm tool, which imports data from multiple systems, creates a ""master"" record based on the different sources, and serves as either a cross reference or updates the source system. Often used for things like customers. I would assume now MDM tools include some sort of LLM/Machine Learning to make better deicisions.3. within the data warehouse store build cross references as you detect anomalies (e.g, system X adds department ""Shops"" - there is no department ""Shops"", so you temporarily give this a unknown dimension entry, then later when you figure out that ""Shops"" is department 12345 add a cross reference and on the next pass its reassigned to 12345.4. force child systems to at least incorporate the ""owning"" systems unique identifier as a field (e.g, if you have departments then one of your fields must be the department id from System X which owns departments). then in the warehouse each of these rows ties to a different dimension, but since one of the columns is always the System X department ID, users can filter on that.Are there other design patterns I'm missing?",9,0.82,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l820qc/patterns_of_master_data_dimension_reconciliation/,2025-06-10 15:41:53,2025-06-11 01:44:19

In this case, the silver layer is being skipped entirely, and the gold layer will serve as a 1:1 technical copy of the source views.While working on the development, I noticed that some of these source views contain duplicate records. I recommended introducing logical business keys to ensure uniqueness and preserve data quality, even though we’re not implementing dimensional modeling. However, the team responsible for the source system insists that the views should be replicated as-is and that it’s unnecessary to define any keys at all.I’m not convinced this is a good approach, especially for a layer that will be used for downstream reporting and analytics.What would you do in this case?Would you still enforce some form of business key validation in the gold layer, even when doing a simple pass-through replication?Thanks in advance.",5,0.79,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l4as6j/how_to_handle_source_table_replication_with/,2025-06-05 21:12:17,2025-06-11 01:44:19

Some tasks are depend on others so we can fill dependency trees. But not just one, as there are subsets of tasks that do not depend on any other subsets of tasks. So those subsets can run parallel (as without dependency connection they can be started immediately by the platform).I work in Databricks, which does not allow limiting the number of in-progress tasks at once. If there are too many in-progress tasks, the driver node may receive too large workload and crash.1. Upscale driver: I do not need this, I could wait for normal, slower, cheaper run.2. Add a normal dependency from the end of A subtree to the beginning of B subtree. This way I can limit the number of in-progress tasks, but if something in A fails, B will not start. Also it messes up lineage reporting.3. Same as #2 but the dependency type is All Done. The problem is that if something in A fails, B is started and if it finishes successfully, the pipeline hides the error from A.4. Create ""dummy tasks"" as checkpoints, connect 10 tasks to the first, checkpoint, connect another 10 ... This would kill the overall performance.5. Create separated workflows to all dependent subset of tasks, and use All Done connection type between them, and set up error reporting to the sub-workflows.6.

1l5iv1q,Suggestions welcome: Data ingestion gzip vs uncompressed data in Spark?,devanoff214,dataengineering,"I'm working on some data pipelines for a new source of data for our data lake, and right now we really only have one path to get the data up to the cloud. Going to do some hand-waving here only because I can't control this part of the process (for now), but a process is extracting data from our mainframe system as text (csv), and then compressing the data, and then copying it out to a cloud storage account in S3.Why compress it? Well, it does compress well; we see around \~30% space saved and the data size is not small; we're going from roughly 15GB per extract to down to 4.5GB. These are averages; some days are smaller, some are larger, but it's in this ballpark. Part of the reason for the compression is to save us some bandwidth and time in the file copy.So now, I have a spark job to ingest the data into our raw layer, and it's taking longer than I \*feel\* it should take. I know that there's some overhead to reading compressed .gzip (I feel like I read somewhere once that it has to read the entire file on a single thread first). So the reads and then ultimately the writes to our tables are taking a while, longer than we'd like, for the data to be available for our consumers.The debate we're having now is where do we want to ""eat"" the time:* Upload uncompressed files (vs compressed) so longer times in the file transfer* Add a step to decompress the files before we read them* Or just continue to have slower ingestion in our pipelinesMy argument is that we can't beat physics; we are going to have to accept some length of time with any of these options. I just feel as an organization, we're over-indexing on a solution. So I'm curious which ones of these you'd prefer?

I began with BASIC and assembler on a C64, then I started working professionally with C/C++ then Visual Basic, Lotus Notes, .NET, C#, Java/Spring and now it's mostly JS, Node and React.I've never been attached to any particular language/technique but looked at what different platforms can offer. It took me quite some time to decide to move to fullstack web since I felt for a long time that web dev was like pounding a square peg through a round hole (and it still feels like that in some aspects), but the JS eco-system is fantastic these days. And JS truly runs everywhere.Something that's always amazed me is how some people like to spend their energy on bashing the new stuff that comes along. And it's always about focusing and exaggerating the negative sides. It has reached a point where I'm compelled to give new tech extra attention if it's heavily criticized by other programmers.Back in the day those who programmed Visual Basic where ""script kiddies"" and when React and Node came out it received tons of negative opinion only to dominate a few years later. So on this note I've lately focused on using AI as much as possible when programming. And I think it's bloody fantastic if used right. And by right I mean to let it do small well defined tasks and integrate into your app. Not prompt it to build an entire app so that you don't understand and can maintain the code.Especially CSS/Tailwind which I hate passionately. Just give the layout you want to the AI and let it grind until it looks right.I get that it can be tempting for new programmers to copy paste AI generated code they don't understand into a project, which is not a good idea. But the ""don't use AI if you're new is just silly in my opinion. A great aspect with AI is that you can have it explain programming concepts ""like I'm five"".

I'd like to know if just one of these courses is actually enough, or if a few are enough then in what sequence should I do them. Of course if I had infinite time I would probably do them all but as of now this is overwhelming and would really appreciate if this could be narrowed down to the absolute essentials, stuff I can feasibly do in < 3 months and still get something out of. I'm aware that TOP seems well praised universally so I'm definitely going to do that.To preface I'm fairly adequate in programming and have worked on a few projects, including web-based ones, but I'm really looking to rebuild my skills from scratch if that makes sense.I also understand that the best way to learn is through building projects, I get that but I'd like to supplement that with learning theoreticals and any courses from the above (or if there's some other amazing one I somehow missed) which also involve project building would be best. I'd also like to know where I can find some project ideas (I'm aware roadmap.sh has a few). I'd like to build at least 3 projects within the time I have.Again would really appreciate some help (if I seem rather clueless in this post it's probably because I am, sorry, any guidance is appreciated)",91,0.98,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l3myti/road_to_full_stack_web_dev/,2025-06-05 01:32:37,2025-06-11 01:44:20
1l38eu0,How to build REAL projects,Far-Dragonfly-8306,learnprogramming,"I'm not here to ask the usual, lazy ""learned programming at 26! how become better programmer! also how get job?"" Because, yeah, I know how to become a better programmer: ""do projects,"" they all say. ""Solve a real world problem that you have."" But every legitimate programmer out there needs to acknowledge that there's a world of computer general knowledge that's typically necessary for many of these ""projects"" to function. Sure, at my level (<1 year of programming; yes I am self taught, no I did not get a CS degree), I can create a terminal based RPG game or create a terminal based CRUD. But when programmers go out and build a compiler, there's a whole world of knowledge required on how to do that, none of which is probably even concretely understandable - only abstractly understandable. To take another example: if you want to get into web development, it is not enough to know JS, HTML, and CSS - one must also know how requests/get/server/browsers work. So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler? Maybe my question is vague because it lacks an objective. I'm sure many of you will say ""what do you want to DO? What's your goal? That will determine how you learn this under-the-hood stuff."" And yet in the same breath, I suspect most programmers out there have this under-the-hood knowledge that I seem to lack. Where is this knowledge? YouTube tutorials on ""how to build [complicated thingy],"" by necessity, gloss over the important details behind the inner workings of lines of code, because otherwise the video would rabbit-hole quite quickly.",86,0.92,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l38eu0/how_to_build_real_projects/,2025-06-04 15:24:57,2025-06-11 01:44:20

You'd finish a course on Udemy or Coursera and *boom*—screenshot, post it to LinkedIn, maybe even YouTube: ""I completed 10 full-stack dev courses in 2 months!!"" It was all about stacking credentials, even if you hadn't actually built anything yet.Now it feels like nobody cares. People post their portfolios, small apps, launch their own little SaaS tools, or even tweet out UI clones they built over the weekend. Even beginner YouTubers are documenting ""Building X in 30 days"" instead of ""Which coding bootcamp gave me more certificates.""I think a certificate doesn't really prove much anymore. Anyone can follow a tutorial. But building your own thing? That shows actual thinking, effort, and debugging pain.Not saying certificates are completely useless—they can be a nice way to stay on track or organize your learning—but it feels like hiring managers, other devs care *way* more about what you can show, not what you've watched.Just curious how others see it:\- Do you still collect certs from learning platforms?\- Has a certificate *ever* helped you get a job, interview, freelance , or anything like that?\- Why do you think they were such a big deal a few years ago?\- Would you recommend someone new today focus on getting certificates—or just build stuff?",35,0.95,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l80kus/do_you_still_collect_coding_certificates_or_just/,2025-06-10 14:45:27,2025-06-11 01:44:20

It's about doing the application, giving the correct answer and leveling up which eventually awards you with chests that yield sitewide currencies/items you spend to keep going on. I didn't try them out yet but Codedex looks more of a gamified service.""Holding hands"" approach was the point of criticism from what I saw and I can confirm although I can't critique the service on the method - there are times where a total beginner would be baffled.However, that's where their ""Socratic"" AI called Boots comes in - you can ask him questions and he will proceed to jog your memory by asking you new ones. That might be frustrating to some, especially in cases where you need an outright explanation to a part of the code that was not explicitly taught before.I did not feel outcasted while getting from zero to half way into Functions tutorials and this is a very good aspect. I respect vendors who do not entice by ""look at this amazing feature you are missing out since you are on free"" and rather convince you by proving their merits and generating the feeling that they are worth your financial support if you are able.I am from Turkey and I saw purchasing power parity discount on top of the promotion one so that's another plus for people like us who are crushed under their evil governments' poor management.I am in no way affiliated with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) \- I just felt I needed to pay my respects for offering a more-free-than-premium service who also care about where you are from.

1l57tr4,My story about learning C and C++ as a self taught Java programmer (hoping to help someone on the same path),Vashh92,learnprogramming,"Disclaimer: I still consider myself ""new"" to programming. I'm not an expert by any means. I just want to share my story.Ever since I started listening to discussions surrounding memory management, I've had a growing interest in C/C++. Several months ago, I began studying open source C++ repositories and trying to put together all the pieces of a mostly complete program. It was a disaster, honestly. I quickly came to realize that my first impression of programming was overly simplistic and due for a refactor. I depended on the verbose nature of Java more than I thought I did. I took for granted all the things the Java Virtual Machine handled automatically until I was introduced to header files and Cmake. I'd argue this is one of the most important recognitions I've made about programming in general so far. It made me focus more on compiler behavior, pre-compile tasks, and all the madness going on in the terminal rather than just how good I can code, follow exception messages or solve surface level problems.My advice for new learners of C or C++: 1. Be very patient with it. Take extended breaks (burnout can occur quickly)2. The coding part will mostly be simple following a tutorial. It's everything else regarding the compiler tasks, headers, proper linking, and so on that will be troubling because it's not common for Java programmers to deal with that.3. Reading code others wrote in C++ will be madness, but it is necessary for learning. Stay resilient. You'll eventually start following the logic more easily.4. There are several C/C++ compilers out there. make sure you're choosing the one the project you're looking at expects. It's been an unexpected sticking point for me. People say the compiler won't make any meaningful difference in performance, which can be mistaken as saying the compiler choice doesn't matter at all. It will matter, just not for performance.5. Cmake is a friend, not a foe. Follow its instructions and download the CMake UI so you can see all the missing data at once. It'll mostly be seen in large projects.6. Building a project is less about the code itself and more about file linking. Pointing the compiler to all associated files is top priority to learn (in my opinion)7. C/C++ makes no assumptions about your platform. That's more significant than I first imagined. It's another thing the JVM handles under the hoodIf I am misguided about any of this, please let me know. Drop some stories in the comments about your learning experience as well and I'll happily read them",22,0.9,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l57tr4/my_story_about_learning_c_and_c_as_a_self_taught/,2025-06-07 00:24:03,2025-06-11 01:44:20

I enjoy several things but haven’t gone deep into any of them.So my question is:\-What would you recommend I do next?\-Should I focus on one language?Is there a particular field I should explore based on my interests?\-How did you personally figure out what direction to take in your programming journey?Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Some are C language developed projects, some are c++ (open source games mostly).So here's where I'm stuck: From what I gather, c++ is more difficult overall for a beginner to learn than c, but the open source projects I would be interested in that are in c are likely more difficult to get a handle on as a beginner. So I'm not sure if I go with the higher difficulty lang or higher skill-floor projects? Secondly, I'm on an absolute poopoo of a laptop :D it's this old thinkpad I'm going to strip and put linux on.

Some years ago, after university, I had to start from beginning to change my work carrier and for the first time, I've approached to the coding world. I love it. I took a master in data science, then I continued to study, c# and unity for game developer. I was hired as data scientist but few months later, the project ended and I was moved in another segment in the same society, as solution architect, with something that really wasn't suit for me. So, I spent some months for a master in devops and I finally could ask to change another team, this time in a team of integration. My team works as middle ware, and I could learn a lot about microservices, api, Aws tools and such that we have as infrastructure. So, I decided to stop trying to learn from others and start study, again, in order to have a robust knowledge of the entire process, end to end. So, with the chance to see how some lambda function (Aws) was integrated into other tools, I asked to write a new one that was needed for a new application. Following all pipeline and integrate it into cloud watch. Was a good work (both cause I used cdk libraries, but mostly cause I saw how pipelines really work in production, as a player and not just spectator). But in the end, the more I learn, the more I find out new stuff, that probably should have been discovered ten years ago at the university. So, right now, I'm trying to study about spring boot and Java, nodejs, maven, camel and how to make whole works together, in order to write good api/web app. Now, I feel full of stuff I don't know, and in my future I would like to have the chance to work as software dev, solution architect or whatever, cause I feel like all these worlds overlap somehow, somewhere.That said, I kindly ask for some suggestions:1)where should I start?2)what should I prioritize? 3)im not gonna lie, I'm using a lot chatgpt or Claude to study, like asking focused questions, like usage, best practice, asking for exercises and dig down every time I have a doubt, but, because I always been a self taught in this world, I have no idea if there are books, documentations or whatever that can be exhaustive and valid.I know can be confusing, but I'm very confused right now.

Its hosted on Vercel with a custom domain. Its not a static website and uses a server behind the scenes for stuff like ""serving"" the html files from a public folder and contact.html so that people that visit the website can send us messages (That's also why its not hosted on Github). It uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and other Javascript libraries for having the server capabilities. Now I have not really studied and worked on ExpressJS and all but I was able to vibe-code it (I know I'm sorry but its my dad that wanted the website really quick).Fast forward to present day and my dad wants a blog page in the website. Now I asked copilot in VSCode to do do it for me but turns out it got really complicated. I setup a database schema in supabase connected to vercel and then it started spewing out all these lines of code that didn't work at all and I got confused. (`POST /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog` etc)So what my dad wants is that he should be able to make posts preferably with images and thats it. When I first heard of it, I thought maybe he would also like people to be able to comment and like on posts as well. Well he has clarified that he just wants the first part only. Now the thing is how should I go about it. I have 2 choices:1.

1l70xyf,Application first or concept first?,alex_sakuta,learnprogramming,"Modern programming languages, especially dynamic languages have a really good thing going for them which is there is a library for pretty much everything you want to do which is wrapper that makes it easy for you to do the thing without ever having to understand the core architecture of how something is happening.For example, talking about JS env: Need servers? Express. Need sockets? Socket.io. And so on.This makes it really easy tod develop application quickly and unfortunately that's all that an organisation would care for too.In my resume if someone sees a chat application, they don't care if I implemented the web socket architecture or I just used a library. They may ask that stuff in an interview and still not mind that I used a library.Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.I also learnt how to implement an event loop. But would any company care about these skills if I don't have any decent project? I don't think so.But, keeping my own subjective thinking and personal experiences aside, I had a doubt.If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?Like because I learnt Express, I had an easy time creating macros for implementing routes in my C HTTP server. I just imitated a syntax similar to that in C.On the other hand, had I never used Express, I don't think my abstraction of routes would be like the way Express has and don't know if it would have been this good which it is now.So, clearly the learning of the application helps the learning of architecture just as much as learning the architecture helps learning the application.With this, what do you suggest:- Learn application first, no matter how you do it.- Learn architecture first and then design your own and learn application through that instead of a simply using libs.- A mid ground, learn architecture, learn application using whatever tool is necessary and then if one wishes, one can design their architecture from scratch as well.",7,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l70xyf/application_first_or_concept_first/,2025-06-09 10:06:52,2025-06-11 01:44:20

I feel as though this is a big issue with my skills as a programmer. I particularly struggle with OOP and abstracting what I want from a system into various aspects. Concepts as a whole tend to confuse me at first and I need a real concrete understanding before ""getting it"".

1l89tdd,Getting back into programming..,Intelligent_Term_970,learnprogramming,"I’ve been a programmer for most of my life. I started with PHP, which I worked with for around 10 years.Eventually, I wanted to level up. I began reading more and more about design patterns and techniques like generics and other advanced concepts. When the opportunity came along, I made the switch to Go. However, I never quite got used to the syntax—it felt a bit old-school, with very short and cryptic naming conventions. After more than a year, when I was offered a job working with C# I decided to switch again.Unfortunately, that company turned out to be a poor fit. They refused to adopt modern patterns, and the codebase was in a terrible state. And after six months, I moved on to another C# role, hoping for a better experience. But again, the codebase was a mess, and the work was split roughly 75% frontend and 25% backend.Since I had to work on the frontend, I started learning TypeScript. I really enjoyed many of the concepts and examples I came across while learning it, but sadly, the actual codebase I worked with didn’t reflect any of that what I learned and there was no room or time to improve that was already there.For the full picture: in addition to my 40-hour work week, I would often spend another 40 hours learning and building proof of concepts. You could say programming was my life.I started doubting if it wasn’t time to do something else and when another type of job came along I stepped off the programming wagon. I expected I would get my enjoyment in programming back in the hours that I used to make besides my work, but instead I just stopped programming all together.Now more then 2 years further I’m willing to pick it up in my sparetime again.But i don’t want to do course after course. I’m also not really sure what language I want to pick up. Not what to build.The main advantage of typescript is that I can write frontend and backend code with it. I could pick up c# or even try f# (always loved the functional syntax). I could go back to php? Or maybe try out rust or elixer? Just thinking about it makes me want to quit again? So maybe I’m not ready to pick it up again.I wonder if anyone has some advice to break out of this? Although I do enjoy my current job.

I have a Econ degree (2020), and spent the last 5 years in finance-related roles. I've been teaching myself to code for the last 7 months (great timing, I know). At first I was just doing it for fun, but then it became one of the more meaningful parts of my life. I used to think I liked finance, but really I just liked saying ""stonks go up"". By contrast coding is predictable, controllable, you eventually can figure out where you f\*cked up, and how you can improve. It's a kind learning environment. And in that there is peace. But I feel like I was just about 2-3 years too late on that realization. A couple months ago, I was very confident I could make it as a professional developer. Now I don't know. There's a lot of fear-mongering and apocalyptic prophesying going on. Some say AI is going to wipe out junior dev jobs. Some say there will still be plenty of demand but you’ll need to be more senior-level faster. And junior postings are way down. Layoffs everywhere.How the heck are we supposed to know what to focus on, when everything's up in the air?I've done alot of research and experimenting with all these roles, some thoughts: * **Front-end** / **Web Design** \- S.O.L* **Full-stack** \- somewhat better, but very generalist skillset* **Back-end -** pretty good open vis-a-vis AI defenseability, good way to niche-up* **Cloud** / **DevOps** \- clearest path to employment, good balance of supply/demand* **MLE / MLOps** \- highest demand, but very low base pool, and I don’t have a stats/ML background* **Blockchain** \- thought about it given my finance background but very sketch * **Data Science / ML** \- did a bootcamp, not fan of stats Exploring all of these definitely set me back on the web stack, but I did finish The Odin Project, the first half of Full Stack Open (Core Course, 5 credits), and partially through a milion other courses on Scrimba, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev), Coursera, etc. I'm also considering a master’s to hedge my bets, hoping that by the time I come out the other end in 2-3 years, the markets will have settled. No idea if worth it, but on the other hand grinding projects feels pointless with the current freeze on junior hires. So my question is this. What path should I focus on as a self-taught dev with no degree, in this brutal market for junior devs? Should I target back-end, cloud, or something like MLOps? Is a master’s a smart move, or should I double down on projects and networking?

This uncertainty stems partly from my lack of confidence, but I now understand that working on personal projects is crucial for growth. Previously, I relied solely on LeetCode and books like ""How to Think Like a Programmer"" by Anton Spraul, but this community has shown me these should only supplement hands-on practice, not replace it.My main question is: Can I develop core programming skills that would transfer to any specialization I eventually choose - whether that's web development, DevOps, cloud engineering, or something else?

Now I have just been asked to contribute new features to an existing Fortran project, a language with which I am not at all familiar.

Here is how I would break it down.1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)** \- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)** \- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)** \- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.4. **Wrap up (2 mins)** \- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.**How I prepared:*** Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.I know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off!

1l5kbzs,What happened to the industry to cause such a shift in hiring and layoffs?,EzekielYeager,cscareerquestions,"I’m really terrible at Reddit formatting, so this will probably seem like a blob of text. So many people are incorrectly saying that AI is the driving reason for the mass layoffs, non-hiring, and the downward trend of anything software development related. AI is a _contributing_ factor to the *difficulty* of getting hired at entry level positions at companies, but that’s a standard bar push. But what’s *truly* influencing the mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and shrinking investment into developing proprietary and innovative technologies in America isn’t AI. It’s a tax credit rewrite that was never supposed to take effect. Law and legislation is boring, but this piece specifically, is important for all of you. It impacts your life, your industry, how you’re paid, what the Chief Financial Officer sees and uses to justify paying you six figures, and your tax rebates if you’re planning to start or work in a startup.I’m going to lay out the facts in a (hopefully) objective way. The credit I’m talking about:The Research and Development Tax Credit under IRC Tax Code 174. EDIT: Edits will be for formatting. The law that changed it:The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (specifically under section 13206). This provision was initially drafted by Kevin Brady (R-TX), and advocated significantly for by Republican lawmakers. The House of Representatives vote:227 Republicans For13 Republicans Against0 Democrats For192 Democrats AgainstThe Senate vote:51 Republicans For0 Republicans Against0 Democrats For47 Democrats, and 2 Independents Against The final result:Signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, 2017. Date it took effect:January 1, 2022Why so late?A fun, gimmicky workaround to the Byrd Rule and to delay costly tax hikes until after the 5-year mark, while cashing in on any revenue after the 10-year mark. In short, it was a play to look fiscally responsible, but didn’t provide any tax cuts. It just kicked the can down the road and offset immediate tech conglomerate backlash. They assumed that this provision would be removed or indefinitely delayed by future Congress, but they didn’t. Previous:Prior to 2022, businesses were able to immediately (same year tax break) cash in and deduct R&D expenses, including software developer and other IT professionals’ salaries, IT infrastructure changes, engineer innovation in all sectors, and more. After 2022:All of the expenses covered by the R&D credit now has to be capitalized and amortized. For domestic research, they are required to amortize over 5 years. For foreign research, they are required to amortize over 15 years. Meaning that, prior to 2022, a $1M investment into software development and cyber security would be fully deductible for fiscal year 22. Now, that same $1M investment into those same fields would only allow for $200k to be deductible for the fiscal year, and the remaining $800k would need to be spread out over the remaining four.Which resulted in layoffs, frozen hiring, cash flow strain for startups and tech firms, and immediate tax burden on companies employing R&D-based that persists to today. BUT! There is a bipartisan bill that’s going through Congress right now to reverse it and retroactively apply the lost tax credits back to businesses from 2021 forward, but we’ll see where it goes!",562,0.9,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l5kbzs/what_happened_to_the_industry_to_cause_such_a/,2025-06-07 13:03:00,2025-06-11 01:44:21
1l43hhb,"Even with the current market, SWE is still the best field by far.",cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"Yes, there are a few downsides. The market is also pretty shitty. BUT.. other fields have it so much worse than us.Why SWE is the best:* Even if your goal is to just be an average SWE, you will still end up making 2x or 3x what most other fields make.* The ability to work from home or have a flexible hybrid schedule is AMAZING. There are so many jobs where you have to show up to work at a very specific time and if you're even 1 minute late, you get reprimanded for it. How cool is it that we can show up to work at 11am and leave whenever we want? How cool is it to tell you manager ""Hey I'll be away this afternoon"" and they are totally fine with it? Not many fields have this luxury.* The work is genuinely interesting. Software runs the world. It's awesome to be able to understand how these big systems work and be able to contribute to them. Through real world work + a Computer Science degree, the 'magic' behind computers vanishes and you really start to acknowledge the beauty behind all the abstractions. It's just such a cool field in general.* There is so much variety in what companies you can work for. Want an extremely prestigious and high paying job? You know what to study to make that happen. Want a chill job? You know where to apply for those. Want to join an exciting start-up and work on something from the ground up while wearing multiple hats? Yeah, there are tons of those jobs too. The possibilities are endless.* Similar to the above, there is tons of variety in what you can do in your career. Since SWE is so intertwined with every other field, the possibilities are near endless. Want to make web-apps for millions of people? DO IT!! Want to work on medical devices to save people's lives? YES QUEEN. How about writing code for satellites that power GPS systems across the world? LETS GO!!! Oh, you want to write code for simulation software so scientists can research the effects of earthquakes? AYYYY BRUH!! Literally the possibilities are endless.* It's an office job. I don't have to be out in the extreme heat or extreme cold breaking my body. People who work in manual labour jobs are completely screwed by the time they hit their mid 30s. Aching backs, wrists, shoulders, neck, you name it. Their body is broken when they get into their prime years. The work is also brutal. Imagine lifting heavy things for 12 hours a day in extreme weather, just to make $50k a year? Meanwhile I'm in the office (or at home in my pajamas) drinking some coffee and working on a cool puzzle.. and getting paid tons of money to do it.* The ability to impact millions of people with your code. Not many fields have access to such a large scale as we do. If you work for a well-known company, then it's likely that the features you build and the code that you push will affect the lives of literally millions of people across the world. It's cool to know that your work is recognized on such a global scale.So yeah. I know times are tough right now. There are some downsides of course too. But overall, I think SWE is still the best field.What do you guys think?

1l45mqh,Has job hopping gone too far in software?,ambulocetus_,cscareerquestions,"Let me preface by saying I'm a big believer in worker empowerment, strong rights, unions, etc. I think folks should job hop to get raises and find better positions that fit their needs.But has it gone too far in some cases? Hear me out. What prompted me thinking about this:Our Sr Director just announced she was leaving after 1 year with the company, and another Sr Manager adjacent to mine left recently with 1 year at the company. I checked both their LinkedIn profiles - the director has worked at 10 companies in 15 years, and the manager 12 companies in 20 years. What kind of stability is that? These are folks who have a lot of employees reporting to them, and we rely on them for direction and culture building. Also, why are companies continually OK hiring people like this? That's what I *really* don't get. You think you're the special company where this new hire is going to stick around, after over a decade of ~1-1.5 year tenures? It just seems like an incredible waste of resources.Everywhere I look on LinkedIn, it's the same. 1-2 year tenures at every company. Hell, that's barely enough time to really learn the ropes and build some impact projects. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these people really don't know what they're doing and their actual job is just ""job hopper.""Thoughts?",358,0.85,214,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l45mqh/has_job_hopping_gone_too_far_in_software/,2025-06-05 17:46:41,2025-06-11 01:44:21

One question totally threw me off. They asked me to describe what a vacuum cleaner looks like to someone who’s never seen one, like on a phone call. So no gestures, no pictures, just words. I blanked. Couldn’t find the right words, not even with my mother tongue, got nervous, and the whole thing just spiralled.Then I got rejected. And I accepted this result.What I didn’t know was that some people on that team joked about me afterwards, said my English was bad and my accent was strong. I’ve been in North America for 8 years. It wasn’t even about my tech skills at that point, just that one moment became the whole impression.Fast forward a few months, and I got to know some people from that team through mutual friends. We ended up hanging out, chatting, nothing formal. At some point they realized I had applied before, and their reaction was... weird. They were like “wait, that was you? That new grad with a thick accent?”Guess what, they never even thought I had an accent, not once, until I told them I interviewed with their team before.They literally didn’t connect me with their memory of the interview, because I didn’t fit the version they made up.I’ve moved on now.

1l3m70p,"Name and shame: CoreWeave - almost ghosted twice after 7 rounds over 6 months - unclear roles, moving targets, zero feedback",LeadBamboozler,cscareerquestions,"Sharing this as a heads-up for anyone considering interviewing with CoreWeave, especially for security or infrastructure roles. I went through two interview loops with them, several months apart, and was ghosted once and required multiple follow-ups to not be ghosted a second time — despite confirmed positive feedback from interviewers.**Round 1 (~7 months ago)**I interviewed for a Tech Lead role with a near perfect match in domain, stack, ownership, and experience level. Went through five rounds:- Recruiter- Director- Tech Lead (coding round)- Principal Engineer (system design)- Security Analyst (cross-functional)I moved through the interview cycle and after the cross-functional round, the recruiter emailed me thanking me for taking the time to interview and said he’d collate the feedback and be in touch when he had an update. Ghosted after this email despite repeated follow-ups. I connected with the Director on LinkedIn a month or so after this.**Round 2 (3 weeks ago)**The director shared a Staff Engineer posting that looked to be a direct replacement for the Tech Lead role, so I reached out to him on LinkedIn. He apologized for the earlier ghosting, said I got strong feedback, and that the org had new leadership and shifted direction — fewer managers, more senior ICs. He said he’d love to re-engage and that the recruiter would reach out.The recruiter (same one who ghosted me originally) called me a few days later — but instead of the Staff role, he described an Infrastructure Security role that had similar domain requirements. Maybe I should’ve clarified right then, but I assumed it was all part of the same track and the recruiter mentioned that I would be assessed on the same principles that I was assessed on in the previous interview loop - he explicitly said that he had no concerns at all.They scheduled me with a new distinguished engineer who had joined since the original ghosting. We did not cover a single topic that was discussed in the previous interview.While the discussion was somewhat related to my area, there was a focus on some fairly obscure but oddly specific topics. Despite the curveball - I think I reasoned correctly about the nuances while acknowledging that this area was not something I had direct experience in. The discussion was still highly collaborative and flowed naturally and at the end, the DE mentioned he hoped to speak with me again soon.Then: more silence. Followed up with the recruiter. Nothing. Followed up with the Director on LinkedIn. He said, “let me talk to the recruiter.” A few days later I got a templated rejection email. Zero feedback with an explicit note in the template saying they can’t provide feedback.I understand that goals evolve quickly at high-growth companies. But from a candidate’s perspective, this felt like goalposts were shifting between cycles, and maybe even between rounds. There is a total misalignment in what they’re looking for and across what experience levels. Interestingly - one of the questions I asked DE was *what was the hardest problem he was trying to solve at CoreWeave?*His answer? Hiring and building the team.So if you're thinking of interviewing with CoreWeave: proceed with your eyes open. This process burned a lot of my time, and I walked away with zero signal on where I was off target.",102,0.96,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l3m70p/name_and_shame_coreweave_almost_ghosted_twice/,2025-06-05 00:54:17,2025-06-11 01:44:21

1l5sz35,You’re Afraid of Networking? That’s Your Sign to Start Today,seekgs_2023,cscareerquestions,"I've helped a lot of students & early-career folks with job hunting, and one fear comes up all the time: **networking**. So many people are scared they'll say the wrong thing, or that their message will just get ignored.Totally get it! I've been there too. But based on what I’ve seen from job seekers who’ve actually landed roles (including some who started with zero connections), here are some tips that really work:**1. Start with a 15 min coffee chat**Don’t overthink it. You’re not asking for a job. You’re just asking for 15 minutes to get to know the other person’s position. Most professionals remember what it felt like in the beginning, and they’re happy to help.You can say something like, “Hi \[name\], I’m currently studying \[major\] and exploring career paths in \[field\]. If you’d like to chat with me for 15 minutes, I’d love to hear about your experiences.”**2. Build rapport: \~2 min**Don’t jump right into the subject. Start by warming up with a friendly opening line:“How are you doing today?”“Hope you’re having a great week, thank you for your time!”It’s a small thing, but it can create a relaxed atmosphere and make both parties feel more comfortable.**3. Introduce yourself: 2-3 min**Keep it brief and to the point. Think of it like your LinkedIn verbal summary.“I’m currently a Data Analytics student at \[school\] and I’m really interested in marketing analytics. I’ve worked on projects with A/B testing and Tableau dashboards, and I’d love to learn more about what careers in this field really look like.”Confidence comes from clarity of thought: if you know what you want, you’ll be ten times more confident when you speak your mind.**4. Ask two good questions: \~10 min**This is where you learn. Try:“What do you like most (and least) about your job?”“How did you get into this field?”“If you graduated today, what would you focus on?”Avoid asking generic questions like “How is your company?” Just try to show curiosity and depth.**5. Follow up consistently**Send a quick thank you note and ask if they’d like to stay in touch. That’s it. Relationships are developed through follow-up, not one-off chats.**Tips:**\- If you don't hearing back so far: Try alumni, smaller companies, or people who are 1-3 years ahead of you. They’re often more responsive than FAANG executives.\- Feeling nervous all the time? Write a pitch and practice it with a friend before the actual chat.\- Keep a spreadsheet of who you reached out to, when, and what you learned.So if you’re afraid of networking, you’re not alone. I’ve been there. Take the first step and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at where it leads.Has anyone else networked their way into your first job?

Because of this, they do not understand how difficult some of their tasks are to implement successfully (and quickly). I keep on getting comments like, ""Can't you just do this today?"" or ""Why would it take you a month to do this?"" or ""Why is that so hard to implement?"" I try to explain that, unlike an iPhone or Excel, these very particular requests don't just happen with the click of a button - *that is why you are hiring me*. I also stress the importance of doing things correctly. Finally, I stress that I am a freelancer, and I have a full-time job. I don't know how to get it through to their head that this stuff is complicated and takes time. In addition, I don't just want to drop them because I genuinely like doing the work (and the money is nice). **Is there a non-arrogant way to discuss these matters?** A part of me just wants to say, ""Ok.

Can anyone who has worked at Atlassian chime in here?

I was really excited. My role was to explore how we could use large language models and build AI systems to improve our content and automate workflows. I was mostly a backend engineer, creating APIs, and I loved it.A little while ago, our CEO suddenly decided our company needs to be ""AI first"". On the surface, that sounds great for someone in my role. But the execution is becoming a nightmare. Any complex technical challenge I bring up gets dismissed with a wave of his hand and a simple, ""Oh yeah just write a prompt and develop it fast"".We are now in a phase where we are actively breaking things that already work perfectly fine, just to rebuild them the ""AI way"". The logic seems to be that if it doesn't use a large language model, it's obsolete, which makes no sense.The worst part, however, is what this has done to my job. The CEO now expects every engineer to own the entire product process from start to finish. This means we are all now responsible for writing long product requirement documents, creating wireframes, coding the frontend, developing the backend APIs, and then deploying and integrating everything ourselves.I chose a career in engineering specifically because I did not enjoy product management. Now, it's a core part of my job. And when concerns are raised about the massive new workload and lack of experience in these areas, the response is just, ""Oh yeah just use ChatGPT to write the document"".My work feels less meaningful every day. I went from being a specialized engineer working on interesting AI problems to a generalist doing a bit of everything, without any real depth or focus.

1l3x147,How do you correct your career path when the wrong job is slowly killing you,CashKey1212,cscareerquestions,"When I graduated in 2023, I applied for a backend Java role. My resume was about SpringBoot projects. One of the companies I contacted asked about JVM, databases, and made me do LeetCode problems. I got the offer later and accepted it considering the fair salary. But I thought my role was to do Java backend development.However, when I got into the company, I found out that they were using GWT (Google Web Toolkit) to build both frontend and backend, and I was assigned to GWT front end to develop web applications and desktop applications.For your reference, GWT means developing frontend and backend using Java alone. The frontend is trans-compiled into JS code by the GWT compiler from Java code. Google used it to build Google Docs.The technology-GWT is already abandoned by Google, and nobody is using that anymore. I felt very pressured about my current situation but was afraid to jump to other positions because I thought I would not competitive, and jumping too fast would be a stain on my resume as a new graduate. And I also hesitated about the thought of going for a master's degree.And this is a vicious downward spiral. The more I delay finding a real Java backend position, the less valuable I become on the job market.Having stayed at the role for two years, now I did realize my situation, and I think the correct solution is try to jump to other companies as soon as possible. And I think the master's degree solution has more disadvantages in terms of accumulation of savings, so I abandoned it.Still, I feel very anxious about starting finding jobs, because apparently working experience is the most valuable thing on the job market. If I apply for a front-end job (that is what I'm doing with GWT), nobody wants a Java programmer because the market needs React.js and JavaScript programmer. If I apply for a back-end job, my working experience is useless too because I didn't do SpringBoot.I think I am really in a very disadvantageous situation now.

Most of the time it gets to the point where I need to split up the task into super tiny granular prompts and at that point it's just faster for me to do the job myself.Are there people here who work in big codebases that find it helpful aside from writing simple tests and utilities? What I mean is building full fledged features by vibe coding.

1l5v4pl,Tired of remote work and small town life. Would relocation help?,CautiouslyFrosty,cscareerquestions,"Hey all! A few years ago, when the employment market shifted with COVID, I landed a great, well-salaried remote software engineering job. With the added flexibility, my wife and I decided to move back to our hometown and bought a house.It's been about four years now, and I think I'm realizing I'm tired of the isolation it creates in my life. Not only do I feel siloed at work and a bit excluded from upward movement, but I'm also realizing I don't quite fit into my hometown's social fabric as I'd assumed, especially with my job being so different from the local trades.I'm realizing I want to work in person again. I miss the daily camaraderie with other engineers, the energy of a stricter schedule, and even the minor corporate politics that somehow keep everyone alert. Remote work has made me a bit lax, and while I still deliver good work, I'm not sure I like this more relaxed pace.I could always move a couple of hours back to my old metro area, but it's still fairly small. I'm interested in trying a larger city with more tech companies and less friction in the job market (not implying it's easier to get a job, just more options).However, having bought a house, moving is a bit more complex and expenses are now quite a bit higher. It's not as easy to pick up and move as when I was renting and had less stuff. I'm curious if any of you have gone through something similar and would have any tips. Did you use a new job to manage a relocation, or did you make it work without having to move jobs? Any tips, regrets, or expectations that either held true or were broken? I'm eager to hear about others' experiences.EDIT: Most comments received have been about cost of living. I'm very financially aware that moving somewhere more populated correlates with an increase in housing cost. I'm more interested in experiences others have had; please don't suggest I'm naive and that if I only looked at the numbers harder, I'd realize I'm crazy for wanting to do what I've outlined above. I'm not. It's truly a case of suffocating from the isolation of remote work and a small town; an increase in cost of living is something I can afford and would happily do so if it helps me feel more integrated with other people around me.",8,0.73,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l5v4pl/tired_of_remote_work_and_small_town_life_would/,2025-06-07 21:02:27,2025-06-11 01:44:21

They post a job just to collect data, and then re-post a revised version later.So when you face rejection, don’t take it personally. It often has nothing to do with your qualifications or performance. The job search process involves many factors beyond your control.The worst thing you can do while unemployed is to do nothing. Keep going—progress, however small, is still progress.",5,0.57,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l83yej/dont_be_discouraged_when_receiving_job_rejection/,2025-06-10 16:57:51,2025-06-11 01:44:21

1l6nzso,SWE -> Ai researcher with ethics focus,TheGhostOfBobStoops,cscareerquestions,"#Hey guys, I’m posting for a friend who doesn’t have a Reddit account with enough karma! Thank you I’m currently a software engineer at Microsoft with 5 years of industry experience(mobile developer for a major product). Over the past few years, I’ve developed a deep passion for philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I believe my long-term goal is to work as an AI ethics researcher, ideally contributing to both academic understanding and practical guidance for organizations building impactful systems. To pursue this, I’m considering enrolling in a Master’s in Philosophy to gain formal training in foundational and conceptual frameworks(philosophy of mind and ethics focus), with the eventual goal of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or a related interdisciplinary field that focuses on AI ethics. That said, I’m wondering if a single Philosophy master’s is the most efficient path—or if it might be worthwhile to simultaneously pursue a second Master’s in Machine Learning or Computer Science. I recognize this may extend the timeline, but I’m genuinely passionate about building a strong, cross-disciplinary foundation and want to make sure I’m well-prepared to contribute meaningfully in both technical and ethical domains. My key questions are: * Is a PhD necessary to break into impactful AI ethics research, or can a Master’s degree (or two) be sufficient?* Would pursuing two Master’s degrees in parallel (Philosophy + ML/CS) make sense, or would you recommend a more focused route?* Are there specific programs or schools you would recommend for someone with this interdisciplinary focus?* Finally, does this path tend to offer long-term job security and practical opportunities in industry at major labs? Thank you so much for your time and any advice you can share—I deeply appreciate it.",4,0.7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l6nzso/swe_ai_researcher_with_ethics_focus/,2025-06-08 21:54:23,2025-06-11 01:44:21

1l4ogw2,What is true about certifications?,No_Stay_4583,cscareerquestions,"To begin with, im a developer with almost 10 yoe. Started with a bachelors and during fulltime work managed to get my masters. I dont have a lot of certificates, because i dont work for consultancy and have been at my current employer for almost 7 years. I do have experience with a lot of tools/frameworks like AWS but like i said no certification.Also based in Europe.I recently went on interview at a few companies and most of them asked for certifications. Both for consultancy and not. Even though I managed to give them a detailed explanation of things, they kept asking why i didnt pursue certifications.The last few days I have been reading a lot of topics around this subject. And there doesnt seem to be a straightforward answer. Some say experience > certifications. Some say its a red flag if someone has a lot of certifications. And you have people that swear by certifications.Now Im a bit into my doubting phase. Whats true and whats not? In the last two months I have been focussing on certifications, managed to get two, and at the end of this year I hope to get another three. The two were rather easy since i have had experience with them for years. Is this also a red flag? If someone gets a lot of certifications in a year?Because now im doubting myself.What are your experiences on this topic?",4,0.7,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l4ogw2/what_is_true_about_certifications/,2025-06-06 09:50:49,2025-06-11 01:44:21

Most of discussions I see on Reddit compare the two extremes: pre-Series B start-up vs company with 50,000 employees. I am interested in scale-up (say, 300 - 2,000 employees). I have a few questions:\- How fast do such companies operate?\- How much politics and bureaucracy is there?\- Are different functions heavily compartmentalized and siloed? My major pain point as a Data Scientist in a large company is an extremely slow process to deploy my models due multiple teams needed in this process while I could hypothetically do it all myself.\- How slow is planning process? Is main strategic planning done in terms of half-years, quarters, months or weeks?\- How is company culture? Is it very different from the usual big company blame-evasion culture?\- Does approved tech stack put significant constraints on your ability to operate effectively and efficiently?

I currently work with 5–6 US-based companies (mostly SaaS and tech) and have long-term relationships with most of them. This setup allows me to earn a great income and gives me a lot of freedom. It's also pretty low-risk, since I'm not dependent on a single client.One of my clients — a growing fintech startup — is pushing hard to bring me on full-time. They’ve interviewed other candidates but seem set on me. They’re offering a high-paying contract (contractor status, not employed) that would exceed my current income slightly.I’m torn for a few reasons:* I really enjoy the freedom of freelancing — no need to ask for time off, minimal meetings, full control of my schedule.* But I also deal with a lot of context switching, which is mentally exhausting. Part of me dreams of focusing on one product.* Going full-time would mean dropping other clients, which puts me in a more vulnerable position if things don’t work out.Has anyone here gone from freelancing to a full-time role (especially as a contractor)?
