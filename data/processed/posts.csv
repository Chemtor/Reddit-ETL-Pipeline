1opz0ve,"Unpopular Opinion: Data Quality is a product management problem, not an engineering one.",NewLog4967,dataengineering,"Hear me out. We spend countless hours building data quality frameworks, setting up Great Expectations, and writing custom DBT tests. But 90% of the data quality issues we get paged for are because the business logic changed and no one told us.A product manager wouldn't launch a new feature in an app without defining what quality means for the user. Why do we accept this for data products?We're treated like janitors cleaning up other people's messes instead of engineers building a product. The root cause is a lack of ownership and clear requirements *before* data is produced.Discussion Points:* Am I just jaded, or is this a universal experience?* How have you successfully pushed data quality ownership *upstream* to the product teams that generate the data?* Should Data Engineers start refusing to build pipelines until acceptance criteria for data quality are signed off?Let's vent and share solutions.",202,0.93,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1opz0ve/unpopular_opinion_data_quality_is_a_product/,2025-11-06 13:33:10,2025-11-11 01:41:50
1oos473,When the pipeline stops being “a pipeline” and becomes “the system”,stephen8212438,dataengineering,"There’s a funny moment in most companies where the thing that was supposed to be a temporary ETL job slowly turns into the backbone of everything. It starts as a single script, then a scheduled job, then a workflow, then a whole chain of dependencies, dashboards, alerts, retries, lineage, access control, and “don’t ever let this break or the business stops functioning.”Nobody calls it out when it happens.

1op7yd0,Is work life balance in data engineering is non-existent?,shanksfk,dataengineering,"I’ve been a data engineer for a few years now and honestly, I’m starting to think work life balance in this field just doesn’t exist.Every company I’ve joined so far has been the same story. Sprints are packed with too many tickets, story points that make no sense, and tasks that are way more complex than they look on paper. You start a sprint already behind.Even if you finish your work, there’s always something else. A pipeline fails, a deployment breaks, or someone suddenly needs “a quick fix” for production. It feels like you can never really log off because something is always running somewhere.In my current team, the seniors are still online until midnight almost every night. Nobody officially says we have to work that late, but when that’s what everyone else is doing, it’s hard not to feel pressured. You feel bad for signing off at 7 PM even when you’ve done everything assigned to you.I actually like data engineering itself. Building data pipelines, tuning Spark jobs, learning new tools, all of that is fun. But the constant grind and unrealistic pace make it hard to enjoy any of it. It feels like you have to keep pushing non-stop just to survive.Is this just how data engineering is everywhere, or are there actually teams out there with a healthy workload and real work life balance?",160,0.92,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1op7yd0/is_work_life_balance_in_data_engineering_is/,2025-11-05 16:44:47,2025-11-11 01:41:50

Feels like a new issue comes out of nowhere,thro0away12,dataengineering,"I work as an analytics engineer at a Fortune 500 team and I feel honestly stressed out everyday especially over the last few months.I develop datasets for the end user in mind. The end datasets combine data from different sources we normalize in our database. The issue I’m facing is that stuff that seems to have been ok-ed a few months ago is suddenly not ok - I get grilled for requirements I was told to put, if something is inconsistent I have a colleague who gets on my case and acts like I don’t take accountability for mistakes, even though the end result follows the requirements I was literally told are the correct processes to evaluate whatever the end user wants. I’ve improved all channels of communication and document things extensively now, so thankfully that helps point to why I did things the way I did months ago but it’s frustrating the way colleagues react and behave to unexpected failures while im finishing time sensitive current tasks. Our pipelines upstream of me have some new failure or the other everyday that’s not in my purview. When data goes missing in my datasets because of that, I have to dig and investigate what happened that can take forever, sometimes it’s a failure because of the vendor sending an unexpectedly changed format or some failure in the pipeline that software engineering team takes care of. When things fail, I have to manually do the steps in the pipeline to temporarily fix the issue which is a series of download, upload, download and “eyeball validate” and upload to the folder that eventually feeds our database for multiple datasets. This eats up my entire day that I have to dedicate for other time sensitive tasks and I feel there are serious unrealistic expectations. I log into work first day out of a day off with a bulk of messages about a failed data issue and have back to back meetings in the AM. I was asked just 1.5 hours of logging in with meetings if I looked into and resolved a data issue that realistically takes a few hours….um no I was in meetings lol. There was a time in the past at 10PM or so I was asked to manually load data because it failed in our pipeline and I was tired and uploaded the wrong dataset. My manager freaked out the next day,they couldn’t reverse the effects of the new dataset till the next day, so they found me incapable of the task but while yes, it was my mistake of not checking it was 10PM, I don’t get paid for after hours work and I was checked out.

1ota9vg,How are you handling projected AI costs ($75k+/mo) and data conflicts for customer-facing agents?,Worried_Teaching_707,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I'm working as an AI Architect consultant for a mid-sized B2B SaaS company, and we're in the final forecasting stage for a new ""AI Co-pilot"" feature. This agent is customer-facing, designed to let their Pro-tier users run complex queries against their own data.The projected API costs are raising serious red flags, and I'm trying to benchmark how others are handling this.**1. The Cost Projection:** The agent is complex. A single query (e.g., ""Summarize my team's activity on Project X vs. their quarterly goals"") requires a 4-5 call chain to GPT-4T (planning, tool-use 1, tool-use 2, synthesis, etc.). We're clocking this at **\~$0.75 per query**.The feature will roll out to **\~5,000 users**. Even with a conservative **20% DAU** (1,000 users) asking just **5 queries/day**, the math is alarming: \*(1,000 DAUs \* 5 queries/day \* 20 workdays \* $0.75/query) = **\~$75,000/month.**\*This turns a feature into a major COGS problem. How are you justifying/managing this? Are your numbers similar?**2. The Data Conflict Problem:** Honestly, this might be worse than the cost. The agent has to query multiple internal systems *about* the customer's data (e.g., their usage logs, their tenant DB, the billing system).We're seeing conflicts. For example, the **usage logs** show a customer is using an ""Enterprise"" feature, but the **billing system** has them on a ""Pro"" plan. The agent doesn't know what to do and might give a wrong or confusing answer. This reliability issue could kill the feature.**My Questions:*** Are you all just eating these high API costs, or did you build a sophisticated middleware/proxy to aggressively cache, route to cheaper models, and reduce ""ping-pong""?* How are you solving these data-conflict issues? Is there a ""pre-LLM"" validation layer?* Are any of the observability tools (Langfuse, Helicone, etc.) actually helping solve this, or are they just for logging?Would appreciate any architecture or strategy insights.

1oq6id9,I (25M) working as a data engineer hybrid role want advice,Flimsy-Painting6880,dataengineering,"I 25M am working as a data engineer for a large financial institution in the UK with 3yoe and I feel somewhat behind at the moment.My academic background is in applied mathematics and I first was a contractor at my firm for 2 years with a partner company before I got made permanent. It is a hybrid role with 2 days per week in the office in London.The positives of the role are as follows:- Quite good WLB (Only about 10 hrs per week actual work)- Good non-toxic culture with friendly technical and non technical colleagues who are always happy to help- I have been able to upskill in the role, and now have skills in Python, SQL, Java, DevOps, machine learning, ETL pipelines, GCP, business analysis, basic architecture design and SRE for maintaining data products.The negatives are as follows:- Low TC (only £60k TC) in London- Unclear how I might get a promotion in my organisation.Due to the good WLB mentioned above, I have used time to learn new skills and learn value investing and because I live with my parents I have been able to build a fairly good portfolio for my age.I am soon going to buy a flat however so I will not be able to invest as much in the near future.What should I be focusing on? Because although I partially think I should look for another highest TC role, the grass isn’t always greener, so I might be better off milking this good WLB role for all its worth then pursuing some kind of entrepreneurial venture alongside it, because that could have potentially unlimited upside with low downside if my corporate role provides a margin of safety, and if that takes off I could become a full time entrepreneur.What thoughts/advice do people have?

1op9z6x,Is it worth staying in an internship where I’m not really learning anything?,Express_Ad_6732,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I’m currently doing a Data Engineering internship (been around 3 months), and I’m honestly starting to question whether it’s worth continuing anymore.When I joined, I was super excited to learn real-world stuff — build data pipelines, understand architecture, and get proper mentorship from seniors. But the reality has been quite different.Most of my seniors mainly work with Spark and SQL, while I’ve been assigned tasks involving Airflow and Airbyte. The issue is — no one really knows these tools well enough to guide me.For example, yesterday I faced an Airflow 209 error. Due to some changes, I ended up installing and uninstalling Airflow multiple times, which eventually caused my GitHub repo limit to exceed. After a lot of debugging, I finally figured out the issue myself — but my manager and team had no idea what was going on.Same with Airbyte 505 errors — and everyone’s just as confused as I am. Even my manager wasn’t sure why they happen. I end up spending hours debugging and searching online, with zero feedback or learning support.I totally get that self-learning is a big part of this field, but lately it feels like I’m not really learning, just surviving through errors. There’s no code review, no structured explanation, and no one to discuss better approaches with.Now I’m wondering:Should I stay another month and try to make the best of it,or resign and look for an opportunity where I can actually grow under proper guidance?Would leaving after 3 months look bad if I can still talk about the things I’ve learned — like building small workflows, debugging orchestrations, and understanding data flow?Has anyone else gone through a similar “no mentorship, just errors” internship?I’d really appreciate advice from senior data engineers, because I genuinely want to become a strong data engineer and learn the right way.EditAfter going through everyone’s advice here, I’ve decided not to quit the internship for now. Instead, I’ll focus more on self-learning and building consistency until I find a better opportunity.Honestly, this experience has been a rollercoaster — frustrating at times, but it’s also pushing me to think like a real data engineer. I’ve started enjoying those moments when, after hours of debugging and trial-and-error, I finally fix an issue without any senior’s help.

1ooyobk,Samara: A 100% Config-Driven ETL Framework [FOSS],ThqXbs8,dataengineering,"# SamaraI've been working on Samara, a framework that lets you build complete ETL pipelines using just YAML or JSON configuration files. No boilerplate, no repetitive code—just define what you want and let the framework handle the execution with telemetry, error handling and alerting.The idea hit me after writing the same data pipeline patterns over and over. Why are we writing hundreds of lines of code to read a CSV, join it with another dataset, filter some rows, and write the output? Engineering is about solving problems, the problem here is repetiviely doing the same over and over.## What My Project DoesYou write a config file that describes your pipeline:- Where your data lives (files, databases, APIs)- What transformations to apply (joins, filters, aggregations, type casting)- Where the results should go- What to do when things succeed or failSamara reads that config and executes the entire pipeline. Same configuration should work whether you're running on Spark or Polars (TODO) or ... Switch engines by changing a single parameter.## Target Audience**For engineers**: Stop writing the same extract-transform-load code. Focus on the complex stuff that actually needs custom logic.**For teams**: Everyone uses the same patterns. Pipeline definitions are readable by analysts who don't code. Changes are visible in version control as clean configuration diffs.**For maintainability**: When requirements change, you update YAML or JSON instead of refactoring code across multiple files.## Current State- 100% test coverage (unit + e2e)- Full type safety throughout- Comprehensive alerts (email, webhooks, files)- Event hooks for custom actions at pipeline stages- Solid documentation with architecture diagrams- Spark implementation mostly done, Polars implementation in progress## Looking for ContributorsThe foundation is solid, but there's exciting work ahead:- Extend Polars engine support- Build out transformation library- Add more data source connectors like Kafka and DatabasesCheck out the repo: [github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara)Star it if the approach resonates with you.

1oroinc,How would you build a multi-tenant data lakehouse platform with a data ontology or catalog as a startup?,fabkosta,dataengineering,"Assume you're a startup with limited funds, and you need to build some sort of multi-tenant data lakehouse, where each tenant is one of your clients with potentially (business-) sensitive data. So, ideally you want to segregate each client from each other client cleanly. Let's assume data per tenant initially is moderate, but will grow over time. Let's also assume there are only relatively few people working with the data platform per client, but those who do work with it have needs for performing advanced analytics (like ML model training). One crucial piece is that we need some sort of data catalogue or ontology to describe the clients data. That's a key component of the entire startup idea, without this it will not work.How would you architect this given given the limited funds? (I know, I know, it all depends on the context and situation etc., but I'm still sorting my thoughts here, and don't have all the details and requirements ready at this stage. I'm trying to get an overview on the different options and their fundamental pros and cons to decide where to dive in deeper with the research and what questions even to ask later.)**Option 1:** My first instinct was to think about cloud-native solutions like Azure Fabric, Azure object storage, and other Azure services - or some comparable setup in AWS/GCP. The cool thing is that you get something up and running relatively quickly with e.g. Terraform scripts, and by using a CI/CD pipeline you can ramp up entirely, neatly segregated client/tenant environments in an Azure resource group. I like the cleanliness of this solution. But when I looked into the pricing of Azure Fabric, boy, even the smallest possible single service instance already costs you a small fortune. If you ramp up an Azure Fabric instance for each client, you will have to charge them hefty fees right from the start. That's not entirely optimal for an early-stage startup that still needs to convince the first customers to even consider you.I looked briefly into BigQuery and Snowflake, and those seem to have similarly hefty prices due to 24/7 running compute costs particularly. All of this just eats up your budget.**Option 2:** I then started looking into open source alternatives like Dremio - and realized that the juicy bits (like data catalog) are not included in the free version, but in the enterprise version only. I could not find any figures on the license costs, but the few hints point to a five figure license cost, if I got that right. Or, alternatively, you fall back again to consuming them as a manages SaaS from them, any end up paying a continuous fee like with Azure Fabric. I haven't looked into Delta Lake yet, but I would assume pros and cons are similar here.**Option 3:** We could go even lower level and do things more or less from scratch (see e.g. [this blog post](https://medium.com/@harits.muhammad.only/how-to-build-free-modern-data-lakehouse-using-dockerized-dbt-airflow-minio-and-dremio-933294de5ac5)). However, the trade-off is of course you end up paying less money to providers and spend much more time fiddling around with low-level engineering yourself. On the positive side, you'll have full control over everything.And that's how far I got. Not sure what's the best direction now to dig deeper.

1osm6x8,"If serialisability is enforced in the app/middleware, is it safe to relax DB isolation (e.g., to READ COMMITTED)?",bond_shakier_0,dataengineering,"I’m exploring the trade-offs between **database-level isolation** and **application/middleware-level serialisation**.Suppose I already enforce **per-key serial order** outside the database (e.g., productId) via one of these:- local **per-key locks** (single JVM),- a **distributed lock** (Redis/ZooKeeper/etcd),- a **single-writer queue** (Kafka partition per key).In these setups, only one update for a given key reaches the DB at a time. Practically, the DB doesn’t see concurrent writers for that key.**Questions**1. If serial order is already enforced upstream, does it still make sense to keep the DB at SERIALIZABLE? Or can I safely relax to READ COMMITTED / REPEATABLE READ?2. Where does **contention** go after relaxing isolation—does it simply move from the DB’s lock manager to my app/middleware (locks/queue)?3. Any **gotchas, patterns, or references** (papers/blogs) that discuss this trade-off?**Minimal examples to illustrate context****A) DB-enforced (serialisable transaction)**```sqlBEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = 42;-- if stock > 0:UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 42;COMMIT;```**B) App-enforced (single JVM, per-key lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**```java// map: productId -> lock objectLock lock = locks.computeIfAbsent(productId, id -> new ReentrantLock());lock.lock();try { // autocommit: each statement commits on its own int stock = select(""SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?"", productId); if (stock > 0) { exec(""UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?"", productId); }} finally { lock.unlock();}```**C) App-enforced (distributed lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**```javaRLock lock = redisson.getLock(""lock:product:"" + productId);if (!lock.tryLock(200, 5_000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) { // busy; caller can retry/back off return;}try { int stock = select(""SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?"", productId); if (stock > 0) { exec(""UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?"", productId); }} finally { lock.unlock();}```**D) App-enforced (single-writer queue), DB at READ COMMITTED**```java// Producer (HTTP handler)enqueue(topic=""purchases"", key=productId, value=""BUY"");// Consumer (single thread per key-partition)for (Message m : poll(""purchases"")) { long id = m.key; int stock = select(""SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?"", id); if (stock > 0) { exec(""UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?"", id); }}```I understand that each approach has different failure modes (e.g., lock TTLs, process crashes between select/update, fairness, retries).

1ooxica,CDC and schema changes,Emanolac,dataengineering,"How do you handle schema changes on a cdc tracked table? I tested some scenarios with CDC enabled and I’m a bit confused what is going to work or not. To give you an overview, I want to enable CDC on my tables and consume all the data from a third party(Microsoft Fabric). Because of that, I don’t want to lose any data tracked by the _CT tables and I discovered that changing the schema structure of the tables, may potentially end up with some data loss if no proper solution is found. I’ll give you an example to follow.I have the User table with Id, Name,Age, RowVersion. The CDC is enabled at db and at this table level, and I set it to track every row of this table. Now some changes may appear in this operational table1. I add a new column, let’s say Salary as DECIMAL. I want to track this column as well. But I don’t want to disable and enable again the CDC for this table, because I will lose the data in the old capture instance2. After a while, I want to ALTER the column Salary from DECIMAL to INT (this is just for the sake of the example). Here, what I observed, is that after the ALTER state is run, the Salary column in CT table is automatically changed to INT which is weird that may lead to potentially some data loss from the previous data3. I will Delete the Salary column. The statement will not break but I need to update somehow the tracking for this table without the column. 4. I will rename the Name column to FirstName. The rename statement will break because it will see that the column is linked to CDC5. I will rename the table from User to Users. This statement is not failing but I still need to update the cdc tracking to not let misleading naming conventions that may be confusing Did you encounter similar issues in your development?

This works really well for our team, and give us very fined grain control over our database objects.I’m trying to figure out the right separation of responsibilities between dbt and an external DDL tool:- Is it recommended or safe to let something like SnowDDL/Atlas manage Snowflake objects, and only use dbt as the transformation tool to update and insert records?- How do you prevent dbt from dropping or replacing tables it didn’t create (so you don’t lose grants, sequences, metadata, etc…)?Would love to hear how other teams draw the line between:- DDL / schema versioning (SnowDDL, Atlas, Terraform, etc.)- Transformation logic / data lineage (dbt)",2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ool0ha/can_or_should_i_handle_snowflake_schema_mgmt/,2025-11-04 22:11:54,2025-11-11 01:41:50
1ookgz2,Stuck integrating Hive Metastore for PySpark + Trino + MinIO setup,poogast,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I'm building a real-time data pipeline using Docker Compose and I've hit a wall with the Hive Metastore. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction or suggest a better architecture.My Goal:I want a containerized setup where:1. A PySpark container processes data (in real-time/streaming) and writes it as a table to a Delta Lake format.2. The data is stored in a MinIO bucket (S3-compatible).3. Trino can read these Delta tables from MinIO.4. Grafana connects to Trino to visualize the data.My Current Architecture & Problem:I have the following containers working mostly independently:· pyspark-app: Writes Delta tables successfully to s3a://my-bucket/ (pointing to MinIO).· minio: Storage is working. I can see the _delta_log and data files from Spark.· trino: Running and can connect to MinIO.· grafana: Connected to Trino.The missing link is schema discovery. For Trino to understand the schema of the Delta tables created by Spark, I know it needs a metastore. My approach was to add a hive-metastore container (with a PostgreSQL backend for the metastore DB).This is the step that's failing. I'm having a hard time configuring the Hive Metastore to correctly talk to both the Spark-generated Delta tables on MinIO and then making Trino use that same metastore. The configurations are becoming a tangled mess.What I've Tried/Researched:· Used jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base for Spark.· Set Spark configs like spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog, and the necessary S3A settings for MinIO.· For Trino, I've looked at the hive and delta-lake connectors.· My Hive Metastore setup involves setting S3A endpoints and access keys in hive-site.xml, but I suspect the issue is with the service discovery and the thrift URI.My Specific Question:Is the ""Hive Metastore in a container"" approach the best and most modern way to solve this? It feels brittle.1. Is there a better, more container-native alternative to the Hive Metastore for this use case? I've heard of things like AWS Glue Data Catalog, but I'm on-prem with MinIO.2. If Hive Metastore is the right way, what's the critical configuration I'm likely missing to glue it all together? Specifically, how do I ensure Spark registers tables there and Trino reads from it?3. Should I be using the Trino Delta Lake connector instead of the Hive connector? Does it still require a metastore?Any advice, a working docker-compose.yml snippet, or a pointer to a reference architecture would be immensely helpful!Thanks in advance.",2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ookgz2/stuck_integrating_hive_metastore_for_pyspark/,2025-11-04 21:51:09,2025-11-11 01:41:50

1or3sxw,The collapse of Data and AI Infrastructure into one,Traditional_Rip_5915,dataengineering,"Lately, I feel data infrastructure is changing to serve AI use cases. There's a sort of merger between the traditional data stack and the new AI stack. I see this most in two places: 1) the semantic layer and 2) the control plane.On the first point, if AI writes SQL and its answers aren't correct for whatever reason - different names for data elements across the data stack, different definitions for the same metric - this is where a semantic model comes in. It's basically giving the LLM the context to create the right results. On the second point, it seems data infrastructure and AI infrastructure are collapsing into one control plane. For example, analytics are now agent-facing, not just customer-facing. This changes the requirements for data processing. Quality and lineage checks need to be available to agents. Systems need to meet latency requirements that are designed around agents doing analytic work and retrieving data effectively. How are y'all seeing this show up? What steps are y'all taking when implementing these semantic data models?

That felt like something pandas should make easier.The library helps with swapping columns, moving multiple columns before or after others, pushing blocks to the front or end, sorting columns by variance, standard deviation or correlation, and grouping them by dtype or NaN ratio.

1oosu69,Transformation layer from Qlik to Snowflake,No_Candle_2534,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I'm trying to modernize the stack in my company. I want to move the data transformation layer from qlik to snowflake. Have to convince my boss. If anyone had this battle before, please advice.For context, my team is me (frustrated DE), team manager (really supportive but with no technical background), 2 internal analyst focusing on gathering technical requirements and 2 external bi developer focusing on qlik.I use Snowflake + dbt but the models built in here are just a handful, because I was not allowed to connect to the ERP system (I am internal by the way) but only to other sources. It looks like soon I will have access to ERP data though.Currently the external consultants connects with Qlik directly to our ERP system, downloads a bunch of data from there + snowflake + a few random excels and create a massive transformation layer in Qlik.There is no version control, and the internal analysts do not even know how to use qlik - so they just ask the consultants to develop dashboards and have no idea of the data modelling built. Development is slow, dashboards look imho basic and as a DE I want to have at least proper development and governance standards for the data modelling.My idea: Step 1 - have ERP data in snowflake. Build facts and dim in there.Step 2 - let the analysts use SQL and learn DBT to have the ""reporting"" models in snowflake as well. Upskill the analyst so they can use github to communicate bugs, enhancements etc. Use qlik for visualization onlyMy manager is sold on step 1, not yet 2. The external consultants are saying that qlik workd best with facts and dims, instead of one normalized table. So that they can handle the downloads faster and do transformations in qlik.My points to go for step 2:- qlik has no version control (yet - noy sure if it is an optiom)- internally no visibility on the code, it is just a black box the consultants manage. Move would mean better knowledge sharing and data governance- the aim is not to create huge tables/views for the dashboards but rather optimal models with just the fields needed- possibility of internal upskill (analysts using sql/dbt + git)- better visbility on costs, both on the computation layer as well as storage costs decreased Anything else I can say to convince my manager to make this move?",1,0.6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oosu69/transformation_layer_from_qlik_to_snowflake/,2025-11-05 03:55:28,2025-11-11 01:41:50

But I recently noticed that one of our standard processes for monitoring crew assignments during shifts is wildly inefficient, and I want to build a proof of concept dashboard so that management can OK the project to our IT dept. Right now, when a train is delayed, dispatchers have to manually piece together information from multiple systems to judge if a crew will still make their next run. They look at real-time train delay data in one feed, crew assignments somewhere else, and scheduled arrival and departure times in a third place, cross-referencing train numbers and crew IDs by hand. Then they compile it all into a list and relay that list to our crew assignment office by phone. It’s wildly inefficient and time consuming, and it’s baffling to me that no one has ever linked them before, given how straightforward the logic should be.I guess my question is- is this as simple as I’m assuming it should be?

1ooiekb,Data Vault - Subset from Prod to Pre Prod,Salt_Anteater3307,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I am working at a large insurance company where we are building a new data platform (dwh) in Azure, and I have been asked to figure out a way to move a subset of production data (around 10%) into pre prod, while making sure referential integrity is preserved across our new Data Vault model. There is dev and test with synthetic data (for development) but pre prod has to have a subset of prod data. So 4 different env.Here’s the rough idea I have been working on, and I would really appreciate feedback, challenges, or even “don’t do it” warnings.The process would start with an input manifest – basically just a list of thousand of business UUIDs (like contract_uuid = 1234, etc.) that serve as entry points. From there, the idea is to treat the Vault like a graph and traverse it:I would use metadatacatalog (link tables, key columns, etc.) to figure out which link tables to scan, and each time I find a new key (e.g. a customer_uuid in a link table), that key gets added to the traversal. The engine keeps running as long as new keys are discovered. Every Iteration would start from the first entry point again (e.g contact_uuid) but with new keys discovered from the previous iteration added. Duplicates key in the iterations will be ignored.I would build this in PySpark to keep it scalable and flexible. The goal is not to pull raw tables, but rather end up with a list of UUIDs per Hub or Sat that I can use to extract just the data I need from prod into pre prod via a „data exchange layer“. If someone later triggers an new extract for a different business domain, we would only grab new keys no redundant data, no duplicates.I tried to challenge this approach internally but i felt like it did not lead to a discussion or even „what could go wrong“ scenario.In theory, this all makes sense. But I am aware that theory and practice do notalways match , especially when there are thousand of keys, hundreds of tables, and performance becomes an issue.So here what I am wondering:Has anyone built something similar?Does this approach scale?Are there proven practice for this that I might be missing?So yeah…am i on the right path or run away from this?",1,0.6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ooiekb/data_vault_subset_from_prod_to_pre_prod/,2025-11-04 20:30:27,2025-11-11 01:41:50
1oof1kt,Optimizing filtered vector queries from tens of seconds to single-digit milliseconds in PostgreSQL,m1r0k3,dataengineering,"We actively use pgvector in a production setting for maintaining and querying HNSW vector indexes used to power our recommendation algorithms. A couple of weeks ago, however, as we were adding many more candidates into our database, we suddenly noticed our query times increasing linearly with the number of profiles, which turned out to be a result of incorrectly structured and overly complicated SQL queries. Turns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed. I searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation. Now, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance \- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector \- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy \- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them \- Directions for even further optimizations and learningHopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search!

They said:It’s not easy to break into data governance early in your career.Smaller companies often don’t take governance seriously or have formal frameworks.Larger companies do care, but the field is considered too fragile or risky to hand over to someone without deep experience.Their suggestion was to gain strong hands-on experience in core data roles first — like data engineering or data management — and then transition into data governance once I’ve built a solid foundation and credibility.That makes sense logically, but I’m curious what others think.Has anyone here transitioned into Data Governance later in their career?How did you position yourself for it?Are there any specific skills, certifications, or experiences that helped you make that move?And lastly, do you think the EU’s regulatory environment might create more entry-level or mid-level governance roles in the near future?Would love to hear your experiences or advice.Thanks in advance!",1,0.57,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oo5u6o/is_it_really_that_hard_to_enter_into_data/,2025-11-04 12:23:16,2025-11-11 01:41:50

When you learn to:* Define the problem before touching the keyboard* Explain your code out loud and make it sound simple* Name things precisely* Question assumptions instead of patching symptoms...you start writing code that lasts, scales, and earns trust. If you're early in your journey, here's my best advice:* Don't chase tools, chase understanding.* Don't fear being wrong, fear not learning from it.* Don't copy patterns blindly, know why they exist.Everything else.. frameworks, AI tooling, languages will follow naturally. *What's something you've learned the hard way that changed how you code?*",1293,0.92,170,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1osvg1m/20_years_in_tech_and_heres_the_one_thing_id_tell/,2025-11-09 21:32:55,2025-11-11 01:41:51
1orvzhm,"The most effective way to learn programming is to want to build something, and then to try and build it.",RockaBabyDarling,learnprogramming,"I shared this with some of my most senior software developer buddies and they said dude you need to share this again but in a better time window where more people will see it because it got lost too soon, so I'm doing that. I know I could probably go look at several analytics websites but I feel like midday on Saturday is probably a good time. The rest is my original post.I've been programming for nearly two decades, and the way I got my start, the way many of my most talented friends got their start, was not through a 16-week boot camp. Although I'm not saying there's no value there. Having a goal and moving through each of several key areas in a full-stack SDLC, they do well enough.If you're trying to learn all the things you need to know to be even a junior to mid-level engineer, it can be difficult to glue all those pieces together in your mind. It can feel like you're learning HTML, but it looks like crap, so then you learn CSS. But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript. Now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work, but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like React or Angular. But then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard-coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so it's not hard-coded, so you learn some backend framework. Now you've got APIs, but you're still hard-coding, so then you learn how to stand up a database. All along the way, there are all these choices and decisions to make, pros and cons, and it's always changing.I've gone through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, Spring Boot and Java, the MEAN stack with Angular 1, and then Angular 2 (which wasn't even the same thing as the first), the MERN stack, all the little frameworks and libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object-oriented versus functional or GraphQL vs REST, and it keeps changing. It keeps going: one thing gets simpler, the next gets more complicated. If you don't have some central thing you can use to glue all these concepts together, they come and go and you've never really learned much. You learned kind of how to touch Kubernetes one day and then never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you could do because you're actually on something worse than k8s. But I digress.If you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice after being a software engineer forever is to do these things:**1. Think of the coolest, most badass thing you can think of that you would like to go try and build.**Take as long as you need here. This is the most important part. It really has to resonate as ""you know what, holy shit, I would actually like to build this,"" and you start getting amped about it. That energy is going to get you through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together. You can look back and say, ""Oh yeah, I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mixins combined with the other features of the language. I just dropped plain CSS and LESS overnight. Oh yeah, I've heard of Tailwind. I dabbled with it. It's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly,"" etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.**2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it with, because I promise you the chances that you're going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea through analysis paralysis are going to be astronomical.**Do some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, and patterns are for whatever it is you're trying to build. I recommend a full-stack JavaScript stack, or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge in complexity and the learning curve when just starting out, mainly because it reduces having to learn two languages when context-switching from the frontend to the backend if you're looking to be full-stack. People ask me what the best programming language is, and I always tell them it's the one you've spent five years learning. You can do just about anything with just about any language out there. Some of them are hyper-specialized like Erlang or Rust or Go, but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share. If it's popular, that means people are hiring for it, it means people like it, and that there's support out there for it. Whichever you pick, you'll be fine. You're getting an education either way.**3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you.**Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there, building out the UI, learning how to make a mockup, and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you.**4. You are going to change your mind about things. People who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from six months ago and say to yourself ""what was I thinking here?"" then you're not growing.**Don't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or becoming paralyzed because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale. So now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12-factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale while you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join. These are just growing pains. There's so much reading out there, so many opinions, different patterns, different hills that people will die on. Pick yours. Look at it like building out your own custom set of opinions. I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck. That's the nature of it.Lastly, if you find that your passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure you still want to go in that direction, but you're thinking ""okay, there's this whole other direction that's actually really cool,"" that's fine. The likelihood that you're going to change is just as likely as the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner. I've not been bored in almost two decades of programming. Each day it's more of the same but nothing is the same. No two days are alike. You get to express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely.So if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build. Immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day, even if it's just updating the README every single day until you pick a framework. Start building that part of your resume right away. Show you're active. Try to open a pull request on an open-source project. Go try to build up your HackerRank. Have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do. It'll make all the difference in holding this together for you. Best of luck to you out there.",255,0.97,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1orvzhm/the_most_effective_way_to_learn_programming_is_to/,2025-11-08 18:01:12,2025-11-11 01:41:51

Of course I've been into multiple projects inside this industry, from big e-commerce to management systems, integrations between sites and marketing tools, etc..Recently I had 2 interviews for Senior positions, and I felt very comfortable with the interviews, I passed the 2 live test coding challenges , was I lucky or experience? who knows.I'm going to move to USA next year because my wife is USC, and I'm into this immigration process, but I'm very scared/afraid of interviews in the US, I know that interviews in USA are harder, way harder than here.I've worked with lots of US based customers through my employers, and most of the developers/team mates are very capable , way more than latin american developers, I've worked with Asian guys and their understanding of architecture and computer design is just beyond my skills, and I'm scared that I won't make it in the US because I will be competing against **Asian Developers** that are addict to coding and solving problems for fun.I know that it depends on the company, some companies will have harder interviews , but I feel that my 8 years of experience, will be like 4 years of experience in the US.What do you think? how can I land a job fast ? I can't live in the US without income, that would be very hard.I'm confident about my skills and experience, but I don't think I will be a Senior Developer in the US as I'm in Latin America, here I'm more valuable because I communicate in english plus my technical skills, but in US everyone speaks english, so english is not a valuable skill as it's in here.

If someone gives me a clear plan, I can implement it, debug it, and ship it. If I have built something similar before, I can rebuild it fast.But the moment I have to design the architecture, data flow, or figure out what talks to what by myself, I just freeze. I do not know where to start, I second-guess every choice, and I end up hacking something together that works but feels messy.What makes it even worse is that if I ask AI to design the structure for the app, it gives me a much cleaner architecture and code layout than I would have ever come up with. Instead of helping, it sometimes demotivates me, because it feels like AI is already better at the part I am trying to learn.So now I am wondering:* Is this normal for early devs?* Does architecture/ code structure come with experience, or do people actually study it as a separate skill?* How do you practice code architecture when you do not even know what a good one looks like?* Is relying on AI for structure a bad habit, or is it just the new normal?I do not use AI to write the full code, only the skeleton, and even that already results in something way cleaner than what I would design myself.How did I bridge this gap?Edit:Thanks everyone for the inputs. I think my main issue comes from my history of working in early stage startups where I had to come up with architecture, design, and working code really quickly. The tight deadlines didn’t help either, and there was very little room for mistakes, I was expected to just make things work.

The best way I can explain them is that they were put together with duct tape and bubble gum haha. Whenever I need help with a specific portion, i'd just google the question I had, use code from different forums and tutorials, and edit that code it to fit my specific needs. Like I have no idea how to just free-hand use Pandas for my NFL Algorithm. There is countless hours of googling and taking code to be able to make it happen. I don't know how to just free-hand create an HTML site lol. I just used the code that we learned in a project in school and edited to fit my ideas...I feel like an idiot for that. I guess the best solution is to just keep practicing... but for right now, I just feel like a fraud for not knowing all the intricacies of the languages I use. I am actively looking for entry-level jobs, especially because I have experience in the industy as an Engineering Technician that exposed me to the code that software engineers wrote...

1ot3bss,Ignoring the Burrito analogy. Breaking down monads in the most pragmatic way. Am I correct?,RobertWesner,learnprogramming,"It is day 3 of trying to wrap my head around it and I'm feeling closer to the truth but still not quite there, looking for the final mental relay to click in this connection.I have no clue what ""monoids"" or ""endofunctors"" are supposed to be, nor do i care *yet*. This is my pragmatic breakdown of monads in practice.In essence there are two distinct topics that concern monads:* Purity* Chaining of operations / compositionKey points i have gathered so far, correct me please:* Monads wrap around other ""things""* The ""thing"" the monad wraps around can be operated on within the monad * This operation can also be a ""chain of operations"", monads can do many things internally while appearing to be ""one abstract step"" on the outside* Monads that ""do something"" (= arent simply context), like IO, are ""lazy"". They are representation for computations that are yet to run (unrelated to lazy vs strict languages)* The ""result"" of the monad can be retrieved/calculated and we call that retrieval ""unwrapping""* Making, baking, and eating the monad are pure operations, from an outside perspective, while the inside of the monad *could* practically do whatever impure nonsense it wants * They always are 100% pure ""representations of 1) a value within a context or 2) an operation that produces a value"" * Some have impure operations. For example doing I/O * The impure operation is abstracted away (into oblivion) so the process that ""runs"" the monad does not have to and cannot care about the purity implications of the operation, it simply cares about ""in -> out""If all above points are correctly describing them, monads are not ""that difficult to understand"", so I have to have missed something, right?I guess the biggest hurdle towards understanding monads stems from them coming in many different flavors... Maybe *seems different* from IO when looking from the side, But looking each of them straight in the face they both ""let you get a value, no matter what they have to do to get that value"".",9,0.91,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ot3bss/ignoring_the_burrito_analogy_breaking_down_monads/,2025-11-10 03:27:59,2025-11-11 01:41:51

1oqpvsx,I'm having difficulty finding all kinds of fancy tools and technologies,ZealousidealKale2042,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone!Throughout my years of studying programming and work, I have always had the same question. I don't know how to properly find various tools and libraries.While developing projects or doing my work, I tend to use the simplest and most straightforward approaches, relying on old and time-tested techniques that are hard to ignore when learning programming.When faced with a problem or task, I turn to Google for a solution. I usually find one, but it's often not the most efficient or optimal solution. Later, I find a better, more concise, and secure way to solve the issue that I somehow missed when searching.Each time I publish a repository on GitHub, it only contains the bare essentials for the project and nothing more.But also, every time I open other people's repositories or developers' chats, I see people communicating in Elvish, casting unknown secret spells consisting of made-up words and names of tools and libraries, some of which I have never heard of, such as: just, dependabot, pre-commit, uv, unicornus-pam-pam, umdbpegasus, fizzbuzzenterprisemegacooltool, and so on (some of the names are made up, but I think such tools will appear and become a must-have in the next few days).Many of these pieces of technology can only be discovered by searching for their direct name. However, how can one stumble upon them if they are only searched by name? Furthermore, often, the descriptions of such projects' repositories are as strange as possible and do not reflect their essence. For example, ""FizzBuzzEnterpriseMegaCoolTool is your ambassador to the world of great programming achievements. A framework for delegating fractal powers to transcendent purple entities in the paradigm of the great actor's shift."" What??? Is this some kind of secret agent's code or is it really Elvish?And this framework itself, for example, is just a tool for generating HTTP clients based on a config. Of course, this example is made up, but I believe you understand what I am trying to say. Most project descriptions are a quiet horror. However, the most interesting thing is that it creates the feeling that everyone around you understands what they are and why they are needed.. And in general, everyone except me, of course, has been using this thing since it first appeared on the internet.When I first started studying, I looked at different roadmaps and study plans. There were lots of popular and useful tools and technologies, like git, Linux, VSCode, and more. Now, nothing has really changed - the basic stuff is still the same.I find similar roadmaps and look for these magic technologies, but I don't find them. The most you can find them in all sorts of awesome lists, but even then, not all and not always.Often, these projects have thousands of stars on GitHub, but neither Google nor GitHub search gives me this useful thing - just all the outdated nonsense and users' personal projects.And it happens even more often that such projects have fewer than 500 stars on GitHub, but people still use these things if you look at recent applications or in programmers' chats. How they discovered these things is not clear.There is also a common problem that I can't guess up to a certain concept in principle, and because of that, I can't create a search result, because that idea doesn't occur to me. For example, yesterday, I found out about such a thing as harper. I had never even thought of finding tools to check grammar, especially to automate this check in repositories. Or, for instance, hexagonal architecture, which has become popular in recent years (although the concept and original article have been around for many years). I stumbled upon this by accident. If you search for architecture on Google, there will only be MVC, MVP, MVVM and others, not this one. I don't understand how this spreads and why Google's search doesn't reflect actual trends.I understand that people often learn about concepts and tools through communication and job, rather than searching, but I would still like to know how people initially learn about these things and how they transfer their knowledge. Perhaps I just answered my own question - people simply communicate and interact with each other, sharing information and experiences. Someone may discover something interesting and share it with others, who tell others, and so on. But perhaps I need to hear confirmation of this understanding from you.In my attempts to ask these fundamental and interesting questions in chat rooms, but everyone there was toxic about it or ignored it, although, as for me, finding information and learning new things is the most important part of programming. I sometimes feel as if I have been banned from Google and Github search :D. It feels as if my searches are being filtered to exclude useful information and instead provide irrelevant or nonsensical results.TLDR: I am struggling to find useful new tools, libraries, and concepts in the development community when they are not well indexed by search engines and are mainly distributed through community channels. What important detail of the search for all this am I missing?I am sorry for the messy and unstructured nature of my text. I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do.

I'm 30 now and for the past 4-5 years I've had this growing feeling that I'm really, really going to regret not even trying to make a videogame before I die.I've always pushed this idea away because I'm bad at math, and I'm bad at technical things in general. I get overwhelmed and lost easily, and I get frustrated quickly when trying to learn new software, (Adobe Illustrator my beloathed...) especially when I know what I want to do, but just can't seem to do it...Recently though I've been thinking a LOT about life and I'm becoming increasingly bothered by the fact that I used to be different in that regard. When I was a teenager, I would spend hours on coding Neopets pet pages for fun, or I'd be troubleshooting why some game wouldn't work for three days without getting discouraged, and... I would like to rediscover her again. She's gotta be in there somewhere, still, under all the burnout and stress and frustration. I think I really miss her :/So, I've started looking into it, and oh my stars I am beyond intimidated... but I still want to try. Being a 2D artist, I'd like to work on a 2D game, and it seems that Godot is very well regarded...

Do you have any advice for someone completely and utterly clueless? Can you maybe point me in some useful directions? To be honest even simple words of encouragement would do, because I'm in a state of having 0.0003% confidence in myself, fueled by the usual - I feel like I'm starting very late, I fear not having enough time/energy due to full time job + chronic illness, I fear I won't understand even the simplest things... but mom said it's my turn on the mid-life crisis and I want to try anyway. So I'm here to humbly ask for advice from the programming elders. :folded_hands:Thank you in advance for your time!! :sparkling_heart:(P.S. - I understand most games are made by teams, but I'd really like to try and be a solo dev to start with - I don't want to drag anyone down with me in case this doesn't work out, working with other people is just too stressful at the moment)(P.S. x 2 - I have no interest in AI coding, or any type of generative AI)",5,0.86,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1otv10u/growing_fear_that_ill_regret_not_even_trying_to/,2025-11-11 00:27:39,2025-11-11 01:41:51

1orwkei,The feasibility of creating a small-scope 3D multiplayer game using C and Vulkan.,Lotheye,learnprogramming,"Hello. I come seeking advice.I'm attempting to make a game with C and Vulkan (no engine). It will be low scope. It has a low-mid poly aesthetic, fairly involved mechanics, and will be multiplayer, supporting a handful of servers with lobbies with a max pop of \~16.I'm adequate with C, with a fairly robust knowledge of it's more advanced topics, although I know nothing of networking/multiplayer. Just from cursory research, I hear a lot of nightmare stories of how adding multiplayer could add years of dev time, compounded with using C, it is seen as potentially unfeasable unless you are some kind of savant, which I am not.Now, I did end up getting reasonably far from a first attempt, just implementing the foundations of Vulkan, having an interactable, 3D play area, and moderately advanced game state and mechanic stuffs. Then, my old computer shat the bed, so I am starting from scratch. So, I definitely can at least create the non-multiplayer aspects of the game, but multiplayer is defnitely the big hurdle. I am 100% completely willing to learn this as well.I want to tackle this in a smart way. My plan is to create a single player version first, with all the non-multiplayer related systems in it so that I can at least have a workeable product in case the multiplayer thing doesn't pan out. Yet, the code base will be designed in such a way as to use a simulated pseudo-server, so that I can both at least dip my toes into the water, and when I finally gain a working knowledge of complex networking/multiplayer using C, I can implement it without having to rewrite entire systems from scratch. I'm making this plan without knowing if this is even best practice for this kind of scenario, or workable at all.So, am I being foolish here? Should I bother doing things this way, or should I just jump straight into the deep end and implement networking/multiplayer as I am learning it? Is my plan actually viable, or am I completely misunderstanding just what implementing networking/multiplayer looks like? Is this really such a giant headache with C, at my slightly above average skill level, that I should just not bother at all, and make the game single player?As a short note, I understand that one of the canned responses is to just start with small projects first, but I have never worked this way. I said that I have adequate knowledge of C, but Python was my first language (C is my 4th), and I gained a sufficient mastery over it by doing the complete opposite of that piece of advice. Jumping into the deep end with my grand project of choice is how I learn best. I am just worried if multiplayer would be beyond me by making the development time balloon to the point of making it a non-viable option.",5,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1orwkei/the_feasibility_of_creating_a_smallscope_3d/,2025-11-08 18:23:53,2025-11-11 01:41:51

Keep in mind that preferably we would want a method that isn't blocked behind a paywall, and that we want good habits in terms of organization to form early since we are still teenagers. Also, I'd appreciate it if the UI for the method is easy to understand and intuitive :) Currently, we have a system on Notion (For reference \`notion.com/templates/notion-projects-and-tasks\` ) in which we can a list of tasks and each bunch is separated by a ""project"" which is basically a topic like frontend, backend, note taking, etc. This method is cool, as in it's simple to use and we can very easily add on to each section in their own right. However, this method doesn't have much structure, meaning there's just a bunch of task without any organization of what to do in which order, or any ""branching off"" with tasks in the project that are related to each other. Essentially, it's just a pile of tasks. What we want is a roadmap-based system which we branch out into separate categories (UI, Authentication, Communication, etc.) and in each category, we have a linear roadmap which shows each tasks to do in sequence, each task with it's own note or page where we can either add extra mini ""sub-tasks"" to do and comments about our progress and so on and so forth. In such a way where it like creates a pathway of tasks, each task being it's own branch on the tree that connects to others so it gives us a nice flow on what should be done. You know just like standard roadmap but still with great organization, task management and all. At least that's what we invision as being good Having said that, this is what we are sort of thinking of. But we are young and do not know as much as you other smarter people. So I implore honestly, what would be best? Notion, \*\*Clickup, Jira, Asana\*\* system and software?

I’ve also passed a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).I’m having a hard time recognizing where exactly my lack of skill is and how I should structure my practice. For example, with the LeetCode problem “121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock"", my initial thought was: “Okay, there’s a profit to be maximized — this seems like a decision problem. When to buy? When to sell? Could it be a greedy problem?” I came up with a “greedy” approach, but it failed on a counterexample. After looking up the solution, I found it could be solved with two pointers and a sliding window — a simple and straightforward method.When I tried to find a dynamic programming solution, I couldn’t locate one (at least on YouTube) that started with a recursive approach and then introduced memoization. From what I remember in my DSA course, we first derived the recursive function as a mathematical definition (not code) and then built a table of values for the dynamic programming implementation. I think my problem is that I understand the general ideas of these concepts:\* Backtracking\* Dynamic Programming\* MemoizationI can also identify the problem category:\* Enumeration (find all possible paths or ways)\* Optimization (find the maximum or minimum)\* Decision (e.g., fractional knapsack problem)I’m not getting too emotional about it. If I make mistakes, I study other people’s solutions, then move to the next problem with a fresh mind — avoiding overthinking.

With so many concepts to learn and languages to explore, I often feel lost in the vast amount of information available. I'm curious about how others manage their learning process. Do you set specific goals for yourself, such as completing a certain number of projects or mastering specific topics? How do you measure your improvement over time? Additionally, are there any tools or methods you've found particularly helpful for tracking your learning milestones?

1opqxkh,I’m washed,FabulousTip3302,cscareerquestions,"I was laid off October 2023 and haven’t worked as an engineer since then. Senior engineer, 7-8 years of experience. Honestly, the combination of remote work and alcoholism destroyed my mental health that by the time i received that fateful calendar invite, i was relieved. I didn’t have to do it anymore. I got an okay severance but used that and my unemployment to keep me afloat and not homeless for ~6 months. I quit drinking at that time and interviewed for a few jobs.After two final rounds for a couple jobs and not getting it both times, i’ve basically been frozen. I can’t do the interviews, i can barely even bring myself to apply anymore. I thought it would be easier being sober but it’s like my subconscious is trying to sabotage me because of how truly awful it was in those final months of employment. Here i am, 2 years later, and i’m not even sure if it’s possible for me to get a job anymore when i’ve got a two year gap. I’m borderline homeless, staying with family, and i’m kind of sick of it. Delivering uber eats destroyed my car in this time that i literally just cashed out my old 401k, the absolute last of my savings.

1oske7j,Feelings that the U.S. economy will never recover?,mylogicoveryourlogic,cscareerquestions,"Since about 2020 I have heard seniors in the industry mention how they have noticed waves of jobs that were once for American workers, usually entry-mid level, being offshored to easter europe, latam, the Philippines, and worst of all, india. I'm a dual citizen. Having looked at the job postings in my other country (small country in the Balkans) I've noticed that there are tons of positions for senior software engineers. These are jobs from American companies. I have heard even seniors mentioning that it's harder to get a job. Well no shit that's the case if even senior roles are being outsourced. Not only that, every story I've heard so far of a senior switching jobs ended up with many downsides. Going back to office, pay cut, even shittier work conditions. I'm trying to think about the end goal here. No manufacturing jobs. No IT jobs. Where the hell is the legislation to save the U.S. from collapsing because I don't see any way that it can continue in this trajectory without mass upheaval. Not everybody can be a doctor. Not everybody can be a plumber, especially with how fragile most human bodies are. Not everyone can open a restaurant (which you see tons of them failing and closing down).

1or3gyj,My experience interviewing in 2025 with 5 YOE,queenoyster,cscareerquestions,"https://imgur.com/a/iRI5FRTI wanted to share my experience interviewing for the past two months in this market. I have a Bachelors of Science in a field unrelated to computer science and graduated in 2020, straight into COVID-world. I'd taken a few computer science courses, so I spent my last semester of university looking for software engineer roles knowing we were probably going to be remote for a while.I've been working for five years, with most of that time at Amazon. I've been a mid-level engineer for roughly 1.5 years, but feel that I should've been promoted sooner. Despite what people say about working at Amazon, I've enjoyed my four years here. I lucked out with finding a good team and manager.My main reasons for leaving are:- Amazon comp philosophy is bad. You are assigned stock to meet a target compensation number, with the assumption that the stock will increase 15% YoY. The stock has actually gained 10% YoY since I've started, which means I'm paid less than my target. The solution to this is Amazon assigns more stock that vests the following years to make up for the gap. This means you'd have to stay longer to meet your target compensation. The reverse is also true. If your actual compensation surpasses your target because of stock gains, then you are assigned fewer/no additional stock vests for the next few years. The employee loses when the stock does well and when the stock does poorly.- Layoffs were coming. The volume of posts about layoffs occurring later this year dramatically increased across Blind, internal Slack, r/amazonemployees, various Discords, etc. Morale was already bad since we did two layoffs prior to 2025.- My work was getting stale.- I felt there was no path to senior for me in the next four years.- I distrust my org's leadership.- I'm in Seattle for Amazon and I've accepted it's not my city. I'd like to move to New York City or San Francisco.Most of the jobs I applied to came from LinkedIn, but I applied manually through the employer's website. I targeted midlevel engineering roles if they were available, otherwise, I applied for senior. Towards the tail end of my job search, I used a browser extension called Simplify to autofill applications. I highly recommend this since you can also use it to keep track of your applications, scrum board style. I spread out my applications so that I would have interviews for the two following weeks.To prepare for my interviews, I bought a year of Leetcode premium and a lifetime subscription to HelloInterview premium. I also joined a Slack server targeted towards engineering leadership career development and participated in mock interviews there. My friends generously offered their time to mock interview me as well. These were great because they gave me very candid feedback. I also searched through Glassdoor for other peoples' interview experiences to get an idea of what to expect for companies I was highly interested in. My weakest round is probably the coding round; I completed 160 Leetcode during this interview cycle and felt that was sufficient. I should note that I would've practiced more Leetcode if I were interviewing with large tech companies like Google or Microsoft, but I didn't hear back from them. I also had never done a system design interview before this job application cycle, so I studied that hard. I read every HelloInterview system design article and felt I overprepared.Managing emotions around rejection was pretty difficult, I'm thankful I have good friends I could talk to. I got rejected from my top 3 target companies and I bedrotted for weeks beating myself up over it. If I were to have done anything different, I would've front-loaded my interviews with companies I cared less about. I felt much more comfortable in my later interviews. I also would've spaced out my interviews more. It was difficult balancing them and a full-time job. I tried to do early morning interviews (I even had two 2AM ones!), but found that my performance really suffered in the morning. I'd block out time in the afternoon instead to do interviews and pray no one at work wanted to schedule over them. I'd often work after hours to catch up on work I'd neglected during the day.I ended this interview cycle with 5 offers: 2 senior and 3 mid-level. Two of these offers were at late stage SF-based AI startups (not any of the big names). I accepted one of these. I don't want to reveal exact numbers, but I'll say that my base comp exceeds my total comp at Amazon, and I am extremely happy with it.",325,0.91,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1or3gyj/my_experience_interviewing_in_2025_with_5_yoe/,2025-11-07 19:16:38,2025-11-11 01:41:52

1orkbhk,Approaching 1 year of unemployment,petiteautomaton,cscareerquestions,"I normally don’t post about my personal issues online but I genuinely feel lost on what to do right now. I was laid off in the last week of 2024 and have been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for the past 10 months. I have 5 years of experience at a FAANG company and consider myself good at selling myself because I consistently make it to final interview rounds, but I’ve not landed a single offer all year. Now it’s November and I just got the ‘no offer’ emails after final rounds with two more companies (I think I have failed 12 final loops now). What do I do now? I am lucky to be financially secure but I feel as if my career is dead. While I know my situation can’t be unique I have not found any information about what do here. Things I have tried/am considering:- I’ve worked on personal projects to fill out my resume. They fill the page out well but are always ignored in actual interviews- I’ve applied to smaller companies and startups, but in my experience it is both harder to find job listings for smaller companies and I am ghosted more often by startups than mid-large companies - I’ve considered going back to school to pursue a masters or change fields, but hesitated when seeing grad schools require recommendations from employers. It could be an option but I’d need to hope my managers that I haven’t kept in touch with would recommend me- I could seek underemployment. Not ideal but better than not accomplishing anything - I can keep applying. Obvious but I dread when the gap on my resume has grown so much I stop getting interviewsAny advice or stories about similar situations appreciatedEdit: I appreciate the honest replies. It seems the general recommendation is to improve my interviewing skills and keep applying.

1osy1dv,Two tweaks to my job hunting process that landed me a new job,JagoffAndOnAgain,cscareerquestions,"**tl;dr** 1. Paid an expert to redo my resume, and 2. Ignored LinkedIn/Indeed completely. Bookmarked and applied directly through company Careers/Jobs pages for brand new positions only.---In 2023, I was laid off from a full stack job I loved and was at for 9 years. The severance package provided some ""career coaching and resume assistance"" via Randstad. So I used them to redo my resume which I had always done entirely myself with no external help, including AI. I thought it was a lot better.I was wrong. Throughout the next 6 months in the spring and summer of 2023, I applied to 171 jobs (with 13 YoE at the time). I heard back from 12 (7%), was ghosted by 5 of those and rejected by 4 more. When I accepted my contract position, I ended two other interviews.Cut to this summer 2025. I was thankful for the contract position but wasn't particularly interested in the domain. Also, I got cabin fever working remotely. My new apartment's home office is a lot sadder than the old one. I need to get out of the house and see the sun which I don't do when WFH. I totally understand why most people love WFH- I did it for years. It's just not great for me personally long term. For all this reasons, I began hunting despite the doom and gloom around the current job market.For a few months, I stuck to my old habits. I added my current position to my resume but kept it basically the same as before. I applied to LinkedIn posts along with hundreds of other people. And I was back to my 2023 numbers. In fact, it was worse. I was only hearing back 5% of the time (which this time was only one job) and they ghosted me after one interview. Fuckers.---**1.** I realized I needed a change. I had a gut feeling my resume wasn't great. It wasn't getting me the first look. I'm a software engineer, not a resume expert. These are two entirely different skillsets. A younger me scoffed at the idea of resume writing being valuable: ""I write great code on cool systems, that should be easy enough for anyone to glean from my resume!"" Idiot. I searched ""software engineer resume coach"" and found one with great TrustPilot reviews. I spent $300 for someone to take my old resume, ask me clarifications, and return a brand new resume back to me about a week later.I cannot tell you how much of an upgrade the second resume is. The first one looks like dogshit by comparison. My old resume was a massive wall of text combining some tech keywords with the resume guidance of the late 2000's (my college era when I learned to write a resume). This new version had largely the same information, but it was presented in a much more impressive way. I was impressed by my own resume. It also surprisingly gave me a new sense of confidence going into interviews. It had way more metrics and quantitive points than I had on there.My callback rate when from 5% to 25%. Post-resume glow up, I applied to 12 positions and heard back from 3. Pretty stunning turnaround.But an improved resume wasn't the only thing I changed in this round of job hunting. I changed my application tactics.---**2.** In 2023 and part of my 2025 hunt, I spent a lot of time on LinkedIn applying to jobs according to filters and advanced searches. This just never felt particularly useful. You're adding another layer of software between your resume and a human being's eyes. Also, I just hate LinkedIn. People are so strange and phony on there. So I abandoned it.Instead, I started searching for lists of companies based in my city. I would then bookmark their Careers or Jobs pages in a folder in my browser. By the end of my hunt, I bookmarked about 55 pages. And a few times per week, I would spent about half an hour looking at every single one.I was looking for jobs posted within the last 48 hours but ideally that day. If a day was posted longer than 3 days ago, I considered it a dead end. You want to be in the first 50 in a stack of resumes.Job posting aggregators are a wasteland. I think these days HR looks at the stack of applications in their domain first, then looks to LinkedIn and Indeed if they see nothing promising.---With these two tactics, I interviewed with a few places, narrowed it down to two, and chose the one I was most excited about. It's been off to a good start so far.Anyways, that is my advice from my past few years of job hunting in the frustrating market/economy/country/existence. Good luck!When I posted this to r/experienceddevs I got accused of being an ad almost instantly, so FYI I will not be recommending the resume service I used. Just search around and I'm sure you'll find someone capable. This is merely advice for what seemed to work for me.",149,0.87,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1osy1dv/two_tweaks_to_my_job_hunting_process_that_landed/,2025-11-09 23:19:01,2025-11-11 01:41:52
1ot149w,[PSA] RSUs leave you holding a lot of stock in a single asset. Diversified portfolios help mitigate risk. Not investment advice.,ObjectBrilliant7592,cscareerquestions,"I know lots of developers that are heavily invested in their own companies, due to never cashing their company stock, received through RSUs as part of their compensation package. Many of my friends have done very well on these stocks throughout the last tech bubble and refuse to sell, even though some of their company stocks have since taken a dip. They believe they will make back their unrealized gains. Some of their reasoning is:> It will bounce back, tech stocks are still in a bull market!> I work for the company and things are going really well right now!> It's performed really well in the past!*None of this matters.* Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Most companies that were listed on stock exchanges 100 years ago are *gone*. Many tech stocks today have high P/E ratios and other indicators that suggest they are overvalued. If the AI bubble bursts, it is highly likely that your company's stock will take a hit, regardless of how you perceive their level of exposure to that area.Imagine having a large percentage of your net worth tied up in one stock you picked. This is what you have, effectively. I'm not going to give people here a full rundown on basic investing, but a diversified portfolio is always a strong choice. Speak with an investment professional. Over the long term, a diversified portfolio is always the smart move. Being a bagholder isn't fun.

This faded away due to the whole covid situation, and long story short everyone ended up graduating at their own time and going their own ways.Fast forward a few years and i have very few friends and i find myself doing fuck all on weekends.

1oq9tfb,Six months into my first SWE job at Apple and I still feel like a complete imposter,guineverefira,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I’m about six months into my first full-time software engineering job at Apple, and I constantly feel like an imposter. I still don’t fully understand what’s being discussed in stand-up sometimes — people talk about complex systems and dependencies like it’s second nature, and I just nod along feeling lost.I also find myself relying on AI to generate a lot of my code. It’s something that’s actually encouraged here, but part of me worries it’s making me dependent. I do try to read and understand what it’s doing afterward, but I still feel like I’m just barely keeping up. Without it, though, I honestly think I’d be completely lost and wouldn’t finish half of what I need to do.For example, right now I’m doing some performance testing — running network tests, analyzing latency, and comparing different protocols — and it’s been going on for a while. I just keep feeling like I’m missing something or not doing it the “right” way. Part of me wonders if someone else had this task instead of me, it would’ve been done by now.I also feel like I’m getting things done, but not really understanding them. I can complete the tasks, but idk if i’m even doing them well and I wish I truly understood how and why everything works the way it does — the underlying architecture, the reasoning, the “why” behind each step. It makes me feel like I’m just going through the motions rather than growing as an engineer.Lately I’ve also been feeling kind of dumb — not in a self-deprecating way, but genuinely wondering if maybe my brain just doesn’t think the way a CS brain should. Like, maybe I’m not smart enough for this kind of work. I see how effortlessly some people grasp things like system architecture or debugging complex issues, and I feel like I’m missing whatever “clicks” for them.What really gets to me is hearing how confidently everyone else speaks — about QE, testing flows, deployment, architecture, tokens, etc etc — and I just… don’t feel like I understand the bigger picture. I can get individual tasks done, but I don’t yet “get” how all the pieces fit together in a large-scale system.Has anyone else gone through this? How do you actually learn to think like a real engineer and not just a task-doer? How do I become that person who genuinely knows what they’re doing and speaks knowledgeably and doesn’t just pray to somehow make it through the day without being confused out of my mind? Is this normal? Are there courses, books, or resources that helped you connect the dots and understand the bigger picture of how software systems work in practice?Any advice would mean a lot.",110,0.82,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oq9tfb/six_months_into_my_first_swe_job_at_apple_and_i/,2025-11-06 20:22:41,2025-11-11 01:41:52

My last job was in a big household name company but not one known for tech (more publishing) in Java. I never felt I was more than mediocre, and then I got sick with nebulous undiagnosable long covid, which made my performance worse, and I became an easy budget cut. After a few months of inactive burnout (where I lost a lot of muscle memory), and a few months of sending out CVs, I had pretty much given up on getting any significant interviews any time soon and was pretty much just messing around with ones I didn't care about and building my portfolio as much as possible, with an aim of just learning out loud and then leveraging that in my next round of applying. I was making a language learning app with some NLP elements in python for the last couple months. I haven't written much Java since April, and even then, my last position was fullstack and they had me on a lot of frontend in the final year. I haven't done any leetcode since June (and most DSA I haven't revisited since I got hired at my last place >2 years ago). Studying up on the systems design I'm starting to be expected to understand better as a now potential mid was in my backlog.Suddenly, two days ago I got an email from a big tech company (not FAANG but close, and in an adjacent field to my last company) I had applied to a month or more ago. I remember filling in the application form thinking ""I don't know why I am doing this, I should definitely wait until I have improved myself and have an actual chance. They're going to think this application is pathetic"". I expected no response and honestly forgot entirely about the job position or what I even wrote in that form. They want to interview me for a Java position.I can only assume they saw how my last company is actually vaguely relevant to their product and clicked on my github and saw how active I am rn and actually wanted to give me a chance.I have accepted, have HR on Tuesday, I'm just trying to work out how to get myself in gear in time for the next stage if it happens. Currently revisiting all of DSA on leetcode and doing problems but I'm unsure I can manage to internalise this stuff in time...

1opdfhk,How are you guys getting AI to write working code?,Thiccolas18,cscareerquestions,"So for some context, I would not consider myself old school by any means. I started learning to code with Java back in 2017, so I learned to code ""the old-fashioned way"" by looking at documentation and/or stack overflow before AI came into the mainstream.I now work in test automation primarily using C#, but I also have quite a bit of experience with Python as well. I now use Copilot in my daily workflow, but I genuinely do not understand how you guys are saying things like ""My workflow is 95% prompting then copy and pasting and I barely ever touch code manually now."" My experience with copilot is that it will make up functions left and right that do not exist in the codebase, and it's actually faster for me to just write the code manually and then use AI as sort of a glorified stack overflow. I.e. I can rubber duck with it, and it won't call me stupid for asking a question. I'm genuinely confused how people are vibe coding entire applications.When you guys do this is the code actually robust and work well? Or do you end up spending a lot of time refactoring? Do you spend a lot of time coming up with instructions for the AI? What are the strategies you guys use to make it effective for you? In my experience it seems to be good at things like leetcode, but bad in large codebases with dependencies and structure.Edit: From these responses it seems like most of you use AI basically the same way I do, with the exception of the cursor comments.

1or1gbw,Would you ever go back to a company you were laid off from?,prm20_,cscareerquestions,"I was laid off with about 90% of my team due to company “restructuring” in early 2024. It obviously sucked ass, but I understood this was an unfortunate risk that comes with working Tech for the most part. So I made sure to have contingency plans in place so it wasn’t too bad overall. Here’s the kicker, I have a little under 7 years of experience in Tech, but I spent 4 years as a TPM and only 2.5 as a SDE. So my experience, with lack of schooling, has been hurting me lately. Fast forward to now, I’m currently working as technical ”specialist”, which is just a support role one level lower beneath the Support Engineers. It’s keeping the bills paid (barely) but I recently found out my old company has an opening and they could probably get me back in due to my old rapport with the company.

I’d spend around 12 hours a day between classes, studying, and hanging out in the library. It was intense but I loved the rhythm — I was constantly learning, moving around, and seeing people.Now I work for a big multinational company, I only go to the office once a week. My days look completely different: I wake up, sit at my desk, code my algorithms, and then around 6 PM I shut off my company laptop. And then… nothing. It’s already dark outside, everyone’s going home, and it feels too late to go do anything.I actually like my job — I’m doing exactly what I wanted to do — but the way the 9–5 structure works feels kind of pointless sometimes.

Any newly invented tool/process is assumed to be a must-have, no matter how shitty or irrelevant it is, then puts it in the requirement.3.

1oqflk2,"My devs struggle to work independently, and it's partly my fault. As their manager and fellow dev, how can I start to fix this in a way that gives them time to ramp up but also applies the necessary pressure to get on it?",PentaSector,cscareerquestions,"Hey all. Apologies for the long post. Mainly want to be thorough to emphasize the efforts I've made and the scope of the problem.So, I manage a small squad of devs on a larger project team and maintain a full-time dev workload alongside them. (I know what you're thinking, and you're right, but I've accepted the challenge for the sake of my trajectory.)This is my first managerial role; I was deliberately given less advanced devs, partly to mentor them and help boost their professional development, partly to shield them from aggressive technical leadership. I was fine with that assignment; it plays to my strengths as a mentor and safe space steward. I do what I can to foster collaboration and self-organization - we have* a chat channel just for my reports and me (i.e., a space to screen ""stupid"" questions before asking the wider team, etc.)* regular meetings to check up on work status and collaborate on blockers in real time* 1:1 and 1:few meetings to get people comfortable and talking through obstacles* me frequently working to communicate thought process to the team through detailed code reviews, driving on pair/group programming sessions, and brainstorming out loud during aforementioned meetingsBasically, I'm doing everything I can to not only get people working together, but also to make sure they see the work through my eyes as much as I can verbalize my process.I'm confident in asserting that I'm putting forth disproportionate effort in getting them somewhere closer to my level. My efficiency suffers for it, but leadership is generally happy with my velocity, and I'm still significantly more efficient than the rest of the team. Some of them are legitimately junior and gradually ramping up, but a few have more YoE than I do and frequently submit incomplete, incorrect, or arguably badly engineered solutions (acknowledging that the latter is somewhat subject to my opinions, but it's also the least of my worries). This manifests in incredibly frustrating ways, like having to talk through the same technical guidance or arguments repeatedly as people continue to make the exact same mistakes, and having to frequently repeat what strikes me as obvious advice to solve refactoring or bugfixing problems (e.g., if you're trying to correlate a code path to a navigation path within a web app, start with a known related unit of code and follow the references). Tl;dr: lack of curiosity seems to be a major factor.These are the kinds of problems that resulted in me being stepped up to manage these devs, and the lack of improvement is felt across the wider team. This manifests pretty clearly in the fact that we estimate our own roadmap and have decent leeway to do so, and the devs aren't even meeting their own numbers when they get the padding they argue for. We're essentially not at liberty to stretch our roadmap much further, just given the dependencies on our output, so when we fall behind on our own estimates, it's a problem, and people come under scrutiny.I was recently asked to pull the tech lead into one of our regular meetings - one where mob coding is a frequent engagement - to help gauge the situation. After sitting in on a few rounds, his assessment was that I'm doing enough of the work that they ultimately have no need to be curious when I drive, and he's right. Anytime the devs pull me aside, it turns into me taking the cockpit and talking through how I work; I always let them start, but I usually take over *because* they essentially hit a point where they're just lost or out of ideas, including in the context of obstacles we've specifically worked through before.His proposed solution was to start letting them fail immediately. There's a version of this that I can get on with, but this work environment is not particularly tolerant of the kind of ""failure"" it would entail, and I don't want to put anybody's job at risk.So my question is essentially this:**What's a graduated approach I can take to get people working more independently that gives willing devs a chance and respects my time?**I don't foresee something like purposely tracking my collab hours and tuning them down each week; that'll never hold up. I *have* contemplated cutting all collab hours and letting code review be our only touchpoint. The problem here is that several devs don't seem to internalize review feedback, and PR churn sometimes results in exponential loss of time. E.g., they may submit a PR after one day but take two more to fix relatively simple issues. I'm essentially looking for a way to provide detailed, immediate feedback that they *will* internalize, while keeping my time burden for that sort of effort stable and eventually decreasing.Moreover, **what's a way to do this that doesn't leave people feeling demoralized or traumatized?** I'm clearly frustrated, but these are still people, and I don't want to make their lives hard. I just want to see them perform to their potential.Open to any insights regarding successful approaches that folks have taken here to empower and motivate their teams, especially if starting from a place of subpar performance.Also feel free to ask clarifying questions or hurl clarifying insults; there's surely a lot of context I'm leaving out here, probably in part just because I'm fixating on solving the problem more than thinking broadly around it.**EDIT:** remove a rogue instance of the word ""I'm.""",31,0.89,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oqflk2/my_devs_struggle_to_work_independently_and_its/,2025-11-07 00:13:45,2025-11-11 01:41:52

My role was basically Technical Project Manager (who sometimes writes code or makes websites) by the end of it, and I was hating it. I wanted to leave management and get back to development, so I self-taught Vue and React basics to the point of being able to pass an interview and learn on the job.About 9 months ago, I got a new job as a Vue developer. During the interview process, my now-boss said that she understood the level to which I understood Vue was below what they'd expect of an employee, but they were willing to train me.Perfect! That's exactly what I was looking for, especially since the money was a significant increase compared to what I was earning in my old role as a team lead, so I thought I'd struck gold. And for the first 6 months, it felt that way.Going from knowing Vue at a hobby/passing activity level to a professional level was a difficult climb, but I felt like I was still making progress each day.Lately, however, I have felt like a wasted paycheck and a burden to the team. My main mentor figure changed departments as experienced resource was needed elsewhere, and while I have people I can still reach out to for help, I just keep hitting block after block and feel over-reliant on them.We use Sentry for bug management, and I absolutely cannot stand it.

I asked my now-boss for help a while back, and she's given me the advice of ""When you encounter something you don't understand, research the technology."" along with ""Create a simpler, working version of the part that's broken, then try and apply that logic.""This advice is great...for simple issue that can be Googled or technology I understand the concepts of.

I can SOMETIMES get to the bottom of it, but I have just kept hitting walls of bugs where someone who wrote the system is needed because they understand how it works (the company seems entirely averse to adding comments explaining their code).What I'm struggling with is I just don't know if I enjoy this anymore. A few months ago, I LOVED my job - I'd hit the gold mine and life was going great.Lately though...I have spoken to a therapist and three separate GPs who signed me off for the last two weeks due to ""Acute stress reaction"" (probably not allowed to go into detail on this sub). I'd done a lot of thinking and soul-searching over the last two weeks, hit today (my first day back) with a positive attitude, and yet within 4 hours I'd returned to my habit of crying at my desk.It doesn't help that I work from home, since I'm alone in my room all the time. We go to the office once a week, but I'm the only one from my department and actually works on this codebase who goes in, so I just end up working in a room full of people who are more intelligent and experienced than me, but have never looked at a single line of code that I'm responsible for working on.I just feel stuck. I want to love this job and this career, but the way this job has made me feel lately...it's not living.Has anyone else experienced this? Going from light FE work (HTML, JS, and CSS only) to Vue/React development, picking up the basics, and then just hitting a brick wall 9 months later?Does anyone have any advice?P.S. My therapist has recently advised she thinks I have ADHD, and that perfectionism and unreasonable standards for myself are some of my symptoms and trigger my mental overload/shutdown when I hit my fifth brick wall of the day.

I got my PhD in CS from a good US school, and perhaps just as relevant for the topic, I got a minor in history. I worked in tech in the US, Germany, UK, the Netherlands, and visited China many times for work.To various extents, I've seen the the development of AI, dot-com bubble (indirectly), big data boom, cloud revolution, the Bitcoin inception, the LLMs, and a few side-hypes like the quantum computing.I'm also well-aware of the overall crisis of science, especially with respect to publishing and funding, that spans far beyond the boundaries of Computer Science. Nevertheless, I would argue that no major scientific discipline is in a worse danger than CS, and I'm proceeding to expand on that.Tech has generated an unprecedented amount of wealth over the last three decades. That wealth produced the political power that influenced the society. Unlike some other historically influential movements, this one chose an unsubtle method of societal influence that generates unprecedented amount of discontent, and therefore I denote the people who hold this power as ""moguls."" Worse even for the tech community, the moguls hid their ideological underpinnings and political ambitions behind their ""tech nerd"" images. History teaches us that the majority of the upcoming backlash will center around the images the moguls perpetuate and not their chosen ideologies. Although one could argue that a scientific or engineering discipline may spontaneously evaporate upon fulfilling its historical role, I assume that CS is not at that stage. That is to say that there still exist problems that CS can help humanity with.Under the above assumption, how do we defend CS (and tech) as a discipline once the ""shit hits the fan,"" pardon my French? How do we argue that it's not tech that is evil, but the ideologies fueling the tech moguls?",6,0.52,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ostt8g/how_will_we_protect_computer_science_after_the/,2025-11-09 20:27:57,2025-11-11 01:41:52
1orftw4,Tips for behavorial?,qrcode23,cscareerquestions,"Hello fellow dev,I’m spending this weekend preparing stories and strategies to present myself well to the hiring manager during the behavioral round. I’m pursuing Senior SWE position(s). Through my recruiter screening and technical phone parts, I believe I’ve shown that I’m technically strong, and I think they know through my introductions that I haven’t mentored or led projects. That’s why I’m curious about what expectations I should anticipate when speaking with the hiring manager.This market is tough, so I’m taking all the help I can get. I’m self-aware that socializing isn’t my strongest skill. In past hiring processes for SWE II roles, I tended to succeed at companies that emphasized LeetCode-style technical assessments. But at places where the behavioral portion carried weight, I often fell short—partly because I optimized only for the technical side.Now I’m focused on building strong behavioral stories. I’ve read advice online suggesting it’s okay to “fake it till you make it,” which I interpreted as exaggerating my impact or responsibilities. My assumption was that as long as I know the details well enough to answer follow-up questions, I could frame my contributions more strongly.Overall, I’d love tips on how to frame stories and strategies to present myself effectively to the hiring manager.

Had multiple offers when I finished but went with the one closest to home despite it not being the highest salary. Working as software engineer for a defense contractor and been here 3 years. For the people in a similar company you will know it is semi laid back as things are allowed to move slow but the work can be challenging at times.Heres my dilemma.. I feel like I should be somewhere else making way more money. I think my talent is going to waste here working on 30 year old C++ code. Multiple coworkers have told me not to stay too long or you will have no option in the future. Feeling a bit down. The pro about the job is that it is very secure, almost recession proof. It’s just that it’s starting to feel like im not doing the best I can in my career. I’m about to be 27 and I feel like it’s now or never. Really want to work as an engineer for hedge fund or something to do with trading and quantitative stuff. My company will pay for my masters but that means staying there another 3-4 years. Am I just tired of the repetitiveness? Lately I’ve been thinking it would be the same anywhere I go. I find myself as somebody who wants to get better everyday but this new stage in life seems like I reached a pinnacle. Anybody ever feel the same way? I see people here grinding for jobs and complaining they can’t get one so maybe I’m just ungrateful. TL;DR feeling like I’m not doing enough despite having a decent job.

For reference, I am a data engineer in the semi-conductor industry, and the number of times that I have worked on a project only to:1. Get held up by permissions and access constantly, and have to submit an IT ticket that gets put on the back burner for weeks.2. Find out that I need to use the approved by IT tools/resources which are often completely ass and hold no real world value, and hinder progress, because people making these decisions are looking at safety and budget, not actual function. Looking at you Power Automate flow, the worst platform I have ever had the displeasure of using in my entire life… all because my company won’t allow anyone not directly on the software team to create an actual web application outside of Power App and Power automate flow.3. Deal with management misunderstanding priorities and getting caught up on their grandiose visions of ML/AI which is just literally a buzz word at this point and they have no understanding of what is actually meant by these words. I had a boss that wanted me, by myself, to implement a way to monitor FSE’s , with AI, who are working on the tool to ensure they’re installing the parts outlined in procedures… sir… what?! He pressed us to do this for months despite telling him it isn’t attainable, and he just kept saying, “figure it out.” Until finally he left the he company.4. Management or stakeholders who want a detailed, image based, representation of every single change you accidentally mention instead of just making discretely. I had a manager for a while who, for example, in one meeting I mentioned I have to change the data type of a column on my not even proof of concept project yet, and he had me spend 6 days making DAGs, picture based PowerPoints, and tons of other documentation, because he wanted to understand better… this was a guy who bragged about lying on his resume to get a tech job management position and was previously just monitoring processes and creating tickets when processes failed for wafer runs in the fab…. Needless to say, he was shortly thereafter demoted lol.And so many other things.The point is, exercise, go for walks, meditate, or some thing else to build resilience and clear your mind, and learn patience, because the biggest thing I have learned in the last 3-4 years in this industry is that you will run into so many absurd issues or requests that are in no way based in logic, and are purely emotional, and if you let it eat at you, it’s going to destroy your mental health, work relationships, etc.Godspeed y’all. Edit: I also want to emphasize, I am so grateful to have a job, I love my company, I love the management that I have most of the time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have worked here for 10 years now.

1ooe9vo,Is it alright to showcase repos that have obviously used AI tools/agents in their development?,paxmlank,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR: If I make commits and explicitly/implicitly demonstrate that AI was used, that could suggest both that I need AI to develop or that I am able to use modern tooling to quickly develop a working product. What's the stance on making such repos public with this info?Context: I have ~5 YOE already so maybe showing my GitHub to a prospective employer doesn't matter, but I've been working on a tool for the past week to learn about what goes into it and yesterday decided to just use Claude Code for faster development while still reading through diffs and being meticulous.On the one hand, as far as this tool's development goes, it's something that I want to have at my disposal for my own reasons, and learning about what goes into its development is something I want. So, I don't really care if a HM or whatever doesn't like what they see. That being said, would it be bad in this day and age to just have a repo with many large, quick commits that indicate the obvious use of an AI tool? One the one hand, ""he's vibe-coding and can't do this without AI"", on the other hand, it shows I can use modern tools to quickly deliver something.",4,0.75,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ooe9vo/is_it_alright_to_showcase_repos_that_have/,2025-11-04 17:59:59,2025-11-11 01:41:52

1oqzaxc,is it a good idea to gain a solid/foundational understanding of C/C++ before transitioning to whatever?,-_9Grd56A3iWw6QhNQ_-,cscareerquestions,"hi. i asked a professor of mine and he advised me to consider spending a few months getting the hang of C/C++ before picking up anything else, he tried to emphasize on the importance of doing so but i figured i would ask for outside opinions as well from other people in the industry and this seems like a good place to do sofor what it's worth, i do have time on my side. i don't mind spending six months or so trying to understand and play around with them. i am also unsure of what i'd like to pick up as a career option; typescript/python/go all sound fun, so do zig/rust with how specialized they are, but picking up either of, say, typescript or go would definitely get me to a higher level of ""expertise"" in a shorter time frame, compared to going through C/C++ and then changing, which isn't the priority here, but what i mean is that diving into multiple languages would sort of hinder my progression and just focusing on one thing from the get-go would be more beneficial for me in the long run since i'll just forget whatever i studied prior to those anywaysany advice is appreciated! i'm not in a hurry, but naturally, the sooner the better haha, since i'll have more time to showcase stuff, but i absolutely do want to be good at whatever i do at some point in the future. i think i'd like to maybe learn typescript & go (front/back) eventuallyalso, while not really necessary to point out, i dug around a bit and it seems like going through [this book](http://knking.com/books/c2/) (for C) and [this website](https://www.learncpp.com/) (for C++) is what is generally recommended for these languages. alternatively, i could go through [this tutorial](https://javascript.info/) (for JS) right away, for instance",4,0.65,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oqzaxc/is_it_a_good_idea_to_gain_a_solidfoundational/,2025-11-07 16:40:24,2025-11-11 01:41:52
1oql05h,a junior with imposter syndrome (typical i know),r-injin,cscareerquestions,"just coming on here to vent, i guess. i was hired for a contract to hire position through a recruiter for a major media company in mid august. i've basically been told that this job is ""guaranteed"" once the contract period ends, but i'm taking that with a massive grain of salt and assuming this ""guarantee"" isn't really a guarantee. i've never held a tech job prior to this one, my background is in healthcare and i graduated with a degree in IT in december 2024. i've always considered myself a high performer, i don't like to cut corners, i have this primal need to be thorough in everything that i do and like i must understand, inside and out, the code that i'm writing. if i can't explain why i wrote this the way i did, what am i doing?i completed onboarding probably end of august and since then, i think i've probably *actually* merged maybe 5 tickets. also, since i've been hired, the company i work for has brought on another junior engineer just last week and i started at the same time as another junior engineer. just from talking to the other juniors, it has become painfully evident to me that i am a personality hire. and that's fine! whatever gets you the job, right?? i believe i had, essentially 3 behavioral interviews, and 1 technical interview whereas the other juniors had upwards of 2-3 technical screens. i do also want to mention that my job primarily revolves around vanilla javascript, which i was never proficient in. before my technical interview, i probably crammed all the basics of javascript in < 1 week bc i'd been spending almost 100% of my time using python with the assumption that technical screens would be language agnostic. that was not the case for this interview.i know it's par for the course for juniors to feel ""slow"" or ""behind"", it truly does feel like drinking from a fire hose in terms of understanding wtf is going on before i even think about writing a solution for the ticket i'm working on. 90% of my time spent is just understanding what others have written, how to work with it, etc. i've never touched unit testing in jest prior to this role and now i'm responsible for writing unit tests with 95% coverage for every ticket i write - literally everything is brand spanking new to me lmfao and, ofc, i also know that juniors are certainly not expected to contribute *meaningfully* probably for the first year or so. but, at the same time, if it's taking me 1 month to work on a 3 point ticket, i cannot help but feel out of my depth and like i don't deserve to be in the position i'm in. i ask questions when i need to, i ask to be part of meetings/ask if i can sit in on discussions revolving technology i have zero exposure to (hello datadog & synthetics testing!!!!), i'm chatty and maybe even too responsive on slack, i participate in outings, all that shit.am i crazy to feel like they hired the wrong person for this job?? at the end of the day, i was hired to do a job and i feel like i'm not doing that job. my engineering manager tells me everyone on the team loves me, blah blah blah, but he would ""love"" to see me ""pick up more tickets"". idk gang, am i letting imposter syndrome get the better of me? tia :''')",5,0.73,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oql05h/a_junior_with_imposter_syndrome_typical_i_know/,2025-11-07 04:30:27,2025-11-11 01:41:52

I guess I always just assumed design is for naturally creative people who have an interest in that stuff.* In mid 40s now, and gone back into a fulltime job as fullstack dev recently, but not enjoying it after being so used to having my freedom most of my career.* I like working on my own big complex solo projects, but not working on big shared codebases and/or in teams. * I've got ADHD, which is a big differentiator here... no problem cranking 30 hours on my own projects, but staying motivated & focused on team projects is very hard... I'm constantly ""whinging/arguing in my head"" about things I don't like in the codebase, which I know is unproductive, but I can't help it.* I'm considering going back to being self-employed, and maybe learning to design sites myself, so I can do everything myself, rather than being more limited to backend dev, and relying also not relying on wordpress themes for the design side.* Wondering if anyone else had made this kind of change? i.e. more techie-minded people who weren't interested in design (or even frontend) for a long time, but went and learnt it anyway to run their own small webdev agencies? * Typically I've taken on these small site jobs, and just throw together in Wordpress (not a fan)... mainly because of the themes available (seeing I'm not a designer)... my theory here is that I'd instead build something closer to static sites with React (stack that I like), and learn the design side so I can at least design pretty standard brochureware business sites for clients. * None of my clients that I've built wordpress sites for ever actually use the control panel to edit stuff themselves (and I hate having to edit stuff in wordpress for them), so I'm thinking of just charging a bit more for the hosting, and including updates in those ongoing fees.* I don't mind dealing with clients and all that ""soft skills"" side of business, chasing invoices etc... plenty of experience with it mostly being self-employed... and much prefer handling that myself than dealing with vague requirements passed through communication-by-proxy in bigger companies. * What I'm seeking advice/anecdotes about here is more just the ""learning to design"" side for anyone with a similar techie background. ... how feasible is it?
