1mfx209,I used to think data engineering was a small specialty of software engineering. I was very mistaken.,big_like_a_pickle,dataengineering,"I've had a 25 year career as a software engineer and architect. Most of my concerns have revolved around the following things:- Application scalability, availability, and security.- Ensuring that what we were building addressed the business needs without getting lost in the weeds.- UX concerns like ensuring everything functioned on mobile platforms and legacy web browsers.- DevOps stuff: How do we quickly ship code as fast as possible to accelerate product delivery, yet still catch regression defects early and not blow up things?- Mediating organizational conflicts: Product owner wants us to go faster but infosec wants us to go slower, existing customers are complaining about latency due to legacy code but we're also losing new customers because we're losing ground to competitors due to lack of new features. I've been vaguely aware of data engineering for years but never really thought about it. If you had asked me, I probably would have said *""Yeah, those are the guys who keep Power BI fed and running. I'm sure they've probably repurposed DevOps workflows to help with that.""*However, recently a trap door opened under me as I've been trying to help deliver a different kind of product. I fell into the world of data engineering and am shocked at how foreign it actually is.Data lineage, feature stores, Pandas vs Polars, Dask, genuinely saturating dozens of cores and needing half a TB of RAM (in the app dev world, hardware is rarely a legit constraint and if it is, we easily horizontally scale), having to figure out what kind of GPU we need and where to optimally use that in the pipeline vs just distributing to a bunch of CPUs, etc. Do we use PCA reduction on these SBERT embeddings or not?Even simple stuff like ""what is a 'feature'?"" took some time to wrap my head around. *""Dude, it's a column. Why do we need a new word for that?""*Anyhow... I never disrespected data people, I just didn't know enough about the discipline to have an opinion at all. However, I definitely have found a lot of respect for the wizards of this black art. I guess if I had to pass along any advice, it would be that I think that most of my software engineering brethren are equally ignorant about data engineering.

1md5wp9,quick PSA on LLM fear.,Thinker_Assignment,dataengineering,"hey folks, i see a lot of fear of LLMs and i just wanted to say we are doing ourselves a disservice by having knee jerk reactions against it.# The real threat isn’t replacement. It’s displacement.Your work isn’t actually replaceable by autocomplete. But it **looks like it is,** and that’s the problem.LLMs are built to sound confident, not to be correct. They generate fluent, plausible output that gives the *illusion* of competence, without understanding, judgment, or responsibility.So the danger isn’t the model. **It’s your manager thinking you’re replaceable.** Or their manager pressuring them to “do more AI, less people.” Or a CFO using AI as cover for layoffs in a foggy, panic-driven economy.You won’t be replaced by a language model. But you can be **displaced** by the perception that one is “good enough.” The next few years look the same: Industry is adding: memory, tools, multimodal input, even planning— Still out of reach, no clear pathway ahead: **true cognition, self-awareness, reasoning under uncertainty, and grounded understanding.** even today for cognitive restructuring and grounding we use 2k year old methods like socratic questioning - we're nowhere close to solving this.# How you can win this fight Right now, every company is standing in a dense AI fog. No one knows what’s real, what’s hype, or how to use these tools safely.The most valuable roles today? They go to the **LLM navigators** — the people who understand what's possible, what’s coming, and how to steer through uncertainty.It’s the same prestige arc we saw with data 15 years ago. With ML 5–10 years ago. And now it’s your turn.You don’t need to be an LLM expert. But if you’re the one testing tools, forming opinions, stress-testing outputs, and helping others make sense of it all — you’ve already stepped into leadership.**Be the scout.** The one-eyed engineer guiding the blind through this strange new frontier. It’s improv now. The answer is “yes, and…” → Yes, and let’s do it safely. → Yes, and let’s make the most of it. → Yes, and let’s not blow up the business.But “no”? no AI, no experiments, no change? This will get interpreted as “no value.” ""falling behind"" ""missed opportunity"" ""company risk"". And if you’re a blocker, the system will set you free and find a helper.So don’t be a victim. Don’t freeze. Don’t frame it as *you vs. AI.* That’s a losing game.Frame it as: **“I’m the one who understands AI. I’ll help us use it — safely, effectively, and with eyes open.”**That’s who companies want. That’s who they’re **desperate** to invest in. And while you personally as an engineer may not care, this is the **prestige** that data managers in large companies are after - they want to be the person steering the company in AI age, keep job, get promoted, take credit for riding the possibilities out there. It's almost like whitepapers used to be a few years ago. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I hope this helps you guys keep your jobs.",202,0.95,20,https://i.redd.it/5l0gt05s10gf1.png,2025-07-30 12:57:57,2025-08-05 01:56:22

1mce29s,A little rant on (aspiring) data engineers,Stock-Contribution-6,dataengineering,"Hi all, this is a little rant on data engineering candidates mostly, but also about hiring processes.As everybody, I've been on the candidate side of the process a lot over the years and processes are all over the place, so I understand both the complaints on being asked leetcode/cs theory questions or being tasked with take-home assigned that feel like actual tickets. Thankfully I've never been judged by an AI bot or did any video hiring.That's why now that I've been hiring people I try to design a process that is humane, checks on the actual concepts rather than tools or cs theory and gets an overview of the candidate's programming skills.Now the meat of my rant starts. I see curriculums filled to the brim with all the tools in existance and very few years of experience. I see peopel straight up using AI for every single question in the most blatant way possible. Many candidates mostly cannot code at all past the level of a YouTube tutorial.It's very grim and there seems to be just no shame in feeding any request in any form to the latest bullshit AI that spews out complete trash.Rant over. I don't think most people will take this seriously or listen to what I'm saying because it's a delicate subject, but if you have to take anything out of this post is to stop using AIs for the technical part because it's very easy to spot and it doesn't help anybody.TLDR: stop using AI for the technical step of hiring, it's more damaging than anything",137,0.9,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mce29s/a_little_rant_on_aspiring_data_engineers/,2025-07-29 15:12:15,2025-08-05 01:56:22

Even with event timestamps and buffer logic in Spark, we end up with duplicated records or gaps in aggregation windows.And two. Schema drift is also messing things up. Whenever the hardware team updates firmware or adds new sensor types, the structure of the incoming data changes slightly which breaks something downstream.We have tried enforcing Avro schemas via Schema Registry but it does not do that well when things evolve quickly.To make things even worse, our Snowflake MERGE operations are starting to fizzle under load. Clustered tables help but not enough. We are debating whether to continue building around this setup with more Spark jobs and glue code, or switch to something more managed that can handle real-time ingestion and late arrival tolerance.

1mbypdh,Is data engineering becoming more plug and play? A few questions about the profession.,EversonElias,dataengineering,"I got into data engineering during the pandemic, when an internship opportunity came up. I find the profession interesting, but I don't think I've ever really found myself in it. What's more, I've only had experience with medium-complexity projects. I don't think I ever really worked with big data. That's why I decided to ask you about it, because my view may have some negative bias.Where I've worked, I've used a lot of ready-made solutions on well-known platforms, such as Databricks, GCP and Azure (including Fabric). With each passing day, I feel that I've picked up many ready-made things. The connectors are ready, the platforms are ready and some already offer options to optimize automatically. Not that it's a bad thing, because this abstraction makes work easier and allows us to focus on what's most important: modeling, security, scalability, data quality, etc.However, even that makes me a little worried about my future in the profession. The platforms are going to offer more and more pre-assembled configurations. What will be left to challenge me in the profession? Sometimes I see myself as a doer of the same things and less of a creator... I've sent out a few CVs recently and haven't had many replies, so it could be that I'm actually taking a rather pessimistic view.

I’m a Junior Data Engineer (\~3 years in, including internship), and I’ve hit a point where I feel I need to **level up my technical foundation**, but I’m struggling with self-discipline and consistency when learning on my own.# My background:* Comfortable with Python (ETLs) and basic SQL (creating tables, selecting stuff, left/inner joins)* Daily use of Airflow (just template-based usage, not deep customization)* I work with batch pipelines, APIs, Data Lake, and Iceberg tables* I’ve *never worked with*: streaming, dbt, CI/CD, production-ready data modeling, advanced orchestration, or real data architecture* I’m more of a “copy & adapt” (from other prod projects) engineer than one who builds from scratch — I want to change that# My problem:I **don’t struggle with motivation**, but I do with **discipline**. When I try to study with MOOCs or read books alone, I drop off quickly. So I’m considering **enrolling in a postgrad certificate or structured course**, even if it’s not the most elite one — just to have *external pressure* and deadlines. I care about building real skill, not networking or titles.# What I’m looking for:* A **practical learning path**, preferably with hands-on projects and real tech* Structure that helps me stay accountable* Deepening my skills in: Airflow (advanced), PySpark/Spark, Kafka, SQL, cloud-based pipelines, testing, CI/CD* Willing to invest time and money if it helps me build solid skills# Questions:* Has anyone here gone through something similar — what helped you push through the discipline barrier?* Any recommendations for **serious technical courses** (e.g. Udemy, DataCamp, Udacity, ProjectPro, Coursera, others)?* Are structured certs or postgrad programs worth it for people like me who need external accountability?* Would a “nanodegree” (e.g. Udacity) be overkill or the right fit?Any thoughts are welcome. Honesty is appreciated — I just want to get better and build a real career.Is it really just ""get your sh\*t together and create a personal project"". Is it that easy for most of you guys?

You pay for all tables replicated, even if many are not used now.2) Less flexibility: archiving/access to raw data is tied to Redshift; older/unused data still incurs cost.3) Possible need to manage Redshift partitioning, retention policies, and performance tuning as more data accumulates.I am confused what to use.

Disclaimer: we created the Telomere service that this integrates with.With just a couple lines of code, you can monitor both schedule health (""did the nightly job run?"") and execution health (""did it finish within 4 hours?""). The provider automatically configures timeouts based on your DAG settings: from telomere_provider.utils import enable_telomere_tracking # Your existing DAG, scheduled to run every 24 hours with a 4 hour timeout... dag = DAG(""nightly_dag"", ...) # Enable tracking with one line! enable_telomere_tracking(dag)It integrates with Telomere which has a free tier that covers 12+ daily DAGs. We built this because Airflow's own alerting can fail if there's an infrastructure issue, and external cron monitors miss when DAGs start but die mid-execution.Check out the [blog post](https://modulecollective.com/posts/telomere-airflow-provider/) or go to [https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider](https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider) to check out the code.Would love feedback from folks who've struggled with Airflow monitoring!",13,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mfx5u8/released_an_airflow_provider_that_makes_dag/,2025-08-02 18:08:31,2025-08-05 01:56:22

1mdw8ef,Architecture advices on AWS,Adrien0623,dataengineering,"Hey!I recently joined a new company as their first data engineer. The team had already set up a basic data warehouse, but I see opportunities to improve its scalability and efficiency.In my previous roles, I primarily worked with GCP using BigQuery, Dataproc, and Airflow-managed Spark jobs. I found that stack to be clean, scalable, and cost-effective as a batch oriented pipeline. Now that I’m working in an AWS environment, I’m adapting to a different toolset and architecture.Here’s a high-level overview of the current setup:- Ingestion: Airbyte pulls data from backend databases every few minutes.- Storage & Transformation: A provisioned Redshift cluster serves as the warehouse, with DBT jobs triggered by GitHub Actions.- Consumption: A back-office app queries both Redshift (when joins accross backend services data are required) and the backend databases (for real-time needs).While this works for now, it lacks scalability and clarity. Key challenges I’ve identified:- No data partitioning, due to Airbyte’s current limitations. It's still striking that they don't support it on such important connectors as Redshift or S3...- No clear separation between data lake and data mart, making the warehouse feel disorganized.- Redshift is over-provisioned and underutilized, resulting in high costs for relatively low value.- When backend databases schemas changes (which is frequent), there's often a lot of manual procedure to handle breaking changes.To address this, I’m considering the following changes:- Replace Redshift with Athena + Glue to cut costs and enable a more flexible, serverless architecture—accepting a bit more latency in return.- Eventually replace Airbyte with Spark or Glue-based ingestion, to introduce time partitioning and better control (though some source tables lack timestamp fields, which limits options for now).- Move away from GitHub Actions and adopt a more robust scheduler like Airflow.- Possibly replace DBT with Spark for greater flexibility in the long term.- Add a BI tool connected on the data warehouse to enable self service analysis internally.Given the company expects significant data growth, I’d like to design something more scalable, but still pragmatic and cost effective. For now many people agree the current architecture is problematic, that processes are complex and error-prone and that we have little observability and room for improvements. However due to organization structures I have little impact or decision level on data models, migrations etc. And because many people don't have data expertise or experience it's often hard to make them understand some challenges and why some practices are problematic and not future-proof. So I'd be very grateful to get your view on the following questions to be sure I'm heading in the correct direction:1. Does this current architecture seem suboptimal to you as well?2. Do my proposed changes make sense, or would you suggest a different direction?3. Any other ideas for improving or simplifying the setup?Thanks a lot!",10,0.92,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mdw8ef/architecture_advices_on_aws/,2025-07-31 08:40:03,2025-08-05 01:56:22

1meipzo,"Using SQL to auto-classify customer feedback at scale, zero python and pure SQL with Cortex",New-Ship-5404,dataengineering,"I wanted to share something practical that we recently implemented, which might be useful for others working with unstructured data.We received a growing volume of customer feedback through surveys, with thousands of text responses coming in weekly. The manual classification process was becoming unsustainable: slow, inconsistent, and impossible to scale.Instead of spinning up Python-based NLP pipelines or fine-tuning models, we tried something surprisingly simple: **Snowflake Cortex's** `CLASSIFY_TEXT()` function directly in SQL.A simple example: SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.CLASSIFY_TEXT( 'Delivery was fast but support was unhelpful', ['Product', 'Customer Service', 'Delivery', 'UX'] ) AS category; We took it a step further and plugged this into a scheduled task to automatically label incoming feedback every week. Now the pipeline runs itself, and sentiment and category labels get applied without any manual touchpoints.It’s not perfect (nothing is), but it’s consistent, fast, and gets us 90% of the way with near-zero overhead.If you're working with survey data, CSAT responses, or other customer feedback streams, this might be worth exploring.

1mcrhcq,Offer decision,Existing-Mousse3509,dataengineering,"Hi, first of all I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this, for my English (as it's not my first language), and for any mistakes since this is my first time posting.I'm writing here to ask for advice regarding a decision I need to make between two offers I've received. I'm unsure which one to take, as I’m trying to evaluate how each could benefit me in the future.To give some context, I have a BSc in Computer Science and worked for a year as a Software Engineer. During that time, I became interested in data, so I decided to leave my job and enroll in a Master’s in Data Science, from which I recently graduated. During the program, I was particularly interested in subjects related to Big Data and Cloud, more so than ML and DL. Then I started to see Data Engineering as a great career path, since I think it combines my previous software engineering skills with data, and I’m also quite interested in architecture.Now, about the two offers:On one hand, I received an offer from a tech consultancy focused on data. It’s aimed at recent graduates and includes a short training period in technologies like Scala and Spark, after which you start working on a client project. I like that this offer is very focused on people wanting to pursue a Data Engineering career, which really appeals to me. It also offers full remote work, which I appreciate (although I’d also like the option to go to the office and meet people). From what I’ve seen, over time you can progress toward a Data Architect role, which I also find interesting.However, most of the people who have been part of this program in previous years seem to come from non-tech backgrounds or bootcamps, and managed to get in with minimal justification. In fact, when I got the offer call, they told me I was one of the most qualified candidates they’d seen in terms of education and IT experience, which made me a bit skeptical. Another downside is that this offer pays less than the second one, and I might end up being subcontracted to the same client that the second offer comes from.The second offer comes from a well-known bank in my country. After going through several processes, I was offered the position of ""Data Scientist Analyst"", and they told me I could choose the department that interested me most. I chose the Engineering department because it seemed the most appealing, and they mentioned that they work closely with other Data Engineers and Architects. Even though they mentioned some technologies I’m familiar with (Python, SQL, PySpark, Git, BigQuery, CI/CD), it still feels like the role is more data science–oriented than engineering.The positives are that the bank pays more and has better benefits overall, and it could add some prestige to my cv even if the experience isn’t exactly what I’m looking for. On the downside, I'm required to go to the office 3 days a week, and it’s quite far from where I live by public transport. If I want to drive there, I’d have to wake up very early to avoid traffic and not lose my whole day. Also, from what I’ve read and seen from others working there, the role seems very focused on ML, which doesn’t excite me that much, I actually got Little bit bored of it during the Master’s. But then again, maybe working on ML in a real job is very different from studying it in university, so it might turn out to be more interesting than I expect.That’s why I’m unsure whether I should take the first offer or take a chance on the second one, see if I like it, and if not, try to pivot to a more suitable project/ department or job in the bank, and leave with some experience if it doesn’t work out. I feel like if I reject the bank now, I probably won’t get another chance to work there in the future.So I’m looking for opinions and different perspectives from others, because honestly, I feel a bit lost and don’t really know which path to take since nowadays Data Engineering seems more appealing.Again, sorry because probably I forgot to mention so many details, either way I’ll be happy to answer questions you might have.",11,0.79,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mcrhcq/offer_decision/,2025-07-29 23:49:57,2025-08-05 01:56:22

I currently have a dictionary object that I just set some first level data in. I save this dictionary object several times as a file up in a bucket. This tracks information about the process such asa. did i log into the API successfullyb. how much data is availablec. how much data did i download successfullyd. did the api report any license changes when queried.This is all separate from the API data that I download and save. I want to save the process information as it helps me troubleshoot and manage what happened. I then process the process information json file after the fact to see what happened. The read/report process runs in a different code base so the idea of having json is nice since i dont have to care about the json being a certain structure. I output some text to a chat bot to a small group of users. I would like to send some more information in the read/report process via email; or even save to a database and stand up a simple self hosted streamlit process. However, when I report it's a straight one-shot read the json files saved, do some simple calcs in pandas and output to a chat room. I dont save the metrics in another datasource.However i would like to send a lot more information in the json file as the process runs. And I want to report on it. Each process has several disparate steps that it goes through. I am thinking that I should convert the json file to a pub sub event process that publishes to a database. I have GCP so i can use pub sub, I also have access to a simple postgresdb to publish to. I do like that my stack is simple (json file to bucket) but i also know that I am not getting information that I want.Thoughts on how I could improve on this? I dont mind adding something to the stack to support it. Adding something like Sentry would be my last choice at the moment as I am trying to keep the reporting stack closer in house.

1mgv9ri,New educational project: Rustframe - a lightweight math and dataframe toolkit,palashtyagi,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I've been working on [`rustframe`](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe), a small educational crate that provides straightforward implementations of common dataframe, matrix, mathematical, and statistical operations. The goal is to offer a clean, approachable API with high test coverage - ideal for quick numeric experiments or learning, rather than competing with heavyweights like `polars` or `ndarray`.The README includes quick-start examples for basic utilities, and there's a growing collection of demos showcasing broader functionality - including some simple ML models. Each module includes unit tests that double as usage examples, and the documentation is enriched with inline code and doctests.Right now, I'm focusing on expanding the DataFrame and CSV functionality. I'd love to hear ideas or suggestions for other features you'd find useful - especially if they fit the project's educational focus.### What's inside:* **Matrix operations**: element-wise arithmetic, boolean logic, transposition, etc.* **DataFrames**: column-major structures with labeled columns and typed row indices* **Compute module**: stats, analysis, and ML models (correlation, regression, PCA, K-means, etc.)* **Random utilities**: both pseudo-random and cryptographically secure generators* **In progress**: heterogeneous DataFrames and CSV parsing### Known limitations:* Not memory-efficient (yet)* Feature set is evolving### Links:* GitHub: [Magnus167/rustframe](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe) (includes CI/CD and self-hosted runners)* Crates.io: [rustframe](https://crates.io/crates/rustframe)* Homepage & Examples: [magnus167.github.io/rustframe](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/)* Docs:  [magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs/)  or  [docs.rs/rustframe](https://docs.rs/rustframe/latest/rustframe/)* [Benchmark report](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/benchmark-report/)* [CodeCov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Magnus167/rustframe/)I'd love any feedback, code review, or contributions!Thanks!",4,1.0,0,https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe,2025-08-03 21:34:11,2025-08-05 01:56:22

I'm fine with making a website, I'm fine with HTML, I'm fine with JavaScript, but you're not catching me writing any CSS and so I let AI do it. ""Style it this way with the color scheme we specified and maintain the same style for the borders that we've been using, and put each element in it's own little border side-by side"". I paste in the CSS and the button is black instead of pink and each element is listed vertically instead of horizontally like I asked it to. And so what do I do? I tell it to please fix it. ""They're not side-by-side, they're being listed vertically, please fix it or tell me what changes to make, here is the broken code"". I paste the supposedly ""corrected code"" and.... nothing is corrected, IT'S STILL THE SAME. I spent at least 8 minutes doing that when I'm sure that if I had learned CSS like a normal front-end developer, I would've been able to solve that problem in 2 minutes max. And you know what the worst part is? The AI will tell you with 100% confidence, ""Oof, you're so close! Here is the corrected version"", and it's not the correct version.Another example, a few days ago I tried to give vibe coding another chance, just for the experience. I installed Cursor and I told the AI exactly what app I wanted to make. I wanted a mobile app that let's users track their water intake, calories, and create workout plans with a calendar in the app, the UI will be built with Kotlin, the backend with Java and the database will be SQLite. Very popular technologies used for mobile development, so it should be easy right? No, the AI couldn't even get past installing Java dependencies. It installed Gradle, but it installed version 4 which doesn't work with Java 21 and so instead of recommending that we upgrade Gradle, it instead recommends that we DOWNGRADE JAVA, to Java 17 WHICH ALSO DOESN'T WORK WITH GRADLE VERSION 4. I ended up giving up like 20 minutes into trying to start the damn project, I swear it was this back and forth of ""seems like this isn't working, should I proceed with ...?"" I press proceed because it seems like a reasonable thing to do and it didn't work, over and over and over again and because I know nothing about Kotlin and Java I didn't even know how to debug the thing, which makes the experience even more frustrating.

Every line mattered and every bug you fixed gave you a sense of fulfillment. When everything finally came together it felt amazing. You created something purely with your own hands and brain.Now I feel like all of that is gone. With AI spitting out entire apps it just feels empty. Sure, I could just not use AI, but who is really going to choose to be less productive, especially at work where everyone else is using it?It doesn’t feel the same anymore. The craftsmanship of coding feels like it is dying. I used to spend hours reading documentation, slowly building something through rigorous testing and tweaking, enjoying every part of the process. Now I just prompt and paste. There is zero fulfillment. When people talk about AI replacing programmers, most worry about losing their jobs. That doesn’t worry me, because someone will still have to prompt and fix AI-generated code. For me it’s about losing the joy of building something yourself.Does anyone else feel this way?

I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.In linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor. I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems, but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \*any\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation. In discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me. In intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.I ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.I have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school. I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year, but I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS degree curriculum on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.When I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. when I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as ""how to draw a 2d triangle program"" opens up a new journey learning the opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.I have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. I then go back to an ""intro to java/python/c# course"" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages. I don't understand how a computer is able to encode the concept of inequality such as 2 <3 or why I need a current and temp variable when traversing an array or swapping array values.I'm not quite sure how to move forward.",13,0.9,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mf0jc4/should_a_student_learn_computer_science_with/,2025-08-01 16:07:01,2025-08-05 01:56:23

Well, you know how some of you guys (typically beginners) will wait until you get a cool idea of what to code like a poker game or a new mod for minecraft, code it, then wait for your next big idea to come to you? Yeah stop doing that. Waiting on motivation to code won't build good habits and at the end of the day you can't make it that far, not just in getting a job but in your personal growth as well. Coding by discpline means to code something, anything every day or whatever interval you want to set. If you don't have an idea, search for one online. Maybe even do some leetcode problems if nothing interests you that day. But, you have to do something. After all, if you want to get a job in coding you will have to code every day. Might as well get used to it early right?

If another manager needs access to a resource, just request a pointer to the manager that owns it through the service locator.Here's my question: In especially large-scale projects that involve A LOT of communication between its managers, are multithreaded, and especially do unit testing, what is the better approach: dependency injection or service location?

I've been with said company for almost 11 months now.Over this past year, I've tasked with single-handedly developing an internal web application. This app includes a range of features - from web scrapers and data preprocessing scripts, to systems for managing and rating external collaborators, and even some AI agents that automate repetitive tasks.The stack I'd chosen to work with is Next.js, FastAPI and PostgreSQL.I won't lie - the journey developing this app has been a tough one. Being fresh out of university with limited knowledge and experience, and the only developer in the whole company meant a lot of trial and error and ambiguity in the beginning. But that challenge has also proven to help me grow as a person. I've learned many things of which I had no idea about before.That said, due to heavy nature of said responsibility and time constrains, I've also relied quite heavily on AI whenever I would hit a roadblock. While it's been helpful, I feel like it made me skip the deeper learning that comes from reading the docs and explore various sites, such as StackOverflow and others. Now, that the app had reached a solid state, I would like to go back and rectify my past mistakes.So now, I'm reaching out to the more experienced devs here:What books, courses, or other resources would you wholeheartedly recommend to someone who wants to deepen their skills, fill in knowledge gaps, and become truly solid - maybe even a ""cracked developer""? Something that would make me stand out from the rest of my peers as a SWE.Through this job, I’ve discovered a strong passion for Python, backend development (FastAPI) and Generative AI (LangGraph and LLMs' APIs) - so I’d love to also hear your suggestions on these topics on how I can become more proficient, perhaps even share with me some valuable tips.As I've mentioned earlier, being a solo dev - a beginner, nonetheless - often felt like I was missing out on a real growth experience. I didn’t have someone more experienced to learn from, to guide me when I was stuck, or just to point me in the right direction when things got overwhelming. I’m also pretty sure that while building the internal web app, there were better tools or approaches I could’ve used — I just didn’t know about them at the time. That's why I want to change that. I want to become a better dev and, due to the competitive nature of the current market, not get lost with the tide.",5,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1md67si/looking_to_grow_as_a_junior_dev_need_help/,2025-07-30 13:11:17,2025-08-05 01:56:23

I just thought if I solve enough questions, if I just see enough codes from the past, I’d be able to get past it like I did with other subjects in high school but it’s not true. The more I try to become better, the more I realize the biggest issue is: I really don’t know how to break down big problems into smaller ones, know how to specify what kind of functions/ datatypes I will use, and solve the problem. I’ve just been learning the syntax, never deeply dove down to the core of the problem, and relying on ai when there are parts I dont know how to fix. And to make things worse, I really dont know how to practice these things.

1mfx8u9,"New CIS Grad, No experience. What are my options realistically?",soulunknown333,learnprogramming,"Hello,I graduated this past June with a bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems. I’m aiming to get into front end web dev / software dev, but I’m seeing how tough it is for new grads with no experience. I'm honestly just hoping to land any position that relates to my degree now.The only job I’ve had is working at Burger King for a year. I know I messed up not doing internships during school. Skill-wise, I know HTML, CSS, some basic JavaScript, C++, Java, and SQL. I’ve been working through The Odin Project but I’m only around halfway through the Foundations section. It’ll probably take me well into next year to finish the whole curriculum and ideally I’d like to be working before then.I know this kind of post probably shows up here a lot, and I’ve done a bit of googling and researching already. I guess I just want to feel more certain about what all my options really are, given my situation and in todays market (since it seems to shift around quickly).After researching, I'm wondering if I should just get my A+ cert and try to land a help desk job for now. I’d honestly prefer not to go that route, but if it’s the most realistic way to get a foot in the door, I’ll do it.So basically I’m wondering: – Is it still worth trying to get an internship now, even after graduating? – Are there other entry-level roles besides help desk that I can realistically land with my degree + skills in 2025? – Given where I’m at, what should I focus on most right now?Any advice or personal experience would be really appreciated.

However making feature enhancements or UI tweaks was painful or just impossible.

Also learned git and pushing to github.Then I discovered Svelte and my life changed, it is amazing. Nextjs is fairly poopy in comparison. But there are very limited learning resources for Svelte5/Sveltekit working with supabase. The Svelte docs seem geared to experienced coders.Looking for any good resources to teach me webdev concepts e.g. when to use components, props, state, effects, best practices for API calls to the backend, etc. In one project I was manually calling the same component multiple times, then I saw a youtube video on how to use For Each to iterate through it.

1mfteom,Hiring norms have changed much faster than entry level candidates realize,FredWeitendorf,cscareerquestions,"A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)Let me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may ""know"" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.Number one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?Number two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.Third most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they ""get it""? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.None of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.Here are a few common examples:* Sending very flowery, ""fake personalized"", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to ""stand out"" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.*** Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**What these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**(cont. below: what to do instead)",1012,0.93,224,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mfteom/hiring_norms_have_changed_much_faster_than_entry/,2025-08-02 15:31:35,2025-08-05 01:56:24

On top of that, the May and June numbers were revised. 19,000 jobs were added in May and 14,000 jobs were added in June. Presumably next month or in September we will see revisions to the July numbers and they will be cut as well. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer increased to 1.83 million from 1.65 million in June. A lot of people have been making posts lately saying this sub is just doom-and-gloom and the market is better than what people here are saying, but the numbers speak for themselves.

1mf26ye,Unemployed for 3 years after graduation. Advice needed.,LoLNumberFour,cscareerquestions,"I'm based in the US. For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.During my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.Lately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.Here's my resume for the ones that care: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/88MUfWW)EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the suggestions.

1mhbvet,How to learn to build at scale when your job do not need solutions at scale?,nerdy_adventurer,cscareerquestions,"I'm asking similar questions like [this](https://www.jointaro.com/question/k9MR0UBCtVXvyZrOdPLw/how-do-i-get-better-at-building-large-scale-systems-without-working-directly-on-such-projects/) here from larger audience. I have been in software development for years at consulting companies where clients ask to develop certain systems for their needs which are mostly CRUD with complex business rules, rarely realtime. Most of those solutions do not need large scale system design, you may use containers, may be K8s if you are lucky. But mostly do not need hundreds of microservices, CQRS, event-driven stuff. Even if we have freedom of tech stack we are doing disservice to client and future developers if you did something complicated for resume driven development. While I can try and learn new design patterns, good coding practices, there is no room to build things at scale.But when you look at jobs posts, they ask for things like microservices, event-driven design, CQRS, Kafka etc. So my question to those who were in similar situation before, **how to gain experience building things at scale when your work do not need things at scale?** It seems I have been stagnant years without opportunity to involve in systems that need scale.",17,0.95,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mhbvet/how_to_learn_to_build_at_scale_when_your_job_do/,2025-08-04 12:19:32,2025-08-05 01:56:24

All the windows laptops are being switched from windows 10 to windows 11 and during this process, will have to get programs reinstalled.

1mbygci,Is getting a job with no internships having graduated from a mediocre/below average university a sheer numbers game?,throwaway10015982,cscareerquestions,"I recently applied to a role and had an onsite for a position that had only two vacancies. There were over 500 applicants, and I keep thinking about this, but if you extrapolate this to the entire field, doesn't this mean that it's basically close to impossible to actually get a job if you don't have an insane resume upon graduation, especially given that this sub frequently mentions that projects no longer really matter? I'm at the point where I keep thinking that there's honestly zero point in even trying to get a job in the field because of how unlikely it is. Like I see no reason that given 1000+ applicants to a role, with at least a handful of those being guys that have programmed an entire OS from scratch and went to a top ten school and likely already have experience, the odds of those guys not applying or there being such a small applicant pool that the guy who had a mediocre GPA along with no internships who has farted out a middling personal project to fill out an otherwise empty resume actually gets a role seems almost astronomically low.I doompost here a lot but in my head there genuinely seems to be no real path to employment in the industry (I'm not even talking SWE either, like literally any job that requires a bachelors in CS at all) if you're not exceptional or quite literally apply to every single open position in the country and just move wherever at a whim and hope you essentially win the lottery",14,0.8,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mbygci/is_getting_a_job_with_no_internships_having/,2025-07-29 01:26:48,2025-08-05 01:56:24

1mhmy7l,"Junior / Mid-level engineers feeling invisible or stuck, hope this helps!",SomeRandomCSGuy,cscareerquestions,"For all the engineers that are feeling invisible, stuck or plateaued, this is for you and hope it helps / guides you into the next steps. I am a senior software engineer who got to this position pretty fast, and got promoted over other engineers with 3-4x my YoE, so whatever I saw in this post contributed massively to my growth, making my impact visible, getting me recognized, and eventually promoted. As a junior engineer, I was always awed by these senior+ engineers who seemed to make such an impact by whatever they did. This led me to start observing and building relationships with some of these really senior engineers around me (staff/principal) and learn how they operated, built that authority around them, and got stuff done, and something clicked. I realized it wasn’t just about technical skill and crushing tickets. What moved the needle was learning to communicate clearly, understand what impacts the business, build trust, build alignment between stakeholders, and be proactive (taking initiatives) instead of just reactive (wait to get assigned work).There is usually a misconception, that to stand out, you just need to work on your technical skills. That is wrong. To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. These are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau.A lot of engineers think that these skills are only required for managers etc, but they are wrong - even ICs require them. For these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing wikis/docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Taking time to write these up can not only promote healthy structured offline discussions (google docs for eg) but also act as an information aggregator for knowledge sharing (instead of being scattered on slack for eg or lost in meetings) and for having an audit log of important decisions - so in the future anyone can refer back to why a decision was taken and one doesn’t have to scramble to remember it, etc. The documents that you write now also help you to present your ideas and propose changes in a better manner in live meetings, where you can present that doc during the meetings and walk everyone through it - you don't need to memorize anything since all the information is already there in front of you, in a clean structured manner.Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.I worked heavily on my speech. I was afraid to speak in meetings because I was introverted and had confidence issues because I had a bit of stuttering problem, I used to use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc. But I took time to work on it, and over time I started speaking more eloquently and fluently which made such a massive difference in my confidence, and whenever I had to propose something or even speak during meetings, it made a difference. Don’t get me wrong, technical skills are also important, but as you go up, your mastery of these other non-technical skills starts to matter more. They will make you more visible, your impact more visible, and eventually get you promoted. So I urge you to start working on them, you will be surprised just how much difference they make. If you are an introvert like me, if I can do it so can you. I used to think these soft skills are reserved for extroverts but I was extremely wrong, and these are most definitely learnable. Looking forward to hearing in the comments what has worked for other engineers out there as well!Happy to answer any questions in the comments and DMs! I am an open book and happy to help however I can!",14,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mhmy7l/junior_midlevel_engineers_feeling_invisible_or/,2025-08-04 19:20:18,2025-08-05 01:56:24

1mgp1ak,How does your team deal with changes in scope during sprints?,BedNo5127,cscareerquestions,"It's become an issue that I feel I need to address in some way because I notice a senior dev does this with me more than most. The story will be refined and discussed and then the sprint will start. After I'm near the finish line and the PR is put out, he will suddenly remember changes that we should add to the feature I'm working on. Then he pushes for me to make the change in the same sprint by hand waving away ""it should be quick"". I take issue with this because more often than not, when working on the changes he wants, they turn out to not be as straightforward as he thought and I have to work longer to complete the story. It wouldn't be such an issue if I found out earlier in the sprint, but with him, it's usually like 1-3 days before the sprint ends and this is a noticeable pattern with him. It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that. I try not to take it personal, but it's getting harder. It's like he purposefully tries to put me in tight spots to try and get out of it. And it's not like I'm trying to not work.

1mce6wv,How to handle hostile senior dev,ice-truck-drilla,cscareerquestions,"I started at a company on a dev team a few months ago. This is my first permanent job after completing my master’s degree.Initially, I was welcomed on and had a really great time getting to know people and contribute, and my performance review was “exceeds all expectations” from everyone on my team. My boss indicated that they were seeking to have me transition into a leadership role in the future given that I have a specific background.Fast-forward a couple of months later, and one of the senior devs on my team has become somewhat hostile to me. They started calling out any critiques of my work directly in our Teams channel (that contains some senior company leadership like VPs) and during meetings in a way that I kind of take offense to. EX) “u/ice-truck-drilla seems to have done this wrong.” instead of “u/ice-truck-drilla, this doesn’t look right to me. Can you double check this?”First, I think this should be a direct message, not a company wide blast. Second, when this has happened, so far, the work being critiqued has always been correct. Of course I make mistakes, but these were not. These company-wide callouts have only happened a few times over the past few weeks, and luckily, the technical lead had my back and stated that my work was correct in front of everyone. One time, one of the VPs who was previously a dev mentioned that the work output I presented looked very accurate.I’m not sure what changed but this hostile dev used to be really pleasant to work with. I try hard and work long hours, and it feels like they’re trying to birth a negative reputation for me. Some added context is that this dev recently found out that I am not white (I’m white-passing) and my parents are immigrants. I’m not sure if this is the root cause, but it is something I’ve considered. I do not want to make any waves, and I have been thinking that the job market is way too harsh rn for me to even think about defending myself or bringing this up with anyone.

However, we’re wondering if Is there any point of my brother applying to Ivy League universities? How about top CS state schools like UIUC?If he end up getting into universities like Brown, Penn, or Columbia, would it simply be better for him to attend Waterloo?

1mesyno,"3 Startups, 0 Stability – Is It Time to Move On from Tech?",iEmerald,cscareerquestions,"When I was a teenager, I developed an interest in programming. I spent countless hours following tutorials and building small projects. Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.But I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.After graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.After two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.When the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.I was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.Then, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.Now I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding. I can’t seem to find any local developer roles or remote contracts anymore. I’ve started to question whether I’m even cut out for a career in software development.Should I keep looking for a job? Pursue a master’s degree? Switch to a different field entirely? What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Back then, I used to really love my work - building models from scratch using PyTorch, experimenting with different architectures, scikit-learn, setting up evaluation pipelines, explainability and some math. It was hard, but I loved it. I enjoyed debugging errors with the help of Google search, asking and answering questions on StackOverflow. For the last 2 years, all I have been doing is using the OpenAI API, building agents using open-source frameworks, and prompt engineering. I don't remember the last time I opened StackOverflow or tried debugging using Google. I have not written a single SQL query by myself in the last 2 years. Everything feels very simple: just call an API and get it done. I am losing my motivation for my job.

I'd appreciate if some senior engineers could give their insight into working on an infra team in terms of career growth (junior -> senior).A lot of people on my team are pretty experienced with only a couple junior engineers which is pretty common for infra teams. I've read that infra teams tend to give more scope than product teams for senior engineers who are looking to be promoted to staff. However, how is career progression from junior to senior? Will it be slow due to there being many tenured folks? Talking to some of the folks, they said that the team is harder than other teams to onboard onto because of the technical complexity. I feel like working on an infra team as a new grad is a rare opportunity but I am also hesitant on career progression even though a new grad on the team did make it to senior in 5 years.Any input would be appreciated :)Edit: I work on cloud infrastructure.

1md73xr,feeling like an imposter despite actively contributing to their team,caramel_macchiato27,cscareerquestions,"I’m a senior software engineer with 4.5 years of experience (recently promoted) and have contributed a lot in my team. I constantly doubt my own understanding and technical skills, which has led to a sense of imposter syndrome. Even with several years of experience, I find myself questioning whether I truly grasp certain topics or if I’m just missing something everyone else understands. I am truly worried if somebody will ask me something during the meetings because of this. I often feel that when I discuss technical topics, the person I’m talking to tends to speak vaguely or there’s some misunderstanding at first. I also wonder if part of the issue is that my thoughts don’t always come across exactly as I intend in English, or maybe I have difficulty understanding vague explanations. Is this something others experience? How do you handle or improve communication in technical discussions to avoid misunderstandings?I also notice that other senior engineers seem skilled, they can answer almost any question on the spot whereas I’m not that type of person. When I’m asked something technical, I usually need some quiet time to fully understand the question, then I look through the relevant files and documentation before I can come up with a good answer.
