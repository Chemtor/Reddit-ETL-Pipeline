He’s in his mid-career as a data engineer, and he acts like he knows everything already. The problem is, he’s incredibly lazy when it comes to actually doing the work.He avoids writing code whenever he can, only picks the easy or low-effort tasks, and leaves the more complex or critical problems for others to handle. When it comes to operational stuff — like closing tickets, doing optimization work, or cleaning up pipelines — he either delays it forever or does it half-heartedly.What’s frustrating is that he talks like he’s the most experienced guy on the team, but his output and initiative don’t reflect that at all. The rest of us end up picking up the slack, and it’s starting to affect team morale and delivery.Has anyone else dealt with a “know-it-all but lazy” type like this?

1ogirla,Rant: Managing expectations,Agreeable_Bake_783,dataengineering,"Hey,I have to rant a bit, since i've seen way too much posts in this reddit who are all like ""What certifications should i do?"" or ""what tools should i learn?"" or something about personal big data projects. What annoys me are not the posts themselves, but the culture and the companies making believe that all this is necessary. So i feel like people need to manage their expectations. In themselves and in the companies they work for. The following are OPINIONS of mine that help me to check in with myself.1. You are not the company and the company is not you. If they want you to use a new tool, they need to provide PAID time for you to learn the tool.2. Don't do personal projects (unless you REALLY enjoy it). It just takes time you could have spend doing literally anything else. Personal projects will not prepare you for the real thing because the data isn't as messy, the business is not as annoying and you want have to deal with coworkers breaking production pipelines. 3. Nobody cares about certifications. If I have to do a certification, I want to be paid for it and not pay for it.4. Life over work. Always.5. Don't beat yourself up, if you don't know something. It's fine. Try it out and fail. Try again. (During work hours of course)Don't get me wrong, i read stuff in my offtime as well and i am in this reddit. But i only as long I enjoy it.

1oieor6,Are DE jobs moving?,Numerous-Fix-4360,dataengineering,"Hi, I'm a senior analytics engineer - currently in Canada (but a US/Canada dual citizen, so looking at North America in general).I'm noticing more and more that in both my company, and many of my peers' companies, data roles that were once located in the US are being moved to low-cost (of employment) regions. These are roles that were once US-based, and are now being reallocated to low cost regions.My company's CEO has even quietly set a target of having a minimum of 35% of the jobs in each department located in a low-cost region of the world, and is aggressively pushing to move more and more positions to low cost regions through layoffs, restructuring, and natural turnover/attrition. I've heard from several peers that their companies seem to be quietly reallocating many of their positions, as well, and it's leaving me uncertain about the future of this industry in a high-cost region like North America.The macro-economic research does still seem to suggest that technical data roles (like a DE or analytics engineer) are still stable and projected to stay in-demand in North America, but ""from the ground"" I'm only seeing reallocations to low-cost regions en mass.Curious if anybody else is noticing this at their company, in their networks, on their feeds, etc.?I'm considering the long term feasibility of staying in this profession as executives, boards, and PE owners just get greedier and greedier, so just wanting to see what others are observing in the market.Edit: removed my quick off the cuff list of low cost countries because debating the definition and criteria for “low cost” wasn’t really the point lol",63,0.88,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oieor6/are_de_jobs_moving/,2025-10-28 16:50:57,2025-11-01 01:42:46

Each one works fine in isolation, but they don’t talk to each other. When running into some problems with duplicated data, permission issues and just basic trouble in finding out what data is where.The result: duplicated metadata, broken permissions, and no single view of what exists.I started looking into how other companies solve this, and found two broad paths:|**Approach**|**Description**|**Pros**|**Cons**||:-|:-|:-|:-||**Centralized (vendor ecosystem)**|Use one vendor’s unified catalog (like Unity Catalog) and migrate everything there.|Simpler governance, strong UI/UX, less initial setup.|High vendor lock-in, poor cross-engine compatibility (e.g. Trino, Flink, Kafka).||**Federated (open metadata layer)**|Connect existing catalogs under a single metadata service (e.g. [Apache Gravitino](https://gravitino.apache.org)).|Works across ecosystems, flexible connectors, community-driven.|Still maturing, needs engineering effort for integration.|Right now we’re leaning toward the federated path , but not replacing existing catalogs, just connecting them together.  feels more sustainable in the long-term, especially as we add more engines and registries.I’m curious how others are handling the metadata sprawl.

1oj1itv,How to convince a switch from SSIS to python Airflow?,GehDichWaschen,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,TLDR: The team prefers SSIS over Airflow, I want to convince them to accept the switch as a long term goal.I am a Senior Data Engineer and I started at an SME earlier this year.Previously I used a lot of Cloud Services, like AWS BatchJob for the ETL of an Kubernetes application, EC2 with airflow in docker-compose, developed API endpoints for a frontend Application using sqlalchemy at a big company, worked TDD in Scrum etc.Here, I found the current setup of the ETL pipeline to be a massive library of SSIS Packages basically getting data from an on prem ERP to a Reporting Model.There are no tests, there are many small-small hacky ways inside SSIS to get what you want out of the data. The is no style guide or Review Process. In general it's lacking the usual oversight you would have in a \*\*searchable\*\* code project as well as the capability to run tests on the system and databases. git is not really used at all. Documentation is hardly maintainedEverything is being worked on in the Visual Studio UI, which is buggy at best and simply crashing at worst (around twice per day).I work in a 2-person team and our Job it is to manage the SSIS ETL, Tabular Model and all PowerBI Reports throughout the company. The two of us are the entire reporting team.I replaced a long-time employee that has been in the company for around 15 years and didn't know any code and left minimal documentation. Generally my colleague (data scientist) does documentation only in his personal notebook which he shares sporadically on request.Since my start I introduced JIRA for our processes with a clear task board (it was a mess before) and bi-weekly sprints. Also a Wiki which I filled with hundreds of pages by now. I am currently introducing another tool, so at least we don't have to use buggy VS to manage the tabular model and can use git there as well.I am transforming all our PBI reports into .pbip files, so we can work with git there, too (We have like 100 reports).Also, I built an entire prod Airflow Environment on an on-prem Windows server to be able to query APIs (not possible in SSIS) and run some basic statistical analysis (""AI-capabilities""). The Airflow repo is fully tested, has Exception Handling, feature and hotfix branches, dev, prod etc. and can be used locally as well as on remote.But I am the only one currently maintaining it. My colleague does not want to change to Airflow, because ""the other one is working"". Fact is, I am losing a lot of time managing SSIS in VS while getting a lower quality system.Plus, if we ever want to hire an additional colleague, he will probably face the same issues as I do (no docs, massive monolith, no search function, etc.) and will probably not get a good hire.My boss is non-technical, so he is not of much help. We are also not in IT, so every time the SQL Server bugs, we need to run to the IT department to fix our ETL Job, which can take days.So, how can I convince my colleague to eventually switch to Airflow?It doesn't need to be today, but I want this to be a committed long term goal.Writing this, I feel I have committed so much to this company already and would really like to give them a chance (preference of industry and location)Thank you all for reading, maybe you have some insight how to handle this. I would rather not quit on this, but might be my only option.",41,0.88,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oj1itv/how_to_convince_a_switch_from_ssis_to_python/,2025-10-29 11:04:22,2025-11-01 01:42:46
1ohga81,Migrating to DBT,Glittering_Beat_1121,dataengineering,"Hi!As part of a client I’m working with, I was planning to migrate quite an old data platform to what many would consider a modern data stack (dagster/airlfow + DBT + data lakehouse). Their current data estate is quite outdated (e.g. single step function manually triggered, 40+ state machines running lambda scripts to manipulate data. Also they’re on Redshit and connect to Qlik for BI. I don’t think they’re willing to change those two), and as I just recently joined, they’re asking me to modernise it. The modern data stack mentioned above is what I believe would work best and also what I’m most comfortable with. Now the question is, as DBT has been acquired by Fivetran a few weeks ago, how would you tackle the migration to a completely new modern data stack? Would DBT still be your choice even if not as “open” as it was before and the uncertainty around maintenance of dbt-core? Or would you go with something else? I’m not aware of any other tool like DBT that does such a good job in transformation.Am I unnecessarily worrying and should I still go with proposing DBT?

1og2l5l,Rant: Excited to be a part of a project that turned out to be a nightmare,ibrx8,dataengineering,"I have 6+ years of experience in data analytics and have worked on multiple projects mostly related to data quality and process automation. I always wanted to work in a data engineering project and recently i got an opportunity to work on a project which seem to be exciting with GenAI & Python stuff. My role here is to develop python scripts to integrate multiple sources and LLM outputs and package everything into a solution. I designed a config driven ETL code using python and wrote multiple classes to package everything into a single codebase. I used LLM chats to optimise my code. Due to very tight deadlines I had to rush the development without realising the whole thing would turn into a nightmare. I have tried my best to follow the coding standards but the client is very upset about few parts of the design. A couple of days ago, I had a code review meeting with my client team where I had to walk through my code and answer questions inorder to get the approval for QA. The client team had an architect level manager who had already gone through the repository and had a lot of valid questions about the design flaws in the code. I felt very embarrassed during the meeting and it was a very awkward conversation. Everytime he had pointed out something wrong, I had no answers to it and there was silence for about half a minute before I say "" Ok I can implement that"". I know it is my fault that I didn't have enough knowledge about designing data systems but I'm worried more about tarnishing my companies' reputation by providing a low quality deliverable.

Each split maximizes:Gain = GradientGain + λ·InformationGainwhere λ adapts based on class imbalance. This explicitly optimizes for information gain on the minority class instead of just minimizing loss.Combined with:\- Quantile-based binning (robust to scale shifts)\- Conservative regularization (prevents overfitting to majority)\- PR-AUC early stopping (focuses on minority performance)The architecture is inherently more robust to drift without needing online adaptation. Trade-offsThe good:\- Auto-tunes for your data (no hyperparameter search needed)\- Works out-of-the-box on extreme imbalance\- Comparable inference speed to XGBoostThe honest:\- \~2-4x slower training (45s vs 12s on 170K samples)\- Slightly behind on balanced data (use XGBoost there)\- Built in Rust, so less Python ecosystem integration Why I'm SharingThis started as a learning project (built from scratch in Rust), but the drift resilience results surprised me. I haven't seen many papers addressing this - most focus on online learning or explicit drift detection.Looking for feedback on:\- Have others seen similar robustness from conservative regularization?\- Are there existing techniques that achieve this without retraining?\- Would this be useful for production systems, or is 2-4x slower training a dealbreaker?

Optimizer + statistics*** Which statistics materially influence join reordering and predicate pushdown for TPC-H-like SQL (and how to scope them: which tables/columns, histograms, sampling granularity)* Any caveats where cost-based changes often harm (Q04/Q14 patterns), and how to constrain the optimizer to avoid those plans**3. Query-level idioms*** Preferred ClickHouse-native patterns for EXISTS/NOT EXISTS (especially Q21) that avoid full scans/aggregations while keeping memory under control* When to prefer IN/SEMI/ANTI joins vs INNER/LEFT; reliable anti-join idioms that plan well in 25.9* Safe uses of PREWHERE, `optimize_move_to_prewhere`, and read-in-order for these queries**4.

1oglc5s,DE Gatekeeping and Training,lilde1297,dataengineering,"Background: the enterprise DE in my org manages the big data environment. He uses nifi for orchestration and snowflake for the data warehouse. As far as how his environment is actually put together and communicating all I know is that he uses zookeeper for his nifi cluster and it’s on the cloud (Azure). There is no one who knows anything more than that. No one in IT. Not his boss. Not his one employee. No one knows and his reason is that he doesn’t trust anyone and they aren’t good enough, not even his employee.The discussion. Have you dealt with such a person? How has your org dealt with people gatekeeping like this? From my perspective this is a massive problem and basically means that this guy is a massive walking pile of technical debt. If he leaves then the clean up and troubleshooting to figure out what he did would be immense. On top of that he now has suggested taking over smaller DE processes from other outside IT as a play to “centralize” data engineering work. He won’t let them migrate their stuff to his environment as again he doesn’t rust them to be good enough and doesn’t want to teach them how to use his environment.

Then, the user could ask natural language questions about the CRM data using the Claude AI desktop app or a similar tool, via a connection to the DuckDB MCP server. These REST APIs require the user to be connected (using a session cookie or, in some cases, an API token) to the service and make potentially 1,000 to 100,000 API calls to retrieve all the necessary details. To keep the data current, an automated scheduler is necessary. * I've built a Go program that performs the complete ETL and tested it, packaging it as a macOS application; however, maintaining database changes manually is complicated. I've reviewed various Go ORM packages that could add significant complexity to this project. * I've built a Python DLT library-based ETL script that does a better job normalizing the JSON objects into database tables, but I haven't found a way to package it yet into a standalone macOS app. * I've built several Chrome extensions that can extract data and save it as CSV or JSON files, but I haven't figured out how to write DuckDB files directly from Chrome. Ideally, the standalone app would be just a ""drag to Applications folder, click to open, and leave running,"" but there are so many onboarding steps to ensure correct configuration, MCP server setup, Claude MCP config setup, etc., that non-technical users will get confused after step #5.

1oif45q,Migrating from Spreadsheets to PostgreSQL,oihv,dataengineering,"Hello everyone, I'm doing a part time as a customer service for an online class. I basically manage the students, their related informations, sessions bought, etc. Also relates it to the class that they are enrolled in. At the moment, all this information is stored in a monolithic sheets (well I did divide atleast the student data and the class, connect them by id).But, I'm a CS student, and I just studied dbms last semester, this whole premise sounds like a perfect case to implement what I learn and design a relational database!So, I'm here to crosscheck my plan. I plan this with gpt.. btw, because I can't afford to spend too much time working on this side project, and I'm not going to be paid for this extra work either, but then I believe this will help me a ton at my work, and I will also learn a bunch after designing the schema and seeing in real time how the database grows.So the plan is use a local instance of postgreSQL with a frontend like NocoDB for spreadsheets like interface. So then I have the fallback of using NocoDB to edit my data, or when I can, and I will try to, always use SQL, or atleast make my own interface to manage the data.Here's some considerations why I should move to this approach:1. The monolithic sheets, one spreadsheets have too much column (phone number, name, classes bought, class id, classes left, last class date, note, complains, (sales related data like age, gender, city, learning objective). And just yesterday, I had a call with my manager, and she says that I should also includes payment information, and 2 types of complains, and I was staring at the long list of the data in the spreadsheets..2. I have a pain point of syncing two different sheets. So my company uses other service of spreadsheets (not google) and there is coworker that can't access this site from their country. So, I, again, need to update both of this spreadsheet, and the issue is my company have trust issue with google, so I would also need to filter some data before putting it into the google spreadsheet, from the company one. Too much hassle.What I hope to achievr from migrating to sql, is that I can just sync them both to my local instance of SQL instead of from one to the other.cons of this approach (that i know of):This infrastructure will then depends on me, and I think I would need a no-code solution in the future if there will be other coworker in my position. Other approach being considered: Just refactore the sheets that mimics relational db (students, classes, enrolls_in, teaches_in, payment, complains)But then having to filter and sync across the other sheets will still be an issue.I've read a post somewhere about a teacher that tried to do this kind of thing, basically a student management system. And then it just became a burden for him, needing him to maintain an ecosystem without being paid for it.But from what I see, this approach seems need little maintenance and effort to keep up, so only the initial setup will be hard. But feel free to prove me wrong!That's about it, I hope you all can give me insights whether or not this journey I'm about to take will be fruitful.

As a result, I find myself in a generic “data engineer” category, and my package is assessed accordingly, even though data engineering is only a part of my job and my profile is much broader than that.Before, when I was at my small company, my package evolved comfortably each year as I expanded my skills and we relied less and less on external subcontractors to manage the data aspects that I did not master well. Now, even though I continue to improve my skills and expertise, I find myself stuck with a fixed package because my new company is unaware of the breadth of my expertise...Specifically, on my local industrial site, I do the following:* Manage all the data ingestion pipeline (cleaning, transformation, uploading to the database, management of feedback loops, automatic alerts, etc.)* Manage a very large Postgresql database (maintenance, backup, upgrades, performance optimization, etc.) with multiple schema and broad variaty of data embedded* Create new database structures (new schemas, tables, functions, etc.)* Build custom data exploitation platforms and implement various business visualisations* Use data for modelling/prediction with machine learning techniques* Manage our cloud services (access, upgrades, costs, etc.) and the cloud architectures required for data pipelines, database, BI,… (on AWS: EC2, lambda, SQS, RDS, dynamoDB, Sagemaker, Quicksight,…)I added these functions over the years. I was originally hired to do just ""data analysis"" and industrial statistics (I'm basically a statistician and I have 25 years of experience in the industry), but I'm quite good at teaching myself new things. For example, I am able to read documentation and several books on a subject, practice, correct my errors and then apply this new knowledge in my work. I have always progressed like this: ir is my main professional strength and what my small company valued most.I do not claim to be as skilled an expert as a specialist in these various fields, but I am sufficiently proficient to have been able to handle everything fully autonomously for several years. **What job profile do you think would cover all these skills?** **=>** *I would like to propose a job profile that would allow my new large company to benchmark my profile* and realize that my package can still evolve and that I am saving them a lot of money (external consultants or new hires, I also do a lot of custom development, which saves us from having to purchase professional software solutions).Personally, I don't want to change companies because I know it will be difficult to find another position that is as broad and intellectually so interesting, especially since I don't claim to know EVERY aspect of these different professions (for example, I now know AWS very well because I work on this platform on a day to day basis, but I know very little about Azure or Google Cloud; I know machine learning fairly well, but I know very little about deep learning, which I have hardly ever practised, etc.). But it's really frustrating to feel like you're working really hard, tackling successfully technical challenges where our external consultants have proven to be less effective, spending hundreds of hours (often on my own time) to strengthen my skills without any recognition and package increase perspective...Thanks for your help!",4,0.67,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oj5rw1/what_job_profile_do_you_think_would_cover_all/,2025-10-29 14:18:18,2025-11-01 01:42:46

I've filtered their fact tables down to show only active jobs on our floor, and most of our reporting centers around that data. I built a Go ETL program that pulls data from Oracle and pushes it to Postgres every hour (currently moving about 1k rows per pull). My next step was to use dbt to build out proper dimensions and new fact tables.**Why the Migration?**The company moved their on-premise Oracle database to Azure, which has tanked our Power BI and Excel report performance. On top of that, the database account they gave us for reporting doesn't have access to materialized views, can't create indexes, or schedule anything. We're basically locked into querying views-on-top-of-views with no optimization options.**Where I'm Stuck**I've hit a few walls that are keeping me from moving forward:1. **Development environment**: The dbt plugin is deprecated in IntelliJ, and the VS Code version is pretty rough. SqlMesh doesn't really solve this either. What tools do you all use for writing this kind of code?2. **Historical tracking**: The ERP uses object versions and business keys built by concatenating two fields with a `^` separator. This makes incremental syncing really difficult. I'm not sure how to handle this cleanly.3. **Dimension table design**: Since I'm filtering to only active jobs to keep row volume down, my dimension tables grow and shrink. That means I have to truncate them on each run instead of maintaining a proper slowly changing dimension. I know it's not ideal, but I'm not sure what the better approach would be here.Your advice would be appreicated.

So for example, I have for job A 100 batch files, each containing x datasets, are ordered which means the first batch has the first datapoints and the last contains the last - the order has important factor. Each batch contains y rows of data in every dataset where each dataset can have a different shape. The last file in the batch might contain less than y rows. Another job, job B can have less or more batch files, will still have x datasets but the split of rows per batch (the amount of data per batch) might be different than y. I've tried a combo of kerchunk, zarr, and dask but keep on having issues with the different shapes, I've lost data between batches - only the first batch data is found or many shapes issues.What solution do you recommend for efficiently doing data analysis?

1ojz8gn,How to develop Fabric notebooks interactively in local repo (Azure DevOPs + VS Code)?,muskagap2,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, I have a question regarding integration of Azure DevOps and VS Code for data engineering in Fabric.Say, I created notebook in the Fabric workspace and then synced to git (Azure DevOps). In Azure DevOps I go to Clone -> Open VS Code to develop notebook locally in VS Code. Now, all notebooks in Fabric and repo are stored as .py files. Normally, developers often prefer working interactively in `.ipynb` (Jupyter/VS Code), not in .py.And now I don't really know how to handle this scenario. In VS Code in Explorer pane I see all the Fabric items, including notebooks. I would like to develop this notebook which i see in the repo. However, I don't know I how to convert .py to .ipynb to locally develop my notebook. And after that how to convert .ipynb back to .py to push it to repo. I don't want to keep .ipynb and .py in remote repo. I just need the update, final .py version in repo. I can't right-click on .py file in repo and switch to .ipynb somehow. I can't do anyhting.So the **best-practice workflow** for me (and I guess for other data engineers) is:Work interactively in `.ipynb` → convert/sync to `.py` → commit `.py` to Git.I read that some use jupytext library:`jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:light notebooks/my_notebook.py`but don't know if it's the common practice.

1ojcrji,Need advice on choosing a new title for my role,dRuEFFECT,dataengineering,"Principal Data Architect - this is the title my director and I originally threw out there, but I'd like some opinions from any of you. I've heard architect is a dying title and don't want to back myself into a corner for future opportunities. We also floated Principal BI Engineer or Principal Data Engineer, but I hardly feel that implementing Stitch and Fivetran for ELT justifies a data engineer title and don't feel my background would line up with that for future opportunities. It may be a moot point if I ever try going for a Director of Analytics role in the future, but not sure if that will ever happen as I've never had direct reports and don't like office politics. I do enjoy being an individual contributor, data governance, and working directly with stakeholders to solve their unique needs on data and reporting. Just trying to better understand what I should call myself, what I should focus on, and where I should try to go to next.Background and context below.I have 14 years experience behind me, with previous roles as Reporting Analyst, Senior Pricing Analyst, Business Analytics Manager, and currently Senior Data Analytics Manager. With leadership and personnel changes in my current company and team, after 3 years of being here my responsibilities have shifted and leadership is open to changing my title, but I'm not sure what direction I should take it.Back in college I set out to be a Mechanical Engineer; I loved physics, but was failing Calc 2 and panicked and regrettably changed my major to their Business program. When I started my career, I took to Excel and VBA macros naturally because my physics brain just likes to build things. Then someone taught me the first 3 lines of SQL and everything took off from there.In my former role as Business Analytics Manager I was an analytics team of 1 for 4 years where I rebuilt everything from the ground. Implemented Stitch for ELT, built standardized data models with materialized views in Redshift, and built dashboards in Periscope (R.I.P.).I got burnt out as a team of 1 and moved to my current company so I can be a part of a larger team, at first I was hired into the Marketing Department just focusing on standardizing data models and reporting under Marketing, but soon after started supporting Finance and Merchandising as well. We had a Senior Data Architect I worked closely with, as well as a Data Scientist; both of these individuals left and were never backfilled so I'm back to where I started managing all of it, although we've dropped all projects the data scientist was running. I now fall under IT instead of Marketing, and I report to a Director of Analytics who reports to the CTO. We also have 3 offshore analyst resources for dashboard building and ad hoc requests, but they primarily focus on website analytics with GA4.I'm currently in the process of onboarding Fivetran for the bulk of our data going into BigQuery, and we just signed on with Tableau to consolidate dashboards and various spreadsheets. I will be rebuilding views to utilize the new data pipelines and rebuilding existing dashboards, much like my last company.What I love most about my work is writing SQL, building complex but clean views to normalize/standardize data to make it intuitive for downstream reporting and dashboard building. I loved building dashboards in Periscope because it was 100% SQL driven, most other BI tools I've found limiting by comparison. I know some python, but working in that environment doesn't come naturally to me and I'm way more comfortable writing everything directly in SQL, building dynamic dashboards, and piping my data into spreadsheets in a format the stakeholders like.I've never truly considered myself an 'analyst' as I don't feel comfortable providing analysis and recommendations, my brain thinks of a thousand different variables as to why that assumption could be misleading. Instead, I like working with the people asking the questions and understanding the nuances of the data being asked about in order to write targeted queries, and let those subject matter experts derive their own conclusions. And while I've always been intrigued by the deeper complexities of data engineering functions and capabilities, there are an endless number of tools and platforms out there that I haven't been exposed to and know little about so I'd feel like a fraud trying to call myself an engineer. At the end of the day I work in data with a mechanical engineering brain rather than a traditional software engineering type, and still struggle to understand what path I should be taking in the future.",1,0.57,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ojcrji/need_advice_on_choosing_a_new_title_for_my_role/,2025-10-29 18:39:31,2025-11-01 01:42:46

For example they collect name, age of the person served for one grant but they only get initials for the second grant. The company does not have a database and only uses office 365 environment.

1oj5ilf,The reality is different – From JSON/XML to relational DB automatically,Exact_Cherry_9137,dataengineering,"I would like to share a story about my current experience and the difficulties I am encountering—or rather, about how my expectations are different from reality.﻿I am a data engineer who has been working in the field of data processing for 25 years now. I believe I have a certain familiarity with these topics, and I have noticed the lack of some tools that would have saved me a lot of time.﻿And that’s how I created a tool (but that’s not the point) that essentially, by taking JSON or XML as input, automatically transforms them into a relational database. It also adapts automatically to changes, always preserving backward compatibility with previously loaded data.﻿At the moment, the tool works with databases like PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Oracle. In the future, I hope to support more (but actually, it could work for all databases, considering that one of these three could be used as a data source after running the tool).﻿Let me get to the point: in my mind, I thought this tool could be a breakthrough, and a similar product (which I won’t mention here to avoid giving it promotion) actually received an award from Snowflake in 2025 because it was considered very innovative. Basically, that tool does much of what mine does, but mine still has some better features.﻿Nowadays, JSON data is everywhere, and that has been the “fuel” that kept me going while developing it.A bit against the trend, my tool does not use AI—maybe this is penalizing it, but I want to be genuine and not hide behind this topic just to get more attention. It is also very respectful of privacy, making it suitable for those dealing with personal or sensitive data (basically, part of the process runs on the customer’s premises, and the result can be sent out to get the final product ready to be executed on their own database).﻿The ultimate idea is to create a SaaS so that anyone who needs it can access the tool. At the moment, however, I don't have the financial resources to cover the costs of productization, legal fees, patents, and all the necessary expenses. That’s why I thought about offering myself as a consultant providing the transformation service, so that once I receive the input data, clients can start viewing their information in a relational database formatThe difficulties I am facing are surprising me. There are people who consider themselves experts and say that this tool doesn't make sense, preferring to write code themselves to extract the necessary information by reading the data directly from JSON—using, in my opinion, syntaxes that are not easy even for those who know only SQL.﻿I am now wondering if there truly are people out there with expert knowledge of these topics (which are definitely niche), because I believe that not having to write a single line of code, being able to get a relational database ready for querying with simple queries, tables that are automatically linked in the same way (parent/child fields), and being able to create reports and dashboards in just a few minutes, is truly an added value that today can be found in only a few tools.﻿I’ll conclude by saying that the estimated minimum ROI, in terms of time—and therefore money—saved for a developer is at least 10x.I am so confident in my solution that I would also love to hear the opinion of those who face this type of situation daily.Thank you to everyone who has read this post and is willing to share their thoughts.",0,0.5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oj5ilf/the_reality_is_different_from_jsonxml_to/,2025-10-29 14:08:13,2025-11-01 01:42:46

I’m especially curious how folks are keeping agents/claude/cursor files up to date, what length is appropriate for such files, and what practices have helped with Dbt and Airflow models. If anyone has stories of what doesn’t work, that would be super helpful too.Context: I am working with my org on AI best practices. I’m currently focused on using 4 channels of context (eg https://open.substack.com/pub/evanvolgas/p/building-your-four-channel-context) and building a shared context library (eg https://open.substack.com/pub/evanvolgas/p/building-your-context-library). I have thoughts on how to maintain the library and some observations about the length of context files (despite internet “best practices” of never more than 150-250 lines, I’m finding some 500 line files to be worthwhile).

1oghzxt,I'm currently learning with AI and I feel like I'm a fraud.,JoeyJoeJoeJrShab,learnprogramming,"I keep seeing posts that contain a sentence similar to this. Let me give some generic advice: try doing it without AI.In the olden times, it was not uncommon for learners to have a project that did not work, and they could not figure out why. Now, thanks to AI, learners have a project that does work, and they can't figure out why.AI is not always bad or evil, but likewise, it definitely isn't always helpful. Learning requires reading, trying, making mistakes, getting confused, reading more, trying more, and repeating. Start small -- there's a reason ""hello world"" is a common first task -- the actual coding is ridiculously simple, but it proves that your have done all of the necessary work to get your environment properly running. Once you've got that working, you can move on to something more complicated.I've seen a lot of people who, with the help of AI, start with a much bigger project. AI helps them get that bigger project running, but they don't fully understand what was done to reach that point, which means they're not able to successfully make changes or fixes to that project.There's nothing wrong with googling. There's nothing wrong with asking AI a question. But your best bet is to spend some time thinking and trying on your own before using either tool. My advice to anyone learning with AI: don't let AI read or write your code. If you're going to ask AI questions, do so in English. Use AI to help you find the terminology that you don't yet know, and once you've learned the right words, spend some time reading about what they mean.",248,0.86,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oghzxt/im_currently_learning_with_ai_and_i_feel_like_im/,2025-10-26 11:12:23,2025-11-01 01:42:47

1ohla28,"How do you ""turn on"" HTTPS in an application? Basic Theory",Few-Pressure-7331,learnprogramming,"This is what I understand. I kind of need some basic explanation to know where to look for things when I want to get deeper into this. TCP and UDP are part of the **transport layer** in the tcp/ip stack and all layers up to that one are implemented by the **os kernel**. So my application won't have to implement it, it would use **system calls**.For a web application a **client** and my **server** will communicate. The client will open a **tcp connection** with the correct **socket** ( ip : port 80 or 443 ) of my server. The client is e.g. the browser.So now we have client and server with an open **tcp connection**. **HTTP** is a protocol in the **application layer** in the tcp/ip stack so it has to be implemented by an application. In a nutshell, http is basically just a standard for how the string of text sent over the tcp connection is structured to be valid.The **webserver** thats being communicated with is an application, so it implements the HTTP protocol. It can either serve static files or call programs or scripts and give the **request data** as a parameter. The application can then produce an answer. No matter if static or dynamic content is served, pretty much the webserver responds to the request it receivedSo that's my basic understanding at I think its correct. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here already.TLS is also an application layer protocol, so it has to be implemented by an application. I heard of libraries like OpenSSL implementing them.But where do I **turn on HTTPS** now? Since the server has to be able to serve static content or forward requests to an application or a script, I'd guess in the server? But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.",93,0.92,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ohla28/how_do_you_turn_on_https_in_an_application_basic/,2025-10-27 17:48:46,2025-11-01 01:42:47

1ok6ywa,My experience switching to a split keyboard while learning to code,COOLGAMER88_YT,learnprogramming,"So I finally caved and tried a split keyboard (NocFree lite, wireless version). Been two weeks and my wrists already feel a lot less strained during long coding sessions. My posture is getting better and the compact 60% design also frees up desk space which is nice when I am juggling multiple devices. The layout took a few days to click especially the right side and some Fn combos but now it feels pretty natural. Typing is quiet, smooth and the little thumb keys are actually useful (again took some getting used to). Wireless mostly works but if I type really fast, sometimes it stumbles and makes me backspace a few times. I also miss a proper battery indicator but I guess its not that bad a thing. Beyond comfort, the customization options are a real productivity boost. I’ve been using Vial to set up extra layers and remap keys. I can even remap keys to control the mouse which is quite handy for my workflow (like scrolling or navigating code without leaving the keyboard). Hot-swappable switches mean I can tweak the typing feel over time without having to replace the whole board so I like the long-term use I’ll get out of it. Overall it has been a small change that’s actually improved my learning speed. Sharing it here for anyone curious about split boards. Those who already use one, how long did it take you to get used to the layout?",25,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ok6ywa/my_experience_switching_to_a_split_keyboard_while/,2025-10-30 18:04:03,2025-11-01 01:42:47

1ojc4as,Is there any benefits to limiting the recourses you learn from?,Defiant-Ad588,learnprogramming,"So I asked myself this question when I first watched a podcast with John Carmack. He was explaining how he learned programming from the very small selection of books his library offered, but mostly from NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS. On top of that he was programming games in assembly!When it comes to problem sets, I find that I learn best without the help of ai. But I ask this question in regards to googling as well because this is something I'm very indecisive about. I'll give an example, the other day I was working on a CS50 problem set and I ended up spending too much time trying to make over complicated for loops to compare each char in an array of strings. Then, when I finally googled it, I found out there was a function in a library that did it for me. Maybe this isn't the best anecdote because I could've read the documentation on the library before hand, but I hope you get my point. I also think ai is so much more looked down upon than googling, but I think both can reinforce the same bad habits, I.e when things get difficult you end up relying on something else. I understand that it wasn't the limited resources that made John Carmack into John Carmack. However, I personally think a scarcity in resources indirectly makes you remember things better. ""Why would I need to remember the syntax differences in declaring a function in JS vs Python if the answers are a couple clicks away."" I'm genuinely curious to hear what your opinions are on this. What would be ways to balance this?

1oflqd0,Difficulty focusing on one language.,DesperateOriginal827,learnprogramming,"Over the last few years, I’ve been teaching myself programming. I’m currently 32 and I wouldn’t say I’m “good” at any specific language. During these past few years, I’ve always jumped between multiple languages (C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc). I have basic knowledge in the languages listed, but I wouldn’t say enough to build something worth while.I do try and stick to one language, but then I’d usually get bored, see a new shiny thing, and jump towards that. Then most of the time, I’ll do a complete 360 and return to the language I initially started with. I’ve been doing this for years and always struggled just to stick to 1 language. And it feels like I’ve shot myself in the foot by not specialising in a single language to become efficient in it. I think the reason why I struggle focusing on a single language, is (in my honest opinion) ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with it, but a few friends who have it, have said it’s a common thing to hyper focus on something, then jump to something else (they work in tech themselves). And the other reason, is that I do find all languages interesting and want to learn as much as possible (which I know isn’t ideal when starting out).I do believe that my interests change quite a lot too, which is most likely another factor. Whether that’ll be attempting to make a small game, website, desktop app, etc. I’ve found it hard just to pick one language and run with it, ignoring the rest until I’ve built up good knowledge of different algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc.As an example, my current job, they use C#/.NET for the backend services, and now my brain wants to learn C# again. But then I’m telling myself, “what’s the point, as you’d only focus on it for a few weeks/months, then your focus will change when a new shiny thing is discovered, or you get bored.”Has anyone else done the same in the past?

I’m not struggling with the subjects themselves. I’m struggling with caring about them the way the system expects me to.Every time exams approach, I don’t feel scared, anxious, or even motivated. I just feel… detached. Because my goal isn’t to chase marks — it’s to understand, to learn, to build. What excites me isn’t memorizing for a grade, it’s learning cutting, learning something that actually connects with my future.But the problem is that sometimes, the environment around you drains you before you even start. You see people studying hard to get top marks, while you’re there trying your best to understand — but there’s nothing to truly understand. You try to find meaning in what you study, but most teachers themselves aren’t motivated, and it kills your spark a little every day.Living in Algeria doesn’t make it easier — the system feels heavy, exhausting, and uninspiring. You go to university, follow the hours, come back home drained, and even on your “rest days,” you don’t really rest. You just survive.And sometimes I ask myself: do students in other countries feel the same? Are they also fighting to keep their curiosity alive in a system that wants to turn everyone into the same mold?I’m not saying I hate studying. I actually love learning. I just wish learning wasn’t reduced to chasing numbers on a piece of paper.So yeah, I’m excited to cut — to start my own path, to learn differently, to build something that feels alive.

My courses are completely online and asynchronous, which is great. But the resources provided are not always the greatest and expect completely green students to take in and have a full understanding of concepts that are more suited for those who have years of experience. The course is IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I'm pretty nervous about it, as a lot of students have said it's the most difficult course they've taken throughout their studies. My understanding of programming/coding is extremely rudimentary at best, ranging from the MySpace days of editing HTML to a basic SQL class I took a few months back. That's about it. Our textbook for the course is Systems Analysis & Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML, 6th ed. I also just purchased a book called Head First Object Oriented Analysis & Design by Brett McLaughlin, which I have heard is great for a visual representation of the basics. Aside from actual books, does anyone have any online tutorials or videos that may be helpful for getting started here? From the very beginning of understanding the underlying concepts. The simpler, the better. I don't even know what UML is, other than that it stands for Unified Modeling Language. No idea what that means! Obviously Google will be my best friend for this class, but if anyone here has trusted resources that they've found helpful, I would definitely appreciate the guidance.

1ojg0gi,How do you learn to analyze the design of code in tutorials/learn to implement ideas from scratch?,tree332,learnprogramming,"in concept art, there is a term called 'kitbashing' where people use assets to make a collage to build their project off of, whether it is using a 3d render to paint over for a 2d illustration or using kits of generalized parts such as screws or technical looking parts of machinery.This is likely a stupid analogy, but I have viewed this to be similar to using tutorials. So far, when I am designing a program from scratch, I make a diagram where I roughly describe and draw out features, then I try to write down potential places I could find an example of the feature. usually it starts with generally describing the feature in google ""How to draw a line between two objects in godot"" for example, then I start looking up classes in the godot library I can use and watching tutorials of feature implementation that is somewhat similar.But I often get stuck trying to then understand the code in the tutorial and studying whether the method used in the tutorial is the most efficient way for my project, or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation.But as a programming beginner, I also don't really understand the design of a library. I may roughly understand the description of a function such as vector2 get\_point\_position(index:int) for example returning the position of a point, but I may not understand the underlying design, such as how I still don't understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it's the 2d line itself that is an array containing points. Initially I thought there was some holy grail book of software architecture & programming library design that if I read, I would have a rough idea of how to outline the implementation of any project, I wouldn't awkwardly type in a rough description of my feature into google but I would rather have a label for the type of data structure and algorithm the feature uses and knew exactly where to look in the library documentation, or if developing from complete scratch.I've went through CS50, reviewed the programming fundamentals of addresses, pointers, OOP principles, intermediate programming in java implementing binary searches and linked lists etc, but my implementation skills still really suck, even after making a design diagram and pseudocode, I never know where to look in order to translate my pseudocode into a specific function in a library or a class from scratch.

The majority of roles are located in Canada or overseas.It seems like we’re in the early stages of moving all software engineering jobs outside of the US. Previously, there wasn’t enough talent outside of the US, and the number of qualified people was limited. However, with improvements in education and the increased availability of talent worldwide, we’ve reached an equilibrium where labor outside of the US can at least match what’s available in the US for non-staff/senior-level roles (although I believe this will also change).

I work in the tech department of a non-tech company btw. But im not a wizard, just a 31 y/o old man now that tries hard. So my question is are VP and director level roles more recession proof than a manager/senior/lead/standard developer level? Im kinda being tabbed to be the next in-line director of a new related department we are going to stand up in the next 15 months because im organic to our current department from being an entry level developer, to lead, and now manager so ive made good connections and repore.

No investments, no side hustle, or no form of passive income whatsoever.

How do you guys invest your income? Maybe this will give some of those people a little more insight. Drop it below!Edit: It was great to see all the different perspectives. This post is not intended to condemn others, but to shed some light on not only problems that are faced, but how some of you guys are solving them.

1og0f3f,Should I leave the unicorn startup after vesting?,SpaceyCoffee,cscareerquestions,"I recently fully vested at the startup I’m at. In the time I’ve been here my shares have gone 10x, and the business is exploding and has become the runaway leader in its sector. A highly profitable IPO looks to be in the cards in the next few years. I have gotten refresher equity over the years, such that my TC is reasonable for 13 YOE. If they were to just 2x again on IPO, I’d be looking at a healthy 8-figure payout after taxes. But of course, that is paper money and is in no way guaranteed (though my insider knowledge has me pretty bullish). The only two major downsides are as follows: I’ve been enduring a brutal 3 hour/day 3 day/week commute with kids at home. And two, I haven’t been able to purchase all my options. Only about 2/3. The pop in valuation coincided with having kids and I just couldn’t justify buying the options at the time, nor was I quite as bullish then. I’d need 3x more than I have in liquid savings to buy out the rest of the options due to taxes, and with every valuation pop that gets harder. I lose these unexercised options if I leave (classic golden handcuffs)I recently interviewed at a smaller, but still unicorn-level startup in the same sector. Its office is only 20 minutes away and has flexible hybrid hours. The offer is to lead a team at a >25% cash bump with a ~10% drop in equity depending on how you math some of the parameters. Overall a >15% TC upgrade at current valuations. It’s a paper career upgrade, but my biggest concern is trading out favorable pre-ISO RSU paper money where I am for paper equity in an as-of-yet less successful startup.There’s a quality of life question that’s near and dear to my heart, but if the trade ends up being multiple 7 figures a couple years from now, I’d kick myself forever.

If I think that I'm correct I'm willing to accept other ideas if they also work, and also that I prefer solutions that work best with the team over solutions that would technically be better but for example being too complicated to explain.Then I said that it also depends on the situation, and told a story about a pointless discussion at the end of a meeting.

This was my first post-grad job.Got pulled aside this morning and was told ""today's your last day here,"" out of nowhere. The reasoning they gave was along the lines of not meeting ""velocity,"" despite no expectations or timelines explicitly being put into place. It was a solo project with little guidance, and I required access to tools I wasn't initially provided and had to ask for, which definitely slowed the pace. There were no warnings and no PIP. They inferred that I wasn't meeting the expectations for the position and the pay.Was told to leave immediately. It was right after I completed my first major deliverable. I was genuinely shocked, as at the beginning my boss was very pleased with my work and liked to show it off; I'd worked extra on nights and weekends in response to my boss's messages to get the project done whilst also tackling my online masters.

I unfortunately graduated with 0 work experience, aside from being a TA for a few semesters. I was only a CSE major my last two years of college and I couldn't land an internship in that summer between themRecently, I had an interview for an internship position for a large company that I was able to secure through a referral. Shortly after the interview, one of the engineers on the panel told me that they want to move forward with me but that I should hold tight for the official offer letter for a couple weeks as they are amidst a hiring freeze. I felt a huge sense of relief and excitement that I was finally going to land a position after months of despair. Fast forward a month later, I get an email from the recruiter that the position is no longer being filled. Needless to say, I felt absolutely crushed.This is especially demoralizing because I have never been this close to landing a position as I rarely get interviews. I get rejected or ghosted for pretty much every application I send out. I feel like recruiters are avoiding me like the plague. I suspect it is because they are prioritizing this year's batch of new grads for junior positions. This is making me feel like my window to get my foot in the door has closed.I have even applied to some IT, QA, and analyst positions but it seems like even those are hard to get these days, especially without certs. I have also been searching for internships but finding one that is also open to grads is extremely rare.Aside from applying, I have been LeetCoding, building projects, and filling in knowledge gaps using things like The Odin Project to learn full-stack development skills. I also recently finished a volunteering gig as a ""web developer"" but all I did was help build a site using a low-code website builder.I am getting the feeling that my family is getting tired of me freeloading, and I am running out of cash. So I am now trying to reassess my options and I am hoping to get some advice/anecdotes from people on here.Way I see it, I have the following options:1. Continue on the job search grind. But until when? I am running on fumes and I am getting very depressed from doing this, with little results to show. Maybe focus on non-SWE IT and analyst roles, but again finding a truly entry-level position that doesn’t require certs or experience is pretty rare.2. Go get a master's degree in CS. The ROI on this one is not clear at the moment and I am already in a decent amount of student debt from undergrad. But this does reset the clock and make me eligible for an internships again, and I will work really fucking hard to secure one. However, I am worried about my prospects, since I had a so and so GPA (3.4) and no research or work experience. I am also currently broke so funding the degree will be difficult, especially without all the recent funding cuts.3. Apply to the military as an officer. Stable employment but I still have to get in and I hear it's challenging for those outside of the military. Besides, this is not a very appealing option due to recent events and I will most likely not be doing any software engineering.4. Look for a non-tech job. I know that this will challenging as other job markets are also struggling. It hurts me to think that all my hard work on my CS degree will mean nothing and it feels like once I accept a non-tech related position, my chances of making it into this industry will officially become 0. Any advice would be appreciated.Thank you for reading my postP.S. my resume can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/C3MpeyT) if anyone is curious.",33,0.86,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ohv2b8/graduated_a_year_ago_and_cant_land_anything/,2025-10-28 00:12:24,2025-11-01 01:42:49
1oh12kv,Feeling completely burnt out and anxious at work,a-_-_-,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve been feeling extremely anxious, burnt out, and honestly on the edge of just quiet quitting. The constant stress at work has drained me to the point where I feel like I have no motivation left.I’m leading a project right now, and it’s been rough. The environment is cutthroat, deadlines are unrealistic, and the infrastructure we depend on is poor. My manager is honestly quite incompetent there’s no real support or guidance. Most of the people I’m working with have been struggling too, and aside from a couple of reliable teammates, I’ve had to pick up the slack for others just to keep the project moving.I’ve been fighting to unblock issues every single day, often taking on extra work to make sure we don’t fall behind. But now we’ve hit a problem , I missed some edge cases earlier in the design, and we might need to pivot to a new design for a small part of the project just a week before launch. I fully accept my mistake, but I can’t stop worrying about how this will reflect on me. With deadlines approaching, I’m terrified this will affect my performance review or even put me on a PIP.What’s making it worse is the exhaustion. I’ve spent so much energy fixing things that were never really my fault in the first place, finding workarounds, reviewers nitpicking and getting alignments, and now that I’m facing my own blocker, I just don’t have the will to deal with it. It feels like I’ve been holding this project together while slowly falling apart myself.I’m not sure what to do at this point, part of me wants to keep pushing, but another part just wants to stop caring altogether. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it when you were stuck between burnout, guilt, and fear of being penalized?",28,0.87,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oh12kv/feeling_completely_burnt_out_and_anxious_at_work/,2025-10-27 00:52:28,2025-11-01 01:42:49

1okk2oz,On track for promotion but got laid off instead - On the verge of burning out.,noobmastersmaster,cscareerquestions,"tldr : Need advice on severance acceptance or other internal position but with no severance. experience: 6years in the industry.Hello y'all, I just got the dreaded news that my position is impacted. I was already on the verge of burning out because I was on track for promo but ""because of org changes we don't know when exactly it'll happen""So I've started applying for internal positions well before this event but now with this news I got a decent severance package and due to my accrued PTO+ Years spent in this firm, i think overall I'll get almost 6months of pay. Now, i also have an option to pursue an internal position in an adjacent team which is basically a 1:1 mapping of my current role and I know that team works a lot and the work over there is mehh or at least not that interests me long term but also likely not be able to prep for interviews due to the expectations. I can basically pull some strings and have high confidence i can get that offer, but if they offer and regardless of whether i accept or reject i'll loose this severance package. It's clear to me that 6month pay is much better than this internal position but i'm on H1b and have until March 2026 to find a job. if not I'm screwed or i'll have to think about changing to B1/B2 to buy time or joining a consulting firm which i want to avoid. With this job market and all this VISA bs i'm not really sure if i can find a new job within March, but the thought of 6month severance without doing any work seems really sweet to recover mentally and get on the leetcode grind. What do you think is the better play? should i just pull my internal applications and get out with severance and try my luck outside? (Somewhat confident i'll find something in 6 months). Or take that internal position and be safe, loose that sweet severance work for some time and switch with position of power? I personally want to take severance but with this VISA limbo i'm super confused about what's better.

1oiio7v,How to make myself more competitive with projects? Impossible?,shade_blade,cscareerquestions,"I've kind of been losing my mind every day I'm not getting anything. It's about 99% of my applications that lead to nothing so it feels like I'm not competitive at all, it feels like I'm just wasting my life away. I've been spending pretty much all day every day applying or working on unpresentable projects but neither of those feel like they are doing anything. Even in the rare case I get a call or something I feel like my experience and projects aren't competitive either? I ask myself ""what do I have that puts me ahead of someone with X years of experience"" and I just have nothing at all.My experience is kind of a lost cause, I don't have good metrics for any of them and they were pretty subpar (last few years were working with stuff that isn't really CS related but I can't remove them or else it looks like I have a massive job gap and the system will reject me instantly.I don't have any ideas for projects I should be making that are exciting or will get me a job at all? I've been making a chess engine thing this past month but it doesn't feel like a real project so in effect it was a waste of time? I don't really have any exciting stories about how I solved a problem that no other person has ever solved anything like it, because it's just implementing various algorithms other people have already made and there is no difficulty to doing that? In terms of metrics it is pretty garbage, it can only search about 10k positions per second while a ""good"" chess engine can do several million per second easily.I don't know how to make something that isn't some random toy project, currently all my side projects are games where being a toy project is part of the point and there's only 1 class project that isn't a game and it probably doesn't count either as it has nothing in the way of metrics either. I don't really have motivation to try to make a banking website or something like that, because I know it isn't real so it will never have any real purpose and companies will see it as not fulfilling its purpose so it doesn't count?

1ogitaa,100% raise opportunity if I switch. But the other company is a bit 'toxic'?,WisestAirBender,cscareerquestions,"About meI've only ever had 1 job at my current company. For the past 5 years or so. I'm paid well here (easily above the market average). Another, smaller company reached out. I cleared their rounds. They're offering me a 100% raise in salary.

They could not give me any solid financial growth plan, just vague promises which may or may not be fulfilled. Anyway, the only reason I'm a bit hesitant is because the new company is a bit toxic. They've had sudden layoffs in the past. Their upper management can be rude at times and insult you. The work load is high (especially now with AI). Their expectations are high.

I've been there ~1.5 years now, and at the beginning, I really enjoyed it. Everyone on my team is kind, my manager is very supportive, and while WLB was rough, I thought I could manage it. I could care less about the work that I'm doing too, but that's probably the case for most people anyway. In the beginning, I was performing well and received a promotion at the 1 year mark, but since then, it feels like my performance has quickly gone downhill. I've had several meetings with my manager discussing my potential and how to improve my metrics. Received advice from senior eng on how to work faster. Watched projects get passed to new hires since I'm no longer reliable. I completely agree with the negative feedback I've received. I wouldn't even be surprised if I get fired during my next performance review.And it's not that the work's become too difficult after the promotion either (I'm doing similar work as before). It's just that everyday I work feels like a little part of me is suffocating.

I'm really frustrated with myself, because I grew up pretty poor and I think, if 12yo me knew I was complaining this much about a job paying me six figures, I'd punch myself in the face. I'm hoping I can get some advice from people who've felt similar:1. Am I just depressed or is my job really not a good fit for me? 2. Do I try to push through this feeling to keep my job or should I start job hunting?3. Should I try to switch career fields if I do look for new employment? 4.

1olb0nm,Doing it well is far more important than doing it fast,Ok-Process-2187,cscareerquestions,"After about 5+ years in this field, I've realized that it's always better to prefer polish over speed.The reason is simple. Unless you work in an extremely isolated silo, you are not entirely responsible for your speed.When people review your code you don't get bonus points for how quickly you wrote it.However, if there are issues with your code, for that you are entirely responsible.If there's some edge case that you didn't properly check, you're responsible for that. If you missed some step in preparing your PR, you're responsible for that. If your code is difficult for others to read, you're responsible for that.Managers will always want you to be fast but speed is a shared responsibility.You cannot be fast if the code base you inherited is a mess. You cannot be fast if the company keeps changing direction. You cannot be fast if your work is rate limited by other people or systems.I've found this applies across orgs of all levels.In big orgs you'll be slowed down by more processes and structure.In small orgs the lack of process and structure increases the potential for mistakes and misunderstandings.Without really knowing the ins and outs of what someone is working on, it's hard to say if they're actually slow but a mistake is a mistake. Now and forever. When it comes time for performance reviews, no one will have the context to know if the time you spent was reasonable but if someone is looking to get rid of you, they will form a collage of every single wrong-doing you committed since the day you joined.So remember, slow down and try to consistently get everything right on the first try.",13,0.76,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1olb0nm/doing_it_well_is_far_more_important_than_doing_it/,2025-11-01 00:46:53,2025-11-01 01:42:49

1ojyeap,Worried current job is limiting future prospects,ElectricTeddyBear,cscareerquestions,"I have been in my current position for about a year, and it's my first job out of college. I am the only 'dev' on the team. I don't have a senior, but there are a couple people doing dev works on different teams in the same building. Most of my work has felt like toy projects. I have mainly been responsible for tool development and data processing. Some examples: maintaining and making new tables for our database (there's talk of redesigning the whole db), writing a basic script people run to keep files standardized, porting our data processing scripts to another group's system, making tableaus and designing KPIs for random manager requests, and my latest is modifying one of our main C# programs to accommodate another group (and whatever other changes have built up over time).It all sounds well and good, but my concern is that I don't have any oversight and that everything seems to fall in the toy project category. None of the code I've written has been complicated, and there have been libraries for everything. I don't have a senior to call me an idiot and ask why I did things a certain way - the only metric I have is whether the tool I made works and whether I did it fast enough for people not to ask again. The point of this post is to ask what I should do to mitigate that. What can I do to move into a pure dev role after this (I'm a test engineer and have that workload on top of my dev stuff). I'm worried that I'm 'poisoning the well' by getting light dev experience without any guide. I am worried that I will essentially still be entry level as long as I stay here.

1ogw7xp,"My brother (a non-dev) has an idea for a service he wants me to build, but I don't even have the first clue of what would be a fair way to charge for the work. Please help.",GreatestJakeEVR,cscareerquestions,"*Edit - Please Read!!*I'm sure grateful to all of you who took the time to speak with me about this, but guys, please, enough advice about my brother lol.I know it's a huge post and the lead gets a bit buried, but I need advice on how people value software services and how our industry tends to monitize services of this sort. It's so I can understand what things are proper for someone in my position to ask and what things I should give him. I don't just want us both to ""feel"" like we are being fair to each other, I need ways to go about valuing this stuff so we can both be comfortable with the deal we make lol. I don't need advice about going into business with my bro cuz both of us would just give the other what they want rather than let them believe they were getting screwed over. We are both much more likely to give too much away to avoid an issue than do the opposite. So having a way to put a value on this stuff and compare it to how businesses usually handle stuff like this would go a long way to ensuring we are both happy with the deal t years down the road.*Edit end*Before I explain what's going on let me start by saying my brother is probably the least greedy, most trustworthy person on this planet. So I'm not worried that he'll try to screw me over, its that I don't have any idea what would be a fair way to charge for something of this nature since it'll basically be entirely my creation from the ground up that is using the data he is supplying. So general advice on books to read or websites to go for advice on the best practices for deciding the monetary value of certain work or current industry practices for different types of work would also be welcome.# So here's what's happening:My brother has an idea for a service he wants to offer to the clients in his day job. Basically its a really confusing field and he wants to charge subscription access to his clients for a website that basically presents all this data for the client in plain English. This is a big deal because there are TONS of these JSON collections of rules and trust me, trying to figure it out from badly named JSON files with confusingly named key : value pairs is insanity. Presumably this info must have existed at one point, but that's kind of the thing: the whole system is so big and convoluted and there's no easily accessible source of info about it.The reason he contacted me is cuz he wants a program that can take these complicated collections of rules and make sense of them then put them on the internet somewhere so people can access a plain English description of the interactions and uses of them. # What's the issue?The issue is that I have a crazy amount of extremely varied experience I have that is allowing me to work on this solo and make something that will actually be a decent software. I've been so interested in data science and ML that I went back for my second bachelor's degree because of it I was certified in TensorFlow years ago, and have been using ChatGPT since before it was the the all-accessible great-god-genie that it is today. You used to have to apply for it by submitting how you planned to use it back when it was still in its infant stages.Anyway its a ton of school,, internship, job, and hobby work that I've done that's put me in a position where I know I can solo build this entire thing for sure. I've already created a model that ""seems"" to be able to pull this off. (I have no idea if its correct cuz its not my field, but my bro says the ones I showed him appear to be mostly correct. Obviously its gonna take a good bit of fine tuning, but I'm not worried in the least that this is going to work out.)So basically I'm going to be 100% making all the decisions of how to design and code and use the models, code and organize all the data collection and storage on the backend, and code all the website design, and do the hosting, testing, CI/CD etc. Every bit of the software that powers this whole endeavor is going to be made by me.# So what the F'ing F is fair for me to ask for as compensation?I don't like the idea of just charging an hourly wage and having to give up something that is all my work. But also I have no intentions or desire to screw my brother on this either. I'm only getting this opportunity cuz he knows me and has the insight to know this is something that his clients would be very happy to have.Also the amount of hours I'll put in is not equal to the amount of work that I'm getting done. A lot of the work is going to be done in the background as my software goes through all this data and creates useful output that's then organized in a way that it can all be dumped in a database and easily retrieved through a site made with Django.Oh and there's multiple clients each with their own sets of rules and things so finding a way to make my database schema universal (or as close to universal as possible) between clients is going to go a long way to prevent me from having to hardcode all of these for each client by hand. The idea is if he picks up another client, we can just dump the data to my system and it will parse it, decode it, and add it all to the database (and through the magic of Django, create a whole bunch of webpages using that data that don't have to be coded by hand).So please, if you have experience working on anything like this or working for a company deciding what to charge clients or know any ways I could learn about that I could really use the info.I've always worked for someone else at an hourly wage, so I have no idea how what to do otherwise. I just don't feel like being paid an hourly wage to work on this is fair. And I'd have no idea how to even figure out how much of a percentage to ask for if I want to split the profits from the subscription sales.",10,0.61,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogw7xp/my_brother_a_nondev_has_an_idea_for_a_service_he/,2025-10-26 21:16:17,2025-11-01 01:42:49

Short version:* Changed role accepting a pay reduction of 7% in new company.* 5 months in I got a 2,27% raise.* I got my MSc in CS.* 1year+2months later I accepted to talk about a role in new company just to get an assessment of what could my value be in the marketplace.* Without even trying hard I got an offer that comes with an increase in seniority and 25% in compensation.* It is too good to pass but I am feeling bad about leaving my team, it is not their fault. Longer version:* I quit last July due to conflicts with new tech lead manager in team. I didn't want to be a bad employee so I left. He didn't even care. * Got an offer in 2 weeks for a total of 7% less yearly compensation of my previous role and NOTE for a fintech company.* I was expecting a 2-times per year salary re-negotiation but policy changed.* I got a 2,26% salary increase last January.* I was promised a better raise this year.* I worked my ass off to evolve more. Almost finished my MSc in CS.* I accepted to talk about a new offer ONCE and without even trying they accessed my skill was worth a 25% increase in salary and a seniority role - I get to mentor entry/juniors.* It is 100% better choice for me to leave, but feeling remorse cause my current team which are great people will get destroyed. Some more notes for the company:1. Year closed with 50% profit increase.2. New offices in new city3. New AI team and hired like 20 ( I am assuming expensive ) AI engineers over they year.4. Developer left team in January, I got his workload - no salary increase, never got a replacement.5. Team got 3 new projects in September.6. Core developer was owed 200 hours of overtime and eventually instead of paying they gave him a 4 day work week for the next few months..... SAD?SUMMARY; Τo me it feels like in this company my worth is less and it gets depicted in salary. Company will try to match offer only because they are in dire position. I don't think this much of a raise would be ever considered. This means they don't value me as they should or my worth is less here and I will be better of switching anyway.

1ojln3d,Imposter syndrome or genuinely just suck?,GaslightingGreenbean,cscareerquestions,"Hello all, me again!So….I’m like a little over a year in as a dev in my stack. I won’t lie, I relied heavily on ai to get my work done for the past year. This sprint I realized that for tasks I consider to be really complex, it’s even faster if I take baby steps and reason through it while using ai to fill any knowledge gaps or bridge my memory. But man… today I watched a senior do in an hour what I couldn’t do in five hours. And it wasn’t even his story, it was mine. He just reasoned through it and based off my explanations actually gave me a working solution to something that was really stressing me out. Like this was a story that our team considered max complexity points wise, but I’m still. Then I heard my manager talking about how I should be doing all my points and each point is like only a certain number of hours and how I should still have hours left over. I’m like, how can I know ahead of time how many hours a task will take me if I find things out mid sprint?And I’m like man… watching people do so effortlessly what takes me ages is honestly kinda painful. Like I almost shed a tear today because I was like “bro this is too much I can’t do this and the deadlines soon…” and I’m honestly tired of feeling stressed and angry over development work. And even if I end up with a working solution, it isn’t “clean”, like it isn’t up to par and my tech lead might just be like “redo this.” I get juniors have a learning curve. I get that. But it’s been a year. I had my old tech lead say 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you at this point” because I did a story incorrectly and he caught it near the end of the sprint. He always said I struggled or asked about simple things and give poor feedback to my manager on how I need to much help often. I can’t remember what’s inside an object and how that object matches to this list with this key blah blah my brain just for some reason cannot reason through it like other people can.It’s gotten to the point where not only am I not taking a portion of the sprint for stories and a portion for whatever else like my manager expects, but I’m working at night, on weekends, I even sometimes would log in on a pto day to ask a question, and I’d often struggle to the point where it would feel like I get nothing doneI just don’t know what’s going on or how to move forward with this. I never wanted to stay a dev, I always wanted to move to the business side, but I’m a dev now so I have to at least do the best I can in this role. I know I won’t stay a dev, but since I’m a dev now, what is going on here? Like, I just don’t understand what’s happening with me?

1oiyzjl,"Made What I’d Consider My First Big Mistake While Working, How Bad Is It?",JtReso,cscareerquestions,"One of my first tasks ever was creating a script that moves folders around when a column of data (let's say C) changes. The manager who gave me the job told me that there was a rule that won't ever be broken at our company. That is column C will always be set to A or B and that we can use that logic to determine where to move folders to. Like an idiot I checked exactly A or B and didn't have any other checks. My manager was let go somewhere down the line and I completely forgot about this script. Not too long ago an office worker complained that they cannot find some of our files from their PC but they can through our site. So it turns out when you set column C to something other than A or B all of our projects that rely on the data still work (because I add a unique identifier file in each that we use to search instead of path thankfully) but internal office workers can't see it directly anymore because they were moved. Someone in leadership made the decision to expand the options for column C. Without my manager here to identify that went against the systems he had us design, they just went with it. So what happens is if a row of data has certain settings and column C is changed to something other than A or B, an automation triggers the script that moves ALL related folders to an unrelated folder (that is not always the same as the last record). One instance was like 10 folders but another was like 10,000 folders. I.T. was able to move things back fairly quickly because we keep a history of movement but one guy was really mad because he thought one of the developers deleted some of our stuff. Dude was essentially yelling at me already when we didn't even fully know the cause yet. I at first didn't think it was related to us but after doing my research and finding the script, I realized it was me specifically so he was kind of right. I told them and fixed it of course. How bad is this? I feel pretty bad because checking just A or B and not having a specific fallback and other checks to make is pretty egregious. I also am not a fan of getting yelled at. I also don't like the idea of defending myself by telling them to wait until we know for sure, and then confirming they were partially right. I should be sleeping right now to drive to work tomorrow but I can't sleep because I'm so bummed.",11,0.75,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oiyzjl/made_what_id_consider_my_first_big_mistake_while/,2025-10-29 08:27:33,2025-11-01 01:42:49

What should I do?",Chengue-Morales,cscareerquestions,"I've been working at my company for almost 10 years, and I'm a senior in a role that's a mix of Product Owner and Developer. The thing is, my seniority in this role is more due to my time working in support and consulting, where I worked for 6 years with the product before moving to my current position. I only started programming about 3 years ago, without a degree in the field, and dividing my time with the PO part of the job.I wanted to experience a full-time developer position in a larger scope than my current one, and I started sending out resumes for internal positions. Incredibly, I got an offer for a senior developer position for a completely different product within the same company, in an industry I have zero knowledge of. I applied for other mid-level positions, but this was the first one I received an offer for.The selection process was easy and quick, and I think the people didn't realize that my actual developer experience is quite short. I think they saw I had a senior tier and skipped technical questions about the stack and previous technical experiences, focusing instead on behavior and logic.I know it will sound like imposter syndrome, but sometimes it's not just a syndrome, right? I'm terrified of accepting the position and ending up fired if I can't deliver what they ask for in the first few months. Financially, I should receive about a 30% increase if I accept.Has anyone been in a similar situation or knows of stories of similar situations? I usually learn quickly, but I know that seniority in development isn't earned overnight. I'm even considering scheduling a meeting with the manager to explain the situation and try to align expectations, possibly reducing the seniority/salary initially to reduce the risk of dismissal, but I know that might seem like a red flag to the manager.

A little background is I was enlisted for 6 years, got my bachelors in business then transitioned out into a BDR role. That company was a mess but I was recruited via linkedin to do back-end work for our sales team at a data center. First year was great! Networked well and learned a lot, then our teams got split into specific roles for different tasks. During this time I was asking heavily for SOP's since we already didn't have many and our scope of work was actually still expanding since data centers are booming with AI. Was promised some but never happened.Got a new manager that's been there for years and shes buddy buddy with our boss. Thought I was doing great, been on the team for almost a year and started showing a lot of improvement in July until now. 1 on 1s were shorter. Got some feedback on things I needed to correct but it was happening less and less. Out of the blue I get hit with this PIP last week. Still dont have SOP's but told im making too many mistakes. I currently have the second most cases managed but told my ""numbers are low"". No proof of the numbers and no verified measure of success for our team. HR asks me not to record the PIP but I did on my phone for my defense. I show all the improvement and the fact I do just as much as everyone else (its really not that intensive of a job we only get a few cases a week and I try to grab my fair share). But even with all my proof and documentation, the 8 mistakes I've made in the last few months apparently warrant a PIP (same mistakes my team members have and STILL are making currently). Manager is now OOO but pip gives vague KPI's which amount to ""make less mistakes and do more work"". No numbers no percentages just ""do better"".I know holidays are a terrible time to job search and I feel like linkedin doesn't even work anymore. I'm really nervous for what I'm going to do here. Any advice is appreciated.\[Side note\] \- I'm the only guy on my team \- I've documented a lot of the short comings of other teams and our systems (Ex: SOP's not having been updated since 2023, multi day delays in replies) \- Old manager says somebody on their team got hired that they want to throw out but they cant and his bosses boss came down on everyone hard about being able to get rid of people.

Just complete silence.I even follow up a few days later, politely, thinking maybe they got busy or something. Still nothing.Like, you reached out to me, hyped up this opportunity, and then vanished like it never happened.

1ojeu31,Is there a major difference in a BA in CS or a BS in CS when getting hired?,Reasonable_Answer_89,cscareerquestions,"Would like to hear any advice from a getting hired perspective. Going back to school, and they admitted me to the BA in CS role, which is probably easier. I know it's less technical, but is there a major difference in landing a job with a BA in CS instead of a BS? Looking to become a full stack web developer after graduating, and one of my goals would be to make six figures in 5-10 years. Buddy of mine minored in CS, and makes $200k+. Another majored in IT, and makes around the same. Would appreciate any input.

The feedback was that it was super close, but there where concerns because I was not often enough in the office - fair enough, I have a long commute and mostly work with teams in other cities so there is not much value in being there. But be more there, and the next position is yours. So I did just that. Was there the whole last year, at least once a week. Well the next round was this week.

1ogrt0k,How do you avoid being emotional at work?,Wingfril,cscareerquestions,"Edit: to be clear, I’m not losing sleep over these things actively. All of these just came up when I was thinking about year end feedback. Some of these definitely annoyed or upset me on the day, but I don’t think about them on a regular basis. The point is— should I have been upset or annoyed at all?There’s been a few instances over the past 5 years where I stayed up at night thinking of people’s actions and comments. I feel like nearly all of the comments and actions were justified, so I think I’m just too emotional and sensitive. I shared some of these with friends, and they all say I’m not being too sensitive, but I also almost never hear them complaining about anything like this (their complaints are usually of the shape “my managers putting me on a dead end project” or “my manager is not acknowledging my contributions”)Curious how people would react in any of the circumstances:* When I was a junior with 2 yoe, I wrote a cl and sent it to someone I’ve been working with, and he scheduled a 1:1 to talk about it. During the meeting, he gave some helpful (but maybe controversial? My tl didn’t agree with the final shape of the cl) advice, but at the same time he was laughing at my code and asking why I did this, and that Im surely smarter than him because I graduated from Caltech. I think I didn’t have a good reason beside it made sense to me. * I switched companies after just over 2.5 years. After about 10 months , my manager told me that my growth trajectory isn’t as good as , and that I’d benefit from more local mentorship (the brain of the project is in hongkong, as was my manager. I’m based in the us)* A manager some levels above me mentioned that he’d rather work with smart assholes than people who are nice but slightly incompetent. (Though to be clear, we’re not hiring either)* My manager is also an IC (he only manages me), and he was the main reviewer for a cl I worked on. Another coworker left a comment and I tried to talk to my manager about these comments first. He cut me off both times. The first time was me saying oh “triggers are a good idea”, and he replied. “Yeah yeah, I saw his comment”. The second time was “are you available at 2:30? I…” “I have a meeting then”. I ask dumb questions so it’s pretty normal to get cut off, but what really annoyed me was securing our 1:1 the next day, he ask what triggers are.(I told this interaction to another younger coworker, and his response was I shouldn’t be emotional at work and that I should talk to my manager, which I did do weeks ago.)",6,0.6,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogrt0k/how_do_you_avoid_being_emotional_at_work/,2025-10-26 18:19:50,2025-11-01 01:42:49
1ogreua,"Recently graduated, feeling like a complete fraud. Where do I even start to improve?",allnamest4k3n,cscareerquestions,"Hey,I graduated from an OK university in Europe with a 3.1 GPA, so not good but not bad either. However, as I have started applying for jobs and from reading discussions on CS related forums (such as here), I have started feeling like a complete fraud. I feel like I know a little bit about a lot, but when I read posts on here I'm seeing terms I have never in my life seen before, and they are thrown around as if it were common knowledge.I feel like my lack of real skills is making it impossible for me to find a junior position; recruiters look at my CV and just discard it because there is nothing about it that stands out in any positive ways.But I do *love* CS and programming, so I'm committed to making this work somehow. I think I need to seriously improve on my core CS skills, but also programming skills, probably by going deep on some specific stack or framework.But man, I have *no clue* where to begin. It feels as if there is an ocean of things that I need to learn before I can even be considered as a serious junior candidate. I dont even know where to begin. I'm currently learning more about infrastructure (self-hosting really) by developing some fairly basic LLM wrappers to make job searching and application easier, and so I'm learning about hosting apps via Docker on remote servers, as well as setting up proper CI/CD pipelines. But even then, this is a miniscule thing and—I dont think—of any interest to any employers. There's also the AI BS, making it feel mega inefficient to do anything by hand (and actually trying to learn), as opposed to just vibing some slop out.I dont know, what do I even do? I'm thinking of doing my masters in CS come next year if I cant find anything, but I dont really have any particular interest in CS research and it would just amount to kicking the can down the road. I'm also fine like really doubling down on trying to improve core CS skills if that is what's missing to get a job, but I dont think an employer gives a damn about me knowing my DS&As.What do I do?",9,0.7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogreua/recently_graduated_feeling_like_a_complete_fraud/,2025-10-26 18:04:28,2025-11-01 01:42:49

Around 3 months ago, I switched to a popular AI startup, expecting that it would be a good learning experience.

I didn't find the new team that interesting, but I told myself I'll give it 3 months before judging. We just did the planning for the next 2 quarters, and I find it really boring.

I'm just worried what it'll look like to future employers if I leave this company within 3-4 months.

They speak so much that I either lose the main idea or miss what they’re actually trying to say.Sometimes I wonder if they’re intentionally softening their message by wrapping it in a lot of words, or if it just comes naturally to them. Either way, it makes it difficult for me to respond or take action based on what they say.What’s interesting is that when others speak on the same topic, I understand them right away.

Web dev has been fine, but it’s not what I was really hoping to do long-term.Recently, my company’s been dipping its toes into AI, mostly by giving non-technical employees access to tools like ChatGPT and running some basic “AI productivity” workshops. I figured that was about as far as they’d go, but the other day I overheard my manager and a director talking about getting some NVIDIA “AI-ready” PCs to run local LLMs. My manager said it could get pricey and that we don’t really have anyone who could handle that right now.That kinda caught my attention, because, well, I *could* help with that. I’m not a pro ML engineer, but I’ve built models, done projects, and studied this stuff a lot. I’d love to contribute if they actually start working on AI internally.The only thing is, I’m still on a **6-month trial contract**, so I don’t want to come across like I’m bored or unhappy with my current job.
