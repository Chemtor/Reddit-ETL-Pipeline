1oa0bi3,Best approach to large joins.,Nearing_retirement,dataengineering,"Hi I’m looking at table that is fairly large 20 billion rows. Trying to join it against table with about 10 million rows. It is aggregate join that an accumulates pretty much all the rows in the bigger table using all rows in smaller table. End result not that big. Maybe 1000 rows. What is strategy for such joins in database. We have been using just a dedicated program written in c++ that just holds all that data in memory. Downside is that it involves custom coding, no sql, just is implemented using vectors and hash tables. Other downside is if this server goes down it takes some time to reload all the data. Also machine needs lots of ram. Upside is the query is very fast.I understand a type of aggregate materialized view could be used. But this doesn’t seem to work if clauses added to where.

Our team's trying to build out our analytics infrastructure and our IT department has set up **completely separate environments** for DEV, UAT, and PROD including:* Separate Snowflake accounts for each environment* Separate managed Airflow deployments for each environment* GitHub monorepo with protected branches (dev/uat/prod) for code (In fact, this is what I asked for. IT dept tried to setup polyrepo for n different projects but I refused)This setup is causing major challenges or at least I do not understand how to:* As far as I am aware, zero copy cloning doesn't work across Snowflake accounts, making it impossible to easily copy production data to DEV for testing* We don't have dedicated DevOps people so setting up CI/CD workflows feels complicated* Testing ML pipelines is extremely difficult without realistic data given we cannot easily copy data from prod to dev account in SnowflakeI've been reading through blogs & docs but I'm still confused about what's standard practice for this circumstance. I'd really appreciate some real-world insights from people who've been in similar situations.# This is my best attempt to distill the questions:* For a small team like ours (4 people handling all data work), is it common to have completely separate Snowflake accounts AND separate Airflow deployments for each environment? Or do most companies use a single Snowflake account with separate databases for DEV/UAT/PROD and a single Airflow instance with environment-specific configurations?* How do you handle testing with production-like data when you can't clone production data across accounts? For ML development especially, how do you validate models without using actual production data?* What's the practical workflow for promoting changes from DEV to UAT to PROD? We're using GitHub branches for each environment but I'm not sure how to structure the CI/CD process for both dbt models and Airflow DAGs without dedicated DevOps support* How do you handle environment-specific configurations in dbt and Airflow when they're completely separate deployments? Like, do you run Airflow & dbt in DEV environment to generate data for validation and do it again across UAT & PROD? How does this work?Again, I have tried my best to arcitulate the headaches that I am having and any practical advice would be super helpful.

My friend has a startup and they had a need to display some data so I offered him that I could build something for them.The idea was to use Superset, since that's what one of their analysts has used before. Superset seems to also have at least some kind of support for Ducklake, so I wanted to try that as well.So I set up an EC2 where I pull a git repo and then spin up few docker compose services. First service is postgres that acts as a metadata for both Superset and Ducklake. Then Superset service spins up nginx and gunicorn that run the BI layer.Actual ETL can be done anywhere on the EC2 (or Lambdas if you will) but basically I'm just pulling data from open source API's, doing a bit of transformation and then pushing the data to Ducklake. Storage is S3 and Ducklake handles the parquet files there.Superset has access to the Ducklake metadata DB and therefore is able to access the data on S3.To my surprise, this is working quite nicely. The only issue seems to be how Superset displays the schema of the Ducklake, as it shows all the secrets of the connection URI (:I don't want to publish the git repo as it's not very polished, but I just wanted to maybe raise discussion if anyone else has tried something similar before?This sure was refreshing and different than my day to day job with big data.And if anyone has any questions regarding setting this up, I'm more than happy to help!",26,0.9,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1odains/ducklake_on_aws/,2025-10-22 14:55:09,2025-10-25 01:26:48

They have data from training sessions the last couple of years in a database, and we have the API's. They want us to visualise the data and look for patterns and also make sure, that they can use, when we are done. We have around 60-100 hours to execute it. My question is what platform should we use\- Build a streamlit app? \- Build a power BI dashboard? \- Build it in DatabricksAre there other ways to do it?

1oca4c7,Help a noob: CI/CD pipelines with medallion architecture,Nomad_chh,dataengineering,"Hello, I have worked for a few years as an analyst (self taught) and now I am trying to get into data engineering. I am trying to simply understand how to structure a DWH using **medallion architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) across **multiple environments** (Dev / Test / Prod).Now, with the last company I worked with, they simply had two databases, staging, and production. Staging is basically the data lake and they transformed all the data to production. I understand this is not best practice.I thought if I wanted to have a proper structure in my DWH, I was thinking of this:DWH |\-> DevDB -> BronzeSchema, SilverSchema, GoldSchema\-> TestDB -> BronzeSchema, SilverSchema, GoldSchema\-> ProdDB -> BronzeSchema, SilverSchema, GoldSchemaWould you even create a bronze layer on dev and test DBs or not really?

1o9q246,Data Factory extraction techniques,Upstairs_Drive_305,dataengineering,Hey looking for some direction on Data factory extraction design patterns. Im new to the Data Engineering world but i come from infrastructure with experience standing Data factories and some simple pipelines. Last month we implemented a Databricks DLT Meta framework that we just scrapped and pivoted to a similar design that doesn't rely on all those onboarding ddl etc files. Now its just dlt pipelines perfoming ingestion based on inputs defined in asset bundle when ingesting. On the data factory side our whole extraction design is dependent on a metadata table in a SQL Server database. This is where i feel like this is a bad design concept to totally depend on a unsecured non version controlled table in a sql server database. That table get deleted or anyone with access doing anything malicious with that table we can't extract data from our sources. Is this a industry standard way of extracting data from sources? This feels very outdated and non scalable to me to have your entire data factory extraction design based on a sql table. We only have 240 tables currently but we are about to scale in December to 2000 and im not confident in that scaling at all. My concerns fall on deaf ears due to my co workers having 15+ years in data but primary using Talend not Data Factory and not using Databricks at all. Can someone please give me some insights on modern techniques if my suspicions are correct?,13,0.86,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1o9q246/data_factory_extraction_techniques/,2025-10-18 08:05:43,2025-10-25 01:26:48
1odz8e9,Argue dbt architecture,nico97nico,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, hope get some advice from you guys.Recently I joined a company where the current project I’m working on goes like this:Data lake store daily snapshots of the data source as it get updates from users and we store them in parquet files, partition by date. From there so far so good.In dbt, our source points only to the latest file.Then we have an incremental model that:Apply business logic , detected updated columns, build history columns (valid from valid to etc)My issue: our history is only inside an incremental model , we can’t do full refresh. The pipeline is not reproducibleMy proposal: add a raw table in between the data lake and dbt But received some pushback form business: 1. We will never do a full refresh 2. If we ever do, we can just restore the db backup 3. You will increase dramatically the storage on the db 4. If we lose the lake or the db, it’s the same thing anyway 5. We already have the data lake to need everything How can I frame my argument to the business ? It’s a huge company with tons of business people watching the project burocracy etc.EDIT: my idea to create another table will be have a “bronze layer” raw layer whatever you want to call it to store all the parquet data, at is a snapshot , add a date column.

What Should I Do?,Mysterious-Sky5410,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I’ve been working at a WITCH company for about a year now, as a Data Engineer. I’ve been in the same project throughout, where I mainly handle support tasks— documentation, debugging, adding columns, updating views, ensuring data flow, and just ensuring everything runs smoothly. Essentially, I’m not involved in any real development work like building pipelines or writing scripts.I’ve seen a lot of posts about people in similar situations, like the one here [Need career advice – Am I a Data Engineer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineersindia/comments/1nf3h0u/need_career_advice_am_i_a_data_engineer_how_do_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) , and it feels like I’m in the same boat. The problem is, I’ve been stuck in this role for a year, and I honestly feel like if I stay for another year or two, I won’t learn anything new. I’ve been trying to switch jobs and have been applying for the last 3-4 months, but most of the time, I don’t even make it past the shortlisting stage. I don’t blame the companies, to be honest—I just don’t have anything unique to show in my experience section. I’ve worked on some personal projects, but that’s about it.Another challenge is the 90-day notice period. It’s hard to move quickly when companies need immediate joiners, so I feel stuck in that regard too.I see two possible options right now:Ask to be released from my current project: But this is tricky. I’m not sure if they’ll even let me go (seniors have told that release is not provided easily), and if I do get released, I’m worried the next project might be even worse. Plus, I don’t know how long I’d be able to stay on the bench, and that’s also not ideal.Resign and serve the notice period quietly: This comes with its own set of risks, mainly the uncertainty of not having a job while I keep applying. The idea of not having a stable income while job hunting scares me.So, I guess I’m at a crossroads. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice on how I should proceed from here? I don't want to be stuck here in this swamp in the early stages of my career as it will also affect my future career path. I have been making few more personal projects to add but I still don't think that will be enough.Appreciate any insights or suggestions!TL/DR : I’ve been working as a Data Engineer in a WITCH company for a year, mostly handling support tasks with no real development experience. I’ve been trying to switch jobs for 3-4 months but keep getting rejected. I’m stuck with a 90-day notice period and feel like I’m not learning anything new.

1oaa9jv,Evaluating my proposed approach,SoloArtist91,dataengineering,"Hey guys, looking for feedback on a potential setup. For context, we are a medium sized company and our data department consists of me, my boss and one other analyst. I'm the most technical one, the other two can connect to a database in Tableau and that's about it. I'm fairly comfortable writing Python scripts and SQL queries, but I am not a software engineer.We currently have MS SQL Server on prem that was set up a decade ago and is reaching its end of life in terms of support. For ETL, we've been using Alteryx for about as long as that, and for reporting we have Tableau Server. We don't have that much data (550GB total), and we ingest about 50k rows an hour in batched CSV files that our vendors send us. This data is a little messy and needs to be cleaned up before a database can ingest it.With the SQL Server getting old and our renewal conversations with Alteryx going extremely poorly, my boss has directed me to research options for replacing both, or scaling Alteryx down to just the last mile for Tableau Server. Our main purposes are 1) upgrade our data warehouse to something with as little maintenance as possible and 2) continue to serve our Tableau dashboards 3) make ad-hoc analysis in Tableau possible for my boss and the other analyst. Ideally, we'd keep our costs to under 70k a year.So far I've played around with Databricks, Clickhouse, Prefect, Dagster, and have started doing the dbt fundementals courses to get a better idea of it. While I liked Databricks's unity catalog and time travel capabilities of delta tables, the price and computing power of spark seems like overkill for our purposes/size. It felt like I was spending a lot of time spinning up clusters and frivolously spending cash working out the syntax.Clickhouse caught my eye since it promises fast query times, it is easy enough to set up and put together a sample pipeline together, and the cloud database offering seems cheaper than DBX. It's nice that dbt-core can be used with it as well, because just writing queries and views inside the cloud console there seems like it can get hairy and confusing really fast.So far, I'm thinking that we can run local Python scripts for ingesting data into Clickhouse staging tables, then write views on top of those for the cleaner silver + gold tables and let Alteryx/analysts connect to those. The tricky part with CH is how it manages upserts/deletions behind the scenes, but I think with ReplacingMergeTrees and solid queries, we could get around those limitations. It's also less forgiving with schema drift and inferring data types.So my questions are as follows:* Does my approach make sense? * Are there other products worth looking into for my use case?* How do you guys evaluate the feasibility of a setup when the tools are new to you?* Is Clickhouse in your experience a solid product that will be around for the next 5-10 years?Thank you for your time.",5,0.78,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1oaa9jv/evaluating_my_proposed_approach/,2025-10-18 23:08:47,2025-10-25 01:26:48
1oefepq,Deep Dive: Data Pruning in Apache Doris,ApacheDoris,dataengineering,"# 1. OverviewIn analytical database systems, reading data from disks and transferring data over the network consume significant server resources. This is particularly true in the storage-compute decoupled architecture, where data must be fetched from remote storage to compute nodes before processing. Therefore, data pruning is crucial for modern analytical database systems. Recent studies underscore its significance. For example, applying filter operations at the scan node can reduce execution time by over 50% \[1\]. PowerDrill has been shown to avoid 92.41% of data reads through effective pruning strategies, while Snowflake reports pruning up to 99.4% of data in customer datasets.Although these results come from different benchmarks and aren't directly comparable, they lead to a consistent insight: for modern analytical data systems, the most efficient way to process data is to **avoid processing it wherever possible.**At Apache Doris, we have implemented multiple strategies to make the system more intelligent, enabling it to skip unnecessary data processing. In this article, we will discuss all the data pruning techniques used in Apache Doris.# 2.Related WorksIn modern analytical database systems, data is typically stored in separate physical segments via horizontal partitioning. By leveraging partition-level metadata, the execution engine can skip all data irrelevant to queries. For instance, by comparing the maximum/minimum values of each column with predicates in the query, the system can exclude all ineligible partitions—a strategy implemented through zone maps \[3\] and SMAs (Small Materialized Aggregates) \[4\].Another common approach is using secondary indexes, such as Bloom filters \[5\], Cuckoo filters \[6\], and Xor filters \[7\]. Additionally, many databases implement dynamic filtering, where filter predicates are generated during query execution and then used to filter data (related studies include \[8\]\[9\]).# 3.Overview of Apache Doris's ArchitectureApache Doris \[10\] is a modern data warehouse designed for real-time analytics. We will briefly introduce its overall architecture and concepts/capabilities of data filtering in this section.**3.1 Overall Architecture of Apache Doris**A Doris cluster consists of three components: Frontend (FE), Backend (BE), and Storage.1. Frontend (FE): Primarily responsible for handling user requests, executing DDL and DML statements, optimizing tasks via the query optimizer, and aggregating execution results from Backends.2. Backend (BE): Primarily responsible for query execution, processing data through a series of control logic and complex computations to return the data for users.3. Storage: Managing data partitioning and data reads/writes. In Apache Doris, storage components are divided into local storage and remote storage. https://preview.redd.it/f7mjdrqffxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fffc7adb40fda731c73e6aaaa8b0bfafa6c823a**3.2 Overview of Data Storage in Apache Doris**In Apache Doris’s data model, a table typically includes partition columns, Key columns, and data columns:* At the storage layer, partition information is maintained in metadata. When a user query arrives, the Frontend can directly determine which partitions to read based on metadata.* Key columns support data aggregation at the storage layer. In actual data files, Segments (split from partitions) are organized by the order of Key columns—meaning Key columns are sorted within each Segment.* Within a Segment, each column is stored as an independent columnar data file (the smallest storage unit in Doris). These columnar files further maintain their own metadata (e.g., maximum and minimum values).https://preview.redd.it/m2noaz7hfxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b54ee7c7839a09a93cefed64c072e8e34f3cd29e**3.3 Overview of Data Pruning in Apache Doris**Based on when pruning occurs, data pruning in Apache Doris is categorized into two types: **static pruning** and **dynamic pruning.*** Static pruning: Determined directly after the query SQL is processed by the parser and optimizer. It typically relies on pre-defined filter predicates in the SQL. For example, when querying data where `a > 1`, the optimizer can immediately exclude all partitions with `a ≤ 1`.* Dynamic pruning: Determined during query execution. For example, in a query with a simple equivalent inner join, the Probe side only needs to read rows with values matching the Build side. This requires dynamically obtaining these values at runtime for pruning.https://preview.redd.it/xhgx11bkfxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d715b0ea97894ceff541ef4132f96744b912cfbTo elaborate on the implementation details of each pruning technique, we further classify them into four types based on pruning methods:1. Predicate filtering (static pruning, determined by user SQL).2. LIMIT pruning (dynamic pruning).3. TopK pruning (dynamic pruning).4. JOIN pruning (dynamic pruning).The execution layer of an Apache Doris cluster usually includes multiple instances, and dynamic pruning requires coordination across instances. This increased the complexity of dynamic pruning. We will discuss the details later.# 4. Predicate FilteringIn Apache Doris, static predicates are generated by the Frontend after processing by the Analyzer and Optimizer. Their effective timing varies based on the columns they act on:* Predicates on partition columns: The Frontend uses metadata to identify which partitions store the required data, enabling direct partition-level pruning (the most efficient form of data pruning).* Predicates on Key columns: Since data is sorted by Key columns within Segments, we can generate upper and lower bounds for Key columns based on the predicates. Then, we use binary search to determine the range of rows to read.* Predicates on regular data columns: First, we filter columnar files by comparing the predicate with metadata (e.g., max/min values) in each file. We then read all eligible columnar files and compute the predicate to get the row IDs of filtered data.Example illustration: First, define the table structure: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tbl` ( a int, b int, c int ) ENGINE=OLAP DUPLICATE KEY(a,b) PARTITION BY RANGE(a) ( PARTITION partition1 VALUES LESS THAN (1), PARTITION partition2 VALUES LESS THAN (2), PARTITION partition3 VALUES LESS THAN (3) ) DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(b) BUCKETS 8 PROPERTIES ( ""replication_allocation"" = ""tag.location.default: 1"" );Insert sample data to partition 1, partition 2, and partition 3:https://preview.redd.it/sd40fsoyfxwf1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=23be57d0ddd3d03acfd5e77f384d3a0f7665b6ee**4.1 Predicate Filtering on Partition Columns** SELECT * FROM `tbl` WHERE `a` > 0;As mentioned before, partition pruning is completed at the Frontend layer by interacting with metadata.https://preview.redd.it/7xdjujomfxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=af183df6d56c363a619d7d03e9004eabb8f5740d**4.2 Predicate Filtering on Key Columns**Query (where `b` is a Key column): SELECT * FROM `tbl` WHERE `b` > 0;https://preview.redd.it/6mnkk1e0gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4da61909a21390bf8186859d54e07965202374c5In this example, the storage layer uses the lower bound of the Key column predicate (`0`, exclusive) to perform a binary search on the Segment. It finally returns the row ID `1` (second row) of eligible data; the row ID is used to read data from other columns.**4.3 Predicate Filtering on Data Columns**Query (where `c` is a regular data column): SELECT * FROM `tbl` WHERE `c` > 2;https://preview.redd.it/973bwl03gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8bff454ceda3cee8e2435eb4d0394b91788912In this example, the storage layer utilizes data files from column `c` across all Segments for computation. Before computation, it skips files where the max value (from metadata) is less than the query’s lower bound (e.g., `Column File 0` is skipped). For `Column File 1`, it computes the predicate to get matching row IDs, which are then used to read data from other columns.# 5. LIMIT PruningLIMIT queries are common in analytical tasks \[11\]. For regular queries, Doris uses concurrent reading to accelerate data scanning. For LIMIT queries, however, Doris adopts a different strategy to prune data early:* LIMIT on Scan nodes: To avoid reading unnecessary data, Doris sets the scan concurrency to `1` and stops scanning once the number of returned rows reaches the LIMIT.* LIMIT on other nodes: The Doris execution engine immediately stops reading data from all upstream nodes once the LIMIT is satisfied.https://preview.redd.it/hd7hus34gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e188c9c134b8c823207cf3be236d967f044a5fb# 6. TopK PruningTopK queries are widely used in BI (Business Intelligence) scenarios. A TopK query retrieves the top-K results sorted by specific columns. Similar to LIMIT pruning, the naive approach—sorting all data and then selecting the top-K results, incurs high data scanning overhead. Thus, database systems typically use heap sorting for TopK queries. Optimizations during heap sorting (e.g., scanning only eligible data) can significantly improve query efficiency.**Standard Heap Sorting**The most intuitive method for TopK queries is to maintain a min-heap (for descending sorting). As data is scanned, it is inserted into the heap (triggering heap updates). Data not in the heap is discarded (no overhead for maintaining discarded data). After all data is scanned, the heap contains the required TopK results.**Theoretically Optimal Solution**The theoretically optimal solution refers to the minimum amount of data scanning needed to obtain correct TopK results:* When the TopK query is sorted by Key columns: Since data within Segments is sorted by Key columns (see Section 3.2), we only need to read the first K rows of each Segment and then aggregate and sort these rows to get the final result.* When the TopK query is sorted by non-Key columns: The optimal approach is to read and sort the sorted data of each Segment, and then select the required rows—avoiding scanning all data.Doris includes targeted optimizations for TopK queries:1. Local pruning: Scan threads first perform local pruning on data.2. Global sorting: A global Coordinator aggregates and fully sorts the pruned data, then performs global pruning based on the sorted results.Thus, TopK queries in Doris involve two phases:* Phase 1: Read the sorted columns, perform local and global sorting, and obtain the row IDs of eligible data.* Phase 2: Re-read all required columns using the row IDs from Phase 1 for the final result.https://preview.redd.it/uqc3raw5gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc2a4f1fb5f8c35f25f726325f186aece54053b**6.1 Local Data Pruning**During query execution:1. Multiple independent threads read data.2. Each thread processes the data locally.3. Results are sent to an aggregation thread for the final result.In TopK queries, each scan thread first performs local pruning:* Each scan node is paired with a TopK node that maintains a heap of size K.* If the number of scanned rows is less than K, scanning continues (insufficient data for TopK results).* Once K rows are scanned, discard other unnecessary data. For subsequent scans, use the heap top element as a filter predicate (only scan data smaller than the heap top).* This process repeats: scan data smaller than the current heap top, update the heap, and use the new heap top for filtering. This ensures only data eligible for TopK is scanned at each stage.**6.2 Global Data Pruning**After local pruning, N execution threads return at most N\*K eligible rows. These rows require aggregation and sorting to get the final TopK results:1. Use heap sorting to sort the N\*K rows.2. Output the K eligible rows and their row IDs to the Scan node.3. The Scan node reads other columns required for the query using these row IDs.**6.3 TopK Pruning for Complex Queries**Local pruning does not involve multi-thread coordination and is straightforward (as long as the scan phase is aware of TopK, it can maintain and use the local heap). Global pruning is more complex: in a cluster, the behavior of the global Coordinator directly affects query performance.Doris designs a general Coordinator applicable to all TopK queries. For example, in queries with multi-table joins:* Phase 1: Read all columns required for joins and sorting, then perform sorting.* Phase 2: Push the row IDs down to multiple tables for scanning.# 7. JOIN PruningMulti-table joins are among the most time-consuming operations in database systems. From execution perspectives, less data means lower join overhead. A brute-force join (computing the Cartesian product) of two tables of size M and N has a time complexity of O(M\*N). Thus, Hash Join is commonly used for higher efficiency:1. Select the smaller table as the Build side and construct a hash table with its data.2. Use the larger table as the Probe side to probe the hash table.Ideally (ignoring memory access overhead and assuming efficient data structures), the time complexity of building the hash table and probing is O(1) per row, leading to an overall O(M+N) complexity for Hash Join. Since the Probe side is usually much larger than the Build side, reducing the Probe side’s data reading and computation is a critical challenge.Apache Doris provides multiple methods for Probe-side pruning. Since the values of the Build-side data in the hash table are known, the pruning method can be selected based on the size of the Build-side data.**7.1 JOIN Pruning Algorithm**The goal of JOIN pruning is to reduce Probe-side overhead without compromising correctness. This requires balancing the overhead of constructing predicates from the hash table and the overhead of probing:* Small Build-side data: Directly construct an exact predicate (e.g., an `IN` predicate). The `IN` predicate ensures all data used for probing is guaranteed to be part of the final output.https://preview.redd.it/bf6mqu69gxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6105912b4af14e4cdd37a4b192fdfc6b9ef323* Large Build-side data: Constructing an `IN` predicate incurs high deduplication overhead. For this case, Doris trades off some probing performance (reduced filtering rate) for a lower-overhead filter: Bloom Filter \[5\]. A Bloom Filter is an efficient filter with a configurable false positive probability (FPP). It maintains low predicate construction overhead even for large Build-side data. Since filtered data still undergoes join probing, correctness is guaranteed.https://preview.redd.it/x0663jhagxwf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8773c6d6bd82b533c2aab9ad1d9bcfcde51bf4fIn Doris, join filter predicates are built dynamically at runtime and cannot be determined statically before execution. Thus, Doris uses an adaptive approach by default:1. First, construct an `IN` predicate.2. When the number of deduplicated values reaches a threshold, reconstruct a Bloom Filter as the join predicate.**7.2 JOIN Predicate Waiting Strategy**As Bloom Filter construction also incurs overhead, Doris’s adaptive pruning algorithm cannot fully avoid high query latency when the Build side has extremely high overhead. Thus, Doris introduces a JOIN predicate waiting strategy:* By default, the predicate is assumed to be built within 1 second. The Probe side waits at most 1 second for the predicate from the Build side. If the predicate is not received, it starts scanning directly.* If the Build-side predicate is completed during Probe-side scanning, it is immediately sent to the Probe side to filter subsequent data.# 8. Conclusion and Future WorkWe present the implementation strategies of four data pruning techniques in Apache Doris: predicate filtering, LIMIT pruning, TopK pruning, and JOIN pruning. Currently, these efficient pruning strategies significantly improve data processing efficiency in Doris. According to the customer data from Snowflake in 2024 \[12\], the average pruning rates of predicate pruning, TopK pruning, and JOIN pruning exceed 50%, while the average pruning rate of LIMIT pruning is 10%. These figures demonstrate the significant impact of the four pruning strategies on customer query efficiency.In the future, we will continue to explore more universal and efficient data pruning strategies. As data volumes grow, pruning efficiency will increasingly influence database system performance—making this a sustained area of development.https://preview.redd.it/wcqv0fkcgxwf1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31f8eec9b95e12c1110facb2bf77b965d5e789d# Reference\[1\] Alexander van Renen and Viktor Leis. 2023.

1odyoh5,Notebook memory in Fabric,Doodeledoode,dataengineering,"Hello all!So, background to my question is that I on my F2 capacity have the task of fetching data from a source, converting the parquet files that I receive into CSV files, and then uploading them to Google Drive through my notebook. But the issue that I first struck was that the amount of data downloaded was too large and crashed the notebook because my F2 ran out of memory (understandable for 10GB files). Therefore, I want to download the files and store them temporarily, upload them to Google Drive and then remove them.First, I tried to download them to a lakehouse, but I then understood that removing files in Lakehouse is only a soft-delete and that it still stores it for 7 days, and I want to avoid being billed for all those GBs...So, to my question. ChatGPT proposed that I download the files into a folder like ""/tmp/\*filename.csv\*"", and supposedly when I do that I use the ephemeral memory created when running the notebook, and then the files will be automatically removed when the notebook is finished running.The solution works and I cannot see the files in my lakehouse, so from my point of view the solution works. BUT, I cannot find any documentation of using this method, so I am curious as to how this really works? Have any of you used this method before? Are the files really deleted after the notebook finishes? Is there any better way of doing this?

1obisxn,Help: Fine-grained Instructions on SparkSQL,ukmurmuk,dataengineering,"Hey folks, I need to pick your brains to brainstorm a potential solution to my problem.Current stack: SparkSQL (Databricks SQL), storage in Delta, modeling in dbt.I have a pipeline that generally works like this: WITH a AS (SELECT * FROM table) SELECT a.*, 'one' AS type FROM a UNION ALL SELECT a.*, 'two' AS type FROM a UNION ALL SELECT a.*, 'three' AS type FROM aThe source table is partitioned on a column, let's say column \`date\`, and the output is stored also with partition column \`date\` (both with Delta). The transformation in the pipeline is just as simple as select one huge table, do broadcast joins with a couple small tables (I have made sure all joins are done as \`BroadcastHashJoin\`), and then project the DataFrame into multiple output legs.I had a few assumptions that turns out to be plain wrong, and this mistake really f\*\*ks up the performance.**Assumption 1:** I thought Spark will scan the table once, and just read it from cache for each of the projections. Turns out, Spark compiles the CTE into inline query and read the table thrice.**Assumption 2**: Because Spark read the table three times, and because Delta doesn't support bucketization, Spark distributes the partition for each projection leg without guarantee that rows that share the same \`date\` will end up in the same worker. The consequence of this is a massive shuffling at the end before writing the output to Delta, and this shuffle really kills the performance.I have been thinking about alternative solutions that involve switching stack/tools, e.g. use pySpark for a fine-grained control, or switch to vanilla Parquet to leverage the bucketization feature, but those options are not practical. Do you guys have any idea to satisfy the above two requirements: (a) scan table once, and (b) ensure partitions are distributed consistently to avoid any shuffling.",3,0.81,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1obisxn/help_finegrained_instructions_on_sparksql/,2025-10-20 13:19:52,2025-10-25 01:26:48

1oeonrp,"I'm a MS student in my last year, should I go back to my old company or should I go with a new I interned for over the summer?",DataByte7389,dataengineering,"Background: I’m finishing up my last year in my M.S. program studying a mixture of Data Analytics and Information Systems. Before grad school, I spent a little over 4 years working remotely at a med-tech startup (around 500 people) in product management. It was a great learning experience but also very stressful. They constantly overloaded me, interfered with my school schedule (when I was working part-time in undergrad), worked late into the night constantly, and broke promises around pay and promotions.I eventually left when I started my master’s, mainly for my own sanity and so I could focus on my health, school, and my relationship. I made sure to leave on good terms since I still really like the company and the products they are creating. It’s a small, niche industry, so I wanted to keep that bridge intact.This past summer, I interned at a manufacturing company that works in the AI/data center space. My role started as Systems Analyst but turned into more of a Data Engineering internship by the end of it. I learned a lot, but the culture was rough on my team. They didn’t really want an intern, and it was a pretty cold and dry environment with them being too busy to interact with me the whole summer. I very much had to figure out a lot of things on my own since I had to use tools and create projects I never had experience with ever. To add, this was just an issue with the team I was on, other interns had a great time on different teams. It made me consistently miss the energy and connection I had with my old coworkers at the startup, which is something I think I value a lot on a team.-Decision-The manufacturing company gave me a full-time offer for after graduation. It is a Sr Engineer role with a total comp of 145k (Yearly Breakdown: $105k base + 10% bonus + around 30k in stock). It’s stable, the benefits are great, and they even mentioned I might rotate through different engineering areas to choose a spot I like. But most likely due to company necessity I will end up in the same team (Data Engineering) I was with before since they are spread extremely thin. I am nervous about the role since they are asking me to do projects that I have little to no experience doing with little support just like the internship. It makes me afraid (A bit of imposter syndrome?) that I will not succeed in the role since I come from a more business / analytics background. But recently I also got contacted by my old company, who’s entering a big growth phase, and they asked if I’d consider coming back to the product team after graduation. They’ve made promises that they’ve reduced a lot of the work and the emergency late nights by creating a new team to manage them. I would focus more on actual product management and problem solving if I came back. They implied they would consider hiring me remotely again but are pushing for me to instead relocate to their HQ (based in Seattle when I am currently on the east coast). I’ve not received an offer yet as we are going back and forth still but I am familiar with the salary range based off of my co-workers. Estimated Breakdown: 80-97k Base + 10-15% Bonus + 12.5k in RSUs. Part of me wants to go back because I really loved the people and the work. But I’m scared of ending up in the same stressful situations again along with all the promises that were broken before and if they can keep them. Also scared that I won’t have much growth since they do not promote often in PM. On the other hand, the new company is stable and pays well with clear expectations but doesn’t excite me the same way as well with other fears about the position and team.How should I proceed? Also another thing I’m thinking about is long term on which role will let me best pursue other growth opportunities and not plateau early in my career.

How should I handle this in our data warehouse?I’m thinking of updating the ExamKey value in Fact\_Exam and Fact\_Result to a default value like -1 that corresponds to Exam ID 123, and then deleting that Exam ID 123 row from the Exam table.I’m not sure if this is even the correct approach. Also, considering that the ExamKey is used in many other fact tables, I don’t think this is an efficient process, as I’d have to check and update several fact tables before deleting.

1oeflsb,Multi-tenant schema on Clickhouse - are we way off?,RevolutionaryOwl2455,dataengineering,"At work (30-person B2B SaaS), we’re currently debating evolving our data schema. The founders cobbled something together 10 years ago on AWS and through some patching and upgrading, we’ve scaled to 10,000 users, typically sales reps.One challenge we’ve long faced is data analysis. We take raw JSON records from CRMs/VOIPs/etc, filter them using conditions, and turn them into performance records on another table. These “promoted” JSON records are then pushed to RedShift where we can do some deeper analysis (such as connecting companies and contacts together, or tying certain activities back to deals, and then helping clients to answer more complex questions than “how many meetings have my team booked this week?”). Without going much deeper, going from performance records back to JSON records and connecting them to associated records but only those that have associated performance… Yeah, it’s not great. The evolved data schema we’re considering is a star schema making use of our own model that can transform records from various systems into this model’s common format. So “company” records from Salesforce, HubSpot, and half a dozen all CRMs are all represented relatively similarly (maybe a few JSON properties we’d keep in a JSON column for display only). Current tables we’re sat on are dimensions for very common things like users, companies, and contacts. Facts are for activities (calls, emails, meetings, tasks, notes etc) and deals.My worry is that any case of a star schema being used that I’ve come across has been for internal analytics - very rarely a multi-tenant architecture for customer data. We’re prototyping with Tinybird which sits on top of Clickhouse. There’s a lot of stuff for us to consider around data deletion, custom properties per integration and so on, but that’s for another day. Does this overall approach sit ok with you? Anything feel off or set off alarm bells?

It’s basically a modernized spin on the kind of work I do at my job, a Transaction Data Platform with a multi-step ETL pipeline.Quick overview of setup:DB structure:Dimensions = Bank -> Account -> RoutingFact = Transactions -> Transaction\_StepsHistory = Hist_Transactions -> Hist_Transaction_Steps (identical to fact tables, just one extra column) I mocked up 3 regions -> 3 banks per region -> 3 accounts per bank -> 702 unique directional routings.A Python script first assigns following parameters to each routing:type (High Intensity/Frequency/Normal)country\_code, region, cross\_borderbase\_freq, base\_amount, base\_latency, base\_successvolatility vars (freq/amount/latency/success)Then the synthesizer script uses above paramters to spit out 85k-135k records per day, and 5x times Transaction\_Steps Anomaly engine randomly spikes volatility (50–250x) \~5 times a week for a random routing, the aim is (hopefully) the pipeline will detect the anomalies.Pipeline workflow:Batch runs daily (simulating off business hours migration).Every day data older than 1 month in live table is moved to history tables (partitioned by day and OLTP compressed) Then the partitions older than a month in history tables are exported to Parquet (maybe I'll create a Data lake or something) cold storage and stored. The current day's transactions are transformed through DBT, to generate 12 marts, helping in anomaly detection and system monitoring A Great Expectation + Python layer takes care of data quality and Anomaly detectionFinally for visualization and ease of discussion I'm generating a streamlit dashboard from above 12 marts.Main concerns/questions:1. Since this is just inspired by my current work (I didn’t use real table names/logic, just the concept), should I be worried about IP/overlap ?2. I’ve done a barebones version of this in shell+SQL, so I personally know business and technical requirements and possible issues in this project, it feels really straightforward. Do you think this is a solid enough project to showcase for DE roles at product-based-companies / fintechs (0–3 YOE range)?3. Thoughts on using synthetic data? I’ve tried to make it noisy and realistic, but since I’ll always have control, I feel like I'm missing something critical that only shows up in real-world messy data?Would love any outside perspectiveThis would ideally be the portfolio project, and there's one more planned using spark where I'm just cleaning and merging Spotify datasets from different types (CSV, json, sqlite, parquet etc) from Kaggle, it's just a practice project to showcase spark understanding. **TLDR:** Built a synthetic transaction pipeline (750k+ txns, 3.75M steps, anomaly injection, DBT marts, cold storage).

My web app is currently running on Vercel, and looking for options for a good cloud data warehouse that integrates well with Vercel. While I am currently using Postgres, my needs are better suited for an OLAP datababase so I am curious if this is still the best option. What are the good options on Vercel for this?I looked at Motherduck and looks like it is a good option, but one challenge I am seeing is that the WASM client would be exposing the tokens to the customer. Given that it is a multi-tenant applications, I would need to create a user per tennant and do that user management myself. If I go with MotherDuck, my alternative is to move my webapp to a proper nodejs deployment where I don't need to depend on WASM client.

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.Every time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.Back in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.I’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.The good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems.

1odrdwj,For any beginners that need to hear this: Don't be scared of projects!,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"So, I recently started programming again after like a year and a half of a break and I very vividly remember that every time I had a project idea that I thought was a bit too ambitious I would always put it away and I would think that it's too much for me and that I should do it some other time in the future. It wasn't until recently that I realized that that mindset can be really dumb sometimes and could even hinder your learning.Now, if you're an absolute beginner with weeks or barely 3 months of experience, then yeah start simple and work your way up. But, I'm talking about the beginners who already learned the fundamentals, those who already understand their programming language and can start making projects. Whatever it is you've been planning, just do it.Building projects will keep you in this loop of learning and crazy dopamine hits when you figure out how everything works. For example, right now I'm building an HTTP server with some help from a tutorial and it's something that I've always wanted to do but seemed so complex to me and now that I am doing it I feel so dumb for not starting it before because everything makes sense now, TCP packets are just a stream of bytes in order, almost no different to reading from a file and I've been reading files for months now. I would have never realized this if I had just said ""Nah, I'm not ready."" Point is, projects only seem impossible or difficult BEFORE you start them. When you do start them and you get through that first obstacle now the project just becomes something new but super fun. So, if you know you have the resources and the fundamental knowledge to start that one project that really interests you, just do it, don't put it off for another 3 months because you think you're not ready. You have endless learning resources, so start the project and build it by solving one problem at a time and you'll be fine.",35,0.97,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1odrdwj/for_any_beginners_that_need_to_hear_this_dont_be/,2025-10-23 02:12:22,2025-10-25 01:26:49

But then i remember my interest in mobile app development. And it's always the same loop: start with one, continue with another language, and finally learn something different until the loop starts again. I do have the basic programming knowledge of loops, functions, etc. But i'm not a master of one specific language. Now i am wondering whether im even suitable for learning programming? On one hand i think yes, because the interest keeps coming back even though i took a break from it. On the other hand, no because i cant seem to focus and master one language.

1oat7wd,Game engines are great. Building without one is also great. :smiling_face_with_halo:,veesahni,learnprogramming,"My son (10 years old now) started his coding adventure with the typical things that kids use - block based tools like scratch.When he outgrew those, he moved on to learn open web technologies. His first two games were built using just HTML, CSS, JS using divs, images and sound apis. Huge learning curve, and still limited in what you can do. It didn't stop him though. More importantly, it taught him the fundamentals (arrays, variables, file management, functions, etc), and there's a lot of value in that.He wanted to do more advanced stuff, and started learning how to use canvas with requestAnimationFrame. He even started thinking about what a collision detection algorithm would look like (with the help of AI). He never passed the experimentation phase here so a game wasn't released. But he learned a lot more about the fundamentals. In all the above, he did have support & guidance from parents. So I think having the right mentorship in place is key.Along the way, he discovered a game engine (Microsoft Makecode Arcade) which, while limited, gave him so much to build on - tilemaps, input management, animations, integrated sound/image editor, gravity, etc. Suddenly, his games could become more complex. Levels, hidden sections and boss battles were all easily approachable.From my observation, picking up the game engine was easy. He already loosely knew what needed to happen, it was just a matter of figuring out how to do it in the engine.What I'm trying to say: when you want to learn to code, using a game engine on day one will speed you up, but it may also mean you're skipping some valuable fundamentals. Perhaps, instead, start smaller and explore. Learn the fundamentals and build on it until you naturally are hitting the limits and need something more powerful.My son also did a writeup on his experience using a game engine - [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/)(Disclosure -  Parents provided multiple rounds of feedback to ensure clarity and coherence of his writeup)",21,0.74,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oat7wd/game_engines_are_great_building_without_one_is/,2025-10-19 15:56:54,2025-10-25 01:26:49

So for me things like logic tables and lookup tables and circuits are quite intuitive now while I still struggle heavily to understand object oriented programming. Assembly is a pain in the ass at the beginning but the structure is nice as it is quite simple in its concepts. Being able to do a lot with less like addition and multiplication is fun.My programming setup usually starts (whatever ""language"" or similar things like LaTeX) with a text editor and two to three terminals open. One for compiling or installing libraries, one for navigating the file system and one for the editor. When I code I often struggle with small syntactic errors all the time but have way less problems with things others consider difficult. Old things like Fortran and TCL are quite intuitive for me. I usually get good results by optimizing the underlying mathematical problem by using some tricks provided by the software or hardware. I usually write very specific solutions for a given scientific problem and optimize a lot by hand first. But understanding concepts that aim to hide complexity is very difficult. I need to use the terminal to install software on Mac as I struggle with the basic pictures showing me to drag the .dmg from one folder to the next. I still have huge issues with VS code because usually the problems I get are related to git or access privileges in the background. If Mac OS was not a full blown Unix I would have been lost at work.

I do it and it shortens the codebase significantly* That reused snippet doesn't do one single thing but several things, like * uses http client to perform apicall external service * extracts json, validates it * stores some value from json to redis* So here we can see 3 responsibilities in single function with explicit logic. So it violates single responsibility principle.* I can't even come up with relevant name for that function and end up with something like `requestTokensThenExtractThenStore` which is bs name. I know it and I can't help myself.* According to that principle I should not only split this function to 3 smaller ones. I do it. And function names are good.* But what should I do with old one? Let's assume I keep it so now it transformed to chain function. All it does is just calls 3 new functions consecutively.* But hey, now old function still does 3 things, not 1. So according to SRP I need to destroy old function and in the place when it was 1 line call I need to past three lines chain in each place instead.* But hey, now we lose in reusability. Like, what if entire chain had to be called not 3-4 times but 10 or 100 times instead?So here are options.* 1 function (max-DRY, no-SRP)* 4 functions (max-DRY, mid-SRP)* 3 functions (mid-DRY, max SRP)What would you chose and where am I wrong?",3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oa8oec/srp_vs_dry/,2025-10-18 21:59:06,2025-10-25 01:26:49

I’ll probably do a master’s degree in biomedical engineering, and I’d love to work in bioinformatics.Unfortunately, that field isn’t really in demand in my country, so I may eventually have to work in cybersecurity instead. I’ve done two internships in that area, liked the work itself, and even got a job offer, but I didn’t really like the company.I’ve realized that I like programming when it has a ""clear purpose"", for example, in fields like cybersecurity, networking, or bioinformatics. I don’t really see myself in general software development roles. I don’t mean to sound offensive, English is not my first language. Sorry if I worded it wrong.I’ve been told that matlab and python are the most useful tools for bioinformatics. I’m quite comfortable with matlab (we used it a lot during my studies), but we didn’t work much with python. I’d like to buy a good python course, ideally one that includes a project I could put on my cv. Just to note, I have a solid foundation for python so I'm not really looking for beginner level courses. Does anyone have recommendations? I don’t really want to spend money on something that wouldn't help me(I'm still a broke student lol).

I have tried going to my professor during their office hours, but to no luck. I have also tried to go to my tutorial lead, but that has also not helped as they say that they cannot provide individual feedback until after an assignment has been submitted, and so I turn to you, people of Reddit, to help me get a sense of whether I am even heading in the right direction.I’ve uploaded **images of my diagram** and a **text description of the scenario** (anonymised) via Imgur links below.

1oemgrv,Reality of CS Students in this Subreddit,Fwellimort,cscareerquestions,"I have over the past few years tried to help 6 CS students more directly through Discord, etc. All of whom claimed to be grinding, etc and so forth. Here has been my thoughts on what I noticed of college students and new grads.PS: I have over a dozen of students who had DMed for help, etc as well but those have always been casual reddit chats since I don't care anymore.My thoughts on the job market:1. Job market for new grads and interns this year looks significantly better than the past 2 years.2. Offshoring is a reality which cannot be ignored. Companies are growing talent abroad now and a lot of layoffs have had their jobs moved to offshore. Unlike the past, offshore infra and talent is there. Covid 'proved' remote work works and 'offshore' == 'remote work'. Talent does not magically get better or worse depending on where the individual is located. And paying top dollar in Canada means entirely different from paying dollar in US.3. There's just too many CS majors and CS curriculums overall have become easier so schools can make more money. And there's so many CS adjacent majors sprouting left and right on top like Information Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational X, Computer Science + X, Information Systems, Informatics, Software Engineering, Business Information Management, etc.And then there's the fact a lot of Math, Physics, Statistics, Actuarial Science, etc students are minoring in CS as well. And Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, etc students all applying to CS jobs as well.The supply of candidates is essentially infinite relative to demand for new grads.4. Resumes all look similar end of day due to Chatgpt. And honestly, what can you expect out of students. These are students, not working professionals. Truth is, the most differentiating factor is school name on a resume before any work experience. That said, at the same time, the talent and quality of new grads have significantly deteriorated. The median talent is on the floor (if there even is a floor). And a lot of them seems to be due to:1. Schools dumbing down curriculums + grade inflation (easier to graduate).2. Students doing bare minimum in school and just studying for the job interviews. Hence you see students here with 2.0 GPAs showing off the interviews they have gotten.3. CS is now really mainstream unlike in the way past in which programming was thought to be for nerds.4. Modern devices have abstracted away so much that students did not have to grow up having to deal with all sorts of bugs, frustrations, etc on the Internet.5. Chatgpt. It does homework, vibe coding, etc. Why bother spending the hours?6. There is a whole industry to min-maxing CS related job interviews. And the quality is really high as well. And a lot of information which in the past might have needed weeks of research is readily available within minutes now.7. TikTok brainwashing towards the world of instant gratifications. Students just don't want to deal with long frustrating grinds that go nowhere, etc.8. A lot of students going in claim to be 'passionate' in CS but really they are just majoring in it for the money or lifestyle they heard on TikTok, Youtube, etc. Now, I think 'passionate' is cringe but .. these students are all just really doing the bare minimum. \--------Why am I saying this? Well.. while I do know Youtube is a bait, my direct experience with 6 CS students in this subreddit have largely been the same as the ones I found on Youtube.In fact, I would argue the ones on Youtube look like god talent relative to most of the 6 CS students here in this subreddit I interacted on Discord.What Youtube videos you might ask? This is from Coding Jesus Youtube channel which is extremely baity and really there for him to advertise his own site but...[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM\_3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM_3yM)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s\_ztBwg7Vls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ztBwg7Vls)Let me just say ... most of the 6 CS students in this subreddit over the years I interacted on Discord... makes those candidates look like top talent.I have come to believe that we seriously need more gatekeeping in this field. Completely agree with Coding Jesus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA) On the hiring side, most students are flat out garbage. But the problem is **student resumes despite how well done at aggregate will always look similar before actual work experience**. Hence on the company side, the only way to filter is largely by school names at aggregate. And trust me when I say this, most students at ""top schools"" nowadays are flat out garbage as well. The difference being AT LEAST the students at top schools tend to be good at Leetcode. At least that bare minimum is done.The worst part of all this is actual talent cannot be differentiated either from the rest as well. And with so much cheaters everywhere, it's just impossible to tell who is actually good from others. It has been frustrating and a huge waste of time trying to help some students here in this subreddit only to learn that they ddn't even bother to do the bare minimum. I'm sorry but if you cannot do a basic easy-medium Leetcode question and are screaming for how the world is unfair and what not claiming you have been grinding and doing everything... then you are not fit for this field. Get out.It's been a huge waste of my time and a huge eye opening over the years how bad most CS students are lately when it comes to CS. And the best part? Every one of them at the start talked as if they thought differently of themselves. But ya.. just me rambling. Just wanted to share this. Also, good luck college students with the job market. I know it's rough. My only real advice to you is .... well, look into C++ if you are serious about software engineering and want to differentiate yourself from others. Totally agree with this recruiter as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA)Note: I still am helping one of them and plan to for the next few years (been helping for two years now).

I think most bonafide engineers aren't super worried or impressed by the prior, but leadership is the one laying people off and changing internal gears.Then of course there is internal politics, general tech ego, and that entire game which has lead to not-uncommon internal blaming and resultant layoffs with someone having to take the heat.I feel bad for the 2019+ bootcamp grads that spent 5k+ on a camp to enter entry level.

Should I Start Thinking about Leaving?,Fearless-Cellist-245,cscareerquestions,"I graduated about 4 months ago and started immediately at a company I interned for. Was doing well at first but I made a pretty big mistake last week. I pushed a bad PR and commits that caused some issues to an important branch. Nothing in prod was affected but a couple engineers had to spend a day or two fixing my mistake and it did end up being a high priority issue that blocked some people. Mostly everyone was nice except a devops engineer who found the issue and was thorough about letting everyone know in every chat that I was the cause of the block. So its pretty well known to everyone that I messed up big-time. I merged a PR to the wrong branch without getting a review because I thought it wasnt required for this branch. I wouldnt usually be worried but we did have layoffs recently and I know an Eng2 who did get laid off during that cycle due to ""performance issues."" So this has me thinking im on the top of the list for the next lay offs. Maybe its best to get ahead of this now and start interviewing at other companies sooner than later?

Was about a 20k bump over my current role so I decided to jump in.Here’s how it went:1.) External Lead Recruiter conversation2.) External Business Partner conversation (direct report of #1)3.) Take-home assignment via Coderbyte4.) Discussion with CTO, including reviewing my takehome5.) Live leetcoding round - 2 engineers6.) Live system design round - 2 engineers7.) Behavioral interview - 1 QA engineer, 1 implementation engineer, 1 product managerAt this point, I figured I was just about done and was about to receive an offer.No - I then received a message about them wanting me to meet their CEO for a “quick chat” - fine. As I prepare for that, I then receive another message that they just hired a new Head of Engineering and they would like me to meet with them BEFORE the CEO.Insane, right? But the market is the market so I persevere.As I await the meeting with the Head of Engineering today, I get a call from the recruiter informing me that there was a “miscommunication” and that they will not hire in my state, NOR the one I plan to move to in a few weeks! (Florida -> Illinois) I was completely transparent about my location/relocation, with my current location being on my resume and LinkedIn (where they found me). The fact that this was not internally discussed prior to me going through the whole process is extremely inconsiderate of my and other candidates’ time.Extremely frustrating, but hey, maybe I dodged a bullet. If they are this disorganized during interviewing, it would probably be a nightmare to work for.

I suppose I could do a better job of not ""accepting"" his answer and trying to make my point clearer but anyway we are kinda past that.The other problem is that I've become a defacto project manager. My manager has told me to assign work to other team members and I've had to create a ""second standup"" outside of my main teams standup where we go over the tickets related to this project. My manager has set an aggressive timeline to deliver this project but I'm seeing that we will not be able to deliver it on his timeline and now I'm getting yelled at for delays. I wasn't really expecting to become a project manager for this role, I don't know how to go about dealing my manager who told me in a 1:1 that he would ""rather die than deliver this project late""Any advice would be appreciated. On the one hand I'm thinking I can use this opportunity to learn about project management etc however I've started doing the ""project manager"" role really close to the deadline so now I'm getting people up to speed etc while we are expecting to go into production asap.

Any advice?,krisko612,cscareerquestions,"I held three different SWE positions at a prominent tech company for the past 8+ years but was unfortunately laid off in January. I’ve been sending out my resume all over the place but I’m struggling to get a lot of bites.I’m a back-end engineer who specializes in C#, .Net and some SQL, however I’m finding that a lot of the companies I’ve been applying for demand full-stack, but the problem is that I have very little UX experience. I had been meaning to get more into that while I was on my job, but I was never really given an opportunity to learn.I started a React course a couple of months ago but I’m having a difficult time maintaining my interest in it. I’m almost considering abandoning my job search and just focusing on the course just to get it done, but even then I’ll still have fairly minimal experience with React.The best results I’ve had so far have been individuals from recruiting companies pinging me on LinkedIn. Most of the time this results in me sending a resume to them for a contract job. I’ve had a few seem really promising but then ghost me after I get the resume. This last week I got in touch with a contractor who was looking for a position that just so happened to be with my first team at the tech company. They fast-tracked me into an interview that ran for far longer than it should have, and actually ran over what was supposed to be a second interview. The recruiter told me they would reschedule the second interview but I haven’t heard back from them. The team wants to have someone in the role by the end of this week but now I fear that even they might not be willing to take me back, even though they have my receipts, are probably using my code, and should know what I’m capable of.Any advice?

PossibleLack of talent / skill? Possible (this hurts the most)My first website was a Joomla-Drupal website (PHP/HTML/CSS) back in...2006! I was spending my christmas holidays as CS student trying to fix CSS issues and launch my ""unique idea"" (it kind of was but I had no idea how to monetize or grow at my 22 years).A career came relatively easy in the richer northern EU countries with plenty of corporate, slow paced jobs (cruising/rest and vest) (without really vesting anything - no stocks).Looking back I probably wasted my first 5 years of work with minor skill building in CSS. I did get pretty good in CSS though.Enter JS hype circa 2015. I Suddenly realize I was a pixel pusher / HTML-CSS guy who barely understood how jQuery worked and my JS skills were close to 0. hoisting? closures? MVVM? wtf are you talking about? I can tell you whats the difference of relative/absolute positioning and the box model, but you're not really interested are you?A lack of effort in personal projects, lack of studying the proper material, and a choice of relatively comfortable jobs that did not use Angular/Backbone or React (early days) meant I stayed behind.Around 2017 I realize I need to do something. I start grinding JS problems, non stop interviewing, codewars, and other learning platforms. I get into my first full time VueJS projects after a whiteboard recursion test and a coding challenge. Only problem: I hated the role, the product, and the people. I get into two more gigs in VueJS projects for a period of a total of 6 years in Vue. And that means: I get left out of the ReactJS game. One more thing to play catchup on.I wake up on morning and realize it's been 15 years I am coding professionally. Most of the peers I've worked with are in Lead, Senior Manager, Investor (!!) roles.I'm still doing take home code challenges, leetcode live interviews - to which I suck -, and struggling to get decent Senior SE roles.I keep interviewing, and something lands on my lap: I take over the tech of a startup without engineers. NextJS, Mongo, AWS, the whole shebang. I m getting good at harder concepts. Do a little of AWS, deployments, backend. AI is happening, this helps. But I hate the product, and I'm working for half the salary I was making before. I get a contract at a FinTech which paid double. 3 months later I'm let go because of ""reasons"".the job market shitshow is here. The TRUMP / Putin / War / Interest Rate bullshit all are happening.

1oc6n0s,Is this normal for 2 juniors who are hired together?,bikinbaebuatcurhat,cscareerquestions,"So I'm a junior cloud engineer, working for around a year now in my first job straight out of uni. I was hired with another junior, but he has a masters and 2 prior years of work experience so I was hired for my ""potential"" whereas he was actually selected for his skillset too. I have no problem with that, I'm happy to learn and grow as fast as I can. My manager however, seemingly doesn't want me to forget how much better he is than me. Here are some things that have been said during our 1-on-1s, without me ever mentioning him (for the story's sake, we'll call him Tyler).""You're doing well, you don't need to compare yourself with Tyler."" I never was.""You are doing your tasks and learning a lot of things, *it's not super great but that's what we expect from you*. Of course we can't expect for you to be an expert. Tyler is different, he has had experience before""""You are real junior here to be honest, if Tyler applied for a mid level role he would've gotten in, we just hired him as a way to get him in the company. So don't worry about him.""""You are an early career experiment, we want to see how we can develop people from zero, but Tyler is not really a junior to be honest""Amongst other things. I don't know if I'm just being sensitive to some very normal or mildly negative feedback, but I just don't understand how I'm supposed to respond to these. I feel like I'm having my inferiority drilled in to me again and again, even when me and Tyler are not working in even remotely similar things. I also find it not productive to have him as an arbitrary benchmark, and spend less time focusing on my performance and growth in isolation. My other coworkers are actually giving me plenty of props and good feedback and think I'm learning super fast, but I feel like I'm not perceived as good as I would've been by my manager if Tyler wasn't working alongside. If I was hired for my potential, then why don't we spend most of our attention maximizing it?Another annoying thing is our objective setting. We've done this process twice now. The first time, I made mine quite compact and Tyler made his more elaborated. Our manager said ""we could make yours a bit more like Tyler's, see how he made his a little clearer?"". Yup, absolutely. That makes sense.But the next cycle, he had his very short. Almost lazy. It was literally just a bullet point of the stacks he wants to learn and get to work with. Whereas I elaborated on mine more specifically. But guess what? ""We can make it similar to Tyler's one just so its easier.""So what the hell. I get that he's older, more educated, more experienced and most importantly, he's a he. I don't want to link these treatments to me being the only girl in the team and the youngest member by a lot, but I can't help to think those things play a part.Or, alternatively, I could be overthinking and these are perfectly normal parts of a manager's evaluations. In which case Im happy to learn to get used to it and move on with my life.I have recently had a hiring manager reach out to me for a position in a different company. I've cleared a few interview rounds and they've said they're willing to offer me a 20% pay raise, with a sign on bonus and stock which I don't currently get at my company. I don't wanna leave my current place for some other reasons that compensate the lower pay, but if this treatment isn't normal I might just consider leaving. However, that also lets me know that I don't suck, so I'm really not sure of what to think anymore now.",67,0.9,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oc6n0s/is_this_normal_for_2_juniors_who_are_hired/,2025-10-21 07:35:50,2025-10-25 01:26:50

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.Every time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.Back in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.I’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.The good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.Has anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?Thanks for reading.

I am not in the US/UK ecosystem (S.Europe here) so I am trying to be relatively picky with my choices (I am getting less picky as we go of course).I recently was rejected after delivering a coding assignment - following two very nice (good vibes) calls with the two founders of a startup.Here is the weird part. I am pretty confident on my delivery. The assignment had a lot business detail, one had to think of what it actually needed - but thanks to AI - I delivered. Finishing touches mine, and I was prepared to answer any questions about the code. We even had a follow-up call planned to talk about the challenge.24 hours later, I receive the most generic rejection message ever - nothing about the challenge , and a cancellation of the follow-up call. I've messaged the guy who I was in touch with - and he wrote something super abstract like ""we wanted to see how you would approach the problem"" and ""we didnt see the depth we were looking for"". (honestly I dont buy it)I accidentally noticed that one of their engineers was stalking my Linkedin Profile a few hours before the rejection mail arrived. I was generally vocal about the ""AI Bubble"" and I am wondering if the fact that their business was AI-driven had something to do with it?The other thing I am thinking is that the guy who visited my profile only did so after I spoke with the two founders so he decided for one or the other reason I am not a good fit - so they had nothing to say about the code by itself.Needless to say this is a brutal market, and I have never seen so challenging interview processes, so lengthy filtering mechanisms. I happen to also be in a relatively small market so this might have to do with it. Remote gigs are harder to find these days.What the heck should I do? I am not a top 10% coder but I'm good enough for most normal businesses. I don't grind Leetcode, and I do suffer from live coding brain freeze which I am trying to battle by doing a lot of live coding interviews. But it is \_very\_ easy for an interviewer to find reasons to reject you.I have excellent soft skill presentation, most recruiters / HR folk are super happy with me, I present myself in an excellent manner.The other day I was prepared to answer a specific live coding challenge following tips from the recruiter. I did it async before the call, almost memorized it.During live coding it, I froze because the API wasnt returning the response I was thinking it would. It took me like 5' to solve the bug.Rejected",33,0.88,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1od59p0/one_more_senior_engineer_who_cant_land_a_job/,2025-10-22 11:08:19,2025-10-25 01:26:50

1oborb7,Am I crazy for considering leaving my current job to join the Navy?,ElDumbminican,cscareerquestions,"For context, I’m a 22M recent grad (graduated May 2025) and am working at a F500 insurance company making ~80,000 as a software engineer. I interned at this company during my senior year, and pretty much joined full time right after graduation (I had maybe a week off).The company is amazing. The work life balance is great, my coworkers and boss are great, and the pay isn’t bad (especially considering I still live with my parents in a low cost of living area). I’m nearby most of my friends and have a very healthy life outside of work with multiple hobbies.Yet I can’t help but feel like something feels missing. My job is right next to my house where I grew up (10 min commute) and I went to school in state only 30 ish minutes away. I feel like I haven’t seen or done anything and am missing out. I know I’m in a situation some would envy, but I just feel… bored?I’ve always been interested in the idea of joining the military, but have obviously heard horror stories about it too (hence why I never joined). But just today I was having a casual conversation with the lead engineer and he told me about his experiences in the Navy. All of the fun he had, all of the minor trouble he got into, the places he’s been, etc… It honestly sounded like a fun adventure and he said he hasn’t regretted a second of it. And obviously it didn’t impact his career negatively as he’s the lead engineer in our team.So I guess the TL:DR is, am I crazy for considering leaving my current job to join as an Officer in the Navy/Air Force? What tech skills will I learn and how will it impact me in the future? Obviously I had my lead engineer as a resource, but I want to get a broader set of opinions too that may not be biased by previous experiences.",27,0.63,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oborb7/am_i_crazy_for_considering_leaving_my_current_job/,2025-10-20 17:50:52,2025-10-25 01:26:50
1oaz1ii,Should I even switch job now?,SoulflareRCC,cscareerquestions,"New grad almost 1 year into my first job. Joined because of the good pay & perks, but I slowly found out my team is a hot mess: no testing, no docs, no staging environment, no ci/cd, a bunch of tech debt and v1/2/3/4/5 to maintain at the same time, stagnant product, team lack of clear direction on what to do next...Very low productivity on everything like oncall, bug fix, project launch, etc, due to all these issues. More importantly, I don't seem to learn much on the job, it's all pretty repetitive work.I panicked and thought my career growth is gonna be nonexistent, so I started spraying resume to all the new grad positions blindly several months ago, I was able to get 1-2 offers from some other large company, the pay is on-par with my current company, the work seems more interesting to me, and I signed the offers. But now I'm a bit scared when I actually think about job switching. My manager and my colleagues like me, and my manager is promising a promo in 1-2 years (i know this can be bs), seems like most junior engineers get promoted pretty fast. WLB is ok too.I chatted with my friends, and it seems like they are all not getting much learning in their job, and it sounds like dealing with a hot mess is a norm in this industry, doesn't that defeat my original purpose for job switching?

My team members, while good people, are generally junior or mid-level, and honestly, they often just want to get tasks done with minimal effort. * Code Quality: The code I review is frequently poor—written just to pass the ticket, not to be clean or maintainable. * Stagnation Fear: When I do code reviews, I often worry that I'm not just failing to grow, but actually regressing. I have no one more experienced than me in frontend to learn from, which makes me feel professionally trapped. * The Dilemma: My role is to mentor them (which I try to do through detailed code reviews and discussions), but constantly dealing with low-quality code makes me paranoid that I'm absorbing bad habits myself.The ChallengeI need advice on how to combat this feeling of stagnation and ensure I keep growing my skills (especially technical ones like architecture and modern patterns).Crucially, I have very little time outside of work for side projects or intense studying. I need strategies to develop myself during work hours within the confines of my current role and project.My Questions for the Community * In-Job Development: What are the most effective ways for a senior/lead to force their own growth technically when surrounded by less-experienced developers, especially when time after work is scarce? (e.g., specific code review tactics, using project architecture as a growth tool, etc.) * Market Strategy: Given the competitive nature of the current tech job market (layoffs, high competition for senior roles): * When is the right time to leave? Should I wait until I can find a role that guarantees working with better talent? * How do I best position my current leadership role (leading a small team, improving code quality) for interviews at top-tier companies that value deep technical expertise? * Mindset: How do you mentally cope with being the ""only source of truth"" and avoid the burnout/frustration that comes from constantly correcting fundamental issues?Thanks in advance for any insights on maintaining momentum and making a strategic career move!",13,0.93,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oed3f9/senior_frontend_developer_8_yoe_feeling_stagnant/,2025-10-23 19:45:14,2025-10-25 01:26:50
1od7qkn,Am I crazy to consider leaving stable job in this market?,Caladbolgll,cscareerquestions,"SDE2 of 7 YoE. I've been reorg'd to my current team 1.5 years ago, and it's been a nightmare. I'm not interested in my team's product, state of engineering wants to pull your hair out, and my manager is borderline toxic. WLB is great and I love my people (outside of my manager), but I've felt incredibly stagnant in my career for awhile and feel miserable. I've been on a burnout for months that's been gradually increasing, and I know that things won't significantly improve anytime soon. I've originally planned to find a position within the company to transfer internally, and it's been 3 months since I started browsing around. Now, it feels like I might be better off to take a full plunge and prep for interviewing other companies for few reasons:1. I've been having golden handcuff, but my salary is tanking hard in less than a year once my 4 year RSU runs out. At that point, I'm only losing a modest amount of salary to jump ship to other company's SDE2 position (according to levels.fyi). That's not even considering a slim chance that I make the hiring bar for senior in some companies. There is no path for promotion within my current company for awhile, anyways. I've saved enough to last for awhile.2. Due to the company policy, it's practically impossible for me to transfer internally for another half a year without painting myself a target. Honestly unsure if my mental health will remain sane until then.3. I've been on GC process for a bit (completed I-140 w/ EB3 using TN). Given the state of current administration, it's very unlikely that mine will be processed in a reasonable time. Might as well keep the priority date and resume as EB-2 at another company.4. Tied to GC process above, I can only internally transfer to positions within my city. I'm on a branch office away from HQ, and the options are pretty small. I don't have much things to bind me to the city outside of GC process, and am honestly okay relocating.5. I've been border locked for the entire year, and will continue to be so until GC is approved - immigration attorney strongly advises not to travel internationally. Not only does changing company mostly address that risk (since I'll have to restart with PERM), it gives me an option to get a sizeable amount of vacation in-between jobs. I've been dying to travel abroad again, albeit this is not a big reason to sabotage anything on my job. I'm leaving the team in the earliest opportunity for sure. I just need to choose between finding an internal position within my current city and company, or fully commit to searching outside. I've heard many anecdotes of how terrible the job market is now, how insane the hiring bars are. The uncertainty with recession also adds a risk of layoffs, which tends to target less contributing employees including new hires.Am I crazy to consider jumping ship in this market?",12,0.75,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1od7qkn/am_i_crazy_to_consider_leaving_stable_job_in_this/,2025-10-22 13:05:32,2025-10-25 01:26:50
1oayayz,Am I underperforming or just in a tough setup?,yaraisnotsodark,cscareerquestions,"Good day devs! I’ve been working as a junior software dev (2 YOE) for a couple months now. It’s just me and my boss. He’s an ex-Reddit engineer with ~15 years of experience, and I come from a web background.We’re building a pretty big multi-app Flutter + Firebase project using Clean Architecture, which is all new to me. The main struggle I’m having is that I rarely get clear requirements. Usually I’ll get something like:“We need a chat box that can also record audio.”And that’s it. From there, I’m expected to figure out everything — UX, architecture, edge cases, and make it up to his standards.He doesn’t really walk me through the context or help clarify requirements; I usually just get feedback once I open my first PR. My PRs almost never meet expectations on the first few goes, and sometimes I make rookie mistakes (like forgetting to rebase), which makes me feel even worse. His feedback can be pretty blunt, too.Because I’m still learning Flutter, Firebase, and the project structure, things take me a long time — sometimes weeks for a single feature. Even when I do understand the requirements, like for the Auth flow I’m finishing now, it’s still slow progress.I’m trying hard to improve, but it’s been rough. During my interview, I said I perform above the average junior — and he’s holding me to that, which is fair. But right now I feel like I’m constantly falling short, and I can’t tell if that’s because I’m actually underperforming… or because this setup would be tough for anyone at my level.So I guess my question is:Is this kind of setup (basically no guidance, just tasks and expectations) normal for a junior? am I genuinely underperforming? And if you’ve been in a similar spot, what helped you get through it?TLDR:I’m a 2 YOE junior dev working under a super-senior ex-Reddit engineer. I get very vague task descriptions (e.g. “build a chat box that records audio”) and have to figure everything out myself — UX, architecture, edge cases, etc. I’m learning a new stack (Flutter + Firebase + Clean Arch), so progress is slow and feedback is tough.

1of0yyo,I may need to pivot ASAP. I need work life balance for future family planning.,crescentmoon101,cscareerquestions,"I was recently laid off and have applied to hundreds of jobs in the last couple of weeks. I have gotten very few responses, just a couple of local short-term contract jobs with no PTO (got ghosted for those roles too). I'm super early in my job search, so I know it might just take time to hear back from some companies.When I was laid off, I was trying to conceive with my husband for a couple of months, so this was a really bad time for me to lose my job. I have 3.5 years of experience working with mostly Vue and TypeScript. I did learn React at bootcamp and have been diving back into studying it since I know it's in higher demand. The thing is, I don't think I can mentally handle the grind in this field. When I first started out, I was hungry, driven, ambitious, and excited to code. I was extremely lucky to land a job 2 months after graduating from bootcamp, and tech was a lot easier to break into. Now I'm in my 30s, I want kids, and I don't have as much motivation to hustle.As much as I love coding, I don't love the concept of having to grind constantly when I want to focus on family building and family life. Just the process of getting through dev interviews feels insane right now. Grinding leetcode, memorizing a ton of system design questions, doing tons of projects to practice different technologies, going through several rounds of interviews, only to possibly get rejected at the last stage? And then maybe having to do it ALL over again if you get laid off a year or 2 later? I've been studying my ass off the past few weeks and it got me thinking, if I'm finding this super exhausting now with no kids, how the hell am I gonna do this again if I were to get laid off again with a toddler or 2? Yes I would of course have support from my husband, but I don't know if it's realistic for me personally to constantly be trying to hustle at work, hustle while being laid off, and be a parent to young children. I keep seeing posts from people who have been laid off multiple times in a year and the idea of having to go through the interview process more than once in a year sounds horrible. Plus, I SUCK at leetcode. I'm a great dev, but leetcode has always been a weakness of mine.Does anyone have any ideas of where I could pivot in tech? I want to learn more about roles that don't require such stressful interview processes.

I recently failed to pass final rounds for a couple companies, the one I got feedback from they told me I ""didn't have the complexity or scope"" in my prior roles that the hiring manager was looking for. This is something I was afraid of going in to the behavioral interviews. I have about 2.5 years of total experience, with a little over 2 at Amazon and 6 mo. on a consulting project (which was a wash because I had to take a personal leave for most of it). I didn't get a chance to show much initiative at Amazon, and the projects assigned to me were small in scope, usually solitary, and not all that technically complex. I have found ways to force them to fit a handful of scenarios, but I just don't have enough content to cover all the possible questions. On top of that it's been so long that I can't remember enough detail about my work or team interactions when an interviewer drills down on a project/topic (in retrospect I should have kept a work diary for reference). I end up having to improvise, which always goes poorly and I feel like I'm coming off as a fraud. What should I do for behavioral interviews going forward? Should I just admit to interviewers that I haven't gotten to do much and want a chance to prove myself? Make up embellishments to my experience? Find a new career?

I’m looking to learn and grow more as an engineer, but a little worried about getting worked like a dog at Zoox lol. I’ve also only ever worked at the one huge company I currently work at, so an environment like Intuit is probably what I’m more used to.Thoughts? Have you worked at either company? What would you do if you were me? Thanks in advance y’all!",6,0.87,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oddinl/zoox_or_intuit/,2025-10-22 16:45:23,2025-10-25 01:26:50
1of28q1,I don't have a lot of good things to talk about inside my experience or projects? Am I not good enough for this field?,shade_blade,cscareerquestions,"I've kind of been feeling very demotivated and stuck, I got a few calls recently but they didn't go anywhere (said ""you'll hear by the end of the week"" and then got nothing). It's better than getting nothing like before but it still is effectively nothing. It just doesn't feel like I have anything ""compelling"" to say about any of my experience and I don't know how to get that good experience. I've been spending all day every day doing ""nothing"" (working on projects that are still unpresentable, sending applications that mostly go nowhere), I don't know what I should be doing at all. Everything I do feels like the wrong answer no matter what. Working on the projects I already have feels useless as they are not presentable (they visually look bad, they are not profitable at this moment, and have absolutely no real technical challenges to them at all)I don't feel like I have any ""difficult"" or ""interesting"" projects to show people, like I don't have anything difficult to show how I struggled because everything I did always felt ""easy"" or it always becomes ""easy"" in hindsight. Even if something took a long time to fix or figure out, in hindsight it is always easy so hiring people will see it as being easy too so I can't really talk about them being struggles. It looks badly on me if I talk about how I figured out how to find the assembly code that touches some struct value for a game mod, because any IDE nowadays would have that same functionality just 2 clicks away. And it's not really impressive for me to build a menu or web page or a web server because those are standard basic level things. It's also not impressive for me to implement some algorithm or use some API because applying some algorithm someone else already wrote is not applying my own thinking and using some API is just using someone else's code which is not impressive to do. Making my own variant chess engine isn't impressive because it's just me following a preset list of things to do to make the engine (and the new stuff is not technically difficult to do as it's more of the same techniques that I am not a pioneer of) So in any case everything I've done is not impressive, any half competent developer could do anything I've done and they would probably do it faster and better in every way.Interview / call wise I don't really know how to improve, I always feel like I give short answers but I don't know how to make them longer without rambling about useless things? (Like I can't tell them about every individual class I took in response to ""tell me about yourself""). I don't know the way to ""fluff up"" my answers to impress them, it feels like if I try too hard it just backfires on me (like if I hype up some web page up as the best thing ever but in reality it looks like the default CSS styling (Graphic design is not my passion) it makes me look stupid). I don't even have real answers for some of the questions they have, like I can't talk about any conflicts I had with others (internships were basically me working alone on projects, class projects never had any big blowups that I was the one fixing everything completely) or talk about something I had difficulty learning about to build a project (it looks bad on me if I talk about learning something ""basic"" but I don't know anything too ""advanced""?)Maybe I'm just not cut out for this field as the standards have gotten so much higher nowadays? Looking at another recent post about how bad current CS grads are there are questions that other people failed that I don't know the complete answer to without looking up the exact specifics. I don't memorize the exact programming language / package versions I use (and I'm not exactly using cutting edge features or the most esoteric library functions either). (I know it's just like project settings or looking at compiler settings but it isn't something I have memorized which I'm supposed to be doing?). I also don't have memorized exactly how the programming languages are implemented (like where exactly a method in a class is stored in python? I know it probably ends up in code memory and internally there is some data structure corresponding to that class and some kind of data structure for the references to the methods of the class, but I don't know the exact specifics like which specific implementation of methods and classes it is using internally)",4,0.84,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1of28q1/i_dont_have_a_lot_of_good_things_to_talk_about/,2025-10-24 16:23:34,2025-10-25 01:26:50
1of21uw,Late CS grad,throwawayblaaaaaahhh,cscareerquestions,"I'm set to graduate in about a year from now, at 25 yo with a CS degree, and am getting concerned about the possible job prospects available to me. It feels late to only be concerned now, and I probably should have been more concerned when I was 21/22, but that ship has sailed now and this is my current situation. How much work should I start doing outside of my coursework? I have no projects or do any kind of leetcode coding, so all I have is a degree really.",5,0.78,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1of21uw/late_cs_grad/,2025-10-24 16:16:21,2025-10-25 01:26:50
1oen6h1,"More job openings for less experienced developers, but are they genuinely planning to hire?",Ok_Practice_6702,cscareerquestions,"I have been seeing a lot of companies reduce their requirements even for senior roles, and companies claiming to be open to entry level candidates. However, in the past I have also seen times where staffing firms had clients claim they were wanting to add a lot of new developers only to say that the roles didn't materialize. That happened to me in one project where a couple months in the client needed to cut labor costs and what they planned to be four main hubs in North American for in office work, they cut more than half and it became nearly all remote and offshore developers. Part of me wants to be more motivated with the positive news that I'm seeing all these new jobs being posted without ridiculous requirements, but the other part is very skeptical and thinking they're just stacking up potential candidates that they are banking on possibly needing if the financial outlook of the industry improves before the end of the year. I was hired for a project at the beginning of November last year, and by mid-January most of our team was not only done with user stories, but backlog stories, and a lot of our time was watching Udemy videos and playing pickleball until they told us our team wasn't needed like they projected as we had seven people working on a few user stories per day that only needed one person on each.",4,0.83,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oen6h1/more_job_openings_for_less_experienced_developers/,2025-10-24 03:17:56,2025-10-25 01:26:50
1oecbdh,Previous boss has a new startup idea. Advice?,Cosmic0blivion,cscareerquestions,"Some back story:A few years ago I started working for a company that was pretty small. The people were nice, I was well taken care of, owners and management were generous. We landed big clients and the company was eventually bought out for a good sum of money (at least 2 million). The owners generously gave us a big bonus for the buyout and even negotiated that we keep our jobs for at least 2 years with the new company. After the period we were eventually let go and found new jobs elsewhere.Yesterday I got a message from my old boss asking if id be interested in working on something on the side. I said id be interested in thinking about it, but my life is busy right now. They said theyd work around my schedule. I'm interested in hearing them out, but im wondering what i should ask for compensation. Development could possibly be split by another dev. And i would only be providing dev work. I'm not hurting for money, but im certainly not going to turn it down lol. Im sure they will probably offer me a wage or lump sum when we hit MVP, but Im more so wondering if i should ask for a share of profits. And if so how much? I should probably hear about the idea first before i decide, but they're smart people, so I have a feeling this idea could be profitable as well.",5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oecbdh/previous_boss_has_a_new_startup_idea_advice/,2025-10-23 19:14:37,2025-10-25 01:26:50
