1l3x7vk,A disaster waiting to happen,kerokero134340,dataengineering,"TLDR; My company wants to replace our pipelines with some all-in-one “AI agent” platformI’m a lone data engineer in a mid-size retail/logistics company that runs SAP ERP (moving to HANA soon). Historically, every department pulled SAP data into Excel, calculated things manually, and got conflicting numbers. I was hired into a small analytics unit to centralize this. I’ve automated data pulls from SAP exports, APIs, scrapers, and built pipelines into SQL Server. It’s traceable, consistent, and used regularly.Now, our new CEO wants to “centralize everything” and “go AI-driven” by bringing in a no-name platform that offers:\- Limited source connectors for a basic data lake/warehouse setup\- A simple SQL interface + visualization tools\- And the worst of it all: an AI agent PER DEPARTMENTEach department will have its own AI “instance” with manually provided business context. Example: “This is how finance defines tenure,” or “Sales counts revenue like this.” Then managers are supposed to just ask the AI for a metric, and it will generate SQL and return the result. Supposedly, this will replace 95–97% of reporting, instantly (and the CTO/CEO believe it).Obviously, I’m extremely skeptical:\- Even with perfect prompts and context, if the underlying data is inconsistent (e.g. rehire dates in free text, missing fields, label mismatches), the AI will silently get it wrong.\- There’s no way to audit mistakes, so if a number looks off, it’s unclear who’s accountable. If a manager believes it, it may go unchallenged.\- The answer to every flaw from them is: “the context was insufficient” or “you didn’t prompt it right.” That’s not sustainable or realistic\- Also some people (probs including me) will have to manage and maintain all the departmental context logic, deal with messy results, and take the blame when AI gets it wrong.\- Meanwhile, we already have a working, auditable, centralized system that could scale better with a real warehouse and a few more hires. They just don't want to hire a team or I have to convince them somehow (bc they think that this is a cheaper, more efficient alternative).I’m still relatively new in this company and I feel like I’m not taken seriously, but I want to push back before we go too far, I'll switch jobs probably soon anyway but I'm actually concerned about my team.How do I convince the management that this is a bad idea?",203,0.97,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l3x7vk/a_disaster_waiting_to_happen/,2025-06-05 11:52:01,2025-06-09 01:48:44

1l16xzj,Data Engineer Career Path,Fredonia1988,dataengineering,"Hey all, I lurk in this sub daily. I’m looking for advice / thoughts / brutally honest opinions on how to move my career forward. About me: 37 year old senior data engineer of 5 years, senior data analyst of about 10 years, 15 years in total working with data. Been at it since college. I have a bachelors degree in economics and a handful of certs including AWS solutions architect associate. I am married with a 1 year old, planning on having at least one more (I think this family info is relevant bc lifestyle plays into career decisions, like the one I’m trying to make). Live / work in Austin, TX. I love data engineering, and I do want to further my career in the role, but am apprehensive given all the AI f*ckery about. I have basically nailed it down to three options:1. Get a masters in CS or AI. I actually do really like the idea of this. I enjoy math, the theory and science, and having a graduate degree is an accolade I want out of life (at least I think). What holds me back: I will need to take some extra pre-req courses and will need to continue working while studying. I anticipate a 5 year track for this (and about $15-20k). This will also be difficult while raising a family. And more pertinently, does this really protect me from AI? I think it will definitely help in the medium term, but who knows if it’d be worth it ten years from now. 2. Continue pressing on as a data engineer, and try to bump up to Staff and then maybe move into some sort of management role. I definitely want the staff position, but ugh being a manager does not feel like my forte. I’ve done it before as an Analytics Manager and hated it. Granted, I was much younger then, and the team I managed was not the most talented. So my last experience is probably not very representative. 3. Get out of Data Engineering and move into something like Sales Engineering. This is a bit out of left field, but I think something like this is probably the best bet to future proof my tech career without an advanced degree. Personally, I haven’t had a full-on sales role before, but the sales thing is kind of in my blood, as my parents and family were quite successful in sales roles. I do enjoy people, and think I could make a successful tech salesman, given my experience as a data engineer. After reading this, what do you feel might be a good path for me? One or the other, a mix of both? I like the idea of going for the masters in CS and moving into Sales Engineering afterwards. Overall I am eager to learn and advance while also being mindful of the future changes coming to the industry (all industries really).

1l1ubll,"Data Engineer Feeling Lost: Is This Consulting Norm, or Am I Doing It Wrong?",human_disaster_92,dataengineering,"I'm at a point in my career where I feel pretty lost and, honestly, a bit demotivated. I'm hoping to get some outside perspective on whether what I'm going through is just 'normal' in consulting, or if I'm somehow attracting all the least desirable projects.I've been working at a tech consulting firm (or 'IT services company,' as I'd call it) for 3 years, supposedly as a Data Engineer. And honestly, my experiences so far have been... peculiar.”My first year was a baptism by fire. I was thrown into a legacy migration project, essentially picking up mid-way after two people suddenly left the company. This meant I spent my days migrating processes from unreadable SQL and Java to PySpark and Python. The code was unmaintainable, full of bad practices, and the PySpark notebooks constantly failed because, obviously, they were written by people with no real Spark expertise. Debugging that was an endless nightmare.Then, a small ray of light appeared: I participated in a project to build a data platform on AWS. I had to learn Terraform on the fly and worked closely with actual cloud architects and infrastructure engineers. I learned a ton about infrastructure as code and, finally, felt like I was building something useful and growing professionally. I was genuinely happy!But the joy didn't last. My boss decided I needed to move to something ""more data-oriented"" (his words). And that's where I am now, feeling completely demoralized.Currently, I'm on a team working with Microsoft Fabric, surrounded by Power BI folks who have very little to no programming experience. Their philosophy is ""low-code for everything,"" with zero automation. They want to build a Medallion architecture and ingest over 100 tables, using one Dataflow Gen2 for EACH table. Yes, you read that right.This translates to:- Monumental development delays.- Cryptic error messages and infernal debugging (if you've ever tried to debug a Dataflow Gen2, you know what I mean).- A strong sense that we're creating massive technical debt from day one.I've tried to explain my vision, pushed for the importance of automation, reducing technical debt, and improving maintainability and monitoring. But it's like talking to a wall. It seems the technical lead, whose background is solely Power BI, doesn't understand the importance of these practices nor has the slightest intention of learning.I feel like, instead of progressing, I'm actually moving backward professionally. I love programming with Python and PySpark, and designing robust, automated solutions. But I keep landing on ETL projects where quality is non-existent, and I see no real value in what we're doing—just ""quick fixes and shoddy work.""I have the impression that I haven't experienced what true data engineering is yet, and that I'm professionally devaluing myself in these kinds of environments.My main questions are:- Is this just my reality as a Data Engineer in consulting, or is there a path to working on projects with good practices and real automation?- How can I redirect my career to find roles where quality code, automation, and robust design are valued?- Any advice on how to address this situation with my current company (if there's any hope) or what to actively look for in my next role?Any similar experiences, perspectives, or advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

There are many students enrolled now, and very few coaches are available. Sometimes, the availability of the coaches is more than 2 weeks away.- Coaches and their teams response time is quite slow. Sometimes the coaches don’t even respond. Only 1:1 was a good experience.- Sometimes the group sessions gets cancelled with no prior information, and they provide no platform to check if the session will begin or not.- Job application process and their follow ups are below average. They did not follow the job location preference and where just randomly appling to any DE role irrespective of which level you belong to.- For the job applications, they initially showed a list of referrals supported, but were not using that during the application process.

The message is encoded based on row order, so the data itself remains unaltered.The payload can be recovered even if some rows are modified or deleted, thanks to a combination of Reed-Solomon and fountain codes. You only need a fraction of the original dataset—regardless of which part—to recover the payload.For example, I managed to hide a 128×128 image in a Parquet file containing 100,000 rows.I believe this could be used to watermark a Parquet file with a signature for authentication and tracking. The payload can still be retrieved even if the file is converted to CSV or SQL.That said, the payload is easy to remove by simply reshuffling all the rows. However, if you maintain the original order using a column such as an ID, the encoding will remain intact.Here’s the package, called Steganodf (like steganography for DataFrames :) )::link: https://github.com/dridk/steganodfLet me know what you think!",29,0.97,1,https://github.com/dridk/steganodf,2025-06-03 00:16:25,2025-06-09 01:48:44

1l2fuol,How do I build great data infrastructure and team?,Famous-Spring-1428,dataengineering,"I recently finished my degree in Computer Science and worked part-time throughout my studies, including on many personal projects in the data domain. I’m very confident in my technical skills: I can (and have) built large systems and my own SaaS projects. I know all the ins and outs of the basic data-engineering tools, SQL, Python, Pandas, PySpark, and have experience with the entire software-engineering stack (Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, even front-end). I also have a solid grasp of statistics.About a year ago, I was hired at a company that had previously outsourced all IT to external firms. I got the job through the CEO of a company where I’d interned previously. He’s now the CTO of this new company and is building the entire IT department from scratch. The reason he was hired is to transform this traditional company, whose industry is being significantly disrupted by tech, into a “tech” company. You can really tell the CEO cares about that: in a little over one year, we’ve grown to 15+ developers, and the culture has changed a lot.I now have the privilege of being trusted with the responsibility of building the entire data infrastructure from scratch. I have total authority over all tech decisions, although I don’t have much experience with how mature data teams operate. Since I’m a total open-source nerd and we’re based in Europe, we want to rely on as few American cloud providers as possible, I’ve set up the current infrastructure like this:* **Airflow** (running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **ClickHouse DWH** (also running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **Spark** (you guessed it, running in our cluster)* **Goose** for SQL migrations in our warehouseSome conceptual decisions I’ve made so far:1. Data ingestion from different sources (Salesforce, multiple products, etc.) runs through Airflow, using simple Pandas scripts to load into the DWH (about 200 k rows per day).2. ClickHouse is our DWH, and Spark connects to ClickHouse so that all analytics runs through Spark against ClickHouse. If you have any tips on how to structure the different data layers (Ingestion/datamart etc), please!What I want to implement next are typical software-engineering practices, dev/prod environments, testing, etc. As I mentioned, I have a lot of experience in classical SWE within corporate environments, so I want to apply as much from that as possible. In my research, I’ve found that you basically just copy the entire environment for dev and prod, which makes sense, but sounds expensive computing wise. We will soon start hiring additional DE/DA/DS.My question is: What technical or organizational decisions do you think are important and valuable? What have you seen work (or not work) in your experience as a data engineer? Are there problems you only discover once your team has grown? I want to get in front of those issues as early as possible. Like I said, I have a lot of experience in how to build SWE projects in a corporate environment. Any things I am not thinking about that will sooner or later come to haunt me in my DE team? Any tips on how to setup my DWH architecture?

For example: -- modelB.sql SELECT colA FROM {{ ref('modelA') }} This ensures `modelA` runs before `modelB`. DBT handles the dependency graph for you, parallelizes independent models for faster builds, and allows for targeted runs using tags. It also supports automated tests defined in YAML files, which run before the associated models.I'm wondering how similar functionality is achieved in Databricks. Is lineage managed manually, or is there a framework to define dependencies and parallelism? How are tests defined and automatically executed? I'd also like to understand how this works in vanilla Spark without Databricks. TLDR - How are Databricks or vanilla Spark projects organized in production.

1l4zcne,Leveling up a data organization,ratczar,dataengineering,"My current organization's level of data maturity is on the lower end. Legacy business that does great work, but hasn't changed in roughly 15-20 years. We have some rockstar DBA's, but they're older and have basically never touched cloud services or ""big"" data. Integrations are SSIS packages and scripts that are kind of in version control, data testing is manual, data analysts have no ability to define or alter tables even though they know the SQL. The business is expanding! It's a good place to be. As we expand, it's challenging our existing model. Our speed of execution is showing the bottlenecks around the DBA team, with one Hero Dev doing the majority of the work. They're wrapped up in application changes, warehouse changes, and analytics changes, and feel like they have to touch every part of the process or else everything will break (because again, tests are manual and we're only kind of doing version control).I'm working with the team on how we can address this. My plan is something like:* Break responsibility apart into the different teams * Application team is responsible for the application DB * DBA team is responsible for the system of record data warehouse and integrations and consults on design decisions * Analytics team is responsible for reports, \*including any underlying SQL and reporting warehouse structure\** Advocate for my Hero Dev to take a promotion towards a data architect and design consulting role bridging the teams, with other DBA's taking on more of the development.* Work on adding automated testing to our existing SSIS packages, then work towards having them built into a CI/CD process* Work with the analyst team on having their own server + database where they can use a framework or even Fabric to manage their tables and semantic layer themselves.I acknowledge this is a super high-level plan with a lot of hand-waving.

Is this article claiming that if I have, say, a dim\_customers table, that to widen that table with customer attributes like location, sign up date, size, etc. that I will create a brittle architecture? To me this seems like a standard practice, as long as you are maintaining the grain of the table (1 customer per record). I also might use this table to join in all of the ids from various source systems.

In this case, the silver layer is being skipped entirely, and the gold layer will serve as a 1:1 technical copy of the source views.While working on the development, I noticed that some of these source views contain duplicate records. I recommended introducing logical business keys to ensure uniqueness and preserve data quality, even though we’re not implementing dimensional modeling. However, the team responsible for the source system insists that the views should be replicated as-is and that it’s unnecessary to define any keys at all.I’m not convinced this is a good approach, especially for a layer that will be used for downstream reporting and analytics.What would you do in this case?Would you still enforce some form of business key validation in the gold layer, even when doing a simple pass-through replication?Thanks in advance.",6,0.88,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l4as6j/how_to_handle_source_table_replication_with/,2025-06-05 21:12:17,2025-06-09 01:48:44

1l1eia9,I'm looking to improve our DE stack and I need recommendations.,A_SeriousGamer,dataengineering,"TL;DR: We have a website and a D365 CRM that we currently keep synchronized through Power Automate, and this is rather terrible. What's a good avenue for better centralising our data for reporting? And what would be a good tool for pulling this data into the central data source?As the title says, we work in procurement for education institutions providing frameworks and the ability to raise tender requests free of charge, while collecting spend from our suppliers.Our development team is rather small with about 2-3 web developers (including our tech lead) and a data analyst. We have good experience in PHP / SQL, and rather limited experience in Python (although I have used it).We have our main website, a Laravel site that serves as the main point of contact for both members and suppliers with a Quote Tool (raising tenders) and Spend Reporter (suppliers tell us their revenue through us). The data for this is currently in a MariaDB / MySQL database. The VM for this is currently hosted within Azure.We then have our CRM, a dynamics 365 / PowerApps Model App(?) that handles Member & Supplier data, contacts, and also contains the framework data same as the site. Of course, this data is kept in Microsoft Data verse.These 2 are kept in sync using an array of Power Automate flows that run whenever a change is made on either end, and attempts to synchronise the two. It uses an API built in Laravel to contact the website data. To keep it realtime, there's an Azure Service bus for the messages sent on either end. A custom connector is used to access the API in Power Automate.We also have some other external data sources such as information from other organisations we pull into Microsoft Dataverse using custom connectors or an array of spreadsheets we get from them.Finally, we also have sources such as SharePoint, accounting software, MailChimp, a couple of S3 buckets, etc, that would be relevant to at least mention.Our reports are generally built in Power BI. These reports are generally built using the MySQL server as a source (although they have to be manually refreshed when connecting through an SSH tunnel) for some, and the Dataverse as the other source.We have licenses to build PowerBI reports that ingest data from any source, as well as most of the power platform suite. However, we don't have a license for Microsoft Fabric at the moment.We also have an old setup of Synapse Analytics alongside an Azure SQL database that as far as I can tell neither of these are really being utilised right now.So, my question from here is: what's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised? We've been looking at Snowflake as an option for a data store as well as (maybe?) for ETL/ELT. Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.Additionally, a big requirement is moving away from Power Automate for handling real time ETL processes as this causes far too many problems than solutions. Ideally, the 2-way sync would be kept as close to real-time as possible.So, what would be a good option for central data storage? And what would be a good option for then running data synchronisation and preparation for building reports?I think options that have been on the table either from personal discussions or with a vendor are:- including Azure Data Factory alongside Synapse for ETL- Microsoft Fabric - Snowflake- Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)- using more Power Query (simple, but only for ingesting data into Dataverse)I can answer questions for any additional context if needed, because I can imagine more will be needed.",6,0.76,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l1eia9/im_looking_to_improve_our_de_stack_and_i_need/,2025-06-02 10:26:24,2025-06-09 01:48:44

1l5iv1q,Suggestions welcome: Data ingestion gzip vs uncompressed data in Spark?,devanoff214,dataengineering,"I'm working on some data pipelines for a new source of data for our data lake, and right now we really only have one path to get the data up to the cloud. Going to do some hand-waving here only because I can't control this part of the process (for now), but a process is extracting data from our mainframe system as text (csv), and then compressing the data, and then copying it out to a cloud storage account in S3.Why compress it? Well, it does compress well; we see around \~30% space saved and the data size is not small; we're going from roughly 15GB per extract to down to 4.5GB. These are averages; some days are smaller, some are larger, but it's in this ballpark. Part of the reason for the compression is to save us some bandwidth and time in the file copy.So now, I have a spark job to ingest the data into our raw layer, and it's taking longer than I \*feel\* it should take. I know that there's some overhead to reading compressed .gzip (I feel like I read somewhere once that it has to read the entire file on a single thread first). So the reads and then ultimately the writes to our tables are taking a while, longer than we'd like, for the data to be available for our consumers.The debate we're having now is where do we want to ""eat"" the time:* Upload uncompressed files (vs compressed) so longer times in the file transfer* Add a step to decompress the files before we read them* Or just continue to have slower ingestion in our pipelinesMy argument is that we can't beat physics; we are going to have to accept some length of time with any of these options. I just feel as an organization, we're over-indexing on a solution. So I'm curious which ones of these you'd prefer?

(if an update query is made, I need to be able to query for what the table looked like before the update) this is sometimes called ""time travel query"" or ""point in time architecture"" depending on your background. The data sources do not retain this historical data, and are not in an ideal data warehouse schema, so Ill need to transform the data either before or after loading it, and maintain the historical records. Redshift seems to lack a direct solution for this problem.a second requirement is to ingest the data using streaming technology such as kafka. though the data warehouse does not have to be updated in real time. that is optional.I have looked at redshift's ""history mode"" but its quite new and it looks like all the data would need to go into RDS first, which has tradeoffs. but one of the main data sources is already on RDS, so that seems promising.total data volume is low, no need for cluster computing if we can save some complexity.I would prefer to lean toward python and sql for programming.I would prefer to do things in real-time, but would accept batches if a particularly elegant solution is available.thanks for considering :D",4,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l2l5ax/infrastructure_suggestions_for_streaming_data/,2025-06-03 19:38:21,2025-06-09 01:48:44

My university hasn’t provided much in terms of practical programming skills, and although I always knew I’d have to learn on my own, I kept postponing it.I’ve tried learning Java and Python through YouTube and documentation. I understand the syntax fairly well, but when it comes to actually building something, I freeze. I don’t know how to move from learning concepts to writing real code. It’s incredibly frustrating.Lately, I’ve started to feel like maybe I’m just not cut out for this. Like I’m too late, too slow, or just not smart enough. I constantly compare myself to others and feel like I’m falling behind.But despite all this, I still want to become a programmer. I’m not ready to give up.

1l3myti,Road to Full Stack / Web dev,Ashen_Trilby,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone. Before saying anything I would like to preface that this is my first time posting in a subreddit, so if I did something wrong somehow I apologize in advance (I chose the resource tag because my main question concerns choosing resources to learn).I have currently completed my second year in uni and am in the midst of my 3-month summer break. I want to spend these three months focusing on learning full stack development (which for now is my career goal ig), and specifically web development. I have this obsession with doing online courses and improving my skills to get better, and I'm also really looking to do some solid projects and start building my resume/cv. I scoured the internet and found multiple recommended courses which I've listed below. Unfortunately I have a bad habit of just hoarding work and trying to do everything without a plan and regardless of whether it is redundant or not. Here are the courses I gathered:- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)- [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j:toc)- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) courses (HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript)- [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) -> [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)- [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript and FrontEnd course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/)- [freecodecamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)- The roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)- [This roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vcu5lm/comment/icgeukp/?context=3) by NiagaraThistleI want to know which of these courses would be enough for me to become skilled at web dev and also set me on the path to becoming a full stack dev. I'd like to know if just one of these courses is actually enough, or if a few are enough then in what sequence should I do them. Of course if I had infinite time I would probably do them all but as of now this is overwhelming and would really appreciate if this could be narrowed down to the absolute essentials, stuff I can feasibly do in < 3 months and still get something out of. I'm aware that TOP seems well praised universally so I'm definitely going to do that.To preface I'm fairly adequate in programming and have worked on a few projects, including web-based ones, but I'm really looking to rebuild my skills from scratch if that makes sense.I also understand that the best way to learn is through building projects, I get that but I'd like to supplement that with learning theoreticals and any courses from the above (or if there's some other amazing one I somehow missed) which also involve project building would be best. I'd also like to know where I can find some project ideas (I'm aware roadmap.sh has a few). I'd like to build at least 3 projects within the time I have.Again would really appreciate some help (if I seem rather clueless in this post it's probably because I am, sorry, any guidance is appreciated)",85,0.98,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l3myti/road_to_full_stack_web_dev/,2025-06-05 01:32:37,2025-06-09 01:48:45
1l38eu0,How to build REAL projects,Far-Dragonfly-8306,learnprogramming,"I'm not here to ask the usual, lazy ""learned programming at 26! how become better programmer! also how get job?"" Because, yeah, I know how to become a better programmer: ""do projects,"" they all say. ""Solve a real world problem that you have."" But every legitimate programmer out there needs to acknowledge that there's a world of computer general knowledge that's typically necessary for many of these ""projects"" to function. Sure, at my level (<1 year of programming; yes I am self taught, no I did not get a CS degree), I can create a terminal based RPG game or create a terminal based CRUD. But when programmers go out and build a compiler, there's a whole world of knowledge required on how to do that, none of which is probably even concretely understandable - only abstractly understandable. To take another example: if you want to get into web development, it is not enough to know JS, HTML, and CSS - one must also know how requests/get/server/browsers work. So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler? Maybe my question is vague because it lacks an objective. I'm sure many of you will say ""what do you want to DO? What's your goal? That will determine how you learn this under-the-hood stuff."" And yet in the same breath, I suspect most programmers out there have this under-the-hood knowledge that I seem to lack. Where is this knowledge? YouTube tutorials on ""how to build [complicated thingy],"" by necessity, gloss over the important details behind the inner workings of lines of code, because otherwise the video would rabbit-hole quite quickly.",85,0.92,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l38eu0/how_to_build_real_projects/,2025-06-04 15:24:57,2025-06-09 01:48:45

It's about doing the application, giving the correct answer and leveling up which eventually awards you with chests that yield sitewide currencies/items you spend to keep going on. I didn't try them out yet but Codedex looks more of a gamified service.""Holding hands"" approach was the point of criticism from what I saw and I can confirm although I can't critique the service on the method - there are times where a total beginner would be baffled.However, that's where their ""Socratic"" AI called Boots comes in - you can ask him questions and he will proceed to jog your memory by asking you new ones. That might be frustrating to some, especially in cases where you need an outright explanation to a part of the code that was not explicitly taught before.I did not feel outcasted while getting from zero to half way into Functions tutorials and this is a very good aspect. I respect vendors who do not entice by ""look at this amazing feature you are missing out since you are on free"" and rather convince you by proving their merits and generating the feeling that they are worth your financial support if you are able.I am from Turkey and I saw purchasing power parity discount on top of the promotion one so that's another plus for people like us who are crushed under their evil governments' poor management.I am in no way affiliated with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) \- I just felt I needed to pay my respects for offering a more-free-than-premium service who also care about where you are from.

1l57tr4,My story about learning C and C++ as a self taught Java programmer (hoping to help someone on the same path),Vashh92,learnprogramming,"Disclaimer: I still consider myself ""new"" to programming. I'm not an expert by any means. I just want to share my story.Ever since I started listening to discussions surrounding memory management, I've had a growing interest in C/C++. Several months ago, I began studying open source C++ repositories and trying to put together all the pieces of a mostly complete program. It was a disaster, honestly. I quickly came to realize that my first impression of programming was overly simplistic and due for a refactor. I depended on the verbose nature of Java more than I thought I did. I took for granted all the things the Java Virtual Machine handled automatically until I was introduced to header files and Cmake. I'd argue this is one of the most important recognitions I've made about programming in general so far. It made me focus more on compiler behavior, pre-compile tasks, and all the madness going on in the terminal rather than just how good I can code, follow exception messages or solve surface level problems.My advice for new learners of C or C++: 1. Be very patient with it. Take extended breaks (burnout can occur quickly)2. The coding part will mostly be simple following a tutorial. It's everything else regarding the compiler tasks, headers, proper linking, and so on that will be troubling because it's not common for Java programmers to deal with that.3. Reading code others wrote in C++ will be madness, but it is necessary for learning. Stay resilient. You'll eventually start following the logic more easily.4. There are several C/C++ compilers out there. make sure you're choosing the one the project you're looking at expects. It's been an unexpected sticking point for me. People say the compiler won't make any meaningful difference in performance, which can be mistaken as saying the compiler choice doesn't matter at all. It will matter, just not for performance.5. Cmake is a friend, not a foe. Follow its instructions and download the CMake UI so you can see all the missing data at once. It'll mostly be seen in large projects.6. Building a project is less about the code itself and more about file linking. Pointing the compiler to all associated files is top priority to learn (in my opinion)7. C/C++ makes no assumptions about your platform. That's more significant than I first imagined. It's another thing the JVM handles under the hoodIf I am misguided about any of this, please let me know.

Some are C language developed projects, some are c++ (open source games mostly).So here's where I'm stuck: From what I gather, c++ is more difficult overall for a beginner to learn than c, but the open source projects I would be interested in that are in c are likely more difficult to get a handle on as a beginner.

1l69vmk,How to add a blog page to my website,Supreme_Hanuman69,learnprogramming,"First of all I'll give some context:Website is made using a template in HTML, CSS and JS. Its hosted on Vercel with a custom domain. Its not a static website and uses a server behind the scenes for stuff like ""serving"" the html files from a public folder and contact.html so that people that visit the website can send us messages (That's also why its not hosted on Github). It uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and other Javascript libraries for having the server capabilities. Now I have not really studied and worked on ExpressJS and all but I was able to vibe-code it (I know I'm sorry but its my dad that wanted the website really quick).Fast forward to present day and my dad wants a blog page in the website. Now I asked copilot in VSCode to do do it for me but turns out it got really complicated. I setup a database schema in supabase connected to vercel and then it started spewing out all these lines of code that didn't work at all and I got confused. (`POST /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog` etc)So what my dad wants is that he should be able to make posts preferably with images and thats it. When I first heard of it, I thought maybe he would also like people to be able to comment and like on posts as well. Well he has clarified that he just wants the first part only. Now the thing is how should I go about it. I have 2 choices:1. Use something like what copilot gave me (Use GET methods along with response and requests) (Gonna have to learn it from YT tutorials and docs since ""AI slop"")2. Create a simple posts.json file and loading the posts from that website using JS script. (Only issue would be how to add images in a json file; maybe base64 encoding would work; base64 is quite heavy though). And then create a Flutter app that allows my dad to create, edit and delete posts and when he clicks on submit, it would automatically get pushed onto my vercel repository in production.First approach seems better to make it look like a proper production application whereas the second approach is a just a make-shift thingWhich one do you think I should work on?

I feel as though this is a big issue with my skills as a programmer. I particularly struggle with OOP and abstracting what I want from a system into various aspects. Concepts as a whole tend to confuse me at first and I need a real concrete understanding before ""getting it"".

Inclusion of additional functionality, so if I had a to do app, including it to be available on mobile/cloud (such as using streamlit from python) would elevate it5. Real world/life functionality, such as expansion of use cases to encompass practical, business domains and situations.6. A project that is specific/applicable to a specific domain, such as an anti-money laundering detection project within banking, or fraud detection within a commercial website/ banking7.

1l4vpq8,How can I develop general (and transferable) programming skills?,UnscrewMyLife,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone!I'm new to programming and drawn to the field because I'm fascinated by how programmers can envision ideas and bring them to life through code. However, I'm struggling with two main challenges that are holding me back.First, I'm having trouble with the fundamentals of problem-solving and breaking down complex tasks. Despite watching tutorials, reading forums, and attempting LeetCode problems, everything feels overwhelming. I suspect I need to start even more basic than most beginners - perhaps at what I'd call a ""level -1."" To address this, I'm planning to work with a tutor who can help me build a solid foundation before I try to learn independently.Second, I'm unsure about which programming specialization to pursue. This uncertainty stems partly from my lack of confidence, but I now understand that working on personal projects is crucial for growth. Previously, I relied solely on LeetCode and books like ""How to Think Like a Programmer"" by Anton Spraul, but this community has shown me these should only supplement hands-on practice, not replace it.My main question is: Can I develop core programming skills that would transfer to any specialization I eventually choose - whether that's web development, DevOps, cloud engineering, or something else? Would it be better to pick a beginner-friendly area like web development to start with, or are there specific foundational projects and practices that would serve me well regardless of my eventual path?I'm open to any guidance you can offer, and I plan to utilize resources like tutoring, online communities, and Discord servers to support my learning journey.",4,0.75,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1l4vpq8/how_can_i_develop_general_and_transferable/,2025-06-06 15:45:43,2025-06-09 01:48:45

1l6pf5i,23M Am I in the right field?,The_FujiRose,learnprogramming,"Hello, I am seeking some advice and guidance from more experienced developers.I've been passionate about computers and programming since childhood. Spending hours on Visual Studio 2016 building fake spaceship GUI to roleplay on or designing a software for registering guests on my sister's 16th birthday party. In my free time I even simulated collisions and very basic physics in Java—of all languages. You know that scene in Kung Fu Panda where Mr. Ping—noodle chef—is proud of Po cuz he had a noodle dream? Yeah I had a noodle dream, but software dev. I hope this is enough to tell you that I deeply love programming.Currently, I am in college for an advanced diploma in computer program and analysis and I'm regretting my life choices. It doesn't help that my college isn't properly regulating AI use either so my diploma means nothing; there are so many cheaters.I don't know if I want to do this as a career anymore. I am considering being a hobbyist. My professors tell me they know or are in companies that are firing junior developers or replacing them with AI. I am concerned the job availability won't be large enough for someone of my academic background. I fear that this career direction is not for me despite computers and programming being a passion since childhood. Every project I do for school or every corporate website or software always has a very stale and boring look. I understand it's important to stick to ""best practices"" that perform better on A/B tests; however, sometimes I just want to design something fun in my own personal projects. There are also—of course—concerns about ARIA and accessibility software being unfamiliar with unique designs. That being said I don't mind sitting for hours doing soulless work so long as my headphones are blasting some phat beats. I can get lost for hours just VIM-ing.

1l5o201,Can a programmer work for himself? Is studying programming only for landing a job for someone?,Akraam_Gaffur,learnprogramming,"I'm curious in learning programming. Just finished learning basics for python. But I've been a Russian tutor for more than 2 years now and I'm used to be on my own. I mean, i can't stand the idea that if i want to learn IT well and be a professional in this, i have to spend at least 1-2 years studying every day. And all of this for working for someone else eventually for 800-1200$ a month in my case(Russia). The question is: is it possible to learn some specific skills in programming such as making a website or a WhatsApp bot and earning a solid money selling these products as a freelancer? I have a friend(a programmer) who said that it's impossible, any business owner would choose a firm over a freelancer, and as a freelancer i won't be able to make good money doing this. I mean, i want to be on my own, May be the field isn't for me? Because before i spend 1-2 years studying something, i want to know is there any prospects for me? Will i be able to launch my own firm doing this? Will i be able to make a good quality product a website for example for a business owner or is programming a team job, not for a solo worker? Thx for the answers, I'm sorry if the question is stupid. Added: also I've checked freelance platforms such as upwork and fivver. A bot for 3$, a site costs 15$ . Are they real prices?

1l54x2g,Bit the bullet for paid mentorship,Educational_Poet960,learnprogramming,"Recently I decided to take actions to better my self and my future career. It's my last semester in college taking CSIS, which for the past 2 semester I havent coded/program so approx 6 months. In the span of 6 months life happened, got my first car stolen, failed my first course(same time my car got stolen), and more..(life happens to everyone so no big deal just takes time). As it's my last semester, I'm trying to get back into my groove of programming and building meaningful projects, which in my head i was over complicating things(is learning c++ better than..? Is making your own compiler better? Is making an application or full stack application with users better? which stack is better to use?) then i came across this growing tech youtuber that was offering paid mentorship. What made him stand out to me? His idea in building application by yourself with guidance. He will collaborate with you in helping you build your idea. It also came to my head that maybe he can guide me in what are things i need to improve on? because I love getting better every single day no matter how small it is. Its just I dont know how to improve or what to improve on... Its like in sports you can determine what to improve on. But with programming i cant determine it. I'm coming to this mentorship with this mindset, but then when i got in and i was questioning if i should continue even though it wasnt even a week yet? Why? Because one of the first module is basic javascript, html and css, which of course i understand that it is needed to have that ""hidden handshake"" that you know what you're doing. So i felt is this only for people transitioning from other jobs to tech? or trying out tech? The other modules are locked until certain days. I've built numerous full stack application using react, node, mongoDB, Vue, Springboot, PHP Laravel because it was a project for my classes. In which, I haven't touched up on it for 6 months. I was taking theory based classes in the 2 semester i wasnt programing/coding(Of course its only an excuse i know).Which currently before i bit the bullet doing the mentorship, I'm learning react native because i got an idea for an app and i want to leverage Java spring boot in it because that's my most backend ive done.In so, my main predicament is should i continue doing the beginner modules of html, css and javascript(again context of ive learnt this in the past already so) or continue learning react native and retouch my skills in using Java(spring boot) to fully make the app or ask the mentor how i should move forward in this program in regards of my skills currently? Idk what to prioritize... plus i still have my last semester.

Here is how I would break it down.1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)** \- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)** \- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)** \- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.4. **Wrap up (2 mins)** \- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.**How I prepared:*** Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.I know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off!

1l43hhb,"Even with the current market, SWE is still the best field by far.",cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"Yes, there are a few downsides. The market is also pretty shitty. BUT.. other fields have it so much worse than us.Why SWE is the best:* Even if your goal is to just be an average SWE, you will still end up making 2x or 3x what most other fields make.* The ability to work from home or have a flexible hybrid schedule is AMAZING. There are so many jobs where you have to show up to work at a very specific time and if you're even 1 minute late, you get reprimanded for it. How cool is it that we can show up to work at 11am and leave whenever we want? How cool is it to tell you manager ""Hey I'll be away this afternoon"" and they are totally fine with it? Not many fields have this luxury.* The work is genuinely interesting. Software runs the world. It's awesome to be able to understand how these big systems work and be able to contribute to them. Through real world work + a Computer Science degree, the 'magic' behind computers vanishes and you really start to acknowledge the beauty behind all the abstractions. It's just such a cool field in general.* There is so much variety in what companies you can work for. Want an extremely prestigious and high paying job? You know what to study to make that happen. Want a chill job? You know where to apply for those. Want to join an exciting start-up and work on something from the ground up while wearing multiple hats? Yeah, there are tons of those jobs too. The possibilities are endless.* Similar to the above, there is tons of variety in what you can do in your career. Since SWE is so intertwined with every other field, the possibilities are near endless. Want to make web-apps for millions of people? DO IT!! Want to work on medical devices to save people's lives? YES QUEEN. How about writing code for satellites that power GPS systems across the world? LETS GO!!! Oh, you want to write code for simulation software so scientists can research the effects of earthquakes? AYYYY BRUH!! Literally the possibilities are endless.* It's an office job. I don't have to be out in the extreme heat or extreme cold breaking my body. People who work in manual labour jobs are completely screwed by the time they hit their mid 30s. Aching backs, wrists, shoulders, neck, you name it. Their body is broken when they get into their prime years. The work is also brutal. Imagine lifting heavy things for 12 hours a day in extreme weather, just to make $50k a year? Meanwhile I'm in the office (or at home in my pajamas) drinking some coffee and working on a cool puzzle.. and getting paid tons of money to do it.* The ability to impact millions of people with your code. Not many fields have access to such a large scale as we do. If you work for a well-known company, then it's likely that the features you build and the code that you push will affect the lives of literally millions of people across the world. It's cool to know that your work is recognized on such a global scale.So yeah. I know times are tough right now. There are some downsides of course too. But overall, I think SWE is still the best field.What do you guys think?

1l5kbzs,What happened to the industry to cause such a shift in hiring and layoffs?,EzekielYeager,cscareerquestions,"I’m really terrible at Reddit formatting, so this will probably seem like a blob of text. So many people are incorrectly saying that AI is the driving reason for the mass layoffs, non-hiring, and the downward trend of anything software development related. AI is a _contributing_ factor to the *difficulty* of getting hired at entry level positions at companies, but that’s a standard bar push. But what’s *truly* influencing the mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and shrinking investment into developing proprietary and innovative technologies in America isn’t AI. It’s a tax credit rewrite that was never supposed to take effect. Law and legislation is boring, but this piece specifically, is important for all of you. It impacts your life, your industry, how you’re paid, what the Chief Financial Officer sees and uses to justify paying you six figures, and your tax rebates if you’re planning to start or work in a startup.I’m going to lay out the facts in a (hopefully) objective way. The credit I’m talking about:The Research and Development Tax Credit under IRC Tax Code 174. EDIT: Edits will be for formatting. The law that changed it:The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (specifically under section 13206). This provision was initially drafted by Kevin Brady (R-TX), and advocated significantly for by Republican lawmakers. The House of Representatives vote:227 Republicans For13 Republicans Against0 Democrats For192 Democrats AgainstThe Senate vote:51 Republicans For0 Republicans Against0 Democrats For47 Democrats, and 2 Independents Against The final result:Signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, 2017. Date it took effect:January 1, 2022Why so late?A fun, gimmicky workaround to the Byrd Rule and to delay costly tax hikes until after the 5-year mark, while cashing in on any revenue after the 10-year mark. In short, it was a play to look fiscally responsible, but didn’t provide any tax cuts. It just kicked the can down the road and offset immediate tech conglomerate backlash. They assumed that this provision would be removed or indefinitely delayed by future Congress, but they didn’t. Previous:Prior to 2022, businesses were able to immediately (same year tax break) cash in and deduct R&D expenses, including software developer and other IT professionals’ salaries, IT infrastructure changes, engineer innovation in all sectors, and more. After 2022:All of the expenses covered by the R&D credit now has to be capitalized and amortized. For domestic research, they are required to amortize over 5 years. For foreign research, they are required to amortize over 15 years. Meaning that, prior to 2022, a $1M investment into software development and cyber security would be fully deductible for fiscal year 22. Now, that same $1M investment into those same fields would only allow for $200k to be deductible for the fiscal year, and the remaining $800k would need to be spread out over the remaining four.Which resulted in layoffs, frozen hiring, cash flow strain for startups and tech firms, and immediate tax burden on companies employing R&D-based that persists to today. BUT! There is a bipartisan bill that’s going through Congress right now to reverse it and retroactively apply the lost tax credits back to businesses from 2021 forward, but we’ll see where it goes!",510,0.9,186,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l5kbzs/what_happened_to_the_industry_to_cause_such_a/,2025-06-07 13:03:00,2025-06-09 01:48:47

I checked both their LinkedIn profiles - the director has worked at 10 companies in 15 years, and the manager 12 companies in 20 years. What kind of stability is that? These are folks who have a lot of employees reporting to them, and we rely on them for direction and culture building. Also, why are companies continually OK hiring people like this? That's what I *really* don't get. You think you're the special company where this new hire is going to stick around, after over a decade of ~1-1.5 year tenures? It just seems like an incredible waste of resources.Everywhere I look on LinkedIn, it's the same. 1-2 year tenures at every company.

I blanked. Couldn’t find the right words, not even with my mother tongue, got nervous, and the whole thing just spiralled.Then I got rejected.

I went through two interview loops with them, several months apart, and was ghosted once and required multiple follow-ups to not be ghosted a second time — despite confirmed positive feedback from interviewers.**Round 1 (~7 months ago)**I interviewed for a Tech Lead role with a near perfect match in domain, stack, ownership, and experience level. Went through five rounds:- Recruiter- Director- Tech Lead (coding round)- Principal Engineer (system design)- Security Analyst (cross-functional)I moved through the interview cycle and after the cross-functional round, the recruiter emailed me thanking me for taking the time to interview and said he’d collate the feedback and be in touch when he had an update. Ghosted after this email despite repeated follow-ups. I connected with the Director on LinkedIn a month or so after this.**Round 2 (3 weeks ago)**The director shared a Staff Engineer posting that looked to be a direct replacement for the Tech Lead role, so I reached out to him on LinkedIn. He apologized for the earlier ghosting, said I got strong feedback, and that the org had new leadership and shifted direction — fewer managers, more senior ICs. He said he’d love to re-engage and that the recruiter would reach out.The recruiter (same one who ghosted me originally) called me a few days later — but instead of the Staff role, he described an Infrastructure Security role that had similar domain requirements. Maybe I should’ve clarified right then, but I assumed it was all part of the same track and the recruiter mentioned that I would be assessed on the same principles that I was assessed on in the previous interview loop - he explicitly said that he had no concerns at all.They scheduled me with a new distinguished engineer who had joined since the original ghosting. We did not cover a single topic that was discussed in the previous interview.While the discussion was somewhat related to my area, there was a focus on some fairly obscure but oddly specific topics. Despite the curveball - I think I reasoned correctly about the nuances while acknowledging that this area was not something I had direct experience in. The discussion was still highly collaborative and flowed naturally and at the end, the DE mentioned he hoped to speak with me again soon.Then: more silence. Followed up with the recruiter. Nothing. Followed up with the Director on LinkedIn. He said, “let me talk to the recruiter.” A few days later I got a templated rejection email. Zero feedback with an explicit note in the template saying they can’t provide feedback.I understand that goals evolve quickly at high-growth companies. But from a candidate’s perspective, this felt like goalposts were shifting between cycles, and maybe even between rounds. There is a total misalignment in what they’re looking for and across what experience levels. Interestingly - one of the questions I asked DE was *what was the hardest problem he was trying to solve at CoreWeave?*His answer? Hiring and building the team.So if you're thinking of interviewing with CoreWeave: proceed with your eyes open.

I failed to secure an internship in either the summer after sophomore or junior year. Just before graduating, I had applied to about 35 jobs with no response - not even an asynchronous coding test. It was already clear that I was cooked with no internships. Combining this disappointment with some major health issues, I went the next 7 months after graduation without applying to a single job. I started applying again in January 2025 and over the last 5 months, I've applied to 142 jobs through Linkedin, Indeed and rarely some other sites.In all of these jobs, only about 15 were for software engineering, with all of the rest being lesser tech roles, some even barely tech related: Data Analyst I, Junior Business Analyst, Entry Level QA tester, etc. I've received a total of 6 ""next steps"" including 3 in person interviews and 0 offers. During this time, the only experience I've been able to advertise is my senior year Software Engineering project (year long capstone), an online Business Analysis course, and a handful of menial summer jobs. Grinding Leetcode is pointless - like I said, I've never even been granted the opportunity of a coding interview. Leveraging what few family connections I have has led to little more than ""apply online"" or ""send me your resume"" (the one with no real experience on it).I hear all of these stories that say ""Don't give up! I applied to 500 jobs before I landed my first software engineering job"". Nevermind that there's no chance of me landing an SE job as my first role (no internships), I have yet to get a straight answer as to where people are even seeing 500 relevant tech roles LET ALONE entry level. Both Indeed and Linkedin have slowed to a drip of one semi-relevant entry level job for every 15 that are irrelevant, a scam, or 2-4 years experience crap.So that's where I am. I have no idea what to do at this point, short of applying to Revature and seeing where that takes me (literally). Every day that goes by, I can feel the entry level CS jobs dwindling.

There exists a consecutive sequence of m servers, labeled from 1 to m, where the expense metric linked to the j-th server is given in the list expense\[j\].

The aggregate expense accounts for the sum of partitioning costs for all server segments.>Given m servers, a list expense, and an integer p, determine both the least and greatest achievable total expense of these operations and return them as a list of length 2: \[minimum expense, maximum expense\].I'm sorry what?

1l5sz35,You’re Afraid of Networking? That’s Your Sign to Start Today,seekgs_2023,cscareerquestions,"I've helped a lot of students & early-career folks with job hunting, and one fear comes up all the time: **networking**. So many people are scared they'll say the wrong thing, or that their message will just get ignored.Totally get it! I've been there too. But based on what I’ve seen from job seekers who’ve actually landed roles (including some who started with zero connections), here are some tips that really work:**1. Start with a 15 min coffee chat**Don’t overthink it. You’re not asking for a job. You’re just asking for 15 minutes to get to know the other person’s position. Most professionals remember what it felt like in the beginning, and they’re happy to help.You can say something like, “Hi \[name\], I’m currently studying \[major\] and exploring career paths in \[field\]. If you’d like to chat with me for 15 minutes, I’d love to hear about your experiences.”**2. Build rapport: \~2 min**Don’t jump right into the subject. Start by warming up with a friendly opening line:“How are you doing today?”“Hope you’re having a great week, thank you for your time!”It’s a small thing, but it can create a relaxed atmosphere and make both parties feel more comfortable.**3. Introduce yourself: 2-3 min**Keep it brief and to the point. Think of it like your LinkedIn verbal summary.“I’m currently a Data Analytics student at \[school\] and I’m really interested in marketing analytics. I’ve worked on projects with A/B testing and Tableau dashboards, and I’d love to learn more about what careers in this field really look like.”Confidence comes from clarity of thought: if you know what you want, you’ll be ten times more confident when you speak your mind.**4. Ask two good questions: \~10 min**This is where you learn. Try:“What do you like most (and least) about your job?”“How did you get into this field?”“If you graduated today, what would you focus on?”Avoid asking generic questions like “How is your company?” Just try to show curiosity and depth.**5. Follow up consistently**Send a quick thank you note and ask if they’d like to stay in touch. That’s it. Relationships are developed through follow-up, not one-off chats.**Tips:**\- If you don't hearing back so far: Try alumni, smaller companies, or people who are 1-3 years ahead of you. They’re often more responsive than FAANG executives.\- Feeling nervous all the time? Write a pitch and practice it with a friend before the actual chat.\- Keep a spreadsheet of who you reached out to, when, and what you learned.So if you’re afraid of networking, you’re not alone. I’ve been there. Take the first step and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at where it leads.Has anyone else networked their way into your first job?

Hey everyone, I am looking for advice in my current role. I landed my first software engineering job about 6 months ago after applying to over 750 jobs. The process broke me a bit, but I was so relieved to finally get a foot in the door. This was the only company I made to the final round, so I was going to take it since I was graduating in the next couple months and needed to secure work. It’s a small startup with a team of about 10 engineers. But the environment and expectations are burning me out and I don’t know what to do. Here’s what’s been making this so hard:- Strict micromanagement: My boss tracks and questions every small task. Sometimes asking for 5-6 different changes on the same ticket. When I think something is done, I have to go back and add even more to it, despite it never being asked in the first place. - Zero mentorship or support: I was thrown into the codebase with minimal onboarding and barely any documentation. No code reviews, no senior dev guidance — I’m expected to figure out complex features solo and somehow get everything right. Ive been able to figure things out, but it’s been a very tedious and tiresome process. - Unrealistic expectations: Every ticket is somehow “urgent,” and I always feel behind because the timelines just aren’t realistic. There’s no prioritization since EVERYTHING seems to be high priority. Every month management says they will “replan the month priorities” but they never do and I’m stuck with infinite tickets for the month that just all need to be done. - Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way). I am yet to ask for remote work, but my peer told me not to expect more than 1 day remote, despite the majority of the team having 2-3 days a week remote. By the time I get home, Im exhausted and barely have time to decompress or do things I like before having to sleep to get my 8 hours. Ultimately, I feel trapped. I was grateful to find work after sending 700+ apps, but this constant grind in this environment is really disrupting my mental health. I don’t want to go back to square one and leave this job since I have a lot of financial pressures, but can’t see my self staying here much longer. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to manage this? I feel like 1yoe does not mean anything in this market, but Im not sure how much longer I can continue doing this. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!TLDR: 6 months into first SWE role, feeling stressed from work environment, expectations, and commute.

While this may not get me a job, it got me on their radar, restored some of my own faith in humanity, and also saved 2 other people from the same hopelessness.

1l19od2,As a bootcamp grad- should I accept a drastic demotion?,ThisAintNoBeer,cscareerquestions,"I graduated from a CS bootcamp in May 2023. Previously I had only worked in retail. I do not have a Bachelor's or even an AA degree (though a decent amount of community college units completed). Right out of the bootcamp I was lucky enough to land an internship at a small government organization via a connection through the bootcamp.I was then converted to full time after the internship. It was a pretty modest junior web developer role that only paid about $50k/yr but the work environment and mentorship were phenomenal. And at least it had some pension and healthcare benefits. Over the last 22 months I've learned a ton and have been given the freedom to make some large and meaningful contributions to the company's flagship products.Sadly we've been hit with some pretty heft budget cutbacks. As the most junior person at the company I'm first on the chopping block and was laid off. As I was being let go, the organization's director offered me a Teaching Assist position at the bootcamp I had graduated. Apparently part of their deal with the bootcamp requires they contribute a certain amount of developer hours towards instruction.She wanted to try something new with a single dev doing the Teaching Assistant thing full time (previously they'd have the more senior devs rotate in every now and then). Currently I work 3 days from home and 2 days in-office. The teaching role would be 4 days a week on-site. I would still be employed by my current organization and keep the title of ""Junior Web Developer"". My compensation would be cut down to $30k/yr AND no benefits.I have a few days to think it over but am tempted to pass on the ""opportunity"". Would that be a mistake? It would be nice to add a third year as a junior developer to my resume along with some teaching experience but I feel like they're really just taking advantage of me.Alternatively I can try to test the waters in this absolutely awful job market. But don't foresee myself getting anywhere. I know tons of people with CS degrees that are having no luck whatsoever. I could also alternatively collect unemployment while working towards an accelerated degree program myself and hope things get better in a year or two.I feel stuck between two kinda terrible options. Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks!tl;dr Bootcamp grad with no degree but 2 yoe. Currently making $50k/yr with healthcare benefits. Was laid off but offered $30k/yr and no healthcare. Should I take the ~$1900/mo net pay offer just to pad my resume while looking for other jobs? Alternatively I could collect unemployment at $1800/months for 6 months while applying full time and working towards a CS degreeEdit: I spoke to my principal engineer and he was pretty adamant that I do not take that position. He said he couldn’t promise anything but if there was ever an opening for a developer I would be the first person he calls.

1l3x147,How do you correct your career path when the wrong job is slowly killing you,CashKey1212,cscareerquestions,"When I graduated in 2023, I applied for a backend Java role. My resume was about SpringBoot projects. One of the companies I contacted asked about JVM, databases, and made me do LeetCode problems. I got the offer later and accepted it considering the fair salary. But I thought my role was to do Java backend development.However, when I got into the company, I found out that they were using GWT (Google Web Toolkit) to build both frontend and backend, and I was assigned to GWT front end to develop web applications and desktop applications.For your reference, GWT means developing frontend and backend using Java alone. The frontend is trans-compiled into JS code by the GWT compiler from Java code. Google used it to build Google Docs.The technology-GWT is already abandoned by Google, and nobody is using that anymore. I felt very pressured about my current situation but was afraid to jump to other positions because I thought I would not competitive, and jumping too fast would be a stain on my resume as a new graduate. And I also hesitated about the thought of going for a master's degree.And this is a vicious downward spiral. The more I delay finding a real Java backend position, the less valuable I become on the job market.Having stayed at the role for two years, now I did realize my situation, and I think the correct solution is try to jump to other companies as soon as possible. And I think the master's degree solution has more disadvantages in terms of accumulation of savings, so I abandoned it.Still, I feel very anxious about starting finding jobs, because apparently working experience is the most valuable thing on the job market. If I apply for a front-end job (that is what I'm doing with GWT), nobody wants a Java programmer because the market needs React.js and JavaScript programmer. If I apply for a back-end job, my working experience is useless too because I didn't do SpringBoot.I think I am really in a very disadvantageous situation now.

One of my team's products is a service that's the intermediary between a bunch of user facing applications, and the database systems they interact with. My project is basically going through every single client of ours, deprecating a mocked instance of my team's product used in integration tests, and replacing it with a proper instance that actually interacts with the intended services. And by god is it hard. Everything I even look at is new. Gradle, dependency injection, internal tools for managing permissions / users, random configuration files, writing production level java code, ohmygawd. I managed (with a lot of help from my mentor) to migrate a simpler testing class, and got an understanding of what it might entail end to end.

Sure - if I work my tail off this summer I might be able to finish this thing. But now I'm worried that this is not sustainable, for me.

I think I now understand why there's a shortage of truly skilled senior developers - and I'm starting to doubt I'll ever become one.

I want to do more backend development and systems level programming and maybe Iot development.However I’ve heard rust is growing rapidly and might replace go.

I miss the daily camaraderie with other engineers, the energy of a stricter schedule, and even the minor corporate politics that somehow keep everyone alert. Remote work has made me a bit lax, and while I still deliver good work, I'm not sure I like this more relaxed pace.I could always move a couple of hours back to my old metro area, but it's still fairly small. I'm interested in trying a larger city with more tech companies and less friction in the job market (not implying it's easier to get a job, just more options).However, having bought a house, moving is a bit more complex and expenses are now quite a bit higher. It's not as easy to pick up and move as when I was renting and had less stuff. I'm curious if any of you have gone through something similar and would have any tips. Did you use a new job to manage a relocation, or did you make it work without having to move jobs? Any tips, regrets, or expectations that either held true or were broken?

1l2urcp,How to think of my job as just a job and not let it affect personal life,eatdrinksleepp,cscareerquestions,"Recent grad here, working in my first time full time role. Something I have been struggling with a lot is maintaining work life balance and preventing work stress from bleeding into personal life. I don’t particularly enjoy my current role so I have been trying to advocate for myself within the company and pursue a role change to gear more towards the tools and technologies I enjoy using and want to learn. But this process has been very stressful for me due to a kinda toxic team dynamic and also the company being very unstructured and vague when it comes to role changes and promotions. My problem is that this work stress and politics is driving me insane and I can’t stop thinking about it even in the little time I get to myself outside of work. I want to get better at just shutting off work brain once I leave the office but it feels impossible. The recent anxiety and frustration I have been feeling because of being stuck in a role I don’t enjoy never goes away and only gets worse. I really want to be like one of those people who think of their job as just a job that earns them money and are able to spend their personal time on non work related things. I have hobbies and passion projects I wanna work on but I even find it hard to focus on them or be motivated about them with all the work related tension in my head. If not physically exhausted, I am always too mentally exhausted to spend my time in anything actually fulfilling outside of work. I am already starting to feel the beginnings of a burnout as a result of all this so I want to fix this before things get worse.

1l2c0sq,Got a job that will cross-train me in software development. They still use pick/basic,Rexoc40,cscareerquestions,"This company sells software the county govts use to files property taxes. It seems pretty solid, and I just had my first day yesterday. Their front end is pretty straightforward, using js, html, css, etc. but they use ancient languages like pick basic for everything else. The reason for this i’m guessing is because of the huge amount of red tape and compliances your software has to have, and the fact that it’s old and works is enough of a reason to not re-vamp the whole thing.The problem is, though, i’m 22. I want to get into development, and while this job offers that, will I get stuck here? My friends are telling me that I am ‘cooked’ but in my mind, even with these old languages, there is still so much practical experience here that can transfer into better development jobs that is much better than just sitting on my ass and getting decline letters for lack of experience. In my mind, this is my experience and even if it’s old, I think that the other skills combined that I will use in this job will make up for everything else.The best things this job offers in my opinion, is their front-end development, and also linux experience. They use a lot of linux, and as of now I am too inexperienced to explain how they use linux, even though I took classes on it in college.

Are there any ways I can improve my chances of getting a team match or speed up the process? How likely is it to get matched within this window?Additionally, I have a few questions:1. I initially gave a salary expectation in the 50th–75th percentile for L4 (based on levels.fyi). Would it help to tell the recruiter I’m open to less, as I care more about the opportunity to grow at AWS than compensation?2. I’ve seen suggestions to regularly follow up with the recruiter. Is weekly follow-up too frequent? Should I reach out by phone or email? Should I inform them if I see newly opened roles that interest me?3.

It seems like every sprint, random stuff pops up that was unaccounted for, and I need to handle that alongside my normal work. Most notably, I own a CI/CD pipeline that breaks at least once a sprint for new reasons each time (usually due to bad changes being pushed through). Individual sprint tasks also tend to have unknowns which expand the amount of time needed. Tasks rarely take as long as expected.My manager doesn't like us adding in buffer time for unknowns, and has pushed back on me doing this before. So I feel like my only option is to take on a load of work that I *know* won't get finished, and deal with the shittiness of finishing each sprint with leftover work to do.Looking at other members of my team, they also carry items, sometimes for a very long time.

Project has been stalling, and my health is deteriorating taking care of the newborn and project. How can I request paternity leave in this situation?Hi, TIA.I started at my new company late last year, and did a fair/ok job, so I started inheriting teammates assignments (we code).My senior teammate (didn’t get to spend much time with them due to teammate being OOO for a good portion of Q4) left the bank in Q1, and transferred their a project code body and materials to me.It was around their departure time that I let work know I was expecting a baby at the beginning of Q2. Given that I was relatively new, and our FTE count was down due to this departure, I agreed to help complete their outstanding projects with the expectation of taking time in July (I know, I know…this was a bad idea. Had I known the complexity of this project, if it was further pushed by management, I would have refused or resigned).Baby came at the start of Q2, and the project has experienced setbacks — I learned after the fact that the knowledge transfer wasn’t all that complete, and the block of code i recieved in transition will probably require major rework thru validation. I can easily see this going thru Q2 and into the beginning of Q3.Issue is I’m not sleeping due to the baby schedule, and I have a chronic condition I am managing privately. It’s not an issue usually, but currently I am feeling exhausted and starting to experience burnout. My partner is also starting to wear thin, and is requesting my presence with the newborn and our other children. We are entitled to a large amount of paternity leave at my company, but I feel this would almost be considered abandoning my project.

1l6nzso,SWE -> Ai researcher with ethics focus,TheGhostOfBobStoops,cscareerquestions,"#Hey guys, I’m posting for a friend who doesn’t have a Reddit account with enough karma! Thank you I’m currently a software engineer at Microsoft with 5 years of industry experience(mobile developer for a major product). Over the past few years, I’ve developed a deep passion for philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I believe my long-term goal is to work as an AI ethics researcher, ideally contributing to both academic understanding and practical guidance for organizations building impactful systems. To pursue this, I’m considering enrolling in a Master’s in Philosophy to gain formal training in foundational and conceptual frameworks(philosophy of mind and ethics focus), with the eventual goal of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or a related interdisciplinary field that focuses on AI ethics. That said, I’m wondering if a single Philosophy master’s is the most efficient path—or if it might be worthwhile to simultaneously pursue a second Master’s in Machine Learning or Computer Science. I recognize this may extend the timeline, but I’m genuinely passionate about building a strong, cross-disciplinary foundation and want to make sure I’m well-prepared to contribute meaningfully in both technical and ethical domains. My key questions are: * Is a PhD necessary to break into impactful AI ethics research, or can a Master’s degree (or two) be sufficient?* Would pursuing two Master’s degrees in parallel (Philosophy + ML/CS) make sense, or would you recommend a more focused route?* Are there specific programs or schools you would recommend for someone with this interdisciplinary focus?* Finally, does this path tend to offer long-term job security and practical opportunities in industry at major labs?
