1kfdl1e,I f***ing hate Azure,wtfzambo,dataengineering,"*Disclaimer: this post is nothing but a rant.*---I've recently inherited a data project which is almost entirely based in Azure synapse.I can't even begin to describe the level of hatred and despair that this platform generates in me.Let's start with the biggest offender: that being Spark as the only available runtime. Because OF COURSE one MUST USE Spark to move 40 bits of data, god forbid someone thinks a firm has (*gasp!*) small data, even if the amount of companies that actually need a distributed system is less than the amount of fucks I have left to give about this industry as a whole.Luckily, I can soothe my rage by meditating during the downtimes, beacause testing code means that, if your cluster is cold, you have to wait between 2 and 5 business days to see results, meaning that each day one gets 5 meaningful commits in at most. Work-life balance, yay!Second, the bane of any sensible software engineer and their sanity: Notebooks. I believe notebooks are an invention of Satan himself, because there is not a single chance that a benevolent individual made the choice of putting notebooks in production.I know that one day, after the 1000th notebook I'll have to fix, my sanity will eventually run out, and I will start a terrorist movement against notebook users. Either that or I will immolate myself alive to the altar of sound software engineering in the hope of restoring equilibrium.Third, we have the biggest lie of them all, the scam of the century, the slithery snake, the greatest pretender: ""yOu dOn't NEeD DaTA enGINEeers!!1"".Because since engineers are expensive, these idiotic corps had to sell to other even more idiotic corps the lie that with these magical NO CODE tools, even Gina the intern from Marketing can do data pipelines!But obviously, Gina the intern from Marketing has marketing stuff to do, leaving those pipelines uncovered. Who's gonna do them now? Why of course, the same exact data engineers one was trying to replace!Except that instead of being provided with proper engineering toolbox, they now have to deal with an environment tailored for people whose shadow outshines their intellect, castrating the productivity many times over, because dragging arbitrary boxes to get a for loop done is clearly SO MUCH faster and productive than literally anything else.I understand now why our salaries are high: it's not because of the skill required to conduct our job. It's to pay the levels of insanity that we're forced to endure.But don't worry, AI will fix it.",772,0.96,223,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kfdl1e/i_fing_hate_azure/,2025-05-05 14:53:40,2025-05-12 01:43:50

1kk0xxg,Last 2 months I have been humbled by the data engineering landscape,skatez101,dataengineering,"Hello All,For the past 6 years I have been working in the data analyst and data engineer role (My title is Senior Data Analyst ). I have been working with Snowflake writing stored procedures, spark using databricks, ADF for orchestration, SQL server, power BI & Tableau dashboards. All the data processing has been either monthly or quarterly. I was always under the impression that I was going to be quite employable when I try to switch at some point.But the past few months have taught me that there aren't many data analyst openings and the field doesn't pay squat and is mostly for freshers and the data engineering that I have been doing isn't really actual data engineering.All the openings I see require knowledge of Kafka, docker, kubernetes, microservices, airflow, mlops, API integration, CI/CD etc. This has left me stunned at the very least. I never knew that most of the companies required such a diverse set of skills and data engineering was more of SWE rather than what I have been doing.

1kimfzi,Do we hate our jobs for the same reasons?,tensor_operator,dataengineering,"I’m a newly minted Data Engineer, with what little experience I have, I’ve noticed quite a few glaring issues with my workplace, causing me to start hating my job. Here are a few:- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. - We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. I don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem.

Pulled Playlist data using Spotify API 2. Created a staging Postgres DB to store raw data of the Playlist 3. Cleaned the data and modeled the data into a STAR schema in a new db.4. Created Facts table containing granular data for Playlist- track_id, names, artists id , album ID5. Created dimension tables - for artists (ID and names) , for albums (ID and names)6. Used Genius API for fetching lyrics for each track7. Created another dimensions tables for lyrics (IDs and lyrics as text)8. Used Gemini API (free tier) to analyze lyrics for each song to return a json output. {'NSFW_TAG: [EXPLICIT/MILD/SAFE]}, {'Keywords found': [list of curse words found}9. Updated the lyrics dimensions to store the NSFW tagging and keywords.I have planned few more steps to execute:1.Use AIRFLOW for orchestration2. Recreate it in cloud instead of local dbdB3.

I consider myself advanced in Power BI — not an expert, but someone who can solve most problems, including performance tuning, RLS, OLS, Tabular Editor, etc.Company 2 – I built and delivered a Data Platform for a retail company (+7000 employees) using Microsoft Fabric. I was the main and principal engineer for the platform for 1.5 years, using Azure Data Factory, Dataflows, Spark Notebooks (basic Spark and Python, such as reading, writing, using APIs, partitioning...), Delta Tables (very good understanding), schema modeling (silver and gold layers), lakehouse governance, understanding business needs, and creating complex SQL queries to extract data from transactional databases. I consider myself intermediate-advanced in SQL (for the market), including window functions, CTEs, etc. I can solve many intermediate and almost all easy LeetCode problems.Company 3 – I just started (20,000+ employees). I'm working in a Data Integration team, using a lot of Talend for ingestion from various sources, and also collaborating with the Databricks team.Freelance Projects (2 years) – I developed some Power BI dashboards and organized databases for two small companies using Sheets, excel and BigQuery.Nowadays, I'm learning a lot of Talend to deliver my work in the best way possible. By the end of the year, I might need to move to another country for family reasons. I’ll step away from the Data Engineering field for a while and will have time to study (maybe for 1.5 years), so I would like to strengthen my knowledge base.I can program in Python a bit. I’ve created some functions, connected to Microsoft Graph through Spark Notebooks, ingested data, and used Selenium for personal projects. I haven't developed my technical skills further mainly because I haven't needed to use Python much at work.I don’t plan to study Databricks, Snowflake, Data Factory, DBT, BigQuery, and AIs deeply, since I already have some experience with them. I understand their core concepts, which I think is enough for now. I’ll have the opportunity to practice these tools through freelancing in the future. I believe I just need to understand what each tool does — the core concepts remain the same. Or am I wrong?I’ve planned a few things to study. I believe a Data Engineer with 5 years of experience should starts understand algorithms, networking, programming languages, software architecture, etc. I found the OSSU University project (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Since I’ve already completed an engineering degree, I don’t need to do everything again, but it looks like a really good path.So, my plan — following OSSU — is to complete these subjects over the next 1.5 years:Systematic Program DesignClass-based Program DesignProgramming Languages, Part A (Is that necessary?)Programming Languages, Part B (Is that necessary?)Programming Languages, Part C (Is that necessary?)Object-Oriented DesignSoftware ArchitectureMathematics for Computer Science (Is that necessary?)The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (Looks interesting)Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to TetrisBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part IIOperating Systems: Three Easy PiecesComputer Networking: a Top-Down ApproachDivide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized AlgorithmsGraph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data StructuresGreedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic ProgrammingShortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About ThemCybersecurity FundamentalsPrinciples of Secure CodingIdentifying Security VulnerabilitiesIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities in C/C++ Programming or Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java ApplicationsDatabases: Modeling and TheoryDatabases: Relational Databases and SQLDatabases: Semistructured DataMachine LearningComputer GraphicsSoftware Engineering: IntroductionEthics, Technology and Engineering (Is that necessary?)Intellectual Property Law in Digital Age (Is that necessary?)Data Privacy FundamentalsAdvanced programmingAdvanced systemsAdvanced theoryAdvanced Information SecurityAdvanced math (Is that necessary?)Any other recommendations is very welcoming!!",10,0.79,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kg5ifd/suggestion_for_my_studies_plan/,2025-05-06 14:12:59,2025-05-12 01:43:50

Are there established best practices or conventions by layer (raw/staging/core) that you follow for datetime handling?2. For wallclock `DATETIME` values (timezone-naive), is it recommended to convert them to a standard timezone-aware format during ingestion?3. Regarding the presentation layer (specifically Looker), should time zone conversions be avoided there to prevent inconsistencies, or are there cases where handling timezones at this layer is acceptable?Any insights or examples of how your teams have handled this would be extremely helpful!Thanks in advance!",10,0.87,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kfjka8/best_practices_for_standardizing_datetime_types/,2025-05-05 18:50:33,2025-05-12 01:43:50

Currently, they mainly want to run batch job pipelines, and a clear requirement is that the orchestration tool must be self-hosted on Kubernetes AND OSS.My initial thought was to go with Apache Airflow, but the growing ecosystem of ""next-gen"" tools (e.g. Dagster, Prefect, Mage, Windmill etc.) makes it hard to keep track of the trade-offs.At the moment, I tend towards either Airflow or Dagster to get somehow started..My key questions:* What are the meaningful pros and cons of Airflow vs. Dagster in real-world deployments?* One key thing could also be that the client wants this platform useable by different teams and therefore a good Multi-tenancy setup would be helpful. Here I see that Airflow has disadvantges compared to most of ""next-gen"" tools like Dagster? Do you agree/disagree?* Are there technical or organizational arguments for preferring one over the other?* One thing that bothers me with many Airflow alternatives is that the open-source (self-hosted) version often comes with feature limitations (e.g. multi-tenant support, integrations, or observability e.g. missing audit logs etc.).

1kh1wtp,First time integrating ML predictions into a traditional DWH — is this architecture sound?,octolang_miseML,dataengineering,"I’m an ML Engineer working in a team where ML is new, and I’m collaborating with data engineers who are integrating model predictions into our data warehouse (DWH) for the first time.We have a traditional DWH setup with raw, staging, source core, analytics core, and reporting layers. The analytics core is where different data sources are joined and modeled before being exposed to reporting.Our project involves two text classification models that predict two kinds of categories based on article text and metadata. These articles are often edited, and we might need to track both article versions and historical model predictions, besides of course saving the latest predictions. The predictions are ultimately needed in the reporting layer.The data team proposed this workflow:1.Add a new reporting-ml layer to stage model-ready inputs.2.Run ML models on that data.3.Send predictions back into the raw layer, allowing them to flow up through staging, source core, and analytics core, so that versioning and lineage are handled by the existing DWH logic.This feels odd to me — pushing derived data (ML predictions) into the raw layer breaks the idea of it being “raw” external data. It also seems like unnecessary overhead to send predictions through all the layers just to reach reporting. Moreover, the suggestion seems to break the unidirectional flow of the current architecture. Finally, I feel some of these things like prediction versioning could or should be handled by a feature store or similar. Is this a good approach? What are the best practices for integrating ML predictions into traditional data warehouse architectures — especially when you need versioning and auditability?Would love advice or examples from folks who’ve done this.",9,0.91,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kh1wtp/first_time_integrating_ml_predictions_into_a/,2025-05-07 16:37:16,2025-05-12 01:43:50

1kfggac,Handling data quality from multiple Lambdas -> DynamoDB on a budget (AWS/Python),BlackLands123,dataengineering,"Hello everyone! :waving_hand:I've recently started a side project using AWS and Python. A core part involves running multiple Lambda functions daily. Each Lambda generates a CSV file based on its specific logic.Sometimes, the CSVs produced by these different Lambdas have data quality issues – things like missing columns, unexpected NaN values, incorrect data types, etc.Before storing the data into DynamoDB, I need a process to:1. Gather the CSV outputs from all the different Lambdas.2. Check each CSV against predefined quality standards (correct schema, no forbidden NaN, etc.).3. Only process and store the data from CSVs that meet the quality standards. Discard or flag data from invalid CSVs.4. Load the cleaned, valid data into DynamoDB. This is a side project, so minimizing AWS costs is crucial. Looking for the most budget-friendly approach. Furthermore, the entire project is in Python, so Python-based solutions are ideal. Environment is AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).**What's the simplest and most cost-effective AWS architecture/pattern to achieve this?**I've considered a few ideas, like maybe having all Lambdas dump CSVs into an S3 bucket and then triggering *another* central Lambda to do the validation and DynamoDB loading, but I'm unsure if that's the best way.Looking for recommendations on services (maybe S3 events, SQS, Step Functions, another Lambda?) and best practices for handling this kind of data validation pipeline on a tight budget.Thanks in advance for your help! :)",3,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kfggac/handling_data_quality_from_multiple_lambdas/,2025-05-05 16:48:16,2025-05-12 01:43:50

1kgvsvx,Automatic datavalidation,-HokageItachi-,dataengineering,"Hi all,My team works extensively with product data in our PIM software. Currently, data validation is a manual process: we review each product individually for logical inconsistencies.

1kg8ndf,Can't really understand the benefits of object oriented programming compared to procedural approach...,travel_through_r,learnprogramming,"Hi! I'm new here, so sorry in advance if I broke some rule.Anyway... During high school, I learned procedural programming (C++), basics of data structures, computer architecture... and as a result, I think I've become somewhat skilled in solving algorithmic tasks.Now at university, I started with object oriented programming (mostly C++ again) and I think that I understand all the basics (classes and objects, constructors/destructors, fields/methods, inheritance...) while all my professors swear that this approach is far better than procedural programming which I used to do (they mostly cite code reusability and security as reason why).The problem is that, even though I already did dozens of, mostly small sized, object oriented programs so far, I still don't see any benefits of it. In fact, it would be easier to me to just make procedural programs while not having to think about object oriented decomposition and stuff like that. Also, so far I haven't see any reason to use inheritance/polymorphism.The ""biggest"" project I did until now is assembler that reads contents of a file with assembly commands and translates it to binary code (I created classes Assembler, SymbolTable, Command... but I could have maybe even easier achieve the same result with procedural approach by simply making structures and global functions that work with instances of those structures).So, my question is: **can someone explain me in simple terms what are the benefits of object oriented programming and when should I use it?**To potentially make things easier to explain and better understand the differences, I even made a small example of a program done with both approaches.So, lets say, you need to create a program ""ObjectParser"" where user can choose to parse and save input strings with some predefined form (every string represents one object and its attributes) or to access already parsed one.Now, let's compare the two paradigms:**1. Procedural:**\- First you would need to define some custom structure to represent object: struct Object { // fields }\- Since global variables are considered a bad practice, in main method you should create a map to store parsed objects: std::map objects;\- Then you should create one function to parse a string from a file (user enters name of a file) and one to access an attribute of a saved object (user provides name of the object and name of the attribute) void parseString(std::map& objects, std::string filename) { // parsing and storing the string } std::string getValue(std::map& objects, std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) { // retrieving the stored object's attribute }\* Notice that you need to pass the map to function since it's not a global object\- Then you write the rest of the main method to get user input in a loop (user chooses to either parse new or retrieve saved object)**2. Object oriented**\- First you would create a class called Parser and inside the private section of that class define structure or class called Object (you can also define this class outside, but since we will only be using it inside Parser class it makes sense that it's the integral part of it).One of the private fields would be a map of objects and it will have two public methods, one for parsing a new string and one to retrieve an attribute of already saved one. class Parser { public: void parseString(std::string filename) { // parsing and storing the string } std::string getValue(std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) { // retrieving the stored object's attribute } private: struct Object { // fields Object(...) { // Object constructor body } } std::map objects; }\* Notice that we use default ""empty"" constructor since the custom one is not needed in this case.\- Then you need to create a main method which will instantiate the Parser and use than instance to parse strings or retrieve attributes after getting user input the same way as in the procedural example.**Discussing the example:**Correct me if I wrong, but I think that both of these would work and it's how you usually make procedural and object oriented programs respectively.Now, except for the fact that in the first example you need to pass the map as an argument (which is only a slight inconvenience) I don't see why the second approach is better, **so if it's easier for you to explain it by using this example or modified version of it, feel free to do it.****IMPORTANT**: This is not, by any means, an attempt to belittle object oriented programming or to say that other paradigms are superior. I'm still a beginner, who is trying to grasp its benefits (probably because I'm yet to make any large scale application).Thanks in advance!**Edit**: Ok, as some of you pointed out, even in my ""procedural"" example I'm using std::string and std::map (internally implemented in OOP manner), so both examples are actually object oriented.

Literally have written hundreds of pages of IT documentation, guides, scripts, etc. Documenting literally everything I do and writing automation to do things easier.My CTO said that the head of dev needed my help with something and I was told that she noticed the way that I document and script and needed my cross-functional knowledge for something that our application (that we sell to clients) does with good documentation and validation.Long story short, she needed a JSON schema so they could make JSON files for something the application does that integrates with IT systems our clients use. Something to define all of the configurations possible and enumerate all the values for each property so that the configuration could be validated by our software's automation. (Most devs know very little about IT infrastructure, so my cross-functional knowledge was know enough of both worlds to be able to make something sensible.)It's such a small thing, but she assigned a task in their dev tracker and I did a PR into a live software project for a company that I work for the first time in my life and even though I'm not a dev (yet!) it's still made me feel like in a small part I'm almost reached that thing that I've literally dreamed of doing for 35 years.I didn't have anyone else to share this with, so I hope you don't mind me sharing the story here.",113,0.97,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kfnfg1/doing_a_dev_thing_in_production_for_the_first_time/,2025-05-05 21:24:37,2025-05-12 01:43:52

It was in JavaScript, which I was learning at the time, and the most important question on the test relied heavily on JavaScript string methods, which I have never memorized (even Python or Java string methods, I'll generally look up).So my question: Does knowing string methods off the top of your head indicate that you are a good programmer? Since you have had so much experience programming that it's trivial to remember and use them?

1kg9bqy,Coming back to software engineering after 25 years,TemperatureStandard6,learnprogramming,"I was a math/CS major in college, and afterwards worked for two years as a software engineer (in Java/SQL). I then switched careers and spent the next 25 years successfully doing something completely unrelated, writing code only extremely occasionally in essentially ""toy"" environments (e.g., simple Basic code in Excel to automate some processes). In the meantime, I sort of missed ""real"" coding, but not enough to switch back careers, and I completely missed all the developments that happened during those 25 years, in terms of tooling, frameworks, etc. Back when I was coding, there was no GitHub, Stack Overflow, Golang, React, cloud, Kubernetes, Microservices, etc., and even Python wasn't really a thing (it existed, but almost nobody was using it seriously in production). I now have an idea for an exciting (and fairly complex) project, and enough time and flexibility (and fire in the belly) to build it myself - at least the initial version to see if the idea has legs before involving other people. Haven't had such an itch to code in 25 years :) So my question is - what is the fastest and most efficient way to learn the modern ""developer stack"" and current frameworks, both to start building quickly and at the same time make sure that whatever I do is consistent with modern best practices and available frameworks? The project will involve a big database on the backend, with a Web client on the frontend, and whatever is available through the Web client would also need to be available via an API. For the initial version, of course I don't need it to support many requests at the same time, but I do want to architect it in a way that it could potentially support a huge number of concurrent requests/be essentially infinitely scalable. I'm not sure where to start ""catching up"" on the entire stack - from tools like Cursor and GitHub to Web frameworks like React to backend stuff - and I am also a bit worried that there are things ""I don't know that I don't know"" (with the things I mentioned, at least I know they exist and roughly understand what they do, but I am worried about ""blind spots"" I may have). There is of course a huge amount of material online, but most of what I found is either super specific and assumes a lot of background knowledge about that particular technology, OR the opposite, it assumes no knowledge of programming at all, and starts out with ""for"" loops and such and moves painfully slowly. I would very much appreciate any suggestions on the above (or any parts of the above) that would help me catch up quickly (obviously not to the expert level on any of these, but to a ""workable"" one) and start building.

1kjdboe,Functional Declarative programming makes no sense to me.,ICEiz,learnprogramming,"Currently close to the end of my 2nd year of uni and one of my classes (computer mathematics and declarative programming) requires to choose a basic coding project and write it in a functional declarative programming style for one of the submissions. The issue is that throughout the whole semester we only covered the mathematics side of functional declarative programming however we never had any practice. I simply cannot wrap my head around the syntax of declarative programming since what I have been learning is imperative. Everywhere i look online shows basic examples of it like ""lst = \[x\*2 for x in lst\]"" and there are no examples of more complex code, e.g. nested loops or branching. On top of this, everywhere that mentions declarative programming they all say that you should not update values throughout the lifespan of the program but that is quite literally impossible. I have spoken to my teacher multiple times and joined several support sessions but i still have no clue how to program declaratively. I understand that i need to ""say what result i want, not how to get to it"" but you still write code in a specific syntax which was simply not exposed to us at a high enough lvl to be able to go and write a small program.

1kjpqui,Looking Things Up When Lost,Embarrassed_Tower_52,learnprogramming,"I’m sharing this experience as context for the title.I've been learning Python fundamentals, and one of the topics I recently explored was working with dictionaries and lists. Yesterday, I started building a simple contact book that uses these structures. The idea was for the program to ask the user how many contacts they'd like to add, and then prompt for each contact’s name, phone number, and email. The goal was to use the name as the key in a dictionary, with the corresponding phone number and email grouped as the value. It also needed to support adding, editing, and deleting contacts.I spent two days stuck on how to cleanly structure this. I figured out how to loop based on the number of contacts entered, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how to group the 2 pieces of information (phone number, email) in a nested way that made sense for a dictionary with the name as Key. After some Googling, I discovered that you could, in one line, create a dictionary with a nested dictionary inside of it. .update({x: {y: z}})Where x is the name, y is the phone number, and z is the email.I felt a bit guilty for not figuring that out on my own. I had tried using a separate dictionary for the values and updating the main contact dictionary with it, but the results were messy. Either older contacts got overwritten, or duplicated data would be printed.All of that to say, I’m wondering if this was one of those learning moments where I should’ve pushed through on my own a bit longer instead of looking it up.

I'm planning to self-study computer science from scratch with the goal of reaching a job-ready (junior-to-mid level) skillset. My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one. Here's my current plan: 1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture. 2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript). 3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects. 4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment. I'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources. ### My Questions:- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?I'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field.

I'm interested in becoming a full stack dev using React on the front and making myself as marketable as possible ideally with .NET as the back-end.A couple years back, I had built a basic CRUD app using Node and Express just to get familiar with back-end concepts, but now I want to go deeper and focus my energy on tools and skills that are actually in demand. Looking at job security, it seems that .NET is a pretty good gamble.So for those of you working in the field:* What back-end tools, frameworks, or skills should I be learning alongside .NET to be job-ready? Things I've read about are Entity Framework Core, DTOs, Repository Pattern etc.* Are there databases, authentication tools, or cloud services that companies expect you to know?* Any tips for someone coming from the front-end world and transitioning to .NET?Appreciate any insight here - I'd love to hear what things I need to learn that'd make me most marketable.Thanks!",5,0.74,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kfqe6h/what_backend_tools_should_i_focus_on_to_become_a/,2025-05-05 23:36:36,2025-05-12 01:43:52

Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. Even in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.But now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.I feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. For those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.But every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role.

However, I can’t help but notice how many people are not really doing what it takes, even in good market, to secure a decent job (ignore 2021-2022, those were anomalously good years, and likely won’t happen again in the near future).What I’ve seen:1. Not searching for internships the summer/fall *before* the summer you want to intern. I literally had someone ask me IRL a few days ago, about my company’s intern program that literally starts next week…. They were focusing on schoolwork apparently in their fall semester , and started looking in the spring.2. Not applying for new grad roles in the same timeline as above. Why did you wait to graduate before you seriously started the job search? 3. Not having projects on your resume (assuming no work xp) because you haven’t taken the right classes yet or some other excuse. Seriously?4. Applying to like 100 roles online, and thinking there’s enough. I went to a top target, and I sent over 1000 apps, attended so many in-person and virtual events, cold DMed people on LinkedIn for informational interviews starting my freshman year. I’m seeing folks who don’t have the benefit of a target school name literally doing less.5. Missing scheduled calls, show up late, not do basic stuff.

I am the best at building front ends, but apparently I'm not the best at figuring out wordle edge cases while people with half my experience stare me.If you are in college for CS, I cannot tell you strongly enough to change your major to business. You're going to put in thousands of applications even when you have a decade of experience and you will have to go through endless interview rounds. Even when you are in demand, you will still need to jump through these endless hoops where people ask you completely useless facts and then smirk at you when you don't figure out the specific edge cases in the worldle app the made you code.Please do not respond to this by saying ""well that's just because it takes 5 interviews to tell whose a good software engineer."" It doesn't. Software engineering is like any other profession, we do not need these endless tests.I feel like I am going crazy and seriously thinking about leaving the industry for one with an actual sane interview process.

If everybody had reasonable hiring processes *like they used to* I would not be as angry even if I were failing them, because at least then I could move on quickly.Edit 2: I am not asking to do away with coding interviews. I think they're dumb but people have been complaining about them for a decade so I understand why companies do them. I'm asking to do away with these ridiculous processes that are 5 rounds *on average* and go back to have 1) a screening call 2) an onsite, 3) and then a reference check, a process which ANY REASONABLE COMPANY should be able to evaluate an employee. Sure ask our coding questions in the onsite, but my god. I interview with startups, who fail thirty percent more often then regular businesses.

As a result, it seems like the amount of work expected to be completed has sharply increased—and ironically enough—the job has gotten more stressful.I used to be assigned several stories per sprint, and could finish them with ample time, all while learning something too. However recently it has felt like since management knows about how AI is, they load us up on our sprints, where I'm getting double the amount of tickets as I was before, and even junior developers are leading entire initiatives of our project, and they too have voiced feelings of intense pressure.As a result of this, I'm starting to feel like my love of programming and problem-solving is dwindling. Each ticket I hardly have the time to truly think about solutions and research and learn, because I'm expected to use AI to grind out the solution and move onto the next. This has made me feel like I'm burning out a bit, because instead of learning things I feel more like a prompt engineer at most and just gluing solutions together and moving onto the next ticket, with little time for anything else because the work volume has drastically increased.Was wondering if anyone else has had feelings similar to this?

I got my current and first job because I was cheap (my starting pay was far below market rate for SE1 role), and the hiring manager was impressed with a systems programming and os architecture project I had on my resume and my github from one of my classes which was written in C. My job uses a techstack of syncfusion c# winform frontend and an old C backend that was originally written before I was even born.I've been spending my free time upskilling, mostly working with .net core & react, and python as I'd like to get a full stack or backend role with a more modern and common techstack. But problem is, every job I've applied to that uses anything remotely modern hasn't given me any call backs. The only jobs I have heard from are ones that I didn't even apply to that want the same thing as my current job does, a cheap junior that knows C.I'm guessing part of the reason why I'm not getting callbacks is not just because of how bad the market is, but because in a recruiters and hiring manager's mind, why take a chance on someone who currently works with something arachic, when you can just get someone who has actual job experience in what they use. How do I get out of being pigeonholed? I tailor my resume to the job I apply to as best I can, but it's not like I can rewrite the experience section of my resume that shows I deal with winforms and C.",48,0.93,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kh3nse/how_to_get_out_of_being_pigeonholed_because_of/,2025-05-07 17:46:49,2025-05-12 01:43:53

I’ve made quite a few projects. The thing is I feel like I’m cheating, because I find a lot of thing pointless to learn when I have full solution from AI in a few seconds. Things that would require me some time to understand, are at my fingertips. I can make a whole project required by my teacher and make it even better than is required, but with AI. Without it I’d have to spend like 4x time to learn things first, but when AI responds with ready code, I understand it, but it would take a lot of time for me to code it ‘that’ way.I enjoy it anyway and spend dozens of hours on projects with AI. I can do a lot with it while understanding the code but not that much without it.What is world’s take on this? How it looks like in corporations? Do they still require us to code something at interviews?

1kf8qw7,Is Your Career Just What People Think of You?,Raladin123,cscareerquestions,"For a long time, I’ve been obsessed with prestige and what people think of me. Only recently have I started to realize that this focus has been damaging.Back in college, I struggled to land strong internships. When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.This past new grad job hunt season was different. I did extremely well. But instead of simply feeling proud, I found myself bringing it up in almost every conversation — how many offers I got, how hard the decision was. My close friends pointed out that my conversations shifted away from hobbies and life to career decisions, leveling systems, and growth.When it came time to choose between job offers, I tried everything to make the “right” decision. I asked all my friends and family. I read every blog and polled every possible forum. I was obsessed with finding the most validated, socially acceptable path — the one society would approve of. Obviously it didn’t work. Eventually, I had to ask myself: *Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing?* And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, **career advancement almost entirely depends on perception.** Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.That’s why I find myself highlighting my accomplishments and leaning toward prestige. I want to be seen as someone worth helping, worth investing in. I want future recruiters to see my resume and not hesitate. But in the process, I’ve started to value prestige more than my own long-term goals and personal values.Choosing between offers this season was especially hard because they represented opposite sides of this internal conflict — one path aligned with prestige, the other with personal fit.Conventional advice says to “stop caring what people think.” But is that even realistic when almost every system in tech (and the world in general) is based on what others think of you and how you're ranked?",27,0.83,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kf8qw7/is_your_career_just_what_people_think_of_you/,2025-05-05 10:58:58,2025-05-12 01:43:53

1ki7tqq,Is now a good time to try and move to big tech?,squarels,cscareerquestions,"I just got a senior promotion working at a startup and I think I've about topped out here salary wise. With benefits and bonus I'm just over 200k but I see all my peers at FAANG with the same YOE getting TC around 300k+.

I’m currently trying to figure out what kind of environment I actually want to work in long term.In particular, how normal is it to see these patterns? I’ve noticed these either as an intern or through reviews online for other startups:* Long hours: e.g. 10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week. Sometimes explicitly stated as part of the culture, other times unstated but clearly expected - people work late, on weekends, etc.* Leadership doesn’t take accountability: when things go wrong, there's no clear ownership from the top. Just a vague sense of we all failed together.* Strict in-office requirement: 5+ days a week in-office, with little or no flexibility for WFH.* Constantly shifting direction or pivoting: roadmaps or priorities changing multiple times a month, with work frequently thrown away.* Unstable policies: things like compensation, time-off policies, or promised benefits being changed or walked back* No mentorship: you're expected to figure things out mostly on your own, even as a junior or new hire.I get that startups are fast-paced, ambiguous, and scrappy, that’s kind of the appeal in some ways. But when several of these things combine, it’s hard to tell if that’s just startup life or if it’s a genuinely unhealthy environment, especially when you're early in your career.So how many of these are just part of the deal when working at an early-stage company?

1kib4yw,Tips on applying to new jobs as junior dev with 1 YOE?,Accipitrim,cscareerquestions,"Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.**((This part is just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**I know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't ""crazy"" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave, but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.All of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.I still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\-----------------------------------------------------I know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",16,0.94,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kib4yw/tips_on_applying_to_new_jobs_as_junior_dev_with_1/,2025-05-09 05:41:09,2025-05-12 01:43:53

I recently turned 30 and am struggling with the reality that I don’t have professional experience in my field. Most of my work has been tied to school projects, so my portfolio isn’t as strong as I’d like.While I don’t consider myself the best or smartest (sometimes I feel the exact opposite), I’ve always been quick to understand things. I’m good at breaking down complex problems, and I’ve received praise for it my entire life. However, discipline has always been a challenge for me. I’ve managed to get by relying on my intellect while doing far less work than I should have. But recently, I’ve started implementing good routines and becoming productive every day.I’m an international student in the U.S., working toward my master’s in Math with a concentration in Computer Science, and my bachelor’s degree was also in CS. All I need to do to graduate is submit my thesis. The pressure is mounting because my time to stay in the country is running out unless I secure a job soon. I’m actually being forced to start using my OPT (limited work eligibility) time to submit my thesis by December and graduate.I feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to compete in the job market despite these challenges. For reference, I’m currently near Houston, Texas. So far, I’ve applied to fewer than 50 jobs. Most of the time, I don’t get responses - sometimes I get rejections - but I’ve never had an interview.For those who have been in similar situations - or those who’ve successfully transitioned into a career without much experience - how did you do it?

Do I have a chance?I know that if I’m given an opportunity in a work environment, I’ll reach a high-performance level very quickly. I just don’t know how to show this potential to employers.

1kftac1,Would a masters degree be worth it?,Wonderful_Analyst_50,cscareerquestions,"I graduated college with a bachelors degree in computer science a while ago and ever since I’ve been living with my parents while doing delivery services like Instacart and uber eats to make money while I try to search for a job as a software engineer. As you can guess I haven’t really gotten anywhere with that. I even attended a software engineering bootcamp last year to try to bolster my resume (may not have been the smartest idea in hindsight but I enjoyed it and met some cool people so I don’t regret it) but still nothing. My family is now trying to push me to apply for a masters program focusing on something like cybersecurity or biotech (which feels a little outside my comfort zone as I wasn’t great at biology) claiming the masters is the final piece I need to make it all come together. Honestly the thought of putting so much more time and money into a field that has had fruitless returns so far gives me a ton of anxiety and I don’t want to come out the other side of it multiple years from now tens of thousands of dollars in debt and be in the same position I’m in now. I was lucky enough that I could get my bachelors degree mostly for free due to my father’s VA benefits but I’d be too old to qualify for that once I get into a masters program so I’d be paying full price this time around. I also burned out pretty hard towards the end of my bachelors (partially due to Covid) and pretty much dragged myself across the finish line so the thought of going back after a few years away is pretty daunting.Ultimately though I know I need to do something and I’m sick and tired of the position I’m in. I feel like I’ve put my life on hold for years trying to start it from the best position possible and I’m at a point where it just doesn’t feel viable anymore. Living with my parents for this long just doing deliveries and job applications every day has made me pretty depressed and I kind of just want to get a regular non-tech job, move out into an apartment with a friend, and figure out my life from there. At the same time though I feel like if a masters degree would genuinely be very useful in the long run, I’m being short sighted and years from now I’d regret not getting it. Especially considering my parents are willing to keep housing me while I go back to school so I’d probably be making my life more difficult by moving out instead, even if it would probably improve my mental health.I do genuinely enjoy coding and would consider myself pretty good at it, but I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about it or anything. I don’t really feel passionate about anything really, I kinda just want to have a good life making comfortable money and not hating my job. When I changed my major to computer science it seemed like a pretty straight shot, I enjoyed it more than my other classes, I was naturally very good at it, and there seemed to be a pretty direct path of internship (check) -> degree (check) -> high paying job (crash and burn). The market crash happened right before I graduated so I found it to be extremely unlucky timing and have pretty much been trying to play catch up ever since.Basically I’m just looking to see if anyone has any thoughts on the usefulness of a masters degree in the current market and if it would be a good use of my time and money or not.

1kfrc6n,MSCS without significant SDE experience - Amazon recruiter wants me to attempt for SDE-2. Should I ask for SDE-1 instead?,PinkSideOfTheFloyd,cscareerquestions,"My background - I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. During my Bachelor's, I had learned Java and OOPS concepts through self-instruction and online resources. After that, I have 4 years of experience in an IT Consulting firm - my job title said ""Consultant."" I mostly worked on production support (incident management and bug fixes) for client projects, primarily on the backend which for the most part, involved a Java-based low code integration development platform and Oracle DB/SQL on the database side. Occasionally, I would use Core Java as and when needed. I also got familiar with version control and CICD concepts.While working on this job, I had been parallelly doing a lot of self learning on fundamental CS topics like Data Structures, Algorithm design and analysis. I eventually left to pursue a Master's in Computer Science where I am currently enrolled. Today, an Amazon recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn to set up an SDE-2 interview. I have been practicing LeetCode and intend to complete at least the Neetcode 150 and Blind 75 in the coming days. My Master's coursework has involved a lot of Low Level Design/Object Oriented Design Patterns and I have been learning High Level System Design from online lecture videos.However, I am not sure if my earlier work experience makes me suitable for an SDE-2 role at Amazon. I haven't really done any significant System Design in my previous role and I am not sure how to deal with the Behavioral/Leadership Principles based rounds where they question you about your earlier work experiences.As I'll be graduating from an MSCS program soon, should I ask the recruiter for an SDE-1 role instead? I'm not sure if she even recruits for SDE-1 and it's not clear if down leveling to SDE-1, in case I meet the SDE-1 bar but not the SDE-2 one, after the interview is an option. I would greatly appreciate any insights on what is advisable given my background.

Therefore a PhD may be neccesary. While i do enjoy NLP, it isnt my dream speciality, but it is adjacent to what i want to do.With the current job market being trash, i also realize how hard it is to get a job within a company, and am afraid that taking a PhD might just worsen my position in 3 years when im done as opposed to gaining experience.

1kin3oq,Returning to Academia to pursue teaching career after years in industry?,PastaRunner,cscareerquestions,"I'm considering planning around a career shift in \~5 years to work towards being a professor in CS. My motivations are1. I really like school/learning and would enjoy getting my masters/doctorate.2. I enjoy teaching + tutoring. And I'm pretty good at it.3. I kinda hate the grind of industry.4. Summers off for my kids5. With an additional 5 years of industry pay I'll have a NW large enough to coast for a very long time on reduced income. Then hopefully in \~10 years I'll be established enough as a professor to make more money within that fieldDownsides1. Industry pays way way more, duh. Average in the cost of school + opportunity cost of not working it's *way way way* more.2. From what I understand, new professors actually just get kicked around as an adjunct for many years and basically treated like studentsI have \~8 years in industry and have worked for some big names like Google and Amazon which I suppose could help get some early career movement as a professor.

1kh9s1s,Job choice,BearWithTopHat,cscareerquestions,"My current company is doing layoffs. I've been told by my direct boss I have a very low chance of being laid off based on my high performance and my recent promotion. Base: 110k Bonus: 20k. Fully remote with no chance of going back in.Because of the layoff announcement I started looking two weeks ago and got an offer at 150k. Bonus is up for debate, but supposedly around 10% of the base. Hybrid 3 days in office. The tech stack is different from my normal one, I've always worked heavy backend java, this would be full stack with C++. I'm fine learning a new stack and front end, and the pay seems good, assuming the bonus can be confirmed. But the 3 days in seems rough. I've never had the displeasure of going into an office before (5 YOE). Always fully remote. If my current job wasnt threatening layoffs I wouldn't consider this at all realistically. To be honest I'm dog shit at interviewing, and I hate leet code, and I almost never get responses from apps, this seemed like a fluke. Additional info: my current company has assigned us 3 new offshore teams, who have taken around 60% of our old workload. We've focused on new things, and have work flowing, but it seems like the goal is for the offshore teams to take more as time passes.Am I being stupid not just taking the confirmed job?
