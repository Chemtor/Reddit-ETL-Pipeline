1mloi5n,Column-level lineage from SQL… in the browser?!,AdNumerous2187,dataengineering,"Hi everyone!Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been working on a small library that generates **column-level lineage** from SQL queries **directly in the browser**.The idea came from wanting to leverage column-level lineage **on the front-end** — for things like visualizing data flows or propagating business metadata.Now, I know there are already great tools for this, like [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) or the [OpenLineage SQL parser](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/sql). But those are built for Python or Java. That means if you want to use them in a browser-based app, you either:* Stand up an API to call them, or* Run a Python runtime in the browser via something like Pyodide (which feels a bit heavy when you just want some metadata in JS :smiling_face_with_tear:)This got me thinking — there’s still a pretty big gap between **data engineering tooling** and **front-end use cases**. We’re starting to see more tools ship with WASM builds, but there’s still a lot of room to grow an ecosystem here.I’d love to hear if you’ve run into similar gaps.If you want to check it out (or see a partially “vibe-coded” demo :grinning_face_with_sweat:), here are the links:* [Repo](https://github.com/nickBes/meta-sql)* [Demo](https://nickbes.github.io/meta-sql/)**Note:** The library is still experimental and may change significantly.",141,0.91,22,https://i.redd.it/aau9eu53ezhf1.png,2025-08-09 12:42:28,2025-08-13 01:45:24
1mjudxc,DuckDB is a weird beast?,Kojimba228,dataengineering,"Okay, so I didn't investigate DuckDB when initially saw it because I thought ""Oh well, another Postgresql/MySQL alternative"". Now I've become curious as to it's usecases and found a few confusing comparison, which lead me to two different questions still unanswered:1. Is DuckDB really a database? I saw multiple posts on this subreddit and elsewhere that showcased it's comparison with tools like Polars, and that people have used DuckDB for local data wrangling because of its SQL support. Point is, I wouldn't compare Postgresql to Pandas, for example, so this is confusion 1. 2. Is it another alternative to Dataframe APIs, which is just using SQL, instead of actual code? Due to numerous comparison with Polars (again), it kinda raises a question of it's possible use in ETL/ELT (maybe integrated with dbt). In my mind Polars is comparable to Pandas, PySpark, Daft, etc, but certainly not to a tool claiming to be an RDBMS.",141,0.96,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mjudxc/duckdb_is_a_weird_beast/,2025-08-07 08:19:14,2025-08-13 01:45:24

1mky6wv,Quantum Odyssey update: now close to being a complete bible of quantum computing for data engineering,QuantumOdysseyGame,dataengineering,"Hey guys,I want to share with you the latest Quantum Odyssey update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post (4 weeks ago), to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists.In a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in ""quantum logic"". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.Although still in Early Access, now it should be completely bug free and everything works as it should. From now on I'll focus solely on building features requested by players.Game now teaches:1. Linear algebra - vector-matrix multiplication, complex numbers, pretty much everything about SU2 group matrices and their impact on qubits by visually seeing the quantum state vector at all times.2. Clifford group (rotations X, Z , S, Y, Hadamard), SX , T and you can see the Kronecker product for any SU2 group combinations up to 2\^5 and their impact on any given quantum state for up to 5 qubits in Hilbert space.3. All quantum phenomena and quantum algorithms that are the result of what the math implies. Every visual generated on the screen is 1:1 to the linear algebra behind (BV, Grover, Shor..)4. Sandbox mode allows absolutely anything to be constructed using both complex numbers and polars.5. Now working on setting up some ideas for weekly competitions in-game. Would be super cool if we could have some real use cases that we can split in up to 5 qubit state compilation/ decomposition problems and serve these through tournaments.. but it might be too early lmk if you got ideas.TL;DR: 60h+ of actual content that takes this a bit beyond even what is regularly though in Quantum Information Science classes Msc level around the world (the game is used by 23 universities in EU via [https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/](https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/) ) and a ton of community made stuff. You can literally read a science paper about some quantum algorithm and port it in the game to see its Hilbert space or ask players to optimize it.Improvements in the past 4 weeks:In-game quotes now come from contemporary physicists. If you have some epic quote you'd like to add to the game (and your name, if you work in the field) for one of the puzzles do let me know. This was some super tedious work (check this patch update [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english) )Big one:We started working on making an offline version that is snycable to the Steam version when you have an internet connection that will be delivered in two phases:Phase 1: Asynchronous Gameplay FlowWe're introducing a system where you no longer have to necessarily wait for the server to respond with your score and XP after each puzzle. These updates will be handled asynchronously, letting you move straight to the next puzzle. This should improve the experience of players on spotty internet connections!Phase 2: Fully Offline ModeWe’re planning to support full offline play, where all progress is saved locally and synced to the server once you're back online. This means you’ll be able to enjoy the game uninterrupted, even without an internet connectionWhy the game requires an internet connection atm?Single player is just the learning part - which can only be done well by seeing how players solve things, how long they spend on tutorials and where they get stuck in game, not to mention this is an open-ended puzzle game where new solutions to old problems are discovered as time goes on. I want players to be rewarded for inventing new solutions or trying to find those already discovered, stuff that requires online and alerts that new solves were discovered. The game branches into bounty hunting (hacking other players) and community content creation/ solving/ rewards after that, currently. A lot more in the future, if things go well.We wanted offline from the start but it was practically not feasible since simply nailing down a good learning curve for quantum computing one cannot just ""guess"".",63,0.89,11,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mky6wv,2025-08-08 15:25:34,2025-08-13 01:45:24
1mkt82k,How can Databricks be faster than Snowflake? Doesn't make sense.,Razzmatazz110,dataengineering,"This article and many others say that Databricks is much faster/cheaper than Snowflake. [https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b](https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b)So I am new to Databricks, and still just in the initial exploring stages. But I have been using Snowflake for quite a while now for my job. The thing I dont understand is how is Databricks faster when running a query than on Snowflake.The Scenario I am thinking is - I got lets say 10 TB of CSV data in an AWS S3 bucket., and I have no choice in the file format or partitioning. Let us say it is some kind of transaction data, and the data is stored partitioned by **DATE** (but I might be not interested in filtering based on Date, I could be interested in filtering by Product ID).1. Now on Snowflake, I know that I have to ingest the data into a Snowflake Internal Table. This converts the data into a columnar Snowflake proprietary format, which is best suited for Snowflake to read the data. Lets say I cluster the table on Date itself, resembling a similar file partition as on the S3 bucket. But I enable search optimization on the table too. 2. Now if I am to do the same thing on Databricks (Please correct me if I am wrong), Databricks doesnt create any proprietary database file format. It uses the underlying S3 bucket itself as data, and creates a table based on that. It is not modified to any database friendly version. **(Please do let me know if there is a way to convert data to a database friendly format similar to Snowflake on Databricks).**Considering that Snowflake makes everything SQL query friendly, and Databricks just has a bunch of CSV files in an S3 bucket, for the comparable size of compute on both, how can Databricks be faster than Snowflake? What magic is that? Or am I thinking about this completely wrong and using or not knowing the functionality Databricks has? In terms of the use case scenario, I am not interested in Machine learning in this context, just pure SQL execution on a large database table. I do understand Databricks is much better for ML stuff.",64,0.83,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mkt82k/how_can_databricks_be_faster_than_snowflake/,2025-08-08 11:58:32,2025-08-13 01:45:24

1molb7d,The most senior guy on my team treats me horribly while others don't really do much,Mathlete7,dataengineering,"I started working at a pretty respected company about three years ago. There was never really a proper learning pathway here. It is more of a watch and try to do it yourself type of setup. Over time I have built a decent number of reports and have become one of the few people on the team who consistently does actual work. Out of a team of 10 it feels like only about three of us really contribute. Honestly it is kind of crazy.The biggest issue I am dealing with is the most senior guy on the team. For some reason he seems to have it out for me. I have taken feedback from plenty of stakeholders without any problem. They treat me with respect. But this guy is never happy with anything I do. I can follow his instructions exactly and he still finds something to criticise. He has even called me names in front of the team and regularly insults my work. I am not claiming to be the best data engineer in the world but I do put in the effort. Meanwhile there are people on the team who have not done real work in months yet he treats them like gold.The tricky part is that despite how he treats me he is the only person I can really go to for help because he knows everything. The problem is if he is wrong about something he will just double down and act like he is right. For example last week he claimed we could not use Power BI for a report because the stakeholder’s PC could not handle it even though I am pretty sure most of the heavy lifting is done by PowerBI.com.The team has been together for over 30 years so even if I went to HR I doubt anyone would back me up. And the newer people would not want to stir the pot since they have it easy getting paid for doing almost nothing.I have mentioned my concerns to my line manager and he says that I am being to sensitive to the feedback on my work and its just how the guy is. There may be some truth to that, but its kinda hard to take feedback when every other comment is laced with a snide/condescending comment Some of the team members say that he's been talking about me on calls for hours after I leave, and I told him that it makes me feel like I am not safe here, to which he said ""That's because you are not safe x"" and the entire call went silent.

Not sure if people are having similar experience but on my team sometimes I feel people either are not aware of what they are doing or don't want to share. Everytime I ask for clarifying questions all i get in response is another question. Nobody is willing to be assertive and I have to reach out to my manager for every small details pertaining to business logic. Thankfully my manager is helful in such scenarios. Technically team mates lack lots of skills,they once laughed that nobody knows SQL on the team to which I was flabbergasted. They certainly lack skills in docker, kubernetes, general database, networking concepts and even basic unit testing, sometimes its really trivial stuff. Now thanks to copilot they are atleast able to sort it out but it really takes considerable time that just keeps delaying our project. Some of the updates that I get in daily stand ups are quite ridiculous like ""I am updating the tables in a database"" for almost 2 weeks which is basically 1 table with regular append. Code is copy pasta from other code bases when I question their implementation i am directed to a different code base from where it was copied and let original author take the responsibility. Lot of times meetings get hijacked by some very trivial things, Saying a bunch of hypothetical things but adding nothing of value.Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. Is this how a normal functioning team looks like? How do you deal with such team members? Sometimes I feel I should just ignore which i do to a degree when it does not impact my work but then ultimately it is causing delays in delivering the project which is very much doable within the timelines. There is definitely atleast 1 person on the team who is a complete misfit for a data engineering role however for god knows why they choose that person. It does seem like typical corporate BS where people portray they are doing a lot when they are not.

We are planning to move to Azure in future, so wondering which back end database would be a good choice. Our top options are Postgres and mongoDb. Postgres is less expensive, and offers good features of a traditional transactional database.However, dynamoDb to Postgres migration would require a lot of functional changes as we move from a Nosql to an RDS. Could someone please weigh in like pros and cons of these two?Another unusual idea floated was - using data bricks as the backend for the UI.

It's built in Rust using Apache Arrow and DataFusion, so it's pretty fast for large datasets.Some of the things it can do (there are currently more than 30 commands):* Basic data inspection (head, tail, schema, metadata, stats)* Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, sampling, deduplication)* Quality checks (outlier detection, search across columns, frequency analysis)* File operations (merging, splitting, format conversion, optimization)* Analysis tools (correlations, binning, pivot tables)The project has grown to include quite a few subcommands over time, but honestly, I'm starting to run out of fresh ideas for new features. Development has slowed down recently because I've covered most of the use cases I personally encounter.If you work with Parquet files regularly, I'd really appreciate hearing about pain points you have with existing tools, workflows that could be streamlined and features that would actually be useful in your day-to-day workThe tool is open source and available through simple command `cargo install nail-parquet`. I know there are already great tools out there like DuckDB CLI and others, but this aims to be more specialized for Parquet workflows with a focus on being fast and having sensible defaults.No pressure at all, but if anyone has ideas for improvements or finds it useful, I'd love to hear about it.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance.**The Current Situation:**We have an ETL pipeline that ingests data from Firestore. The source of this data is JSON outputs generated by the OpenAI API, based on dynamic, client-specific prompts. My boss and the CTO decided that this data should be stored in structured tables in a PostgreSQL database.This architecture has led to two major problems:1. **Constant Schema Changes & Manual Work:** The JSON structure is client-dependent. Every time a client wants to add or remove a field, I receive a request to update the OpenAI prompt. This requires me to manually modify our ETL pipeline and run ALTER TABLE commands on the SQL database to accommodate the new schema.2. **Rigid Reporting Structure:** These PostgreSQL tables directly feed client-facing reports in Metabase. The tight coupling between the rigid SQL schema and the reports makes every small change a multi-step, fragile, and time-consuming process.**My Question:**How can I handle this problem more effectively? I'm looking for advice on alternative architectures or key concepts I should learn to build a more flexible system that doesn't break every time a client's requirements change.**ETL Details:*** The entire pipeline is written in Python.* The data volume is not the issue (approx. 10,000 records daily).

1mlhk5h,Java Spark Questions,Inner_Butterfly1991,dataengineering,"Hey, I used to work at a Scala Spark shop, and we cared a lot about code optimization, we avoided writing UDFs, ensured the vast majority of operations were using the Dataframe API when possible, and although sometimes we had to leverage UDFs that was the exception. We ran all our jobs in batch and were able to run ETL jobs where data was in the 100s of GBs in 10-15 minutes. I recently got a new job at a Java Spark shop, and we use the spark streaming API. Our code starts with a foreach, and all of our code base is assuming we're operating on a single row. But then I took a java spark udemy course and it seems like it's teaching the very thing we're doing in java. But we end up streaming \~20gb of data and our jobs take hours. Now I know we don't even really need to use spark with data that size, but given we have a spark code base, I guess I just have a few questions:1. Is it normal in java spark to use foreach and treat each row differently, and does the java spark engine recognize common transformations written in foreach and leverage it to create a plan that operates on the larger dataframe in a performant fashion? Is the scala logic of ensuring we focus on Dataframe operations rather than row-level UDFs the same in Java? 2. Is java spark, if written well, less performant than Scala Spark? 3. Is it possible that the streaming part could make Spark less performant when looking at \~20gb of data? We're streaming data in json format via Kafka, whereas our Spark Scala batch jobs at my old company were using data both sourced from and creating new parquet files. 2.",7,0.82,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mlhk5h/java_spark_questions/,2025-08-09 05:26:58,2025-08-13 01:45:24

1mnoy85,"Help engineering an optimized solution with limited resources as an entry level ""DE""",echanuda,dataengineering,"I started my job as a ""data engineer"" almost a year ago. The company I work for is pretty weird, and I'd bet most of the work I do is not quite relevant to your typical data engineer. The layman's way of describing it would be a data wrangler. I essentially capture data from certain sources that are loosely affiliated with us and organize them through pipelines to transform them into useful stuff for our own warehouses. But the tools we use aren't really the industry standard, I think?I mostly work with Python + Polars and whatever else might fit the bill. I don't really work with spark, no cloud whatsoever, and I hardly even touch SQL (though I know my way around it). I don't work on a proper ""team"" either. I mostly get handed projects and complete it on my own time. Our team works on two dedicated machines of our choice. They're mostly identical, except one physically hosts a drive that is used as an NFS drive for the other (so I usually stick to the former for lower latency). They're quite beefy, with 350G of memory each, and 40 processors each to work with (albeit lower clock speeds on them).I'm not really sure what counts as ""big data,"" but I certainly work with very large datasets. Recently I've had to work with a particularly large dataset that is 1.9BB rows. It's essentially a very large graph network, with 2/2 columns being nodes, and the row representing an outgoing edge from column\_1 to column\_2. I'm tasked with taking this data, identifying which nodes belong to our own data, and enhancing the graph with incoming connections as well. e.g., a few connections might be represented likeA->BA->CC->Bwhich can extrapolate to incoming connections like soB<-AB<-CA<-CWell, this is really difficult to do, despite the theoretical simplicity. It would be one thing if I just had to do this once, but the dataset is being updated daily with hundreds of thousands of records. These might be inserts, upserts, or removals. I also need to produce a ""diff"" of what was changed after an update, which is a file containing any of the records that were changed/inserted.My solution so far is to maintain two branches of hive-partitioned directories - one for outgoing edges, the other for incoming edges. The data is partitioned on a prefix of the root node, which ends up making it workable within memory (though I'm sure the partition sizes are skewed for some chunks, the majority fall under 250K in size). Updates are partitioned on the fly in memory, and joined to the main branches respectively. A diff dataframe is maintained during each branch's update, which collects all of the changed/inserted records. This entire process takes anywhere from 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on the update size. And for some reason, the reverse edge updates take 10 times as long or longer (even though the reverse edge list is already materialized and re-used for each partition merge). As if it weren't difficult enough, a change is also reflected whenever a new record is deemed to ""touch"" one of our own. This requires integrating our own data as an update across both branches, which simply determines if a node has one of our IDs added. This usually adds a good 20 minutes, with a grand total maximum runtime of 1.3 hours.My team does not work in a conventional sense, so I can't really look to them for help in this matter. That would be a whole other topic to delve into, so I won't get into it here. Basically I am looking here for potential solutions. The one I have is rather convoluted (even though I summarized it quite a bit), but that's because I've tried a ton of simpler solutions before landing on this. I would love some tutelage from actual DE's around here if possible. Note that cloud compute is not an option, and the tools I'm allowed to work with can be quite restricted. But please, I would love any tips for working on this.

1mogizo,Data warehouse for a small company,rod_motier,dataengineering,"Hello.I work as a PM in a small company and recently the management asked me for a set of BI dashboards to help them make informed decisions. We use Google Workspace so I think the best option is using Looker Studio for data visualization. Right now we have some simple reports to allow the operations team to download real-time information from our database (AWS RDS) since they lack SQL or programming skills. The thing is these reports are connected directly to our database so the data transformation occurs directly in Looker Studio, sometimes using complex queries affects the performance causing some reports to load quite slowly.So I've been thinking maybe it's the right time for setting up a Data Warehouse. But I'm not sure if it's a good idea since our database is small (our main table storages transactions and is roughly 50.000 rows and 30 MiB). It'll obviously grow, but I wouldn't expect it to grow exponentially.Since I want to use Looker Studio, I was thinking on setting up a pipeline that replicates the database in real time using AWS DMS or something, transfer the data to Google BigQuery for transformation (I don't know what the best tool would be for this) and then use Looker Studio for visualization.

1mo14fm,Batch processing 2 source tables row-by-row Insert/Updates,_GoldenDoorknob_,dataengineering,"Hi guys,I am looking for some advice on merging 2 source tables , to update a destination table (which is a combination of both table). Currently I am doing select queries on both tables ( I have a boolean which showcases if the record has been replicated (for both table). To fetch the record, then I see if the record based on a UID column exists in the destination table. If not, i insert (currently the one table can insert before the other, which leads to the other source table to do a update on the UID). So, when the records (UID) exists, i need to update certain columns in the destination table. Currently I am looping (python) through the columns of that record and doing a update (on the specific column). The table has 150+ columns, the process is being triggerd by Eventbridge (for both source tables), and the proicessing is being done in AWS Lambda.

1mng31f,Stay at contract job or join Mentor’s company,PM_ME_MEMES_PLZ,dataengineering,"This is a very specific question and the answer might be obvious but looking for opinions that aren’t my parents or friends. All numbers in usdI’m currently in a good stable holding pattern for my work but it’s basically just money with not a ton of growth. I’m currently at a large f500 firm as a contractor making ~85/hour doing a regular 9-5. I’m also doing what is equivalent to 20 hours a week at 150/hour for my mentors new consulting startup, the work is all deliverable based so I’m doing it all before and after the contract job to keep things ethical.My work life balance is ok but not awesome, I have time on weekends to go on trips but my weeks are pretty packed and the contract role wants me to be going into the office minimum twice a week which is fine but a little exhausting.My mentor approached me and has another gig that would pay 40 hours a week through this new consulting startup and he’s asking me to come on full time at this startup, still do the 20 hours I’m currently doing and then do these 40 hours at roughly 100/hour. The gig is for three months but there would likely be more work after the three months but obviously there’s zero guarantee.Contractor role doesn’t really have healthcare and no pto so it would be a raise per hour and since the work is deliverable based rather than a corporate 9-5 I’ll have more flexibility to take time off as long as my work is keeping up.I think this current contract gig is probably pretty stable, there was a round of layoffs recently but I’m on a pretty critical tech project so I could probably just coast here if I wanted to but it’s been made reasonably clear that fte conversions are gonna be on hold since the purse strings are held pretty close. It’s essentially a money printing machine as long as things go well enough.I’m 25, no kids so my gf, parents and friends are all telling me to full send it since on paper it’s more money, way better leadership and if it takes off I’m lining myself up to be the most senior consultant on the team but just looking for more opinions.",3,0.62,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mng31f/stay_at_contract_job_or_join_mentors_company/,2025-08-11 15:28:43,2025-08-13 01:45:24

There exists mainly two types of data ingestions 1) realtime data ingestion (happening through kafka events-->snowpipe streaming--> snowflake Raw schema-->stream+task(transformation)--> Snowflake trusted schema.) and 2)batch data ingestion happening through (files in s3--> snowpipe--> snowflake Raw schema-->streams+task(file parse and transformation)-->snowflake trusted schema).In both the scenarios, data gets stored in snowflake traditional tables before gets consumed by the enduser/customer and the transformation is happening within snowflake either on teh trusted schema or some on top of raw schema tables.Few architects are asking to move to ""iceberg"" table which is open table format. But , I am unable to understand where exactly the ""iceberg"" tables fit here. And if iceberg tables have any downsides, wherein we have to go for the traditional snowflake tables in regards to performance or data transformatione etc? Snowflake traditional tables are highly compressed/cheaper storage, so what additional benefit will we get if we keep the data in 'iceberg table' as opposed to snowflake traditional tables?

The frontend is nearly done and I am planning on optimizing my pipeline. However I do have another idea for a project but I don't know if it is possible. Context My project is related to MMA. Essentially there is a term called ""MMA Math"". It's a derogatory term used to diminish one-dimensional analysis of upcoming fights. Essentially just because fighter A beats fighter B and fighter B beats fighter C, it doesn't necessarily mean fighter A beats fighter C. This is because fighting style, age, psychology and chance all play a role. ""Styles make fights"" as the saying goes. However, no one has ever concretely proven or disproven MMA math. It could just be confirmation bias.Objective -Create a database that tracks all fights between all fighters. Add weights for fights that occur higher up in rank, fights that happen in their prime and between fighters who already fought each other. The fights will also have meta data like how it ended, strikes and takedown landed etc.Questions -I'm not too sure but I think a graph database would be a good place to start as graphs represents relationships between nodes.However, I want this project to look good on my CV and I know graph databases are not very popular and in-demand in the market.I also don't know how queryable graph databases are.Likewise, I don't know where to get the data from.",3,0.72,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mj3i7s/is_my_project_feasiblerealistic_need_a_reality/,2025-08-06 12:37:07,2025-08-13 01:45:24

Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.**Stop obsessing about languages**Everyone's like ""which language should I learn???"" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff.JS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.**What companies acutally look for**I've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough.Your starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch.One of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**One legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes.If you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af?As for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.**Find ppl who get it**You need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click.Stack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better!I was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.**Just. Pick. Something**""People keep saying mixed things about X"" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru.Every ""wrong"" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time.Also don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.**The secret sauce**Consistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways.I still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like ""damn I'm good at this"". It's normal.Hit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.Edit 1: Been getting a bunch of dмs with similar questions — I’ll write small posts on Medium / [Substack](http://typedweekly.com) so it’s easier to share in next days.",734,0.93,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mlmi7k/been_coding_for_5ish_years_talked_to_about_a/,2025-08-09 10:49:13,2025-08-13 01:45:25

For someone just starting their programming journey now, what would you recommend they focus on?Some specific questions I'm wondering about:\- Are traditional fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, etc.) still as crucial when AI can handle a lot of implementation?\- Which programming languages or technologies seem most future-proof right now?\- What soft skills or ways of thinking are becoming more important as the technical barriers lower?\- How should new programmers approach learning alongside AI tools rather than competing with them?I'd love to hear from both experienced developers and fellow newcomers about what you think will matter most going forward.

It makes interpretation slower, consumes more memory, hurts code readability, and is difficult to get used to reading/writing. Additionally, the 'solution' of using a type's name in a variable's name just defeats the point of typing dynamically, in addition to making its name clunky. Dynamic typing does not even serve its own special purpose. You want polymorphism: use inheritance.

1mm9of2,The approach that finally made data structures click after months of struggling,CreditOk5063,learnprogramming,"I spent a solid several months grinding LeetCode. Hundreds of problems. I memorized all the common patterns, read every top-voted solution... but still couldn’t solve new problems without getting stuck.It finally clicked that I wasn’t actually *understanding* anything, I was just getting really good at pattern matching.I realized since I started drawing every data structure out by hand—arrays, trees, linked lists, everything. Visualizing how they behave in memory made stuff like recursion and pointers suddenly make sense. I also began explaining my solutions to myself, and every time I stumbled, it exposed what I didn’t really understand. However, if you wanna make great progress, you also need feedback to every explanation. I used Beyz for record and suggestions,but there are many similar software available on the market now. You can choose the one that is the most affordable. Later, I tried re-implementing basic structures in 3 different languages, Python, JavaScript, and Java, just to separate concept from syntax. It helped a ton.Now, I spend more time on *why* a solution works than memorizing *what* the solution is. It feels slower, but it’s way more durable.Anyone else go through this shift?

1mlnc7i,Why most programming beginners struggle: evaluation,wordbit12,learnprogramming,"I'm a CS student who's really into metacognition and how people learn programming. I get to see lots of students at university and talk with them about their code (sometimes JavaScript), and I've noticed something that I think is a huge problem.The fundamental concept that causes the most trouble for beginners is that **they don't understand evaluation** \- what it actually means to evaluate an expression until it becomes a value.People always say universities are rigorous and full of definitions, but they (or at least my university) seem to completely fail at teaching the definitions that actually matter. I can't count how many friends have told me that programming suddenly ""clicked"" once they understood these basic definitions:* **Value**: an expression that evaluates to itself* **Evaluation**: transforming an expression, step by step, into a valueOnce you get this, everything else builds naturally. Assignment makes sense because it's basically a function that takes two arguments: a name and a value. If there's an expression on the right side, you have to evaluate it first, step by step. Functions only accept values, so arguments have to be evaluated first - boom, functional composition becomes way easier to understand. and same for functions calls, because the student start seeing the call as an operator that takes a function on its left, not just syntax to memorize.Later when you study first-class functions, a statement like ""functions are values"" actually makes sense. Students start asking the right questions: ""But what kind of value? How does it look?"" And that naturally leads to closures and understanding that the value contains a reference to the environment where the function was defined.Here's the thing - I truly believe understanding these basic concepts early helps students ask the right questions. When they face something unexpected with a new expression, the first thing they think is ""How does this evaluate? There must be some evaluation rules.""I think all CS 101 classes should start with (or at least teach at some points) these fundamentals: evaluation, values, the difference between statements and expressions, etc. Instead we get thrown into syntax and algorithms without understanding what's actually happening under the hood.

Here’s what I learned after finishing the course,FrozenFan123,learnprogramming,"I recently finished the Codefinity course after wrapping up CS50, and I wanted to share my honest experience for anyone wondering if it’s worth the investment.Before Codefinity, I had a decent grasp of Python basics from CS50, but I struggled with building real projects on my own. Codefinity’s step-by-step lessons were great for breaking down concepts into manageable chunks, and I found the small projects really helpful for practicing what I learned.That said, it’s not perfect some parts felt slow, and if you’re already confident with basics, you might find it a bit repetitive. Still, it gave me the structure and confidence to move from “I know Python syntax” to actually building things I can show.For those interested, my goal is to eventually work in robotics, and I’ve been using a Raspberry Pi alongside the course to try out small hardware projects. The combination has been helpful to connect coding with real-world applications.I’d love to hear from others who’ve tried Codefinity did it help you move forward?

I have already completed my diploma back in 2020, and gotten mostly through my BSc, and finished more than 90% of the program. Because of a recent change in my financial situation, I need more cash in order to finish it. I want to get work that uses the skills I learned, specifically in low-level languages such as C, C++, or assembly, and leverages my knowledge of network security.After consulting with people who know more about the hiring process than I do, I was told that the projects I have on my resume are not sufficient evidence of said skills. Because of this, I have to work on projects that would resolve this issue. I was advised to volunteer for organizations that would need computer science skills. There are a couple of options I came up with independent of the career agent's advice, but upon their review they only gave encouragement:* Contribute to open source projects* Create an indie gameObviously the path towards creating an indie game is, at the high level, straightforward. In spite of this, such games require time and creativity to reach completion.

For example, **PHP** used to be huge, powering a massive chunk of the web. What do you think led to its decline in popularity compared to other options?

The code is written in Python.TL;DR:1. Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.2. Next, implement the base case.3. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.4. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.5. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.I also go into why so many other tutorials fail to explain what ""leap of faith"" actually is and the unstated assumptions they make. There's also the explanation for the concept that ChatGPT gives, and how it matches the deficiencies of other recursion tutorials.I also have this absolutely demented (but technically correct!) implementation of recursive factorial: def factorial(number): if number < 0: raise Exception('number must be a positive integer') if number % 1 != 0: raise Exception('number must be an integer') if number == 100: # BASE CASE return 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000 elif number < 100: # RECURSIVE CASE return factorial(number + 1) // (number + 1) else: # ANOTHER RECURSIVE CASE return number * factorial(number - 1)",4,0.84,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mlyrcl/the_recursive_leap_of_faith_explained/,2025-08-09 20:01:11,2025-08-13 01:45:25

1mk4wz0,[Project] My first actually useful C# project – a simple wallpaper switcher (WinForms/.NET 9),YangLorenzo,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone! :waving_hand:I'm excited to announce **WallpaperSwitcher 3.0**, the latest release of my first actually useful C# WinForms project!#### What is WallpaperSwitcher?A minimal, fast, and practical desktop wallpaper switcher for Windows (8/10/11), written in C# with WinForms and .NET 9. It allows you to manage wallpaper folders and switch wallpapers with ease—ideal for those who prefer static wallpapers and want something simpler than Wallpaper Engine.**Core Features**:* **Next wallpaper**: Switch wallpapers with a click.* **Folder management**: Add, remove, or switch between wallpaper folders.* **Hotkey support**: Assign hotkeys to switch wallpapers or folders quickly.* **Startup support**: Enable launch on Windows startup.* **System tray support**: Runs in the background with tray icon support—hotkeys still work.* **Settings UI**: Easily manage folders, hotkeys, and other settings via a dedicated window.* **Two wallpaper switch modes**: * **Native Mode**: Uses Windows SlideShow API (smoother but slower switching). * **Custom Mode**: Direct wallpaper setting via Win32 API (faster, emulates slideshow behavior).#### Why I built thisAs a long time **Wallpaper Engine** user, I started growing tired of dynamic wallpapers high power usage, choppy animations during frequent `Alt + Tab`, and lack of portability made me look for alternatives. I began using static wallpapers manually and realized I didn’t need all those extra features. I just wanted a fast, reliable wallpaper switcher and so I built one.Originally considered WPF, WinUI 3, or even Avalonia, but chose **WinForms** for its simplicity and low learning curve. I was able to build a working prototype in just a few hours after watching some tutorials and reading Microsoft docs.--- **What’s new in 3.0.0*** :check_mark_button: Full settings UI (no more editing config files manually!)* :check_mark_button: Hotkey system* :check_mark_button: Dual wallpaper switch modes: Native vs Custom* :check_mark_button: Better folder switching logic* :check_mark_button: System tray + auto-start support* :check_mark_button: UI improved using hand-written `.Designer.cs` (more on that below :backhand_index_pointing_down:)---**About the UI**I initially relied on Visual Studio’s WinForms Designer. But I wanted a cleaner, more modern look—something like Java Swing’s *FlatLaf*. I couldn’t find a suitable theming library for WinForms, so I turned to AI assisted code transformation.I uploaded my `*.Designer.cs` files and asked AI to refactor the UI styling. After several iterations, I got a design I was happy with. The catch? The updated UI broke Designer compatibility in Visual Studio so now I maintain the UI purely via code. It’s a tradeoff, but acceptable for a mostly stable project.---**Architecture decisions*** **Two-project structure**: * `WallpaperSwitcher.Core`: Logic layer (hotkeys, folder mgmt, wallpaper APIs). * `WallpaperSwitcher.Desktop`: UI layer (WinForms).* Started with `DllImport + SystemParametersInfo`, later switched to `LibraryImport` for better AOT support.* Eventually migrated all native API calls to **[CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32)**. This made the code much cleaner and easier to manage—highly recommended if you deal with Windows APIs.---**Tech stack*** C# (.NET 9)* WinForms* CsWin32 (for Windows API interop)* Visual Studio + Rider (design/code split)---:package: **Project & Source Code**:backhand_index_pointing_right: GitHub: [https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher](https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher)Any feedback, suggestions, or code critiques would be super appreciated. I'm still learning C# and desktop development in general, and I’ve learned **a ton** during this project—especially around COM interop, hotkey registration, and Windows APIs.Thank you all for reading! :folded_hands:If you’re someone like me who just wants a simple, no bloat wallpaper switcher give it a try!",3,0.72,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mk4wz0/project_my_first_actually_useful_c_project_a/,2025-08-07 16:35:06,2025-08-13 01:45:25

Often times, I find myself wanting to build multiple projects, contribute to existing ones, or learn new technologies. The problem is I can only focus on one task at a time. These tasks usually require deep focus, making it impossible to effectively switch between them.For example, I have a couple of pet projects, and when I return to either of them to make some changes, it always feels like starting from scratch - learning the codebase again, figuring out the code logic. Every time. Another example is coding in different languages. If I spend some time with one language or framework, it inevitably leads to forgetting stuff from other languages, and when I switch them, I usually spend more time recalling the stuff I forgot than advancing. It feels like an uphill battle all the time. I'm sure some people manage to overcome these struggles, and so I'm asking - how do you juggle multiple projects, stacks effectively, without losing step at any of them?

1ml4dvy,JavaScript or Python for Backend?,IronTheSniper,learnprogramming,"I know this is a very broad question but I’ve been self studying full-stack the entire summer and will be starting my CS classes this fall for college. I never really knew what type of position I wanted in the SWE industry so I kind of selected a stack prematurely. After using JavaScript for about 2 months and doing some leetcode easy problems, I found that solving problems really excites me. Even though I’d sometimes look up the solution when I didn’t understand the problem, just being able to sit and read the code and study it contributed a lot to my learning. My original plan after spending some time with full-stack was to just learn programming with JavaScript, do all the nit and gritty, get a job, then pivot into AI/ML or AWS. From what I see I think companies nowadays value specialization more than generalization. I’m starting to think maybe I had it all backwards and should’ve committed to a single stack rather than a full stack. I tried surfing subreddits for similar experiences but always came across mixed opinions. Overall, I like backend and I’m willing to learn it with Python or Java (my cs classes will be taught in either of these), JavaScript is cool but I don’t think it’s healthy to learn with a tool I’m not passionate in using.

1mk8zj6,The fact that ChatGPT 5 is barely an improvement shows that AI won't replace software engineers.,cs-grad-person-man,cscareerquestions,"I’ve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it’s evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It’s like we’re hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.That’s a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn’t there yet.So yeah, the tech is cool and it’ll keep getting better, but the progress isn’t revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers’ lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It’s great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won’t be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.I know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.What are your thoughts?",4311,0.91,885,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mk8zj6/the_fact_that_chatgpt_5_is_barely_an_improvement/,2025-08-07 19:07:34,2025-08-13 01:45:27

This puts the burden of proof on the company to show they are hiring Americans. Harder to loophole this.2. This is more like EV/Clean Energy incentives rather than tariffs. It's a transfer payment from American companies that outsource to American companies that hire Americans.3. This is not targetting H-1Bs/immigrants. H-1Bs are separate but atleast they recycle money back into the American economy. I get it that PhDs and top talent should come to the US, I am not targetting H-1Bs but rather targetting outsourcing.4. Rich tech companies that earn more money will get hit harder by corporate tax rate and thus need a larger American payroll to get credits. How much Americans a company needs to hire is proportional to the amount of money they make.5. We are hiring the best. We want to make an 150k American salary = 40k Overseas Salary + 110k in missed rebates. Now that both hiring and Americans and overseas cost 150k, please hire the best.6. No extra tax cost to give rebates. The funds come from higher corporate tax rate. It will be a transfer payment from outsourcing companies to ones that are hiring American.7. It's a free market, but why do big oil, big pharma, military industrial complex get protectionism but American citizens don't?",313,0.77,444,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mm4jbh/how_to_incentivize_hiring_americans_to_stop/,2025-08-10 00:20:51,2025-08-13 01:45:27

Recently I got laid off due to ""business org restructuring"" bullshit yada yada.The problem I'm having isn't the job search itself, it sucks but it's always sucked and it always will suck because Capitalism is designed to suck us of our willpower to make us forfeit our deserved remittance in favour of ending the drudgery ASAP. That hasn't changed, though. It's always been that way.The problem isn't leetcode, because as stupid as the whole concept is fundamentally, I'm at least good enough at it to be able to handle them with some modicum of confidence, in spite of it being completely irrelevant to any work in the field.The problem isn't interviews, because in spite of this job being fairly insular (although not as much as most people believe), I have good soft skills from my last job especially being very interactive with many different teams.The problem is that *I fucking hate what tech has become in 2025.*90% of job ads are for gambling sites, crypto sites (but I repeat myself), or AI bullshit that's draining society for every penny it's worth while putting people out of their jobs without any plan for what happens when vast swathes of the population are trained in unemployable fields. It's feeding into a regime that I will withhold my feelings about so as not to get too political, but suffice it to say I vehemently disagree with. The rest of the job ads are so hotly contested and so few and far between that I have barely any shot of competing for them, and even those jobs are still mildly problematic, but at least it's only in the same old ways that they've always been (ie. Banking, marketing).Sorry if this has been said before by others but the feeling of needing to sell my soul to these companies that are speedrunning societal destruction makes me want to throw myself into a river rather than prostrate myself at their feet hoping a little bit of their plundered wealth trickles into my pockets.",255,0.87,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mk6djb/is_anyone_else_disenfranchised_with_tech/,2025-08-07 17:29:36,2025-08-13 01:45:27

The roles I applied to I either thought I'd absolutely love working there, or they would be a great fit for the specific skill set I was starting to build for myself. 3 YOE did turn out to be the edge of non-senior: I was offered a senior role by one company, a non-senior for another, and rejected by a third company because I wasn't quite senior enough.

1misk9a,"Vent: suddenly let go, feeling unmotived to finish the work week",tobythestrangler,cscareerquestions,"Hey all, I’ve been working as an intern at a small professional services firm since May of last year (so ~1.5 years now). What started as a short summer internship got extended **four times**, every time with vague mentions that I’d be offered a full-time role once ""we finish X"" or ""get through Y.""In the beginning, I was doing analytics-focused work, i.e., building dashboards, eda/reporting for clients, simple regression tasks. It was great. Then, as the team realized more of the analytics was internally focused, we decided to stop client work and migrate our dashboards into the company website. That’s when things shifted. Since I have a background in data science + some experience with full-stack dev, I became the one spearheading the dashboard migration effort.For the next 6+ months, I’ve collaborated directly with the dev team, learning React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Docker, Task Scheduling, and D3.js on the fly. It was messy but fulfilling. We were building these tools with hope of scaling them into client-facing tools eventually.Throughout this, my boss kept saying I’d be the one maintaining these dashboards and owning future projects, especially because I had context on both the data and the dev side. I even got **another** project last month, again with the implication that I was part of long-term plans.Fast forward to now: all three projects are basically done. The dashboards work, the visuals take in prod data, and we’re just ironing out some small aesthetic issues + a rework of some GraphQL logic for one proejct. At 9am today, I get a calendar invite for an ""exit interview."" No warning. I talk to my boss and he flatly tells me my last day is next week (August 11), and to have everything wrapped up and documented by then. That’s it.No full-time offer. No more extensions. No transition into another role. Just ""thanks and bye.""Honestly, I’m kind of heartbroken. I poured so much time into this place. Took on projects well outside my scope. Built tools that no one else had the technical background for. I **thought** I was doing everything right. My coworkers were surprised to hear I wasn’t being kept. It’s not just me imagining this either. My boss has consistently dragged his feet on giving me a real answer about my future here.Truthfully, I didn’t even really ""work"" today. I spent most of it job hunting and planning to use up my accrued PTO before I go. I’m in grad school part-time (1 year left), which I think has scared off a few employers. And it's all starting to sting a bit... Especially since I've grown close to my coworkers and enjoyed the work. Side note: this is the second time I've been let go. My first job out of college started as an internship but was extended to full time. However, the company laid me off due to budget slashing post-covid. This time around feels very different.Is it normal to feel like this? To feel like it’s not worth pushing these final 2% of features anymore? Am I being unprofessional by mentally checking out a week before I’m done?I just feel burned out, a bit betrayed, and unsure of what’s next.

My domain is mobile development.I feel I am able to get the job done for the most part, and it is mostly functionally correct as well. However, I always end up making mistakes that seem obvious, and that end up reducing all my work to a zero.Two instances come to mind, among many:1. I was tasked to create a bottom sheet using a Figma design as a reference. I got too caught up in the functionality, which I did implement correctly for the most part. But the bottom sheet was supposed to show over all the other components in the UI, which I forgot to do. My team lead reviewed the task and pointed it out to me.2. I created another bottom sheet that was supposed to have a certain appearance in both landscape and portrait mode. I was able to implement it correctly, and tested it in both orientations, as well as landscape -> portrait and portrait -> landscape (or so I thought). Later, it was discovered that despite my thorough testing, i missed the portrait->landscape scenario, leading to the UI looking bad. Once again, an obvious mistake that should have been avoided and pointed to me by my team lead.It is a problem because ""needs to get better at testing"" has appeared far too many times in my performance review which comes every 3 months and instances like these are cited to me far too often.We only get performance based increments, and because of this, I have never been able to get one, as I believe their perception of me is ""Makes too many obvious mistakes"".I have tried the advice of ""write down all test cases beforehand"", but as scenario 2 shows, even that doesn't stop me from making errors like those.I seem to have hit a wall, one that I can't get over.Has anyone ever faced a problem like this before?

Most people in the tech industry will financially make it. Savings, cost cuttings, switching to trades. It's gonna be okay. But the rejection, the rejection smarts.

The more intense, algorithm-heavy, grindy SWE work doesn’t excite me.What I am really good at is managing, organizing, and coordinating. I thrive when I’m planning, running projects, and keeping people on track.

I told him explicitly I can't work from 5PM - 7PM, but could work after that.

He would say things like ""where are you working from"", ""when did you start working today"", ""how many hours have you been working"", stuff like thatHe tried scheduling a meeting at 6pm my time. I told him, I could not make it to this time and he would have to schedule it at either 4pm or 7:30pm. He took a heavy amount of offense to this and started saying some cryptic stuff about how it's not acceptable that I ""disappear"" at that time.

1mnu6m1,Career Advice,theshiningstars-,cscareerquestions,"Hey CS crew! I’m truly stuck. Severely depressed. I haven’t had a job in over a year now. It’s been a constant battle. I was a Software Engineer at a major automotive company. Last year, i spent the first 8 months not working looking for SWE jobs, that didn’t get me anywhere. No responses. No interviews. Just idle. The last couple months I decided maybe it’s time for me to make a switch into Solutions Engineering. Does anyone have any advice on this? I just feel that competing with people who are extremely talented when it comes to coding won’t put me in a good spot. I’m rusty with coding (out of practice), but I’ve also never been phenomenal at it. An average joe engineer. I’m just exhausted. Everyday I study something new for a company hoping I get somewhere. I don’t imagine myself doing leetcode questions everyday and studying like I’m back in college again. It seems so unfair. I went to college. I did the work. I have the degree. I want to work and make money. I’m dedicated and ambitious, but that is not enough for this career. I need some guidance. I’m at a halt and feel so hopeless. I feel that my career is going down the drain. I’m in more debt now than I was when I was a teen and working at a coffee shop. Endless amount of studying for a few interviews that have gotten me nowhere. There’s just so much information in the technology world, it’s overwhelming. I’m at a loss.

1mnmy0d,Help Me Pull Out Of My Career Nosedive,Patmurf,cscareerquestions,"First and foremost, thank you for even clicking on this. I'm going to lay out my career path, how I got here, and essentially ask for help on what I need to do to get out of this dead end in the next six to 12 months.Very long story short, one unexpected kid at 20 and I didn't get my college degree until 2019 at the age of 33. It was incredibly brutal to get there but I had a compsci degree from the University of Minnesota.Despite that, all of my efforts at job fairs were a bust. My best guess was my age was a factor, but I can't know. Regardless, the only job I could get my hands on at graduation was for a local embedded linux hardware company of \~400 employees for \~$70k. It was a bit of a tough pill to swallow given all of the guys I studied with (and often performed better than) landed at either Amazon or Target for significantly more money.I got some moderate Yocto experience and enough C++ to know I'd rather write in straight C than untangle legacy bowls of spaghetti. Covid hit almost immediately after I was hired and my subpar wage dipped into straight up rough territory within a year. When they called me back into the office I said no and flailed to look for a new job.That too was utterly brutal. I only really had \~1.5yrs of Yocto/embedded experience and was still very green. The only job I could find was a remote gig in another embedded device company in Fargo. The pay was $100k. It wasn't great, but it was a raise, and they promised me I would continue my embedded Yocto experience. This struck me as a deal as I could continue to transport my kids to school and work on the same skillset. Id eventually be a marketable embedded developer in +/- 3 years I felt.It was also a lie. I never, ever touched anything embedded, leaving all of my experience at my first job to largely rot before I could get it to the magic ""5 years"" point. Instead it was secretly full Reactjs/Swift/XCode/C# userspace server code. I now have \~3.5 years of that when my company was bought and I was thrown out of that team into a.... yocto embedded team. I now have 6 more months of experience there. Most of that time was spent remembering things I had completely forgotten.I have been looking for a job to get off this roller coaster since early 2023. I barely even get callbacks. I've gotten two interviews. One was a dud, the other was a trap that offered me $80k without asking me a single tech question. I know this Reddit is aware of the pitfalls and stressors of looking for a job in this field right now so there is no reason to go further.My work history is essentially in shambles and looks horrible on paper from all this thrashing. Both companies do not have names that make my resume stand out in any meaningful way. I realize (or presume) that the only way out for me is to work all day, then code all night and create a portfolio in a space that mildly interests me.I have been working in Rust, which I thoroughly enjoy, and have been messing around in Ratatui crate, which I also enjoy, but work is slow between two high school kids I teach how to drive simultaneously, being the one breadwinner, the one adult that drives, and the one person who does household shopping and cooking. I am too stretched thin to not be attacking this with maximum efficiency.I need to stop wandering in the dark and find the straightest line possible to get me out of my stagnant job/wage. I came to this whole industry late and dont have either the best discipline or sense on how one furthers their career as quickly as possible and becomes marketable in the most effective way, and I'm up to my eyeballs in all the extraneous ""life"" stuff that is non-negotiable. I basically need a road map.Thank you for spending any amount of time on that. I am 100% serious and have the work ethic, I just don't have the direction.

He said I am a great team member and I have the qualities and passions of becoming a software developer, and then he told me that no offers are extended at this time. One of my friend immediately got his return offer and some high school interns are invited to continue their internships at T the upcoming summers (even a high school intern I am working with got hired to work full-time that he did not even have to attend university).Several of my friends also did not get anything too. It's strange. Even though I expected at some point that I might not get any return offer but I don't know why am I still disappointed and depressed right now. I keep telling myself that it is OK, I can try again next time but I am not OK. I feel like all of my hard work and contribution go to waste now. Since the beginning of my internship, I have done my best at every work, be nice, and network with as many people as possible. I have always shown my passion and initiative, done every project the best I could, and even asked for more work a lot of time (I did not get much work). I even won competitions/hackathons (1st place) for this company. I kept thinking what did I do wrong or what did I miss, and what do others have to get hired but I don't. So many things are going on in my mind right now. I feel absolutely embarrassed when facing my friend or anyone who gets hired. I feel like a failure. I am even scared to talk to my family about this. They have sacrificed and expected so much for me.I have put in a lot of my blood, sweat, and tears for the past three years for this first internship, and always aim for return offers so my career is secure and stable.

Plus I’m almost 2 years in and I’m at $30,000 in school debt, which I have no idea if that’s about where I should be or what.But I’m wondering if all online schools are the same kind of learning platform where you just read and answer multiple choice questions and post a discussion board post every week. I’m really getting burnt out on the same type of learning structure every session for ever class.I’ve also looked into other online schools and I haven’t found any that actually have the computer science with a cybersecurity concentration at any of them. They’re all either bachelors in IT, bachelor in cybersecurity, or bachelor in computer science with no choice of a cybersecurity concentration (idk if that’s matters much or not..) I’m wondering if I should continue with this degree or if I should look into somewhere else where maybe I can get help with certifications, mentorship, or at least some experience with real-world software learning how to use them and search for vulnerabilities.If anyone can help me, I’d greatly appreciate it!",5,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mnqmyg/need_advice_with_degree_path_in_cs/,2025-08-11 22:01:42,2025-08-13 01:45:27

1mk5ag1,"Systems thinker with a CS degree, stuck in support roles after major life setbacks - how do I find my path in tech?",fleethead,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I’m hoping to get some guidance or perspective from this community. I’ve been feeling lost for a long time now.I'm 26 and studied Computer Science in Australia (where I'm from and live now) and have always seen myself as a systems thinker. I like to see how everything connects, not just code but tech, people, economic and social systems. I’ve had a rough few years between life setbacks, grief, and demoralising work environments. I feel like I've stagnated and lost confidence in my abilities, or never really developed them further than university level.I’ve held two jobs since graduating:* One was an ""application specialist"" role, mostly user support and QA testing - no real development. (1.5 years) \[Australia based\]* My current job is a support engineer role maintaining legacy WinForms tools in C#. I fix minor bugs, occasionally touch Blazor or SQL, but I wouldn’t even know how to build one of these apps from scratch. There's little mentorship, PRs only get reviewed by the boss once per week if you're lucky, and every other team member is spread thin. (2 years total, with 2x 5 month gaps in between due to multiple deaths in the family) \[Australia based, but worked remotely for 9 months from London\]It’s been a mixed, somewhat toxic environment. I was the only new person to last longer than two weeks in three years. My boss often humiliated me which wrecked my self-worth, and I find it hard not to feel panic that I’m falling behind while everyone else is moving forward.That said, I have done a few things I’m proud of:* At uni, I had a job building Python software for Raspberry Pi devices (e.g., an NFC security system, e-ink display widgets). I don’t have access to these any more.* I’ve participated in two blockchain hackathons (first a team of three which I led/did most of the project, and second I did solo), working with Solidity and JavaScript. Both times something went wrong at the very end and I couldn’t demo properly, but I want to revisit those projects and finish them.* I’ve also started writing about cybernetics, AI, and cognitive security/cogsec on my blog.I have so many project ideas, but I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know whether to double down on the blockchain stuff, explore AI/ML (I’d even go back to uni if I felt it was the right path), or start a new project using something more marketable like React. I often feel FOMO seeing the focused, driven people on this sub. I know I’m capable and think deeply, but I feel stuck and don’t know where to aim.I’ve also been able to find a few thinkers/leaders online who I look up to. In 2023 I flew internationally to a tech conference and networked with, met and conversed at length with the founders and staff of this company, which is probably the highlight of the last few years for me. This is the same company I did the hackathons for. In my mind, I’m working toward having some diverse portfolio that really demonstrates me and my strengths which I could present to any of these people and ask for mentorship.So here’s what I’m hoping you might help me figure out:* How do I find a path in CS I can truly thrive in, that makes use of my strengths?* Should I try to finish the blockchain project or start fresh with something more mainstream like a React app?* Is it worth exploring AI/ML or systems design formally? Or should I just build, build, build and let the path emerge?* How do I rebuild confidence and skill after years of support roles and a toxic work environment?Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot.

1mjrcjh,I don't have a bachelor's. What do I do?,No-Rush-Hour-2422,cscareerquestions,"8 years ago I completed a 2 year degree in CS. Got on the honour roll and everything, but couldn't afford to keep going. Luckily the job market was strong and I was able to find good paying jobs. I even worked with a few people who did the same, or were even self taught, over the years. I have 8 YOE now.I've been at my current employer for 4 years now. But last year new management took over, and things have been slowly going downhill. I would be surprised if we made it another year at this point. So I've started applying for jobs. I take my time and tailor the resume and cover letter to the posting, and I'm only applying for ones that I'm a good fit for. Despite this, I get rejected automatically. My best guess is that I'm being filtered out based on my degree. Even when it comes to posting that say they'll take equivalent experience. Even if the job only requires 4 years of experience and pays less than what I currently make.The problem is that I have a family and a mortgage and all that now, so I can't just drop everything and go back to school. I could do online classes, but there's no way I would be able to finish a degree before this company folds.

1moq8u9,Would you guys give a notice to a company that has screwed you over for 3+ years that you're leaving?,Suspicious_Stable_25,cscareerquestions,"Long story trying to keep it short,I joined this company about 4 years ago. From the very beginning it was a shit show.They lured me in with this ""hot"" tech team and then when I got there the team was ""full"" so I had to find a different team. One of the managers found me a spot on this abysmal graveyard team with super outdated tech. It would take 30 minutes just to login to their stuff and get environment running and I am not kidding. No one wanted to learn new technology. Working on tech 10+ years old. Did great there but eventually couldn't take it anymore and joined a new team. Much better team but still had lots of issues. Ended up becoming the ""lead"" without the title even helping out engineers with 15+ years of experience on me. All the while I'm talking to the person in charge of my promotion and it's constant excuse of ""just perform really well on this team for 6 more months"" yada yada. I do great for 3 years. Then the person leaves the company with no notice. I get a new person in charge of my promotion and he's not a technical guy at all. Promotion time is coming up and the last guy told me this new guy knows everything about my promotion case. I bring it up to him and he has no idea what I am talking about. Then he goes and talks to someone in my org who is non-technical, has no idea what I do and I literally have never talked to. He proceeds to tell me she said I don't step up for leadership positions yet I am basically leading my team. I was pissed she even answered, she should have talked to someone who actually knew what I did. Also, I am the lowest level engineer and leadership is not even required for the next position. Then he leaves for paternity leave for 3 months while promotions are happening. So I literally have no one to vouch for my promotion case during promotions and I am pissed. I am outperforming the more senior engineers and getting paid significantly less.Fed up, I reach out to an old manager and tell him my scenario. He says that's horrible and says he'll take me under his wing for the promotion case. Then my company decides to move me to a different team the week after promotions but I am still in the same org, just a different team/product due to politics/finances basically.I tell my new person in charge of my promotion this and he basically says I might need to perform well for another 6 months for a promotion. I said it wasn't even my choice to switch teams and I've been overperforming my position for the past 3 years and they switched me because in their words ""I was the best engineer"". I basically tell him this 6 months stuff is bs. He says he will talk to his manager and see what he can do. At this point I am so fed up. There's literally no point in me even trying at my job anymore. Whether I am an absolute all-star or I slack off and work the bare minimum I get paid and treated the same. I am basically checked out of this job. It is by far the worst job I have ever had.I may be getting an offer for a new job soon. I told my partner that I don't even think this company deserves to know I am leaving because of how horrible they have treated me. It's clear they have no respect for me so why should I bother giving them 2 weeks notice or any notice at all?Is this bad for me to do? I hate burning bridges but they burned this bridge so long ago I honestly don't even think there is a bridge left to burn. I could go on and on about other awful things they have done, how cheap they are, no recognition for work, and so much more.

I don’t dislike the work, but I can’t seem to find any other positions quite like this at other companies. I’m sure that they exist but are there whole departments for just that sort of work elsewhere like where I work? Or is this sort of work normally lumped in with developers or a testing department?
