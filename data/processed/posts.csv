1l26xgo,Why don't data engineers test like software engineers do?,PotokDes,dataengineering,"Testing is a well established discipline in software engineering, entire careers are built around ensuring code reliability. But in data engineering, testing often feels like an afterthought.Despite building complex pipelines that drive business-critical decisions, many data engineers still lack consistent testing practices. Meanwhile, software engineers lean heavily on unit tests, integration tests, and continuous testing as standard procedure.The truth is, data pipelines *are* software. And when they fail, the consequences: bad data, broken dashboards, compliance issues—can be just as serious as buggy code.I've written a some of articles where I build a dbt project and implement tests, explain why they matter, where to use them.

One thing that strikes me is the gap in maturity between DE and Web Dev. Here are some examples:1. Most DE literature is pretty recent. For example, the first edition of ""Fundamentals of Data Engineering"" was written in 20222. Lack of opinionated frameworks. Come to think of it, I think DBT is pretty much what we got.3. Lack of well-defined patterns or consensus for practices like testing, schema evolution, version control, etc.Data engineering is much more ""unsolved"" than other software engineering fields.

1kych1l,Team wants every service to write individual records directly to Apache Iceberg - am I wrong to think this won't scale?,AlternativeTwist6742,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I'm in a debate with my team about architecture choices and need a reality check from the community.**The Setup:** We're building a data storage system for multiple customer services. My colleagues implemented a pattern where:* Each service writes individual records directly to Iceberg tables via Iceberg python client (pyiceberg)* Or a solution where we leverage S3 for decoupling, where: * Every single S3 event triggers a Lambda that appends **one record** to Iceberg * They envision eventually using Iceberg for everything - both operational and analytical workloads**Their Vision:*** ""Why maintain multiple data stores? Just use Iceberg for everything""* ""Services can write directly without complex pipelines""* ""AWS S3 Tables handle file optimization automatically""* ""Each team manages their own schemas and tables""**What We're Seeing in Production:**We're currently handling hundreds of events per minute across all services. We put the S3 -> Lambda -> append individual record via pyiceberg to the iceberg table solution. What I see is lot of those concurrency errors: CommitFailedException: Requirement failed: branch main has changed: expected id xxxxyx != xxxxxkkMultiple Lambdas are trying to commit to the same table simultaneously and failing.**My Position**I originally proposed:* Using PostgreSQL for operational/transactional data* Periodically ingesting PostgreSQL data into Iceberg for analytics* Micro-Batching records for streaming dataMy reasoning:* Iceberg uses optimistic concurrency control - only one writer can commit at a time per table* We're creating hundreds of tiny files instead of fewer, optimally-sized files* Iceberg is designed for ""large, slow-changing collections of files"" (per their docs)* The metadata overhead of tracking millions of small files will become expensive (regardless of the fact that this is abstracted away from use by using managed S3 Tables)**The Core Disagreement:** My colleagues believe S3 Tables' automatic optimizations mean we don't need to worry about file sizes or commit patterns. They see my proposed architecture (Postgres + batch/micro-batch ingestion, i.e. using Firehose/Spark structured streaming) as unnecessary complexity.It feels we're trying to use Iceberg as both an OLTP and OLAP system when it's designed for OLAP.**Questions for the Community:**1. Has anyone successfully used Iceberg as their primary datastore for both operational AND analytical workloads?2. Is writing individual records to Iceberg (hundreds per minute) sustainable at scale?3. Do S3 Tables' optimizations actually solve the small files and concurrency issues?4.

1l16xzj,Data Engineer Career Path,Fredonia1988,dataengineering,"Hey all, I lurk in this sub daily. I’m looking for advice / thoughts / brutally honest opinions on how to move my career forward. About me: 37 year old senior data engineer of 5 years, senior data analyst of about 10 years, 15 years in total working with data. Been at it since college. I have a bachelors degree in economics and a handful of certs including AWS solutions architect associate. I am married with a 1 year old, planning on having at least one more (I think this family info is relevant bc lifestyle plays into career decisions, like the one I’m trying to make). Live / work in Austin, TX. I love data engineering, and I do want to further my career in the role, but am apprehensive given all the AI f*ckery about. I have basically nailed it down to three options:1. Get a masters in CS or AI. I actually do really like the idea of this. I enjoy math, the theory and science, and having a graduate degree is an accolade I want out of life (at least I think). What holds me back: I will need to take some extra pre-req courses and will need to continue working while studying. I anticipate a 5 year track for this (and about $15-20k). This will also be difficult while raising a family. And more pertinently, does this really protect me from AI? I think it will definitely help in the medium term, but who knows if it’d be worth it ten years from now. 2. Continue pressing on as a data engineer, and try to bump up to Staff and then maybe move into some sort of management role. I definitely want the staff position, but ugh being a manager does not feel like my forte. I’ve done it before as an Analytics Manager and hated it. Granted, I was much younger then, and the team I managed was not the most talented. So my last experience is probably not very representative. 3. Get out of Data Engineering and move into something like Sales Engineering. This is a bit out of left field, but I think something like this is probably the best bet to future proof my tech career without an advanced degree. Personally, I haven’t had a full-on sales role before, but the sales thing is kind of in my blood, as my parents and family were quite successful in sales roles. I do enjoy people, and think I could make a successful tech salesman, given my experience as a data engineer. After reading this, what do you feel might be a good path for me? One or the other, a mix of both? I like the idea of going for the masters in CS and moving into Sales Engineering afterwards. Overall I am eager to learn and advance while also being mindful of the future changes coming to the industry (all industries really).

1l1ubll,"Data Engineer Feeling Lost: Is This Consulting Norm, or Am I Doing It Wrong?",human_disaster_92,dataengineering,"I'm at a point in my career where I feel pretty lost and, honestly, a bit demotivated. I'm hoping to get some outside perspective on whether what I'm going through is just 'normal' in consulting, or if I'm somehow attracting all the least desirable projects.I've been working at a tech consulting firm (or 'IT services company,' as I'd call it) for 3 years, supposedly as a Data Engineer. And honestly, my experiences so far have been... peculiar.”My first year was a baptism by fire. I was thrown into a legacy migration project, essentially picking up mid-way after two people suddenly left the company. This meant I spent my days migrating processes from unreadable SQL and Java to PySpark and Python. The code was unmaintainable, full of bad practices, and the PySpark notebooks constantly failed because, obviously, they were written by people with no real Spark expertise. Debugging that was an endless nightmare.Then, a small ray of light appeared: I participated in a project to build a data platform on AWS. I had to learn Terraform on the fly and worked closely with actual cloud architects and infrastructure engineers. I learned a ton about infrastructure as code and, finally, felt like I was building something useful and growing professionally. I was genuinely happy!But the joy didn't last. My boss decided I needed to move to something ""more data-oriented"" (his words). And that's where I am now, feeling completely demoralized.Currently, I'm on a team working with Microsoft Fabric, surrounded by Power BI folks who have very little to no programming experience. Their philosophy is ""low-code for everything,"" with zero automation. They want to build a Medallion architecture and ingest over 100 tables, using one Dataflow Gen2 for EACH table. Yes, you read that right.This translates to:- Monumental development delays.- Cryptic error messages and infernal debugging (if you've ever tried to debug a Dataflow Gen2, you know what I mean).- A strong sense that we're creating massive technical debt from day one.I've tried to explain my vision, pushed for the importance of automation, reducing technical debt, and improving maintainability and monitoring. But it's like talking to a wall. It seems the technical lead, whose background is solely Power BI, doesn't understand the importance of these practices nor has the slightest intention of learning.I feel like, instead of progressing, I'm actually moving backward professionally. I love programming with Python and PySpark, and designing robust, automated solutions. But I keep landing on ETL projects where quality is non-existent, and I see no real value in what we're doing—just ""quick fixes and shoddy work.""I have the impression that I haven't experienced what true data engineering is yet, and that I'm professionally devaluing myself in these kinds of environments.My main questions are:- Is this just my reality as a Data Engineer in consulting, or is there a path to working on projects with good practices and real automation?- How can I redirect my career to find roles where quality code, automation, and robust design are valued?- Any advice on how to address this situation with my current company (if there's any hope) or what to actively look for in my next role?Any similar experiences, perspectives, or advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

The message is encoded based on row order, so the data itself remains unaltered.The payload can be recovered even if some rows are modified or deleted, thanks to a combination of Reed-Solomon and fountain codes. You only need a fraction of the original dataset—regardless of which part—to recover the payload.For example, I managed to hide a 128×128 image in a Parquet file containing 100,000 rows.I believe this could be used to watermark a Parquet file with a signature for authentication and tracking. The payload can still be retrieved even if the file is converted to CSV or SQL.That said, the payload is easy to remove by simply reshuffling all the rows. However, if you maintain the original order using a column such as an ID, the encoding will remain intact.Here’s the package, called Steganodf (like steganography for DataFrames :) )::link: https://github.com/dridk/steganodfLet me know what you think!",26,0.92,1,https://github.com/dridk/steganodf,2025-06-03 00:16:25,2025-06-05 01:42:27

1l2fuol,How do I build great data infrastructure and team?,Famous-Spring-1428,dataengineering,"I recently finished my degree in Computer Science and worked part-time throughout my studies, including on many personal projects in the data domain. I’m very confident in my technical skills: I can (and have) built large systems and my own SaaS projects. I know all the ins and outs of the basic data-engineering tools, SQL, Python, Pandas, PySpark, and have experience with the entire software-engineering stack (Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, even front-end). I also have a solid grasp of statistics.About a year ago, I was hired at a company that had previously outsourced all IT to external firms. I got the job through the CEO of a company where I’d interned previously. He’s now the CTO of this new company and is building the entire IT department from scratch. The reason he was hired is to transform this traditional company, whose industry is being significantly disrupted by tech, into a “tech” company. You can really tell the CEO cares about that: in a little over one year, we’ve grown to 15+ developers, and the culture has changed a lot.I now have the privilege of being trusted with the responsibility of building the entire data infrastructure from scratch. I have total authority over all tech decisions, although I don’t have much experience with how mature data teams operate. Since I’m a total open-source nerd and we’re based in Europe, we want to rely on as few American cloud providers as possible, I’ve set up the current infrastructure like this:* **Airflow** (running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **ClickHouse DWH** (also running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **Spark** (you guessed it, running in our cluster)* **Goose** for SQL migrations in our warehouseSome conceptual decisions I’ve made so far:1. Data ingestion from different sources (Salesforce, multiple products, etc.) runs through Airflow, using simple Pandas scripts to load into the DWH (about 200 k rows per day).2. ClickHouse is our DWH, and Spark connects to ClickHouse so that all analytics runs through Spark against ClickHouse. If you have any tips on how to structure the different data layers (Ingestion/datamart etc), please!What I want to implement next are typical software-engineering practices, dev/prod environments, testing, etc. As I mentioned, I have a lot of experience in classical SWE within corporate environments, so I want to apply as much from that as possible. In my research, I’ve found that you basically just copy the entire environment for dev and prod, which makes sense, but sounds expensive computing wise. We will soon start hiring additional DE/DA/DS.My question is: What technical or organizational decisions do you think are important and valuable? What have you seen work (or not work) in your experience as a data engineer? Are there problems you only discover once your team has grown? I want to get in front of those issues as early as possible. Like I said, I have a lot of experience in how to build SWE projects in a corporate environment.

1l2sbm1,How Do You Organize A PySpark/Databricks Project,jduran9987,dataengineering,"Hey all,I've been learning Spark/PySpark recently and I'm curious about how production projects are typically structured and organized.My background is in DBT, where each model (table/view) is defined in a SQL file, and DBT builds a DAG automatically using `ref()` calls. For example: -- modelB.sql SELECT colA FROM {{ ref('modelA') }} This ensures `modelA` runs before `modelB`. DBT handles the dependency graph for you, parallelizes independent models for faster builds, and allows for targeted runs using tags. It also supports automated tests defined in YAML files, which run before the associated models.I'm wondering how similar functionality is achieved in Databricks. Is lineage managed manually, or is there a framework to define dependencies and parallelism? How are tests defined and automatically executed? I'd also like to understand how this works in vanilla Spark without Databricks. TLDR - How are Databricks or vanilla Spark projects organized in production. How are things like 100s of tables, lineage/DAGs, orchestration, and tests managed?Thanks!",14,0.95,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l2sbm1/how_do_you_organize_a_pysparkdatabricks_project/,2025-06-04 00:44:28,2025-06-05 01:42:27

I want to share a real challenge I’ve been facing, despite being actively learning, practicing, and building projects. Yet, breaking into a DE role has proven harder than I expected.I have around 6 years of experience working as a data analyst, mostly focused on advanced SQL, data modeling, and reporting with Tableau. I even led a short-term ETL project using Tableau Prep, and over the past couple of years, my work has been very close to what an Analytics Engineer does—building robust queries over a data warehouse, transforming data for self-service reporting, and creating scalable models.Along this journey, I’ve been deeply investing in myself. I enrolled in a comprehensive Data Engineering course that’s constantly updated with modern tools, techniques, and cloud workflows. I’ve also built several open-source projects where I apply DE concepts in practice: Python-based pipelines, Docker orchestration, data transformations, and automated workflows.I tend to avoid saying 'I have no experience' because, while I don’t have formal production experience in cloud environments, I do have hands-on experience through personal projects, structured learning, and working with comparable on-prem or SQL-based tools in my previous roles. However, the hiring process doesn’t seem to value that in the same way.The real obstacle comes down to the production cloud experience. Almost every DE job requires AWS, Databricks, Spark, etc.—but not just knowledge, production-level experience. Setting up cloud projects on my own helps me learn, but comes with its own headaches: managing resources carefully to avoid unexpected costs, configuring environments properly, and the limitations of working without a real production load.I’ve tried the 'get in as a Data Analyst and pivot internally' strategy a few times, but it hasn’t worked for me.At this point, it feels like a frustrating loop: companies want production experience, but getting that experience without the job is almost impossible. Despite the learning, the practice, and the commitment, the outcome hasn't been what I hoped for.So my question is—how do people actually break this loop? Is there something I’m not seeing? Or is it simply about being patient until the right opportunity shows up?

1l3a0yc,[Architecture Feedback Request] Taking external API → Azure Blob → Power BI Service,Project_Support7606,dataengineering,"Hei! I’m designing a solution to pull daily survey data from an external API and load it into Power BI Service in a secure and automated way. Here’s the main idea:•Use an Azure Function to fetch paginated API data and store it in Azure Blob Storage (daily-partitioned .json files).•Power BI connects to the Blob container, dynamically loads the latest file/folder, and refreshes on schedule.•No API calls happen inside Power BI Service (to avoid dynamic data source limitations). I was trying to do normal built-in GET API from Power BI Service but it doesn't accept dynamic data sources (Power BI Desktop works well, no issues) as API usually does.•Everything is designed with data protection and scalability in mind — future-compatible with Fabric Lakehouse.P/S: The reason we are forced to go with this solution without using Fabric architecture because it requires cost-effective solution and Fabric integration is planning to be deployed in our organization (potentially project starts from November)Looking for feedback on:•Anything I might be missing?•Any more robust or elegant approaches?•Would love to hear if anyone’s done something similar.",7,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l3a0yc/architecture_feedback_request_taking_external_api/,2025-06-04 16:28:16,2025-06-05 01:42:27

Result: Duplicate May 15th business dates across different extraction partitions**What I've tried:*** Custom backfill detection logic (complex, had issues)* Changing filter logic (performance problems)**Questions:**1. Is there a clean way to handle this pattern without full refresh?2. Should I be partitioning by business date instead of extraction date?3. Would switching to `merge` strategy be better here?4.

1l1eia9,I'm looking to improve our DE stack and I need recommendations.,A_SeriousGamer,dataengineering,"TL;DR: We have a website and a D365 CRM that we currently keep synchronized through Power Automate, and this is rather terrible. What's a good avenue for better centralising our data for reporting? And what would be a good tool for pulling this data into the central data source?As the title says, we work in procurement for education institutions providing frameworks and the ability to raise tender requests free of charge, while collecting spend from our suppliers.Our development team is rather small with about 2-3 web developers (including our tech lead) and a data analyst. We have good experience in PHP / SQL, and rather limited experience in Python (although I have used it).We have our main website, a Laravel site that serves as the main point of contact for both members and suppliers with a Quote Tool (raising tenders) and Spend Reporter (suppliers tell us their revenue through us). The data for this is currently in a MariaDB / MySQL database. The VM for this is currently hosted within Azure.We then have our CRM, a dynamics 365 / PowerApps Model App(?) that handles Member & Supplier data, contacts, and also contains the framework data same as the site. Of course, this data is kept in Microsoft Data verse.These 2 are kept in sync using an array of Power Automate flows that run whenever a change is made on either end, and attempts to synchronise the two. It uses an API built in Laravel to contact the website data. To keep it realtime, there's an Azure Service bus for the messages sent on either end. A custom connector is used to access the API in Power Automate.We also have some other external data sources such as information from other organisations we pull into Microsoft Dataverse using custom connectors or an array of spreadsheets we get from them.Finally, we also have sources such as SharePoint, accounting software, MailChimp, a couple of S3 buckets, etc, that would be relevant to at least mention.Our reports are generally built in Power BI. These reports are generally built using the MySQL server as a source (although they have to be manually refreshed when connecting through an SSH tunnel) for some, and the Dataverse as the other source.We have licenses to build PowerBI reports that ingest data from any source, as well as most of the power platform suite. However, we don't have a license for Microsoft Fabric at the moment.We also have an old setup of Synapse Analytics alongside an Azure SQL database that as far as I can tell neither of these are really being utilised right now.So, my question from here is: what's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised? We've been looking at Snowflake as an option for a data store as well as (maybe?) for ETL/ELT. Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.Additionally, a big requirement is moving away from Power Automate for handling real time ETL processes as this causes far too many problems than solutions. Ideally, the 2-way sync would be kept as close to real-time as possible.So, what would be a good option for central data storage? And what would be a good option for then running data synchronisation and preparation for building reports?I think options that have been on the table either from personal discussions or with a vendor are:- including Azure Data Factory alongside Synapse for ETL- Microsoft Fabric - Snowflake- Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)- using more Power Query (simple, but only for ingesting data into Dataverse)I can answer questions for any additional context if needed, because I can imagine more will be needed.",5,0.78,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l1eia9/im_looking_to_improve_our_de_stack_and_i_need/,2025-06-02 10:26:24,2025-06-05 01:42:27

1kxzcuu,Should a lakehouse be theorigin for a dataset?,junglemeinmor,dataengineering,"I am relatively new to the world of data lake houses. I'm looking for some thoughts or guidance. In a solution that must be on prem, I have data arriving from multiple sources (files and databases) at the bronze layer. Now in order to get from bronze to silver and then gold, I need some rules based transformation. These rules are not available in a source system today, so the requirement is to create an editable dataset within the lakehouse. This isn't data that's bronze or will be transformed. Business also needs an UI to set these rules. While iceberg does have data editing capabilities, I'm somewhat convinced it's better to have another custom application take care of the rules definition and storage, and be a source of the rules data, instead of managing it all with iceberg and a query engine. To me, it sounds like management of rules is an OLTP use case. Till we decide on this, we are letting the rules be in a file, and that file acts as a source of data brought into the lakehouse. Does anyone else do this? Maintain some master data set that's only in the data lakehouse? Should lakehouses only have a copy of data sourced from somewhere, or can they be a store of completely new datasets created directly in the lake?",7,0.82,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kxzcuu/should_a_lakehouse_be_theorigin_for_a_dataset/,2025-05-29 02:14:39,2025-06-05 01:42:27

I want to keep it simple, easy to maintain and understand. I dont need scalability at this time.I have a requirement to design a data warehouse in redshift that supports the ability to query past data states similarly to temporal tables in MS SQL Server. (if an update query is made, I need to be able to query for what the table looked like before the update) this is sometimes called ""time travel query"" or ""point in time architecture"" depending on your background. The data sources do not retain this historical data, and are not in an ideal data warehouse schema, so Ill need to transform the data either before or after loading it, and maintain the historical records. Redshift seems to lack a direct solution for this problem.a second requirement is to ingest the data using streaming technology such as kafka. though the data warehouse does not have to be updated in real time. that is optional.I have looked at redshift's ""history mode"" but its quite new and it looks like all the data would need to go into RDS first, which has tradeoffs. but one of the main data sources is already on RDS, so that seems promising.total data volume is low, no need for cluster computing if we can save some complexity.I would prefer to lean toward python and sql for programming.I would prefer to do things in real-time, but would accept batches if a particularly elegant solution is available.thanks for considering :D",3,0.72,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l2l5ax/infrastructure_suggestions_for_streaming_data/,2025-06-03 19:38:21,2025-06-05 01:42:27

1l38eu0,How to build REAL projects,Far-Dragonfly-8306,learnprogramming,"I'm not here to ask the usual, lazy ""learned programming at 26! how become better programmer! also how get job?"" Because, yeah, I know how to become a better programmer: ""do projects,"" they all say. ""Solve a real world problem that you have."" But every legitimate programmer out there needs to acknowledge that there's a world of computer general knowledge that's typically necessary for many of these ""projects"" to function. Sure, at my level (<1 year of programming; yes I am self taught, no I did not get a CS degree), I can create a terminal based RPG game or create a terminal based CRUD. But when programmers go out and build a compiler, there's a whole world of knowledge required on how to do that, none of which is probably even concretely understandable - only abstractly understandable. To take another example: if you want to get into web development, it is not enough to know JS, HTML, and CSS - one must also know how requests/get/server/browsers work. So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler? Maybe my question is vague because it lacks an objective. I'm sure many of you will say ""what do you want to DO? What's your goal? That will determine how you learn this under-the-hood stuff."" And yet in the same breath, I suspect most programmers out there have this under-the-hood knowledge that I seem to lack. Where is this knowledge?

Dad wants me to develop an application for a 32-bit Windows XP desktop. This limits my choices a bit.The application needs a UI though I'm considering developing it as a Web UI. That would require VERY simple HTML4 and minimal JavaScript if any.The only other requirement is that it needs to be able to do raw TCP/IPv4 sockets which generally isn't a problem.I'm proficient in a few languages, C++, C#, and Python being my usual choices.I started with a C# .NET Framework 4.0 project since that's the latest .NET that supports XP. The development process is not going great. My modern IDEs continually gripe and moan about my target platform. MSVC 2022 won't even load it.I could try writing the application in C++ though I think I'd have to target MSVC 2015 x86.

But for the backend I am overwhelmed with choices. I've heard that Vercel doesn't support WebSockets so it's out of the list. After some exploring, I saw a couple of options I can pick from.* Use VPS for the hosting such as Hetzner or DigitalOcean* Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP* Cloud platforms such as Render, Heroku, RailwayFor a small portfolio/hobby project, which one of these is my best bet?

Midway, I got attracted to game development and began learning C++ with Unreal Engine.

I've been self-studying HTML, CSS and PHP, but I keep hitting these mental blocks that make me feel like I'm not making progress or that I'm too dumb to ever get this.My question is: Does anyone have experience with or know platforms where I can hire an online tutor? Like, private PHP lessons? Would it be worth it?If anyone's been through this or has tips to overcome these blocks, I'd really appreciate the help!So here's my story... I started by training my programming logic and spent about 3 months watching video lessons and studying basics: operators, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, arrays. Up to that point, it was okay - I could do exercises (some were hard, but I could work through them).The problems started when I got to callbacks, Promises, async/await and try/catch. These concepts just wouldn't click no matter how many explanations I watched.I got so tired of just doing exercises and watching videos that I switched to PHP (because I wanted to build something real to stay motivated). The basics (operators, loops, functions) were fine since they're similar to JS. (Not sure if this was the right choice, but I thought about creating a login system and saw PHP would work well - just needed to download Laragon and start, and I'm actually liking PHP.)But when it came time to actually code and start the project, I froze. I'd search online, I could understand what the code was doing - like I understood how the database connection worked conceptually - but when I went to type it out, I just couldn't remember the whole code. I felt like I was just copying and pasting, even if the code worked in the end, and everyone says this hurts real learning.To make it worse, a coworker (who also studies) told me that in 3 months he was already way beyond this and that I should try harder. This gave me a massive mental block - it feels like no matter how much I study, I'm not getting anywhere.",12,0.76,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kyl2s5/selfstudying_html_css_and_php_but_hitting_massive/,2025-05-29 20:20:18,2025-06-05 01:42:28

I've been going to online school for a little over a year now to get a bachelor's is Computer Science, focusing on Software Engineering.

Ive been trying to do my own research into the field (mostly by googling) to deepen my understanding, but, honestly, I have no idea where to really start. I think I have a reasonable grasp on C++, Java, and Python, and can create programs that typically do what I want in the console, but where do I progress from there? Where do I focus my independent studying next to become an effective engineer? And once I have an area of focus, where do I start? To be more specific, when learning a coding language, typically the classes I've taken start by teaching you different variables, then move on to teaching if-else branches, then loops, etc. How do I figure out what the equivalent would be for learning, say, how to create user interfaces, or accessing databases through code, or other things that go into making a program that I'm not aware of? I hope that makes sense, any advice would be appreciated.

But I often write the code in a normal .r file first, and then transfer it to an .rmd file once it’s working (though this usually breaks a few things). I do it this was because I can debug/view the variables in the environment easier in a .r file than in a .rmd file. Is there a less clunky way to do this?

1kylsng,Java/Spring dev looking for alternatives,akrylowy,learnprogramming,"HelloI have worked as a software engineer in java/kotlin, using spring, for about 2 years. The job required a lot of 'duct tape' fixing, including fixing GCP infrastructure configurations, making SQL queries to retireve data requesters wanted, etc, and mostly just plugging holes in a garbage codebase that management never ever has patience or budget to fix/rewrite/redesign correctly.Thus my skills aren't exactly stellar, Java/Spring-wise, as it was proven to me on my second project.Anyhow, in my spare time I tried out Rust and I loved it, but...the reality of job market.I'm looking to get back in, and I really don't want to go back to Java. Don't want to go to Spring. I especially don't want the OOP infested garbage, with Clean Code (TM) principles everywhere, forcing me to control+click through one tiny function that calls three functions, each of them calling three functions, making me completely forget what it was I was following/debugging by the fourth class/file I have to open and read through.At the same time I am familiar with crazyness of Javascript (which Typescript would alleviate somewhat), I don't want Microsoft products (C#, .NET). I am considering Golang at the moment, and I would really not be against Rust or something purely FP even (I have played around with Elm a bit and damn does that thing seem immune to errors)But, once again, realities of job market. I am not a senior dev, mid at best, and I'd rather have higher odds of finding a job within a few months, rather than low odds in a year+ after grueling amount of learning.Should I just grit my teeth, brush up on my Java/Spring starting from fundamentals (which are lacking in my case), or don't listen to naysayer-thoughts and keep up with Rust and maybe Golang on the side as it's easy enough to be complementary, or something else entirely?",7,0.75,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kylsng/javaspring_dev_looking_for_alternatives/,2025-05-29 20:48:58,2025-06-05 01:42:28
1l3co1e,Struggle to think abstractly,Warmspirit,learnprogramming,"I have found that through speaking with peers and though my own attempts at projects that reasoning about programs / software / ideas is hard for me. For example, breaking down a project into different components and thinking about them *doing* things is difficult. I do much better with in-depth explanations; if I were using a library that abstracted away some task I would be more focused on *how the library works* than just accepting that it does a job and using it. I feel as though this is a big issue with my skills as a programmer. I particularly struggle with OOP and abstracting what I want from a system into various aspects. Concepts as a whole tend to confuse me at first and I need a real concrete understanding before ""getting it"". This leads to me feeling stupid for taking so long whereas others seem more able to understand new concepts, regardless of the topic being taught (although that could just be perceived). What steps can I take to improving this skill and understanding / reasoning with concepts in a way that doesn't require in-depth knowledge?

Basically, I don’t know if it's better to figure stuff out on my own and just do whatever works at the moment, or if I should always take advantage of preexisting solutions. The latter seems boring, to just sit through hundreds of docs and I genuinely doubt people actually do that, but when I try to make stuff by myself, I don't know if it will become hard to manage slop the more features I add and by the time I realise I will have wasted all that time to then rewrite the entire structure of the program. For a more specific example, I am writing a javaFX app. I'm currently trying to make a modular design where I will have one master controller which is responsible for showing or hiding elements of the UI and a bunch of sub controllers to handle those separate UI menus. I made it such that each sub controller holds a reference to its master and runs some kinda update function of the master so that the master is also informed of all UI changes and can evaluate some stuff or facilitate communication between the sub controllers. Technically this works and I understand it well because I had this idea myself. But then I read somewhere that this is bad because it couples the different components too much and may become unwieldy or whatever, and that maybe I should look into something like Google Guava EventBus, but that's another hour of learning where I could just think of stuff on my own instead.Basically, is there any value in using minimal dependancies and just making shit up to learn, or should I follow stricter guidelines on established solutions, even though it's boring?",6,0.88,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kypx73/when_should_i_create_my_own_solutions_and_when_do/,2025-05-29 23:50:13,2025-06-05 01:42:28

1kydanp,Title: Need help choosing language for DSA (Python or C++?) – beginner here,Slow_Spare_1764,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone,I'm currently moving into my 2nd year of college. In my 1st year, I learned the basics of Python and C—just enough to solve very basic problems. But to be honest, I still get confused with concepts like loops and overall logic-building. So yeah, you can guess where I stand in terms of coding skills: beginner level.Now, I have a one-month break, and I was planning to revise both C and Python from the basics so I don't struggle in my 2nd year. The main reason is that in the 3rd semester, we have to study DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) using Python and C.But here's where I'm confused:Everyone is saying ""Don't waste time relearning basics, start with DSA directly in one language. Once you master DSA in one language, switching to another isn't a big deal.""Some suggest doing DSA in Python, and others say C++ is better for DSA.As someone who's just starting out and hasn't really explored much in the coding world yet, I’m feeling stuck. I don’t know which path to follow. I just want to be confident and not fall behind when DSA classes begin.So please, any guidance would mean a lot:Should I revise Python/C basics first?Which language is better to start DSA with as a beginner: Python or C++?What would you do if you were in my place?Please don’t ignore this post – I genuinely need advice from those who’ve been through this. :folded_hands:",2,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kydanp/title_need_help_choosing_language_for_dsa_python/,2025-05-29 15:12:02,2025-06-05 01:42:28

1l0wg36,Big tech engineering culture has gotten significantly worse,MrMoist,cscareerquestions,"Background - I'm a senior engineer with 10yrs+ experience that has worked at a few Big Tech companies and startups. I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I feel like all the tech ""influencers"" of 2021 glamorized this career to unrealistic expectations, and I need to correct some of the preconceived notions.The last 3 years have been absolutely brutal in terms of declining engineering culture. What's worse is that the toxicity is creating a feedback loops that exacerbates the declining culture.Some of the crazy things I've heard* ""I want to you look at every one of your report and ask yourself, is this person producing enough value to justify their high compensations"" (director to his managers)* ""If that person doesn't have the right skills, get rid of them and we'll find someone that does"" (VP to an entire organization after pivoting technology direction). * I.e. - It's not worth training people anymore, even if they're talented and can learn anything new. It's all sink or swim now* ""If these candidates aren't willing to grind hundreds of leetcode questions, they don't have mental fortitude to handle this job"" (engineers to other engineers) * To be fair, I felt like this was a defense mechanism. The amount of BS that you need to put up with to not get laid off has grown significantly.* ""Working nights and weekends is expected"" (manager to my coworker that was on PIP because he didn't work weekends). * I've always felt this pressure previously. But I've never heard it truly be verbalized until recently. Final thoughts* Software engineering in big tech feels more akin to investment banking now. Most companies expect this to be your life. You truly have to be ""passionate"" about making a bunch of money, or ""passionate"" about the product to survive.* Don't get too excited if your company stock skyrockets. The leaders of the company will continue to pinch every bit of value out of you because they're technically paying you more now (e.g. meta) and they know that the job market is harsh.* Prior to 2022, Amazon was considered the most toxic big tech company. But ironically, their multiple layers of bureaucracy and stagnating stock price likely prevented the the culture from getting too much worse, whereas many other companies have drastically exceeded Amazon in terms of toxicity in 2025. IMO, Amazon is solidly 50th percentile in terms of culture now. If you couldn't handle Amazon culture prior to 2022, then you definitely can't handle the type of culture that exists now.",2235,0.97,471,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l0wg36/big_tech_engineering_culture_has_gotten/,2025-06-01 18:42:37,2025-06-05 01:42:29

I’ve tried my best to work on our relationship, but he’s spent all year treating me with explicit disdain, not making eye contact, and ignoring whatever I say in team lunches.I buckled down as much as I could to do better, but every 1:1 became a condescending berating session and I never felt like I truly belonged on the team.Whenever features were delayed, the majority of the time it was because of consistently broken infra, incomplete features from sister teams that mine depended on to start, or inaccurate guidance from dev’s I was asked to consult. I accepted the weaknesses within my control and improved them, but no matter what I did, I could never beat the narrative.Anything I did good was sarcastically devalued and whenever anything went wrong, my manager would tell me I should’ve taken X action that I wouldn’t have known to do at the time without privileged knowledge or time travel (hindsight advice).Coworkers and mentor repeatedly told me I was doing fine, but I just had our first performance review, and I’m being offered 2 things:**PIP vs Severance.**This severance side offer is brand new this year and our company has had huge layoffs.The actual meeting was another vague collection of criticisms, in which, when I asked him what I could’ve ideally done differently, he said “I’m not here to give specific edge cases for you to iterate literally off of and am just looking for high level resourcefulness from you”.When he would list specifically delayed features, I would tell him how I did everything in my power, including implementing his advice (which I can prove), only for the infra related reasons to delay it.When I tried to show areas I’ve improved in, he would agree but then re-insist how below the mark I am even though I’m never been sure what a “Meets Expectation” counterpart of me hypothetically looks like all year. His goalpost for me always felt fictional.Now, I feel extremely jaded and demotivated being forced into this job market.

It definitely boosts efficiency, but at least from my experience, it’s nowhere near replacing engineers.I think companies are laying people off because the tech industry is struggling in general. There are lots of contributing factors, like economic shifts or the new government administration, and I feel like people are overreacting by blaming it all on AI.

I failed to secure an internship in either the summer after sophomore or junior year. Just before graduating, I had applied to about 35 jobs with no response - not even an asynchronous coding test. It was already clear that I was cooked with no internships. Combining this disappointment with some major health issues, I went the next 7 months after graduation without applying to a single job. I started applying again in January 2025 and over the last 5 months, I've applied to 142 jobs through Linkedin, Indeed and rarely some other sites.In all of these jobs, only about 15 were for software engineering, with all of the rest being lesser tech roles, some even barely tech related: Data Analyst I, Junior Business Analyst, Entry Level QA tester, etc. I've received a total of 6 ""next steps"" including 3 in person interviews and 0 offers. During this time, the only experience I've been able to advertise is my senior year Software Engineering project (year long capstone), an online Business Analysis course, and a handful of menial summer jobs. Grinding Leetcode is pointless - like I said, I've never even been granted the opportunity of a coding interview. Leveraging what few family connections I have has led to little more than ""apply online"" or ""send me your resume"" (the one with no real experience on it).I hear all of these stories that say ""Don't give up! I applied to 500 jobs before I landed my first software engineering job"". Nevermind that there's no chance of me landing an SE job as my first role (no internships), I have yet to get a straight answer as to where people are even seeing 500 relevant tech roles LET ALONE entry level. Both Indeed and Linkedin have slowed to a drip of one semi-relevant entry level job for every 15 that are irrelevant, a scam, or 2-4 years experience crap.So that's where I am. I have no idea what to do at this point, short of applying to Revature and seeing where that takes me (literally). Every day that goes by, I can feel the entry level CS jobs dwindling.

1l3hkw0,Losing hope,bestofrolf,cscareerquestions,"cw: suicideI’m a machine learning engineer, recently laid off from a job that already felt like it was wasting my time and potential. I was stuck under a manager who didn’t understand my work, given projects that were constantly abandoned, and eventually let go for “performance” reasons, even though I had always received positive feedback until the company was acquired and everything started to shift.After the company went remote-first, I took the opportunity to relocate. That ended up making things worse. I was isolated, cut off from any meaningful opportunities, and stuck under a subcompany title while the parent company made all the decisions. They had promised to re-evaluate our salaries using market research, but that never happened. HR gave vague responses and pretended nothing was wrong. I knew I was underpaid and underutilized, and it felt like there was no way to change that.Since being let go, I’ve been applying nonstop. I’ve gone through multiple interviews with companies that say they value growth, learning, and curiosity. Most of them either ghost me or reject me after several rounds. It’s exhausting. Every time I think I’m getting close, it falls apart again.My mental health is at an all-time low. Unemployment benefits are not enough. I am behind on so many bills that I’ve started having to choose which ones I can miss without everything collapsing. My credit score is dropping. I feel like I’m drowning in all of it. There are thousands of companies out there, and somehow not a single one even acknowledges that I exist.I think about ending my life constantly. I’ve stopped talking to family and friends because I feel like a burden. I feel like a failure. Like I’m wasting everyone’s time. This is the hardest thing I’ve ever been through, and every day it feels harder to keep trying. Letting go seems easier than holding on to a future that feels further away the more I reach for it.If you’ve been through something like this and made it out the other side, please tell me how. I know there isn’t some secret trick but I can’t gather the drive I had before. I feel like I’ve lost knowledge from being out of work at this point.

Hey everyone, I am looking for advice in my current role. I landed my first software engineering job about 6 months ago after applying to over 750 jobs. The process broke me a bit, but I was so relieved to finally get a foot in the door. This was the only company I made to the final round, so I was going to take it since I was graduating in the next couple months and needed to secure work. It’s a small startup with a team of about 10 engineers. But the environment and expectations are burning me out and I don’t know what to do. Here’s what’s been making this so hard:- Strict micromanagement: My boss tracks and questions every small task. Sometimes asking for 5-6 different changes on the same ticket. When I think something is done, I have to go back and add even more to it, despite it never being asked in the first place. - Zero mentorship or support: I was thrown into the codebase with minimal onboarding and barely any documentation. No code reviews, no senior dev guidance — I’m expected to figure out complex features solo and somehow get everything right. Ive been able to figure things out, but it’s been a very tedious and tiresome process. - Unrealistic expectations: Every ticket is somehow “urgent,” and I always feel behind because the timelines just aren’t realistic. There’s no prioritization since EVERYTHING seems to be high priority. Every month management says they will “replan the month priorities” but they never do and I’m stuck with infinite tickets for the month that just all need to be done. - Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way). I am yet to ask for remote work, but my peer told me not to expect more than 1 day remote, despite the majority of the team having 2-3 days a week remote. By the time I get home, Im exhausted and barely have time to decompress or do things I like before having to sleep to get my 8 hours. Ultimately, I feel trapped. I was grateful to find work after sending 700+ apps, but this constant grind in this environment is really disrupting my mental health. I don’t want to go back to square one and leave this job since I have a lot of financial pressures, but can’t see my self staying here much longer. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to manage this? I feel like 1yoe does not mean anything in this market, but Im not sure how much longer I can continue doing this. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!TLDR: 6 months into first SWE role, feeling stressed from work environment, expectations, and commute.

1l1ps0u,I responded to a questionable automated rejection and got my application back in the queue,venerated,cscareerquestions,"I wanted to share this because I'd usually think someone responding to an automated rejection is a fool and I hesitated for a moment before doing so. I got a rejection from a job that mentioned something about needing to be able to legally work in the country I reside in. I think it's the rejection for needing an H1B visa. Considering that I'm a US citizen working from the US, I decided to reply, despite thinking my email would go into some inbox or maybe the trash, never to be seen.

I emailed them back thanking them for investigating and letting me know what happened. They replied saying that I also saved 2 other applications from false rejection. While this may not get me a job, it got me on their radar, restored some of my own faith in humanity, and also saved 2 other people from the same hopelessness.

1l2omyb,Wasting 20s energy and passion in big tech - like company,Admirable-Area-2678,cscareerquestions,"I am currently working as Frontend developer in typical big tech - like company. Good working environment, up to date tech stack, skilled colleagues, decent pay (in Europe’s standard), basically every aspect is “OK” or even “very good”.At the job I always give 200% - going extra mile, lining up potential issues, being proactive, executing initiatives, delivering value to manager. But it feels like I am wasting my energy, potential and passion for coding. Value of returns feels like non-existent - doesn’t matter how much I push, salary never changes and it’s same tickets grind every single day. I could stop being proactive and do only 50% - but that feels equally wrong and just boring.Sometimes I think I should use all this energy and do my own thing: launch own agency, build SaaS startup, create youtube channel or do any other stuff that could bring more money (yes, salary is not that great in Europe besides Switzerland).What should I do? How not to loose passion? How to use this energy and potential to maximise returns? Every day in job feels like I am limiting my self. And I don’t want to spend my free time on random hobby.

1kzkic1,Some things I've learned recently in the current job market,Ok-Process-2187,cscareerquestions,"Some of these may be obvious but I guess it wasn't for me.1.) during coding rounds, verbalize to confirm understanding not to express thinkingI used to think that I should vocalize all my thoughts and avoid any silence. This has proven to be problematic for a few reasons. First, when you're initially reading the question, vocalizing will unnecessarily slow you down. Second, you probably don't sound very smart when you're quickly reading the question like that, you might start looking for ways to condense sentences, skip over certain sentences, etc. It's all unnecessary.The time to vocalize your thoughts is after you've read it and to then confirm your understanding of the question with the interviewer.Then instead of brainstorming out loud the very first thing that comes to mind. I would ask for another minute to think of how you'd approach the question. The problem with saying the very first thing that comes to mind is that if it's obviously wrong then the interviewer may correct you which would be interpreted as giving you a hint which would count against you. After you've wrestled with the idea for a bit only then share your solution out loud with the interviewer.I wouldn't even bother mentioning an obvious brute force solution if you already have a better idea in mind since talking about the brute force will cut into your time.So the TLDR here is to be more strategic about when to vocalize your thought process.2.) during non-coding rounds, wait for your turn to talk, never interrupt the interviewerThis will probably be obvious to most but I used to interrupt the interviewer near the beginning. Not intentionally. If they said something that I thought would make for a really interesting question, then I would ask it right there when there was a natural pause in the conversation.I now realize this is very bad. It's always better to wait till you're sure that they are done speaking or until they ask you if you have any questions. You gain nothing by interrupting them but can easily make a bad impression and decrease the signal you give from your question by asking during a time in which they aren't fully ready to evaluate you since they still need to get through the rest of what they wanted to say. Plus, they might have brought up an even better point later on.3.) during a hiring manager round, to express that you're serious about the role, interview the interviewerYou can't tell the interviewer that you really want the position. That you've deeply thought about staying at the company in the long term. That you are a top candidate.You can only express these things by asking tough questions that make the interviewer think and possibly feel like they're being interviewed. Obviously you don't want to take this too far. You should ask questions that show you've deeply thought about the company's business model and how the role you're being hired for aligns with that. You should ask questions to see how clearly the hiring manager understands what will be needed for the role. It is genuinely a red flag if you're being hired for a role in which the hiring manager is not sure about what you'll be working on. Think about what other things could be red flags as well and ask some pointed (but still polite) questions about those.My current strategy for this is to split my preparation for this part of the interview over 2 days. On day 1 I learn as much as I can from quick online research about the company and do my best to come up with questions of substance. On day 2 I try again and this is when I come up with much higher quality questions.",49,0.87,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kzkic1/some_things_ive_learned_recently_in_the_current/,2025-05-31 00:53:15,2025-06-05 01:42:29

1l19od2,As a bootcamp grad- should I accept a drastic demotion?,ThisAintNoBeer,cscareerquestions,"I graduated from a CS bootcamp in May 2023. Previously I had only worked in retail. I do not have a Bachelor's or even an AA degree (though a decent amount of community college units completed). Right out of the bootcamp I was lucky enough to land an internship at a small government organization via a connection through the bootcamp.I was then converted to full time after the internship. It was a pretty modest junior web developer role that only paid about $50k/yr but the work environment and mentorship were phenomenal. And at least it had some pension and healthcare benefits. Over the last 22 months I've learned a ton and have been given the freedom to make some large and meaningful contributions to the company's flagship products.Sadly we've been hit with some pretty heft budget cutbacks. As the most junior person at the company I'm first on the chopping block and was laid off. As I was being let go, the organization's director offered me a Teaching Assist position at the bootcamp I had graduated. Apparently part of their deal with the bootcamp requires they contribute a certain amount of developer hours towards instruction.She wanted to try something new with a single dev doing the Teaching Assistant thing full time (previously they'd have the more senior devs rotate in every now and then). Currently I work 3 days from home and 2 days in-office. The teaching role would be 4 days a week on-site. I would still be employed by my current organization and keep the title of ""Junior Web Developer"". My compensation would be cut down to $30k/yr AND no benefits.I have a few days to think it over but am tempted to pass on the ""opportunity"". Would that be a mistake? It would be nice to add a third year as a junior developer to my resume along with some teaching experience but I feel like they're really just taking advantage of me.Alternatively I can try to test the waters in this absolutely awful job market. But don't foresee myself getting anywhere. I know tons of people with CS degrees that are having no luck whatsoever. I could also alternatively collect unemployment while working towards an accelerated degree program myself and hope things get better in a year or two.I feel stuck between two kinda terrible options. Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks!tl;dr Bootcamp grad with no degree but 2 yoe. Currently making $50k/yr with healthcare benefits. Was laid off but offered $30k/yr and no healthcare. Should I take the ~$1900/mo net pay offer just to pad my resume while looking for other jobs? Alternatively I could collect unemployment at $1800/months for 6 months while applying full time and working towards a CS degreeEdit: I spoke to my principal engineer and he was pretty adamant that I do not take that position.

What should I do?My first job was a software dev in a small 50+ company. They say your first job out of college is always an experience, for good or ill, which I agree. I learned a lot and realized some things about myself. I made great memories with my former colleagues. However, more than a year, I was forced to consider the decision to leave due to several reasons - I love coding as much as the next guy but the company is too disorganized. We had to change tech stack twice in just a few months. I also got somewhat disillusioned at the realization that projects never truly end - I love learning as much as the next guy, but all the endless studying that ends up becoming obsolete too quickly... got to me somewhat. It's weird given why I wanted to become a dev in the first place, but it feels like, in a sense, I developed a depression in futility. It's like none of things I did would matter in the next few months. I would've been fine with it. But it's too quickly in my opinion...My second job was in a corporate bank as an SRE junior officer. I like how organized it is. How much less pressure there is on me. I can safely take a Leave when necessary without the threat of on-call. Odd because this job IS an on-call. High salary. Great benefits. I also thought trying a different job might grant me new perspective. Switching from development to operations. It's not a total career switching, but it's different enough.I was optimistic... and got punished for it. After I got regularized, my workload gradually increased. I can normally handle it but the issue is the way things happened.I currently live in a solo apartment, on-call hybrid setup (just this month, I had to work outside my hours many times, some on weekends). There's so much to learn, so much to do, so much juggle... I *can't*. I can't keep up. I realized a fundamental fact about myself - I'm not a great multitasker. I'm a deep thinker (which is why I aspired to be a dev in the first place). I can multi-task, but not so often and not so fast-paced. It's not sustainable. And now, I'm falling apart.My routine was ruined. I don't eat as much. I have inconsistent sleep hours (too few or too much sleep). I don't even leave my apartment in the weekends because I'm too tired and I have housework to do. The salary is great but I doubt it's worth how disorganized I've become. I've become obsessed with completing my tasks. I don't respond to my parents' calls and messages anymore. It hasn't even been a year and I'm already crushed under pressure.Things became so bad my work performance plummeted - lapses in judgement, slower memory, increasingly ""closed-off"" behavior, breathing problems, headaches, constant exhaustion... I pretty much decided to screw it and go home this weekend. I want to see my family and de-stress. But I know fully well that won't be enough.I don't know what to do. I want to job hop but even THAT is an effort in itself in my current situation. I'm too tired for it. I took Leave once a month, but it's not enough.I made enough savings and my family is not financially struggling. My sister already has a job and graduating in a month or two. I feel guilty for the idea nonetheless because I'll become a burden and is using them to cushion me, but I'm so lost.I also don't know where I want to go, what I want to do. Do I leave IT profession entirely? Or is it a case of having terrible work-life balance and hope the next one would be the golden goose? I'm being pessimistic right now and believe that's just perpetuating the cycle.I'm at a point where I'd probably be happy with a lower paying job with less stress and pressure on studying off-hours like my experiences forced on me.",8,0.7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l01qc5/i_dont_know_if_it_profession_is_for_me_anymore_i/,2025-05-31 16:51:58,2025-06-05 01:42:29

I recently received an offer from an ai startup <20 people , and I think this could be a good chance for me to take on more responsibility and work.

1l2urcp,How to think of my job as just a job and not let it affect personal life,eatdrinksleepp,cscareerquestions,"Recent grad here, working in my first time full time role. Something I have been struggling with a lot is maintaining work life balance and preventing work stress from bleeding into personal life. I don’t particularly enjoy my current role so I have been trying to advocate for myself within the company and pursue a role change to gear more towards the tools and technologies I enjoy using and want to learn. But this process has been very stressful for me due to a kinda toxic team dynamic and also the company being very unstructured and vague when it comes to role changes and promotions. My problem is that this work stress and politics is driving me insane and I can’t stop thinking about it even in the little time I get to myself outside of work. I want to get better at just shutting off work brain once I leave the office but it feels impossible. The recent anxiety and frustration I have been feeling because of being stuck in a role I don’t enjoy never goes away and only gets worse. I really want to be like one of those people who think of their job as just a job that earns them money and are able to spend their personal time on non work related things. I have hobbies and passion projects I wanna work on but I even find it hard to focus on them or be motivated about them with all the work related tension in my head. If not physically exhausted, I am always too mentally exhausted to spend my time in anything actually fulfilling outside of work. I am already starting to feel the beginnings of a burnout as a result of all this so I want to fix this before things get worse.

1l2c0sq,Got a job that will cross-train me in software development. They still use pick/basic,Rexoc40,cscareerquestions,"This company sells software the county govts use to files property taxes. It seems pretty solid, and I just had my first day yesterday. Their front end is pretty straightforward, using js, html, css, etc. but they use ancient languages like pick basic for everything else. The reason for this i’m guessing is because of the huge amount of red tape and compliances your software has to have, and the fact that it’s old and works is enough of a reason to not re-vamp the whole thing.The problem is, though, i’m 22. I want to get into development, and while this job offers that, will I get stuck here? My friends are telling me that I am ‘cooked’ but in my mind, even with these old languages, there is still so much practical experience here that can transfer into better development jobs that is much better than just sitting on my ass and getting decline letters for lack of experience. In my mind, this is my experience and even if it’s old, I think that the other skills combined that I will use in this job will make up for everything else.The best things this job offers in my opinion, is their front-end development, and also linux experience. They use a lot of linux, and as of now I am too inexperienced to explain how they use linux, even though I took classes on it in college.

1l1f0a9,How do I take paternity time with inherited failing projects?,DeletdButChngdMyMind,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR - Inherited a project right before the birth of my child, have been working since. Project has been stalling, and my health is deteriorating taking care of the newborn and project. How can I request paternity leave in this situation?Hi, TIA.I started at my new company late last year, and did a fair/ok job, so I started inheriting teammates assignments (we code).My senior teammate (didn’t get to spend much time with them due to teammate being OOO for a good portion of Q4) left the bank in Q1, and transferred their a project code body and materials to me.It was around their departure time that I let work know I was expecting a baby at the beginning of Q2. Given that I was relatively new, and our FTE count was down due to this departure, I agreed to help complete their outstanding projects with the expectation of taking time in July (I know, I know…this was a bad idea. Had I known the complexity of this project, if it was further pushed by management, I would have refused or resigned).Baby came at the start of Q2, and the project has experienced setbacks — I learned after the fact that the knowledge transfer wasn’t all that complete, and the block of code i recieved in transition will probably require major rework thru validation. I can easily see this going thru Q2 and into the beginning of Q3.Issue is I’m not sleeping due to the baby schedule, and I have a chronic condition I am managing privately. It’s not an issue usually, but currently I am feeling exhausted and starting to experience burnout. My partner is also starting to wear thin, and is requesting my presence with the newborn and our other children. We are entitled to a large amount of paternity leave at my company, but I feel this would almost be considered abandoning my project.

Tasks rarely take as long as expected.My manager doesn't like us adding in buffer time for unknowns, and has pushed back on me doing this before.
