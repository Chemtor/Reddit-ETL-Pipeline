It was running on Oracle, by the way. He mentioned that using DBT led to the creation of many more steps or models, since best practices in DBT often encourage breaking large SQL scripts into smaller, modular ones. However, he also said this made the process slower overall, because the Oracle query optimizer tends to perform better with larger, consolidated SQL queries than with many smaller ones.Is there some truth to what he said, or is it just a case of him not knowing how to use the tools properly",91,0.96,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kxb3ip/dbt_slower_than_original_etl/,2025-05-28 07:33:44,2025-06-04 01:43:41

1kych1l,Team wants every service to write individual records directly to Apache Iceberg - am I wrong to think this won't scale?,AlternativeTwist6742,dataengineering,"Hey everyone, I'm in a debate with my team about architecture choices and need a reality check from the community.**The Setup:** We're building a data storage system for multiple customer services. My colleagues implemented a pattern where:* Each service writes individual records directly to Iceberg tables via Iceberg python client (pyiceberg)* Or a solution where we leverage S3 for decoupling, where: * Every single S3 event triggers a Lambda that appends **one record** to Iceberg * They envision eventually using Iceberg for everything - both operational and analytical workloads**Their Vision:*** ""Why maintain multiple data stores? Just use Iceberg for everything""* ""Services can write directly without complex pipelines""* ""AWS S3 Tables handle file optimization automatically""* ""Each team manages their own schemas and tables""**What We're Seeing in Production:**We're currently handling hundreds of events per minute across all services. We put the S3 -> Lambda -> append individual record via pyiceberg to the iceberg table solution. What I see is lot of those concurrency errors: CommitFailedException: Requirement failed: branch main has changed: expected id xxxxyx != xxxxxkkMultiple Lambdas are trying to commit to the same table simultaneously and failing.**My Position**I originally proposed:* Using PostgreSQL for operational/transactional data* Periodically ingesting PostgreSQL data into Iceberg for analytics* Micro-Batching records for streaming dataMy reasoning:* Iceberg uses optimistic concurrency control - only one writer can commit at a time per table* We're creating hundreds of tiny files instead of fewer, optimally-sized files* Iceberg is designed for ""large, slow-changing collections of files"" (per their docs)* The metadata overhead of tracking millions of small files will become expensive (regardless of the fact that this is abstracted away from use by using managed S3 Tables)**The Core Disagreement:** My colleagues believe S3 Tables' automatic optimizations mean we don't need to worry about file sizes or commit patterns. They see my proposed architecture (Postgres + batch/micro-batch ingestion, i.e. using Firehose/Spark structured streaming) as unnecessary complexity.It feels we're trying to use Iceberg as both an OLTP and OLAP system when it's designed for OLAP.**Questions for the Community:**1. Has anyone successfully used Iceberg as their primary datastore for both operational AND analytical workloads?2. Is writing individual records to Iceberg (hundreds per minute) sustainable at scale?3. Do S3 Tables' optimizations actually solve the small files and concurrency issues?4. Am I overcomplicating by suggesting separate operational/analytical stores?Looking for real-world experiences, not theoretical debates.

I had built some simple webapps with flask before, but this is the first time I have worked with a ""batteries included""web framework to a significant extent. One thing that strikes me is the gap in maturity between DE and Web Dev. Here are some examples:1. Most DE literature is pretty recent. For example, the first edition of ""Fundamentals of Data Engineering"" was written in 20222. Lack of opinionated frameworks. Come to think of it, I think DBT is pretty much what we got.3. Lack of well-defined patterns or consensus for practices like testing, schema evolution, version control, etc.Data engineering is much more ""unsolved"" than other software engineering fields.

1l16xzj,Data Engineer Career Path,Fredonia1988,dataengineering,"Hey all, I lurk in this sub daily. I’m looking for advice / thoughts / brutally honest opinions on how to move my career forward. About me: 37 year old senior data engineer of 5 years, senior data analyst of about 10 years, 15 years in total working with data. Been at it since college. I have a bachelors degree in economics and a handful of certs including AWS solutions architect associate. I am married with a 1 year old, planning on having at least one more (I think this family info is relevant bc lifestyle plays into career decisions, like the one I’m trying to make). Live / work in Austin, TX. I love data engineering, and I do want to further my career in the role, but am apprehensive given all the AI f*ckery about. I have basically nailed it down to three options:1. Get a masters in CS or AI. I actually do really like the idea of this. I enjoy math, the theory and science, and having a graduate degree is an accolade I want out of life (at least I think). What holds me back: I will need to take some extra pre-req courses and will need to continue working while studying. I anticipate a 5 year track for this (and about $15-20k). This will also be difficult while raising a family. And more pertinently, does this really protect me from AI? I think it will definitely help in the medium term, but who knows if it’d be worth it ten years from now. 2. Continue pressing on as a data engineer, and try to bump up to Staff and then maybe move into some sort of management role. I definitely want the staff position, but ugh being a manager does not feel like my forte. I’ve done it before as an Analytics Manager and hated it. Granted, I was much younger then, and the team I managed was not the most talented. So my last experience is probably not very representative. 3. Get out of Data Engineering and move into something like Sales Engineering. This is a bit out of left field, but I think something like this is probably the best bet to future proof my tech career without an advanced degree. Personally, I haven’t had a full-on sales role before, but the sales thing is kind of in my blood, as my parents and family were quite successful in sales roles. I do enjoy people, and think I could make a successful tech salesman, given my experience as a data engineer. After reading this, what do you feel might be a good path for me? One or the other, a mix of both? I like the idea of going for the masters in CS and moving into Sales Engineering afterwards. Overall I am eager to learn and advance while also being mindful of the future changes coming to the industry (all industries really).

1l1ubll,"Data Engineer Feeling Lost: Is This Consulting Norm, or Am I Doing It Wrong?",human_disaster_92,dataengineering,"I'm at a point in my career where I feel pretty lost and, honestly, a bit demotivated. I'm hoping to get some outside perspective on whether what I'm going through is just 'normal' in consulting, or if I'm somehow attracting all the least desirable projects.I've been working at a tech consulting firm (or 'IT services company,' as I'd call it) for 3 years, supposedly as a Data Engineer. And honestly, my experiences so far have been... peculiar.”My first year was a baptism by fire. I was thrown into a legacy migration project, essentially picking up mid-way after two people suddenly left the company. This meant I spent my days migrating processes from unreadable SQL and Java to PySpark and Python. The code was unmaintainable, full of bad practices, and the PySpark notebooks constantly failed because, obviously, they were written by people with no real Spark expertise. Debugging that was an endless nightmare.Then, a small ray of light appeared: I participated in a project to build a data platform on AWS. I had to learn Terraform on the fly and worked closely with actual cloud architects and infrastructure engineers. I learned a ton about infrastructure as code and, finally, felt like I was building something useful and growing professionally. I was genuinely happy!But the joy didn't last. My boss decided I needed to move to something ""more data-oriented"" (his words). And that's where I am now, feeling completely demoralized.Currently, I'm on a team working with Microsoft Fabric, surrounded by Power BI folks who have very little to no programming experience. Their philosophy is ""low-code for everything,"" with zero automation. They want to build a Medallion architecture and ingest over 100 tables, using one Dataflow Gen2 for EACH table. Yes, you read that right.This translates to:- Monumental development delays.- Cryptic error messages and infernal debugging (if you've ever tried to debug a Dataflow Gen2, you know what I mean).- A strong sense that we're creating massive technical debt from day one.I've tried to explain my vision, pushed for the importance of automation, reducing technical debt, and improving maintainability and monitoring. But it's like talking to a wall. It seems the technical lead, whose background is solely Power BI, doesn't understand the importance of these practices nor has the slightest intention of learning.I feel like, instead of progressing, I'm actually moving backward professionally. I love programming with Python and PySpark, and designing robust, automated solutions. But I keep landing on ETL projects where quality is non-existent, and I see no real value in what we're doing—just ""quick fixes and shoddy work.""I have the impression that I haven't experienced what true data engineering is yet, and that I'm professionally devaluing myself in these kinds of environments.My main questions are:- Is this just my reality as a Data Engineer in consulting, or is there a path to working on projects with good practices and real automation?- How can I redirect my career to find roles where quality code, automation, and robust design are valued?- Any advice on how to address this situation with my current company (if there's any hope) or what to actively look for in my next role?Any similar experiences, perspectives, or advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

We are planning to use S3 but not sure if that will be too slow4. What do you use as the compute layer?5. What are the things we need to consider before moving to the iceberg? Why moving to iceberg: So currently we are using Singlestore. The main reason for switching to Iceberg is that it allows us to track the data history. also on top of that, something that wont bind us to any vendor for our data. We were using Singlestore.

1kxmcb2,Decentralized compute for AI is starting to feel less like a dream and more like a necessity,Future-Goose7,dataengineering,"Been thinking a lot about how broken access to computing has become in AI.We’ve reached a point where training and inference demand insane GPU power, but almost everything is gated behind AWS, GCP, and Azure. If you’re a startup, indie dev, or research lab, good luck affording it. Even if you can, there’s the compliance overhead, opaque usage policies, and the quiet reality that all your data and models sit in someone else’s walled garden.This centralization creates 3 big issues:* Cost barriers lock out innovation* Surveillance and compliance risks go up* Local/grassroots AI development gets stifledI came across a project recently, Ocean Nodes, that proposes a decentralized alternative. The idea is to create a permissionless compute layer where anyone can contribute idle GPUs or CPUs. Developers can run containerized workloads (training, inference, validation), and everything is cryptographically verified. It’s essentially DePIN combined with AI workloads.Not saying it solves everything overnight, but it flips the model: instead of a few hyperscalers owning all the compute, we can build a network where anyone contributes and anyone can access. Trust is built in by design, not by paperwork.Has anyone here tried running AI jobs on decentralized infrastructure or looked into Ocean Nodes? Does this kind of model actually have legs for serious ML workloads?

1l1y2lp,Watermark a dataframe,TargetDangerous2216,dataengineering,"Hi,I had some fun creating a Python tool that hides a secret payload in a DataFrame. The message is encoded based on row order, so the data itself remains unaltered.The payload can be recovered even if some rows are modified or deleted, thanks to a combination of Reed-Solomon and fountain codes. You only need a fraction of the original dataset—regardless of which part—to recover the payload.For example, I managed to hide a 128×128 image in a Parquet file containing 100,000 rows.I believe this could be used to watermark a Parquet file with a signature for authentication and tracking. The payload can still be retrieved even if the file is converted to CSV or SQL.That said, the payload is easy to remove by simply reshuffling all the rows. However, if you maintain the original order using a column such as an ID, the encoding will remain intact.Here’s the package, called Steganodf (like steganography for DataFrames :) )::link: https://github.com/dridk/steganodfLet me know what you think!",23,0.91,1,https://github.com/dridk/steganodf,2025-06-03 00:16:25,2025-06-04 01:43:41

1l2fuol,How do I build great data infrastructure and team?,Famous-Spring-1428,dataengineering,"I recently finished my degree in Computer Science and worked part-time throughout my studies, including on many personal projects in the data domain. I’m very confident in my technical skills: I can (and have) built large systems and my own SaaS projects. I know all the ins and outs of the basic data-engineering tools, SQL, Python, Pandas, PySpark, and have experience with the entire software-engineering stack (Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, even front-end). I also have a solid grasp of statistics.About a year ago, I was hired at a company that had previously outsourced all IT to external firms. I got the job through the CEO of a company where I’d interned previously. He’s now the CTO of this new company and is building the entire IT department from scratch. The reason he was hired is to transform this traditional company, whose industry is being significantly disrupted by tech, into a “tech” company. You can really tell the CEO cares about that: in a little over one year, we’ve grown to 15+ developers, and the culture has changed a lot.I now have the privilege of being trusted with the responsibility of building the entire data infrastructure from scratch. I have total authority over all tech decisions, although I don’t have much experience with how mature data teams operate. Since I’m a total open-source nerd and we’re based in Europe, we want to rely on as few American cloud providers as possible, I’ve set up the current infrastructure like this:* **Airflow** (running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **ClickHouse DWH** (also running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **Spark** (you guessed it, running in our cluster)* **Goose** for SQL migrations in our warehouseSome conceptual decisions I’ve made so far:1. Data ingestion from different sources (Salesforce, multiple products, etc.) runs through Airflow, using simple Pandas scripts to load into the DWH (about 200 k rows per day).2. ClickHouse is our DWH, and Spark connects to ClickHouse so that all analytics runs through Spark against ClickHouse. If you have any tips on how to structure the different data layers (Ingestion/datamart etc), please!What I want to implement next are typical software-engineering practices, dev/prod environments, testing, etc. As I mentioned, I have a lot of experience in classical SWE within corporate environments, so I want to apply as much from that as possible. In my research, I’ve found that you basically just copy the entire environment for dev and prod, which makes sense, but sounds expensive computing wise. We will soon start hiring additional DE/DA/DS.My question is: What technical or organizational decisions do you think are important and valuable? What have you seen work (or not work) in your experience as a data engineer? Are there problems you only discover once your team has grown? I want to get in front of those issues as early as possible. Like I said, I have a lot of experience in how to build SWE projects in a corporate environment. Any things I am not thinking about that will sooner or later come to haunt me in my DE team? Any tips on how to setup my DWH architecture?

1kz2e4c,What's up with the cloud/close source requirements for applications?,unhinged_peasant,dataengineering,"This is not just another post about 'how to transition into Data Engineering'. I want to share a real challenge I’ve been facing, despite being actively learning, practicing, and building projects. Yet, breaking into a DE role has proven harder than I expected.I have around 6 years of experience working as a data analyst, mostly focused on advanced SQL, data modeling, and reporting with Tableau. I even led a short-term ETL project using Tableau Prep, and over the past couple of years, my work has been very close to what an Analytics Engineer does—building robust queries over a data warehouse, transforming data for self-service reporting, and creating scalable models.Along this journey, I’ve been deeply investing in myself. I enrolled in a comprehensive Data Engineering course that’s constantly updated with modern tools, techniques, and cloud workflows. I’ve also built several open-source projects where I apply DE concepts in practice: Python-based pipelines, Docker orchestration, data transformations, and automated workflows.I tend to avoid saying 'I have no experience' because, while I don’t have formal production experience in cloud environments, I do have hands-on experience through personal projects, structured learning, and working with comparable on-prem or SQL-based tools in my previous roles. However, the hiring process doesn’t seem to value that in the same way.The real obstacle comes down to the production cloud experience. Almost every DE job requires AWS, Databricks, Spark, etc.—but not just knowledge, production-level experience. Setting up cloud projects on my own helps me learn, but comes with its own headaches: managing resources carefully to avoid unexpected costs, configuring environments properly, and the limitations of working without a real production load.I’ve tried the 'get in as a Data Analyst and pivot internally' strategy a few times, but it hasn’t worked for me.At this point, it feels like a frustrating loop: companies want production experience, but getting that experience without the job is almost impossible. Despite the learning, the practice, and the commitment, the outcome hasn't been what I hoped for.So my question is—how do people actually break this loop? Is there something I’m not seeing? Or is it simply about being patient until the right opportunity shows up? I’m genuinely curious to hear from those who’ve been through this or from people on the hiring side of things.",12,0.76,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kz2e4c/whats_up_with_the_cloudclose_source_requirements/,2025-05-30 11:59:21,2025-06-04 01:43:41

Which made us wonder:# Are These Just Gaps in the Ecosystem?We're trying to validate:* Are others running into these same repeatable challenges?* How are you handling governance, validation, and observability in migrations?* If you’ve extended the AWS-native stack, how did you approach things like steward approvals or validation logic?* Has anyone tried solving this at the **platform level** — e.g., a reusable layer over AWS services, or even a standalone open-source toolset?* If AWS-native isn't enough, what **open-source options** could form the foundation of a more robust migration framework?We’re not trying to pitch anything — just seriously considering whether these pain points are universal enough to justify a more structured solution (possibly even SaaS/platform-level).

1kyoxtk,General data movement question,OwnFun4911,dataengineering,"Hi, I am an analyst and trying to get a better understanding of data engineering designs. Our company has some pipelines that take data from Salesforce tables and loads it in to Snowflake. Very simple example, Table A from salesforce into Table A snowflake. I would think that it would be very simple just to run an overnight job of truncating table A in snowflake -> load data from table A salesforce and then we would have an accurate copy in snowflake (obviously minus any changes made in salesforce after the overnight job). Ive recently discovered that the team managing this process takes only ""changes"" in salesforce (I think this is called change data capture..?), using the salesforce record's last modified date to determine whether we need to load/update data in salesforce. I have discovered some pretty glaring data quality issues in snowflakes copy.. and it makes me ask the question... why cant we just run a job like i've described in the paragraph above?

We process over 3 million transactions per month and receive more than 20 million visits to our website monthly.We’re currently trying to integrate data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and BigQuery into our AWS-based architecture, where we use S3, Redshift, dbt, and Tableau for analytics and reporting.However, we’re running into some issues with the ETL process — especially when dealing with the semi-structured NoSQL-like GA4 data in BigQuery. We’ve successfully flattened the arrays into a tabular model, but the resulting tables are huge — both in terms of columns and rows — and we can’t run dbt models efficiently on top of them.We attempted to create intermediate, smaller tables in BigQuery to reduce complexity before loading into AWS, but this introduced an extra transformation layer that we’d rather avoid, as it complicates the pipeline and maintainability.I’d like to implement an incremental model in dbt, but I’m not sure if that’s going to be effective given the way the GA4 data is structured and the performance bottlenecks we’ve hit so far.Has anyone here faced similar challenges with integrating GA4 data into an AWS ecosystem?How did you handle the schema explosion and performance issues with dbt/Redshift?Any thoughts on best practices or architecture patterns would be really appreciated.Thanks in advance!",7,0.83,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kxsxqv/integrating_ga4_bigquery_into_awsbased_data_stack/,2025-05-28 21:20:48,2025-06-04 01:43:41

1l1eia9,I'm looking to improve our DE stack and I need recommendations.,A_SeriousGamer,dataengineering,"TL;DR: We have a website and a D365 CRM that we currently keep synchronized through Power Automate, and this is rather terrible. What's a good avenue for better centralising our data for reporting? And what would be a good tool for pulling this data into the central data source?As the title says, we work in procurement for education institutions providing frameworks and the ability to raise tender requests free of charge, while collecting spend from our suppliers.Our development team is rather small with about 2-3 web developers (including our tech lead) and a data analyst. We have good experience in PHP / SQL, and rather limited experience in Python (although I have used it).We have our main website, a Laravel site that serves as the main point of contact for both members and suppliers with a Quote Tool (raising tenders) and Spend Reporter (suppliers tell us their revenue through us). The data for this is currently in a MariaDB / MySQL database. The VM for this is currently hosted within Azure.We then have our CRM, a dynamics 365 / PowerApps Model App(?) that handles Member & Supplier data, contacts, and also contains the framework data same as the site. Of course, this data is kept in Microsoft Data verse.These 2 are kept in sync using an array of Power Automate flows that run whenever a change is made on either end, and attempts to synchronise the two. It uses an API built in Laravel to contact the website data. To keep it realtime, there's an Azure Service bus for the messages sent on either end. A custom connector is used to access the API in Power Automate.We also have some other external data sources such as information from other organisations we pull into Microsoft Dataverse using custom connectors or an array of spreadsheets we get from them.Finally, we also have sources such as SharePoint, accounting software, MailChimp, a couple of S3 buckets, etc, that would be relevant to at least mention.Our reports are generally built in Power BI. These reports are generally built using the MySQL server as a source (although they have to be manually refreshed when connecting through an SSH tunnel) for some, and the Dataverse as the other source.We have licenses to build PowerBI reports that ingest data from any source, as well as most of the power platform suite. However, we don't have a license for Microsoft Fabric at the moment.We also have an old setup of Synapse Analytics alongside an Azure SQL database that as far as I can tell neither of these are really being utilised right now.So, my question from here is: what's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised? We've been looking at Snowflake as an option for a data store as well as (maybe?) for ETL/ELT. Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.Additionally, a big requirement is moving away from Power Automate for handling real time ETL processes as this causes far too many problems than solutions. Ideally, the 2-way sync would be kept as close to real-time as possible.So, what would be a good option for central data storage? And what would be a good option for then running data synchronisation and preparation for building reports?I think options that have been on the table either from personal discussions or with a vendor are:- including Azure Data Factory alongside Synapse for ETL- Microsoft Fabric - Snowflake- Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)- using more Power Query (simple, but only for ingesting data into Dataverse)I can answer questions for any additional context if needed, because I can imagine more will be needed.",7,0.82,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l1eia9/im_looking_to_improve_our_de_stack_and_i_need/,2025-06-02 10:26:24,2025-06-04 01:43:41

These rules are not available in a source system today, so the requirement is to create an editable dataset within the lakehouse. This isn't data that's bronze or will be transformed. Business also needs an UI to set these rules. While iceberg does have data editing capabilities, I'm somewhat convinced it's better to have another custom application take care of the rules definition and storage, and be a source of the rules data, instead of managing it all with iceberg and a query engine. To me, it sounds like management of rules is an OLTP use case. Till we decide on this, we are letting the rules be in a file, and that file acts as a source of data brought into the lakehouse. Does anyone else do this? Maintain some master data set that's only in the data lakehouse?

Dad wants me to develop an application for a 32-bit Windows XP desktop. This limits my choices a bit.The application needs a UI though I'm considering developing it as a Web UI. That would require VERY simple HTML4 and minimal JavaScript if any.The only other requirement is that it needs to be able to do raw TCP/IPv4 sockets which generally isn't a problem.I'm proficient in a few languages, C++, C#, and Python being my usual choices.I started with a C# .NET Framework 4.0 project since that's the latest .NET that supports XP. The development process is not going great. My modern IDEs continually gripe and moan about my target platform. MSVC 2022 won't even load it.I could try writing the application in C++ though I think I'd have to target MSVC 2015 x86.

Midway, I got attracted to game development and began learning C++ with Unreal Engine.

I've been self-studying HTML, CSS and PHP, but I keep hitting these mental blocks that make me feel like I'm not making progress or that I'm too dumb to ever get this.My question is: Does anyone have experience with or know platforms where I can hire an online tutor? Like, private PHP lessons? Would it be worth it?If anyone's been through this or has tips to overcome these blocks, I'd really appreciate the help!So here's my story... I started by training my programming logic and spent about 3 months watching video lessons and studying basics: operators, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, arrays. Up to that point, it was okay - I could do exercises (some were hard, but I could work through them).The problems started when I got to callbacks, Promises, async/await and try/catch. These concepts just wouldn't click no matter how many explanations I watched.I got so tired of just doing exercises and watching videos that I switched to PHP (because I wanted to build something real to stay motivated). The basics (operators, loops, functions) were fine since they're similar to JS. (Not sure if this was the right choice, but I thought about creating a login system and saw PHP would work well - just needed to download Laragon and start, and I'm actually liking PHP.)But when it came time to actually code and start the project, I froze. I'd search online, I could understand what the code was doing - like I understood how the database connection worked conceptually - but when I went to type it out, I just couldn't remember the whole code. I felt like I was just copying and pasting, even if the code worked in the end, and everyone says this hurts real learning.To make it worse, a coworker (who also studies) told me that in 3 months he was already way beyond this and that I should try harder. This gave me a massive mental block - it feels like no matter how much I study, I'm not getting anywhere.",13,0.8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kyl2s5/selfstudying_html_css_and_php_but_hitting_massive/,2025-05-29 20:20:18,2025-06-04 01:43:42

I’ll also work on creating a resume and 2-3 projects , then eventually start applying in late August/early September. I wanted to know if this 11-week plan makes sense and is realistic — spending the first 5 weeks learning Python and core programming concepts(ex. Cs50, freecodecamp), then the next 6 weeks focusing on learning dsa/LeetCode and building projects. Is this a realistic/solid approach for someone starting from zero to become interview-ready and landing an internship in just 11 weeks?Worst case scenario, I’m prepared to keep applying until the latest which from what I’ve seen will be January.

1l238w5,Going barebones for practice,TestinThaWaters,learnprogramming,"Okay so hear me out. I started learning programming back in 2021, before GenAi was even a thing (yknow what i mean). So a lot of what i learnt was relatively done by myself. However i was barely studying back then, just as a sidething during work. Fastforward to today, and I've been actually studying for roughly 6months, within that time I've done the following to ""degrade"" myself.1. I started on VSCodr with Intellisense. Using its inbuilt git handling2. Turned off intellisense3. Turned off in-line suggestions4. Only using docs or stackoverflow for questions (sometimes google, never AI)So far every single step has made be a better programmer, i can write my own code, i know im understanding more etc. However I'm MUCH slower than others, i understand this, but i also understand everything im writing, and it feels like a good thing. So... here's what my question/topic is. I realized i dont actually know how to *use* git, since its all run through VScode. So i was going to start doing it myself. Until i realized. ""Huh, i keep turning off functionality, for the sake of learning, why dont i just go back to barebones?""So I've decided to run Linux on a virtual machine, run all commands through the CLI, and use a barebones IDE to go with it (haven't decided yet). Is this a good choice? I feel like i wasn't *learning* anything before, and i know I'll be needing to get used to the CLI and learning another OS isn't neccessarily a bad thing (im on Windows, so Windows+Linux). Would people consider doing this? Should i not go so far? I'm also thinking about learning a low-level language and doing a few projects also.

The latter seems boring, to just sit through hundreds of docs and I genuinely doubt people actually do that, but when I try to make stuff by myself, I don't know if it will become hard to manage slop the more features I add and by the time I realise I will have wasted all that time to then rewrite the entire structure of the program.

I made it such that each sub controller holds a reference to its master and runs some kinda update function of the master so that the master is also informed of all UI changes and can evaluate some stuff or facilitate communication between the sub controllers. Technically this works and I understand it well because I had this idea myself.

In my 1st year, I learned the basics of Python and C—just enough to solve very basic problems. But to be honest, I still get confused with concepts like loops and overall logic-building. So yeah, you can guess where I stand in terms of coding skills: beginner level.Now, I have a one-month break, and I was planning to revise both C and Python from the basics so I don't struggle in my 2nd year. The main reason is that in the 3rd semester, we have to study DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) using Python and C.But here's where I'm confused:Everyone is saying ""Don't waste time relearning basics, start with DSA directly in one language. Once you master DSA in one language, switching to another isn't a big deal.""Some suggest doing DSA in Python, and others say C++ is better for DSA.As someone who's just starting out and hasn't really explored much in the coding world yet, I’m feeling stuck. I don’t know which path to follow. I just want to be confident and not fall behind when DSA classes begin.So please, any guidance would mean a lot:Should I revise Python/C basics first?Which language is better to start DSA with as a beginner: Python or C++?What would you do if you were in my place?Please don’t ignore this post – I genuinely need advice from those who’ve been through this. :folded_hands:",3,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kydanp/title_need_help_choosing_language_for_dsa_python/,2025-05-29 15:12:02,2025-06-04 01:43:42

1l0wg36,Big tech engineering culture has gotten significantly worse,MrMoist,cscareerquestions,"Background - I'm a senior engineer with 10yrs+ experience that has worked at a few Big Tech companies and startups. I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I feel like all the tech ""influencers"" of 2021 glamorized this career to unrealistic expectations, and I need to correct some of the preconceived notions.The last 3 years have been absolutely brutal in terms of declining engineering culture. What's worse is that the toxicity is creating a feedback loops that exacerbates the declining culture.Some of the crazy things I've heard* ""I want to you look at every one of your report and ask yourself, is this person producing enough value to justify their high compensations"" (director to his managers)* ""If that person doesn't have the right skills, get rid of them and we'll find someone that does"" (VP to an entire organization after pivoting technology direction). * I.e. - It's not worth training people anymore, even if they're talented and can learn anything new. It's all sink or swim now* ""If these candidates aren't willing to grind hundreds of leetcode questions, they don't have mental fortitude to handle this job"" (engineers to other engineers) * To be fair, I felt like this was a defense mechanism. The amount of BS that you need to put up with to not get laid off has grown significantly.* ""Working nights and weekends is expected"" (manager to my coworker that was on PIP because he didn't work weekends). * I've always felt this pressure previously. But I've never heard it truly be verbalized until recently. Final thoughts* Software engineering in big tech feels more akin to investment banking now. Most companies expect this to be your life. You truly have to be ""passionate"" about making a bunch of money, or ""passionate"" about the product to survive.* Don't get too excited if your company stock skyrockets. The leaders of the company will continue to pinch every bit of value out of you because they're technically paying you more now (e.g. meta) and they know that the job market is harsh.* Prior to 2022, Amazon was considered the most toxic big tech company. But ironically, their multiple layers of bureaucracy and stagnating stock price likely prevented the the culture from getting too much worse, whereas many other companies have drastically exceeded Amazon in terms of toxicity in 2025. IMO, Amazon is solidly 50th percentile in terms of culture now. If you couldn't handle Amazon culture prior to 2022, then you definitely can't handle the type of culture that exists now.",2174,0.97,457,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l0wg36/big_tech_engineering_culture_has_gotten/,2025-06-01 18:42:37,2025-06-04 01:43:43

I learned so much in such little time and picked up so many soft skills, such as how to consult different engineers and compile their knowledge to properly add new features to infra way too big for any 1 dev to have 100% knowledge on.But my manager squeezed and sucked all of that passion out of me. I’ve tried my best to work on our relationship, but he’s spent all year treating me with explicit disdain, not making eye contact, and ignoring whatever I say in team lunches.I buckled down as much as I could to do better, but every 1:1 became a condescending berating session and I never felt like I truly belonged on the team.Whenever features were delayed, the majority of the time it was because of consistently broken infra, incomplete features from sister teams that mine depended on to start, or inaccurate guidance from dev’s I was asked to consult. I accepted the weaknesses within my control and improved them, but no matter what I did, I could never beat the narrative.Anything I did good was sarcastically devalued and whenever anything went wrong, my manager would tell me I should’ve taken X action that I wouldn’t have known to do at the time without privileged knowledge or time travel (hindsight advice).Coworkers and mentor repeatedly told me I was doing fine, but I just had our first performance review, and I’m being offered 2 things:**PIP vs Severance.**This severance side offer is brand new this year and our company has had huge layoffs.The actual meeting was another vague collection of criticisms, in which, when I asked him what I could’ve ideally done differently, he said “I’m not here to give specific edge cases for you to iterate literally off of and am just looking for high level resourcefulness from you”.When he would list specifically delayed features, I would tell him how I did everything in my power, including implementing his advice (which I can prove), only for the infra related reasons to delay it.When I tried to show areas I’ve improved in, he would agree but then re-insist how below the mark I am even though I’m never been sure what a “Meets Expectation” counterpart of me hypothetically looks like all year. His goalpost for me always felt fictional.Now, I feel extremely jaded and demotivated being forced into this job market.

1kxkbsi,"I just bombed a first round technical by over-preparing, and I think a lot of you need to hear about it.",garyspzhn,cscareerquestions,"I’m a 10YOE dev who talks a big game, i fail interviews from time to time like anyone else but my success rate in recent years is particularly high, so I just tried my hand at a company whose job posting was way too good to be true, passed the initial screener and coding assessment with flying colors, but fumbled the opportunity in the most disheartening way. Here’s the story: The CS job market isn’t as black-and-white as you may imagine, there are still a lot of companies that don’t exactly know what they’re doing, they’ll offer you a competitive salary and put you through the ringer, but they’ll still manage to cut through candidates just by following due process and putting the pressure on them. I’ve been writing PHP for 13 years, and up until 2 years ago I’ve done PHP in production, on-and-off for 10 years, but I naturally moved on to JavaScript, Python, and Java because nobody wants us. In other words, I thought I’ll never see another PHP role again, so I stopped searching for them, stopped calling myself a PHP specialist, stopped reading up on latest versions, and got rusty, then a company that uses PHP found me, and they were offering me an insanely good deal, so I jumped at the role. The online assessment was easy, it was medium leet code that required PHP, and I’m great at PHP, so it took me 10 minutes. The screening interview was even easier, we were supposed to talk for 30 minutes, we spoke for 90 minutes, the guy told me what to expect in the technical interview (because I asked), he mentioned all the standards buzzwords like system design and application design, then went into the details, got more particular, told me to brush up on my redis and Java, MVC frameworks, MySQL and security protocols, so I did that - huge mistake. The technical interview was far more like a “screener” than anything else, we didn’t cover system design as intricately as I thought, a lot of what transpired was a pop quiz with questions like “do you know what traits are?” and “do you know what anonymous functions are and how they’re used?” This was supposed to take 45 minutes, I had him on the video chat for 2 hours, I acted clueless the whole time, not because I didn’t know what half the answers were, but because I didn’t study for a pop quiz, i was shocked, I was nervous, I was stressed, I was angry, and most importantly, I was disappointed in myself, because this was the luckiest break ever, and I ruined it. At one point I was so lost, I was second guessing myself, so he did me a favor and shared a codepen, I passed the little “coding challenge” he looked relieved, said “okay so you know this” then resumed the pop quiz, which again, I bombed. Guess what I did to prepare for this interview? Yep, you guessed it! Leet Code and online lectures. Why did i go this route? Tech forums convinced me the job market is an AI-driven rat race and the hiring manager confirmed the bias for me, but I would’ve passed the technical if I just opened and read PHP documentation like the good old days. So the moral of the story is, do all your general interview prep periodically, and when you get the actual interview, just read the documentation, because you never know what kind of interviewer you’re gonna get.

Me and the two other engineers on our team have tried to explain to this guy that we aren't remotely as good as him, and that he'd have to straight up 3x his estimates for any projects he isn't working on. But to no apparent success. He ends up locking us into utterly insane purely self imposed deadlines that have required enormous late night heroics from everyone to complete.

Those that have been working for a few years now, what are your future plans for your career as we face the incoming AI onslaught? It's wild witnessing such a paradigm shift that will literally affect almost every aspect of our lives. We got a bit of a sneak preview, working in tech. Now AI tools are becoming more mainstream and everyone that's trying to make a buck is rushing to either incorporate AI into their product, or make a new AI product. At some point the barrier to entry for coding will be completely mitigated by AI. As long as you can articulate the concepts in natural speech, your idea can be created. We're not there yet, but quickly trending toward it. I personally try to take all the AI hype with a grain of salt, especially with claims like ""AI wrote 30% of Google's new code"" and such that talk up the very same products they're trying to sell. But it can still do plenty of coding, I'm sure most of us know well by now. At this point you have to embrace or get left behind, it seems. Maybe some don't agree with this notion? I'm at 6 YOE and would like to continue in this industry as long as I can. I'm just not sure where on the spectrum of 'get good at React' and 'get good at spoon feeding chatgpt your project requirements"" we're at. Developer roles will look different in 5 years. So, just curious how others are approaching things. Do you feel comfortable in your current role? Continuing to learn new languages/frameworks/whatever as needed for the job?

I failed to secure an internship in either the summer after sophomore or junior year. Just before graduating, I had applied to about 35 jobs with no response - not even an asynchronous coding test. It was already clear that I was cooked with no internships. Combining this disappointment with some major health issues, I went the next 7 months after graduation without applying to a single job. I started applying again in January 2025 and over the last 5 months, I've applied to 142 jobs through Linkedin, Indeed and rarely some other sites.In all of these jobs, only about 15 were for software engineering, with all of the rest being lesser tech roles, some even barely tech related: Data Analyst I, Junior Business Analyst, Entry Level QA tester, etc. I've received a total of 6 ""next steps"" including 3 in person interviews and 0 offers. During this time, the only experience I've been able to advertise is my senior year Software Engineering project (year long capstone), an online Business Analysis course, and a handful of menial summer jobs. Grinding Leetcode is pointless - like I said, I've never even been granted the opportunity of a coding interview. Leveraging what few family connections I have has led to little more than ""apply online"" or ""send me your resume"" (the one with no real experience on it).I hear all of these stories that say ""Don't give up! I applied to 500 jobs before I landed my first software engineering job"". Nevermind that there's no chance of me landing an SE job as my first role (no internships), I have yet to get a straight answer as to where people are even seeing 500 relevant tech roles LET ALONE entry level. Both Indeed and Linkedin have slowed to a drip of one semi-relevant entry level job for every 15 that are irrelevant, a scam, or 2-4 years experience crap.So that's where I am. I have no idea what to do at this point, short of applying to Revature and seeing where that takes me (literally). Every day that goes by, I can feel the entry level CS jobs dwindling.

1l1nq2d,"6 months into First SWE job and I’m burnt out, looking for advice.",GoyardJefe,cscareerquestions,"My Background: New Grad SWE (graduated 2025), 1.5 years freelancing, currently 6 months into industry SWE role. Hey everyone, I am looking for advice in my current role. I landed my first software engineering job about 6 months ago after applying to over 750 jobs. The process broke me a bit, but I was so relieved to finally get a foot in the door. This was the only company I made to the final round, so I was going to take it since I was graduating in the next couple months and needed to secure work. It’s a small startup with a team of about 10 engineers. But the environment and expectations are burning me out and I don’t know what to do. Here’s what’s been making this so hard:- Strict micromanagement: My boss tracks and questions every small task. Sometimes asking for 5-6 different changes on the same ticket. When I think something is done, I have to go back and add even more to it, despite it never being asked in the first place. - Zero mentorship or support: I was thrown into the codebase with minimal onboarding and barely any documentation. No code reviews, no senior dev guidance — I’m expected to figure out complex features solo and somehow get everything right. Ive been able to figure things out, but it’s been a very tedious and tiresome process. - Unrealistic expectations: Every ticket is somehow “urgent,” and I always feel behind because the timelines just aren’t realistic. There’s no prioritization since EVERYTHING seems to be high priority. Every month management says they will “replan the month priorities” but they never do and I’m stuck with infinite tickets for the month that just all need to be done. - Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way). I am yet to ask for remote work, but my peer told me not to expect more than 1 day remote, despite the majority of the team having 2-3 days a week remote. By the time I get home, Im exhausted and barely have time to decompress or do things I like before having to sleep to get my 8 hours. Ultimately, I feel trapped. I was grateful to find work after sending 700+ apps, but this constant grind in this environment is really disrupting my mental health. I don’t want to go back to square one and leave this job since I have a lot of financial pressures, but can’t see my self staying here much longer. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to manage this? I feel like 1yoe does not mean anything in this market, but Im not sure how much longer I can continue doing this. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!TLDR: 6 months into first SWE role, feeling stressed from work environment, expectations, and commute.

1l1ps0u,I responded to a questionable automated rejection and got my application back in the queue,venerated,cscareerquestions,"I wanted to share this because I'd usually think someone responding to an automated rejection is a fool and I hesitated for a moment before doing so. I got a rejection from a job that mentioned something about needing to be able to legally work in the country I reside in. I think it's the rejection for needing an H1B visa. Considering that I'm a US citizen working from the US, I decided to reply, despite thinking my email would go into some inbox or maybe the trash, never to be seen. I got laid off over 2 weeks ago so I really need a job, but also this is a job that I am genuinely excited about and would apply there even if I had a job, so I figured what do I have to lose? To my surprise, I got a reply less than 2 hours later saying that there was an error in the filters they set up and my application was rejected by mistake. They got my application back in the queue. I emailed them back thanking them for investigating and letting me know what happened. They replied saying that I also saved 2 other applications from false rejection. While this may not get me a job, it got me on their radar, restored some of my own faith in humanity, and also saved 2 other people from the same hopelessness. I usually wouldn't pay much attention to a rejection email since they're all usually the same, but I guess don't be scared to take a chance and reach out?

1kzkic1,Some things I've learned recently in the current job market,Ok-Process-2187,cscareerquestions,"Some of these may be obvious but I guess it wasn't for me.1.) during coding rounds, verbalize to confirm understanding not to express thinkingI used to think that I should vocalize all my thoughts and avoid any silence. This has proven to be problematic for a few reasons. First, when you're initially reading the question, vocalizing will unnecessarily slow you down. Second, you probably don't sound very smart when you're quickly reading the question like that, you might start looking for ways to condense sentences, skip over certain sentences, etc. It's all unnecessary.The time to vocalize your thoughts is after you've read it and to then confirm your understanding of the question with the interviewer.Then instead of brainstorming out loud the very first thing that comes to mind. I would ask for another minute to think of how you'd approach the question. The problem with saying the very first thing that comes to mind is that if it's obviously wrong then the interviewer may correct you which would be interpreted as giving you a hint which would count against you. After you've wrestled with the idea for a bit only then share your solution out loud with the interviewer.I wouldn't even bother mentioning an obvious brute force solution if you already have a better idea in mind since talking about the brute force will cut into your time.So the TLDR here is to be more strategic about when to vocalize your thought process.2.) during non-coding rounds, wait for your turn to talk, never interrupt the interviewerThis will probably be obvious to most but I used to interrupt the interviewer near the beginning. Not intentionally. If they said something that I thought would make for a really interesting question, then I would ask it right there when there was a natural pause in the conversation.I now realize this is very bad. It's always better to wait till you're sure that they are done speaking or until they ask you if you have any questions. You gain nothing by interrupting them but can easily make a bad impression and decrease the signal you give from your question by asking during a time in which they aren't fully ready to evaluate you since they still need to get through the rest of what they wanted to say. Plus, they might have brought up an even better point later on.3.) during a hiring manager round, to express that you're serious about the role, interview the interviewerYou can't tell the interviewer that you really want the position. That you've deeply thought about staying at the company in the long term. That you are a top candidate.You can only express these things by asking tough questions that make the interviewer think and possibly feel like they're being interviewed. Obviously you don't want to take this too far. You should ask questions that show you've deeply thought about the company's business model and how the role you're being hired for aligns with that. You should ask questions to see how clearly the hiring manager understands what will be needed for the role. It is genuinely a red flag if you're being hired for a role in which the hiring manager is not sure about what you'll be working on. Think about what other things could be red flags as well and ask some pointed (but still polite) questions about those.My current strategy for this is to split my preparation for this part of the interview over 2 days. On day 1 I learn as much as I can from quick online research about the company and do my best to come up with questions of substance. On day 2 I try again and this is when I come up with much higher quality questions.",43,0.86,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kzkic1/some_things_ive_learned_recently_in_the_current/,2025-05-31 00:53:15,2025-06-04 01:43:43

Back in 2022, I was interested in Computer Science, so I chose the nearest college that offered a new BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence. In hindsight, I realize the course was more of a marketing tactic — using the buzzword ""AI"" to attract students.The curriculum focused mainly on basic CS concepts but lacked depth. We skimmed over data structures and algorithms, touched upon C and Java programming superficially, and did a bit more Python — but again, nothing felt comprehensive. Even the AI-specific modules like machine learning and deep learning were mostly theoretical, with minimal mathematical grounding and almost no practical implementation. Our professors mostly taught using content from GeeksforGeeks and JavaTpoint. Hands-on experience was almost nonexistent.That said, I can’t blame the college entirely. I was dealing with a lot of internal struggles — depression, lack of motivation, and laziness — and I didn’t take the initiative to learn the important things on my own. I do have a few projects under my belt, mostly using OpenAI APIs or basic computer vision models like YOLO. But nothing feels significant. I also don’t know anything about front-end or back-end development. I’ve just used Streamlit to deploy some college projects.Over the past three years, I’ve mostly coasted through — maintaining a decent GPA but doing very little beyond that. I’ve just finished my third year, and I have one more to go.Right now, I’m doing a summer internship at a startup as an ML/DL intern, which I’m honestly surprised I got. The work is mostly R&D with a bit of implementation around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and I’m actually enjoying it. But it's also been a wake-up call — I’m realizing how little I actually know. I’m still relying heavily on AI to write most of my code, just like I did for all my previous projects. It’s scary. I don’t feel prepared for the job market at all.I’m scared I’ve fallen too far behind. The field is so saturated, and there are people out there who are far more talented and driven. I have no fallback plan. I don't know what to do next. I’d really appreciate any guidance — where to start, what skills to focus on, which courses or certifications are actually worth doing.

1l19od2,As a bootcamp grad- should I accept a drastic demotion?,ThisAintNoBeer,cscareerquestions,"I graduated from a CS bootcamp in May 2023. Previously I had only worked in retail. I do not have a Bachelor's or even an AA degree (though a decent amount of community college units completed). Right out of the bootcamp I was lucky enough to land an internship at a small government organization via a connection through the bootcamp.I was then converted to full time after the internship. It was a pretty modest junior web developer role that only paid about $50k/yr but the work environment and mentorship were phenomenal. And at least it had some pension and healthcare benefits. Over the last 22 months I've learned a ton and have been given the freedom to make some large and meaningful contributions to the company's flagship products.Sadly we've been hit with some pretty heft budget cutbacks. As the most junior person at the company I'm first on the chopping block and was laid off. As I was being let go, the organization's director offered me a Teaching Assist position at the bootcamp I had graduated. Apparently part of their deal with the bootcamp requires they contribute a certain amount of developer hours towards instruction.She wanted to try something new with a single dev doing the Teaching Assistant thing full time (previously they'd have the more senior devs rotate in every now and then). Currently I work 3 days from home and 2 days in-office. The teaching role would be 4 days a week on-site. I would still be employed by my current organization and keep the title of ""Junior Web Developer"". My compensation would be cut down to $30k/yr AND no benefits.I have a few days to think it over but am tempted to pass on the ""opportunity"". Would that be a mistake? It would be nice to add a third year as a junior developer to my resume along with some teaching experience but I feel like they're really just taking advantage of me.Alternatively I can try to test the waters in this absolutely awful job market. But don't foresee myself getting anywhere. I know tons of people with CS degrees that are having no luck whatsoever. I could also alternatively collect unemployment while working towards an accelerated degree program myself and hope things get better in a year or two.I feel stuck between two kinda terrible options. Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks!tl;dr Bootcamp grad with no degree but 2 yoe. Currently making $50k/yr with healthcare benefits. Was laid off but offered $30k/yr and no healthcare.

Alternatively I could collect unemployment at $1800/months for 6 months while applying full time and working towards a CS degreeEdit: I spoke to my principal engineer and he was pretty adamant that I do not take that position.

1l01qc5,I don't know if IT profession is for me anymore. I don't know what to do...,Transparent_Prophet,cscareerquestions,"I love technology akin to a child who loved going to candy land. That's what made me aspire for the profession. I wanted to be involved in it, specially the software - the coding, testing, studying, whatever else. Basically, I'm a nerd. But reality is harsher and often more disappointing than fantasy. My first job and my current one completely and utterly killed any sort of passion I had for the profession. I was squeezed dry with nothing left to give... and I feel so lost. I've been asking myself the past few months - Where do I go? What should I do?My first job was a software dev in a small 50+ company. They say your first job out of college is always an experience, for good or ill, which I agree. I learned a lot and realized some things about myself. I made great memories with my former colleagues. However, more than a year, I was forced to consider the decision to leave due to several reasons - I love coding as much as the next guy but the company is too disorganized. We had to change tech stack twice in just a few months. I also got somewhat disillusioned at the realization that projects never truly end - I love learning as much as the next guy, but all the endless studying that ends up becoming obsolete too quickly... got to me somewhat. It's weird given why I wanted to become a dev in the first place, but it feels like, in a sense, I developed a depression in futility. It's like none of things I did would matter in the next few months. I would've been fine with it. But it's too quickly in my opinion...My second job was in a corporate bank as an SRE junior officer. I like how organized it is. How much less pressure there is on me. I can safely take a Leave when necessary without the threat of on-call. Odd because this job IS an on-call. High salary. Great benefits. I also thought trying a different job might grant me new perspective. Switching from development to operations. It's not a total career switching, but it's different enough.I was optimistic... and got punished for it. After I got regularized, my workload gradually increased. I can normally handle it but the issue is the way things happened.I currently live in a solo apartment, on-call hybrid setup (just this month, I had to work outside my hours many times, some on weekends). There's so much to learn, so much to do, so much juggle... I *can't*. I can't keep up. I realized a fundamental fact about myself - I'm not a great multitasker. I'm a deep thinker (which is why I aspired to be a dev in the first place). I can multi-task, but not so often and not so fast-paced. It's not sustainable. And now, I'm falling apart.My routine was ruined. I don't eat as much. I have inconsistent sleep hours (too few or too much sleep). I don't even leave my apartment in the weekends because I'm too tired and I have housework to do. The salary is great but I doubt it's worth how disorganized I've become. I've become obsessed with completing my tasks. I don't respond to my parents' calls and messages anymore. It hasn't even been a year and I'm already crushed under pressure.Things became so bad my work performance plummeted - lapses in judgement, slower memory, increasingly ""closed-off"" behavior, breathing problems, headaches, constant exhaustion... I pretty much decided to screw it and go home this weekend. I want to see my family and de-stress. But I know fully well that won't be enough.I don't know what to do. I want to job hop but even THAT is an effort in itself in my current situation. I'm too tired for it. I took Leave once a month, but it's not enough.I made enough savings and my family is not financially struggling. My sister already has a job and graduating in a month or two. I feel guilty for the idea nonetheless because I'll become a burden and is using them to cushion me, but I'm so lost.I also don't know where I want to go, what I want to do. Do I leave IT profession entirely? Or is it a case of having terrible work-life balance and hope the next one would be the golden goose? I'm being pessimistic right now and believe that's just perpetuating the cycle.I'm at a point where I'd probably be happy with a lower paying job with less stress and pressure on studying off-hours like my experiences forced on me.",8,0.7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l01qc5/i_dont_know_if_it_profession_is_for_me_anymore_i/,2025-05-31 16:51:58,2025-06-04 01:43:43

1l1f0a9,How do I take paternity time with inherited failing projects?,DeletdButChngdMyMind,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR - Inherited a project right before the birth of my child, have been working since. Project has been stalling, and my health is deteriorating taking care of the newborn and project. How can I request paternity leave in this situation?Hi, TIA.I started at my new company late last year, and did a fair/ok job, so I started inheriting teammates assignments (we code).My senior teammate (didn’t get to spend much time with them due to teammate being OOO for a good portion of Q4) left the bank in Q1, and transferred their a project code body and materials to me.It was around their departure time that I let work know I was expecting a baby at the beginning of Q2. Given that I was relatively new, and our FTE count was down due to this departure, I agreed to help complete their outstanding projects with the expectation of taking time in July (I know, I know…this was a bad idea. Had I known the complexity of this project, if it was further pushed by management, I would have refused or resigned).Baby came at the start of Q2, and the project has experienced setbacks — I learned after the fact that the knowledge transfer wasn’t all that complete, and the block of code i recieved in transition will probably require major rework thru validation. I can easily see this going thru Q2 and into the beginning of Q3.Issue is I’m not sleeping due to the baby schedule, and I have a chronic condition I am managing privately. It’s not an issue usually, but currently I am feeling exhausted and starting to experience burnout. My partner is also starting to wear thin, and is requesting my presence with the newborn and our other children. We are entitled to a large amount of paternity leave at my company, but I feel this would almost be considered abandoning my project. I’m currently stuck between not wanting to fail work/losing employment and being there for my family.Any advice would be appreciated.

I have 11 distraction free weeks before the fall semester starts, and I plan on dedicating 7-9 hours 6 days per week for this.

Is this a realistic/solid approach for someone starting from zero to become interview-ready and landing an internship in just 11 weeks?

It seems pretty solid, and I just had my first day yesterday. Their front end is pretty straightforward, using js, html, css, etc. but they use ancient languages like pick basic for everything else.

I want to get into development, and while this job offers that, will I get stuck here? My friends are telling me that I am ‘cooked’ but in my mind, even with these old languages, there is still so much practical experience here that can transfer into better development jobs that is much better than just sitting on my ass and getting decline letters for lack of experience. In my mind, this is my experience and even if it’s old, I think that the other skills combined that I will use in this job will make up for everything else.The best things this job offers in my opinion, is their front-end development, and also linux experience.
