1lrh9w5,2025 Open Source Tech Stack,DataCraftsman,dataengineering,"I'm a Technical Lead Engineer. Previously a Data Engineer, Data Analyst and Data Manager and Aircraft Maintenance Engineer. I am also studying Software Engineering at the moment.I've been working in isolated environments for the past 3 years which prevents me from using modern cloud platforms. Most of my time in DE has been on the platform side, not the data side. Since I joined the field, DevOps, MLOPs, LLMs, RAG and Data Lakehouse have been added to our responsibility on top of the old Modern Data Stack and Data Warehouses. This stack covers all of the use cases I have faced so far. These are my current recommendations for each of those problems in a self hosted, open source environment (with the exception of vibe coding, I haven't found any model good enough to do so yet). You don't need all of these tools, but you could use them all if you needed to. Solve the problems you have with the minimum tools you can. I have been working on guides on how to deploy the stack in docker/kubernetes on my site, [www.datacraftsman.com.au](http://www.datacraftsman.com.au), but not all of them are finished yet... I've been vibe coding data engineering tools instead as it's a fun distraction. I hope these resources help you make a better decision with your architecture.Comment below if you have any advice on improving the stack with reasons why, need any help setting up the tools or want to understand my choices and I'll try my best to help.",536,0.86,86,https://i.redd.it/0bwy1conkuaf1.png,2025-07-04 12:15:10,2025-07-11 01:48:43

1lvyzbc,Vibe / Citizen Developers bringing our Datawarehouse to it's knees,Swimming_Cry_6841,dataengineering,"Received an alert this morning stating that compute usage increased 2000% on a data warehouse.I went and looked at the top queries coming in and spotted evidence of Vibe coders right away. Stuff like SELECT \* or SELECT TOP 7,000,000 \* with a list of 50 different tables and thousands of fields at once (like 10,000), all joined on non-clustered indexes. And not just one query like this, but tons coming through.Started to look at query plans and calculate algorithmic complexity. Some of this was resulting in 100 Billion Query Steps and killing the Data Warehouse, while also locking all sorts of tables and causing resource locks of every imaginable style. The data warehouse, until the rise of citizen developers, was so overprovisioned that it rarely exceeded 5% of its total compute capability; however, it is now spiking at 100%.That being said, management is overjoyed to boast about how they are adding more and more 'vibe coders' (who have no background in development and can't code, i.e., they are unfamiliar with concepts such as inner joins versus outer joins or even basic SQL syntax). They know how to click, cut, paste, and run. Paste the entire schema dump and run the query. This is the same management by the way that signed a deal with a cloud provider and agreed to pay $2million dollars for 2TB of cold log storage lol The rise of Citizen Developers is causing issues where I am, with potentially high future costs.",281,0.98,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lvyzbc/vibe_citizen_developers_bringing_our/,2025-07-10 00:28:06,2025-07-11 01:48:43

In all I processed 178.33 GB ZIP files, which uncompressed was 3314.57 GB. I created Parquet files for each table, with the data types optimized.Here are some next steps that I want to do, and I would love anyone's comments on it:* Create a Dagster (have to learn it) pipeline that downloads and processes the data tables when they are updated (I am almost finished creating a Python Package).* Create a process that will upload the files to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (CERNs data portal) and other sites such as The Internet Archive, and Hugging Face. The data will be versioned so we will always be able to go back in time and see what code was used to create the data and how the data has changed. I also want to create a torrent file for each dataset and have it HTTP seeded from the aforementioned sites; I know this is overkill as the largest dataset is only 6.94 GB, but I want to experiment with it as I think it would be awesome for a data portal to have this feature.* Create a Python package that magically links the data tables to their geographic boundaries. This way people will be able to view it software such as QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, DeckGL, lonboard, or anything that can read Parquet.All of the code to create the data is currently in \[2\].

1lrsrdn,What tests do you do on your data pipeline?,mockingbean,dataengineering,"Am I (lone 1+yoe DE on my team who is feeding 3 DS their data) the naive one? Or am I being gaslighted:My team, which is data starved, has imo unrealistic expectations about how tested a pipeline should be by the data engineer. I must basically do data analysis. Jupyter notebooks and the whole DS package, to completely and finally document the data pipeline _and the data quality_, before the data analysts can lay their eyes on the data. And at that point it's considered a failure if I need to make some change. I feel like this is very waterfall like, and slows us down, because they could have gotten the data much faster if I don't have to spend time doing basically what they should be doing either way, and probably will do again. If there was a genuine intentional feedback loop between us, we could move much faster than what were doing. But now it's considered failure if an adjustment is needed or an additional column must be added etc after the pipeline is documented, which must be completed before they will touch the data.I actually don't mind doing data analysis on a personal level, but it's weird that a data starved data science team doesn't want more data and sooner, and do this analysis themselves?",61,0.94,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lrsrdn/what_tests_do_you_do_on_your_data_pipeline/,2025-07-04 20:36:51,2025-07-11 01:48:43

1lsg7gu,Building a Data Warehouse: alone and without practical experience,bukketraven,dataengineering,"Background: I work in an SME which has a few MS SQL databases for different use cases and a Standard ERP system. Reporting is mainly done via downloading files from the ERP and importing it into PowerBI or excel. For some projects we call the api of the ERP to get the data. Other specialized Applications sit on Top of the SQL databases.Problems: Most of the Reports get fed manually and we really want to get them to run automatically (including data cleaning), which would save a lot of time. Also, the many sources of Data cause a lot of confusion, as internal clients are not always sure where the Data comes from and how up to date it is. Combining data sources is also very painful right now and work feels very redundant. This is why i would like to Build a „single source of truth“.My idea is to Build a analytics database, most likely a data Warehouse according to kimball. I understand how it works theoretically, but i have never done it. I have a masters in business Informatics (Major in Business Intelligence and System Design) and have read the kimball Book. SQL knowledge is very Basic, but i am very motivated to learn.My questions to you are:1.⁠⁠is this a project that i could handle myself without any practical experience? Our IT Department is very small and i only have one colleague that could support a little with database/sql stuff. I know python and have a little experience with prefect. I have no deadline and i can do courses/certs if necessary.2.⁠⁠My current idea is to start with Open source/free tools. BigQuery, airbyte, dbt and prefect as orchestrator. Is this a feasible stack or would this be too much overhead for the beginning? Bigquery, Airbyte and dbt are new to me, but i am motivated to learn (especially the Latter)I know that i will have to do a internal Research on wether this is a feasible project or not, also Talking to stakeholders and defining processes. I will do that before developing anything. But i am still wondering if any of you were in a similar situation or if some More experienced DEs have a few hints for me.

1ltg0pt,Why Realtime Analytics Feels Like a Myth (and What You Can Actually Expect),ivanimus,dataengineering,"Hi there :waving_hand:I’ve been diving into the concept of realtime analytics, and I’m starting to think it’s more hype than reality. Here’s why achieving true realtime analytics (sub-second latency) is so tough, especially when building data marts in a Data Warehouse or Lakehouse:1. Processing Delays: Even with CDC (Change Data Capture) for instant raw data ingestion, subsequent steps like data cleaning, quality checks, transformations, and building data marts take time. Aggregations, validations, and metric calculations can add seconds to minutes, which is far from the ""realtime"" promise (<1s).2. Complex Transformations: Data marts often require heavy operations—joins, aggregations, and metric computations. These depend on data volume, architecture, and compute power. Even with optimized engines like Spark or Trino, latency creeps in, especially with large datasets.3. Data Quality Overhead: Raw data is rarely clean. Validation, deduplication, and enrichment add more delays, making ""near-realtime"" (seconds to minutes) the best-case scenario.4. Infra Bottlenecks: Fast ingestion via CDC is great, but network bandwidth, storage performance, or processing engine limitations can slow things down.5. Hype vs. Reality: Marketing loves to sell ""realtime analytics"" as instant insights, but real-world setups often mean seconds-to-minutes latency. True realtime is only feasible for simple use cases, like basic metric monitoring with streaming systems (e.g., Kafka + Flink).TL;DR: Realtime analytics isn’t exactly a scam, but it’s overhyped. You’re more likely to get ""near-realtime"" due to unavoidable processing and transformation delays. To get close to realtime, simplify transformations, optimize infra, and use streaming tech—but sub-second latency is still a stretch for complex data marts.What’s your experience with realtime analytics? Have you found ways to make it work, or is near-realtime good enough for most use cases?",37,0.78,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ltg0pt/why_realtime_analytics_feels_like_a_myth_and_what/,2025-07-07 00:04:23,2025-07-11 01:48:43

So I'm basically just asking for a gut check here to see if this makes sense or if something like Delta Lake would be necessary here. In addition, I've traditionally used schemas to separate dev from uat and prod in the RDBMS. But if I'm then also separating it by medallion layers then we start to get what seems to be some unnecessary schema bloat.

1lrcx96,"Please help, do modern BI systems need an analytics Database (DW etc.)",Starbuckz42,dataengineering,"Hello,I apologize if this isn't the right spot to ask but I'm feeling like I'm in a needle in a haystack situation and was hoping one of you might have that huge magnet that I'm lacking.TLDR:How viable is a BI approach without an extra analytics database? Source -> BI ToolLonger version:Coming from being ""the excel guy"" I've recently been promoted to analytics engineer (whether or not that's justified is a discussion for another time and place).My company's reporting was entirely build upon me accessing source systems like our ERP and CRM through SQL directly and feeding that into Excel via power query.Due to growth in complexity and demand this isn't a sustainable way of doing things anymore, hence me being tasked with BI-ifying that stuff.Now, it's been a while (read ""a decade"") since the last time I've come into contact with dimensional modeling, kimball and data warehousing.But that's more or less what I know or rather I can get my head around, so naturally that's what I proposed to build.Our development team is seeing things differently saying that storing data multiple times would be unacceptable and with the amount of data we have performance wouldn't be either.They propose to build custom APIs for the various source systems and feeding those directly into whatever BI tool we choose (we are 100% on-prem so powerBI is out of the race, tableau is looking good rn).And here is where I just don't know how to argue. How valid is their point? Do we even need a data warehouse (or lakehouse and all those fancy things I don't know anything about)?One argument they had was that BI tools come with their own specialized ""database"" that is optimized and much faster in a way we could never build it manually.But do they really? I know Excel/power query has some sort of storage, same with powerBI but that's not a database, right?I'm just a bit at a loss here and was hoping you actual engineers could steer me in the right direction.Thank you!",12,0.75,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lrcx96/please_help_do_modern_bi_systems_need_an/,2025-07-04 07:43:03,2025-07-11 01:48:43

This is quite exciting, but also I'm not so experienced to be confident about my choices here, so would really use your advice :).I need to build a system that will run multiple pipelines that will be ingesting data from various sources (MS SQL databases, API, Splunk etc.) to one MS SQL database. I'm thinking about going with the setup suggested in the title - using DLTHub for ingestion pipelines, DBT or SQLMesh for transforming data in the database and Airflow to schedule this. Is this generally speaking a good direction?For some more context: \- for now the volume of the data is quite low and the frequency of the ingestion is daily at most; \- I need a strong focus on security and privacy due to the nature of the data; \- I'm sitting on Azure.And lastly a specific technical question, as I started to implement this solution locally - does anyone have experience with running dlt on Airflow? What's the optimal way to structure the credentials for connections there? For now I specified them in Airflow connections, but then in each Airflow task I need to pull the credentials from the connections and pass them to dlt source and destination, which doesn't make much sense.

1lsgfqq,Data Quality for Transactional Databases,on_the_mark_data,dataengineering,"Hey everyone! I'm creating a hands-on coding course for upstream data quality for transactional databases and would love feedback on my plan! (this course is with a third party [not a vendor] that I won't name).All of my courses have sandbox environments that can be run in GitHub CodeSpaces, infra is open source, and uses a public gov dataset. For this I'm planning on having the following:- Postgres Database- pgAdmin for SQL IDE- A very simple typescript frontend app to surface data- A very simple user login workflow for CRUD data- A data catalog via DataHubWe will have a working data product as well as create data by going through the login workflow a couple times. We will then intentionally break it (update the data to be bad, change the login data collected without changing schema, and changing the DDL files to introduce errors). These errors will be hidden from the user, but they will see a bunch of errors in the logs and frontend.From there we conduct a root cause analysis to identify the issues. Examples of ways we will resolve issues is the following:- Revert back changes to the frontend- Add regex validation for login workflow- Review and fix introduced bugs in the DDL files- Implement DQ checks to run in CI/CD that compares proposed schema changes to expected schema in data catalogAnything you would add or change to this plan? Note that I already have a DQ for analytical databases course that this builds on.My goal is less teaching theory, and more so creating a real-world experience that matches what the job is actually like.",12,0.82,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lsgfqq/data_quality_for_transactional_databases/,2025-07-05 18:22:14,2025-07-11 01:48:43

1ltsbjn,Star schema - flatten dimensional hierarchy?,paulrpg,dataengineering,"I'm doing some design work where are are generally trying to follow Kimball modelling for a star schema. I'm familiar with the theory of the data warehouse toolkit but I haven't had that much experience implementing it. For reference, we are doing this in snowflake/dbt and were talking about tables with a few million rows.I am trying to model a process which has a fixed hierarchy. We have 3 layers to this - a top level organisational plan, a plan for doing a functional test and then the individual steps taken to complete this plan. To make it a bit more complicated - whilst the process I am looking at has a fixed hierarchy but the process is a subset of a larger process which allows for arbitrary depth, I feel that the simpler business case is easier to solve first.I want to end up with 1 or several dimensional models to capture this, store descriptive text etc. The literature states that fixed hierarchies should be flattened. If we took this approach:* Our dimension table grain is 1 row for each task* Each row would contain full textual information for the functional test and the organisational plan* We have a small 'One Big Table' approach, making it easy for BI users to access the dataThe challenge I see here is around what keys to use. Our business processes map to different levels of this hierarchy, some to the top level plan, some to the functional test and some to the step.I keep going back and forth as a more normalised approach - where 1 table for each of these steps and then build a bridge table to map them all together is something that we have done for arbitrary depth and it worked really well.If we are to go with a flattened model then:* Should I include the surrogate keys for each level in the hierarchy (preferred) or model the relationship in a secondary table?* Business analysts are going to use this - is this their preferred approach - they will have fewer joins to do but will need to do more aggregation/deduplication if they are only interested in top level informationIf we go for a more normalised model:* Should we be offering a pre-joined view of the data - effectively making a 'one big table' available at the cost of performance?",10,0.79,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ltsbjn/star_schema_flatten_dimensional_hierarchy/,2025-07-07 12:01:22,2025-07-11 01:48:43

Most of my work is monitoring work with ocassional high level stuff, otherwise most of the time I get like L1 level tasks. Since we cater to multiple clients therefore I had the opportunity to get in touch with other databases like MySQL and Oracle. I also work in AWS cloud, mainly we work with RDS, S3 for backups and EC2 instances where DB instances are installed. We work in rotational shifts which is the least favorite part of the job me. I got DBA role as a chance to enter to corporate and specially the data field, but I really don't like the DBA role, because I have seen the kind of time this role demands from you. I have seen my manager even working weekends sometimes due to some client activity or doing some POC for potential client. Plus the rotational shift I just hate it, I have endured for 2 years but I don't think so I will be able to endure for another year or two. I have been working remotely for last 2 years Therefore I had plenty of time to upskill myself and learn technologies like SQL Server, AWS Cloud (Mainly Database related tasks), L1 administration of MySQL and Oracle. Apart from that I have also invested time in learning Python which I like a lot, I had also invested a lot time in learning SQL too. Earlier I was learning web dev along job thinking that I could transition from DBA to dev, but I realised that both are very different roles and whatever I have learnt here as a DBA won't do me that good in dev role. Therefor I have decided to further transition into DE role. I have made a plan of the things that I will have to learn for DE role and also a plan to double down on things I already know. Mostly I want to focus on Azure ecosystem for DE and for That I have decided to learn SQL, Azure Data Factory - ADF - ETL, Databricks, Python, Spark - PySpark, Azure Synapse Analytics. I am already familiar with SQL and Python as mentioned before, and just need to take care of the other things. I just want to know from you guys is this even possible? Or am I just stuck with DBA role forever? Is my plan even relevant and doable or not?

Also the project will have daily additional data, in terms of this should I use stored procedures or think of using ETL tools instead?Thank you!P.S. not quite a data engineering but been appointed to do this project ughEdit:What I meant about the “not quite a data engineering” is I am not a DE so I am seeking help!

Wanted to know if anybody has encountered this weird behaviour snowflake.Scenario 1 :- The Kafka Streamwe have a kafka stream running on a snowflake permanent table, which runs a put command to upload the csv files to table stage and then runs a copy command which unloads the data into the table. And then a RM command to remove the files from table stage.order of execution :- PUT to table\_1 stage >> copy to table\_1 >> RM to remove table\_1 stage file.All the above mentioned steps are handled by kafka of course :)And as expected this runs fine, no rows missed during the process. Scenario 2:- The batch loadSometimes we need to do i batch load onto the same table, just in case of the kafka stream failure.we have a custom application to select and send out the batch file for loading. But below is the over all process via our custom application.Put file to snowflake named stage >> copy command to unload the file to table\_1.Note :- in our scenario we want to load batch data into the same table where the kafka stream is running. This batch load process only works fine when the kafka stream is turned off on the table. All the rows from the files gets loaded fine.But here is the catch, once the kafka stream is turned on the table, if we try to load the batch file it doesnt just load at all.I have checked the query history and copy history.And found out another weird behaviour. It says the copy command has been run successfully and loaded around 1800 records into the table. But the file that we had uploaded had 57k. Even though it says it had loaded 1800 rows, those rows are nowhere to be found in the table. Has anyone encountered this issue? I know the stream and batch load process are not ideal.

1lwimpe,Seeking advice on Pipeline Optimization,Roody_kanwar,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I recently joined a new company and started this week. My first assigned task is optimizing an existing pipeline that the team has been using. However, the pipeline requires significant work.This team hasn’t had a dedicated data professional before, so they outsourced pipeline development to an offshore team. Upon reviewing the pipeline, I was shocked. There’s zero documentation, no helpful comments or method signatures, and even variable declarations are riddled with errors (e.g., indexes spelled as indekes). The function and class naming conventions are also poor. While I haven’t done extensive data engineering work before, I’m certain these are subpar coding practices. It seems the offshore team got away with this because no one technical was overseeing the work. The pipeline has broken frequently in the past, and instead of proper fixes, it’s been patched with band-aid solutions when what it really needs is a complete overhaul.# The Core Problem:The team wants a unified database where each customer has a unique primary key. However:* Data comes from 5-6 sources, none of which have primary keys for joining.* PII (and other details) for the same customer can differ across sources.* The goal is to deduplicate and unify all customer records under a single ID.I’m considering fuzzy matching, but with \~1M rows, pairwise comparisons are computationally expensive. The offshore team attempted a workaround:1. **Blocking:** Grouping potentially similar records (name variants, emails and phone numbers) to reduce comparison scope.2. **Similarity Scoring:** Running comparisons only within these blocks.I had some questions1. Is there a better approach? Have you worked on similar problems? Any recommended tools/strategies?2. Learning resources? I’m relatively new to data engineering and want to do this right. Any books, papers, or guides on large-scale deduplication?This is a critical project, and I’d appreciate any advice whether technical, procedural, or even just moral support! Thanks in advance, and feel free to ask follow-up questions.",4,0.71,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lwimpe/seeking_advice_on_pipeline_optimization/,2025-07-10 17:25:58,2025-07-11 01:48:43

They both used the DAGs stack (dbt/airflow/great expectations/snowflake). And had airflow manage their scheduled dbt runs. DBT operators (or Docker operators ) would run the command `dbt run` for whole projects.What happens usually is dbt runs sometimes fail due to some sql bug or data issue not detected by QA. And then people would be force to fix the models, deploy a new version of the models, and rerun the airflow tasks, which in return would force airflow to rerun the whole dbt projects, instead of the models that had failed. Is there any way anyone knows of avoiding this? I know wich cosmos you could split a dbt project into individual tasks per model, but im afraid that will create too many tasks on the airflow scheduler. Ideally there would be a way to clear an airflow task that runs a dbt operator, and that dbt operator would know from which failing model to continue.

1lvbyvh,"For new coders: If you want to organically learn a lot about Javascript and coding in general, consider playing Bitburner.",cheyyne,learnprogramming,"If you haven't heard of it, Bitburner is a free coding game in which you take on the role of a hacker writing Javascript to hack computers in a cyberpunk world, earn money, and eventually do lots of things that I can't go into here.The actual 'hacking' is very simplified, the game doesn't teach you cyber security - it's more about writing code that gets things done. In the beginning of the game, you are shown examples for how to write basic things, which you can then learn to improve upon.The game naturally evolves to become a bit more complex as you play, and you are rewarded for thinking about how to make things happen more efficiently, which results in a rewarding gameplay loop that fosters learning without holding your hand, so you have creative freedom.And that's sort of the thing of it; you can muddle through using code that's 'good enough' *if you want to.* But you will more likely be inspired to find that next way to level up your code, to make it more effective, to find the inefficiency and ruthlessly eliminate it.A large part of what makes the game useful is that you are writing real code in a real language using real javascript syntax, with scripts that are really running on your computer; there is very good documentation that you can read to figure out how to improve your code yourself, and how to understand the in-game systems; and the in-game help for how you might approach newly unlocked mechanics is quite good, though not universally so (looking at you, corporate ""Smart Supply"" script example!). And if you get stuck, there is a Discord full of very helpful people who can assist you with whatever you don't understand.Anyhow, though I've done a lot in other languages, before last year I hadn't learned almost any Javascript. Now I've got almost a thousand hours in Bitburner, I've learned how to think about a lot of elementary coding problems in new ways, I've learned a lot of Javascript, and I've even come face to face with a number of Javascript's hated quirks - all from just trying to *make more damn money than I did on my last run, given my current system's limitations.*So I heartily recommend giving it a shot. You can find Bitburner on Steam, or at [https://bitburner-official.github.io/](https://bitburner-official.github.io/). You can find the documentation for all the game's commands [here, at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md). (It says NS, which just means the object which, for all intents and purposes, contains the commands and functions that you can do in the game that aren't straight javascript declarations). Expect a certain amount of exploration - once you're knee deep, you'll be checking through documentation for a given mechanic and get valuable 'Aha!' moments.**NOTE: If you are playing to learn coding, I strongly recommend -avoiding- looking up other player's solutions.** It's okay to start off with an example, but you'll only grow as a programmer by figuring out novel ways to overcome the challenges you'll face. The solution you find for yourself, even if it's less efficient, is infinitely more valuable - and you will find more and more solutions as you get better at thinking like a coder. If you really do hit a hard wall, you might ask AI how a problem could be approached - you'll find GPT has a good corpus of Bitburner dialect in its training data - but do your best to solve your problems with whatever you find in the help files and in the game's documentation. And if you do give in, you could ask on the Bitburner discord, where players will be happy to hint at the right approach without out and out solving the puzzle for you.Anyway, I hope some novice coders find this valuable and discover how fun coding can be through this game. (I have no affiliation with the game or its devs. Just a big fan.) Have fun!

1lt6qlc,How do you actually code??,Godevil4716,learnprogramming,"I'm currently in my third year of engineering, and to be honest, I haven’t done much in the past two years besides watching countless roadmap videos and trying to understand what's trending in the tech market. Now that I’ve entered my third year, I’ve decided to aim for a Java Full Stack Developer role. I know it’s a heavy-duty role, but I want to keep it as my goal even if I don't fully achieve it, at least I’ll be moving in a clear direction.Here’s the issue I’ve been facing: whenever I watch a YouTube video of someone building an end-to-end project, I expect to learn something valuable. But then I see that the actual learning requires following a long playlist. Theoretically, the concepts make sense I understand the data flow and architecture. But when I get to the implementation, especially the backend, everything becomes overwhelming.There are all these annotations, unfamiliar syntax, and configurations that feel like they just magically work and I have no clue why or how. I end up copying the code just to make it work, but in the end, I realize I’ve understood very little. It feels more like rote copying than actual learning.Truthfully, I feel lost during this process. The complexity of the syntax and the lack of clarity around what’s happening behind the scenes demotivates me.So, here’s what I really want to understand: how do people actually “learn” a tech stack or anything new in tech?Do they just copy someone else's project (like I’m doing) and somehow that’s enough to add it to their resume? I’ve watched so many roadmaps that I know the general advice—pick a language, choose a framework, build projects—but when it comes to actual implementation, I feel like without that tutorial in front of me, I wouldn’t be able to write a single line of meaningful logic on my own.Is this really how someone LEARNS in a IT Tech Industry?Just by watching playlist and rote copying?",186,0.92,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lt6qlc/how_do_you_actually_code/,2025-07-06 17:23:55,2025-07-11 01:48:44

1ls1kp8,Friendly advice to beginners: Stop obsessing over languages and start viewing them as tools.,W_lFF,learnprogramming,"I was also guilty of this when I started 3 years ago. I wanted to learn everything, because everything seemed so cool. My main goal was Backend development but I ended up starting courses on Kotlin, Go, Rust, Java, Python and Lua. I didn't see these languages as tools but as personalities, and that's a big mistake I made aswell as a lot of other beginners. Very often I'd find myself asking questions like ""How many languages should I learn?"", ""Is Java, JavaScript and Python a good stack for backend development?"", but I'd still be learning JS arrays in codecademy with only 3 projects in my directory.The answer to all those questions, in my opinion is, it does not matter. Programming != coding, so it doesn't matter how many languages you learn, the thing you should be mainly focused is learning how to solve problems using the syntax. Learn to solve problems with what you have, THAT is the important piece in my opinion.Why I think it's important that many beginners grow out of this phase ASAP: 1. When you start to view languages as what they are, you start to appreciate more what you use. In my case, I don't find JavaScript to be the most charming language, but I love it's rich ecosystem and the fact that I can use it for pretty much anything I want to do. 2. You risk burning yourself out. This was me three years ago. I had 5 courses on different languages and it polluted my mind with information that I KNEW deep down was completely useless to me in the long run. You could argue that I was getting to see new paradigms and techniques to solving problems, but that wasn't even true. I never made it far enough into ANY course to learn anything that I hadn't seen in JavaScript. It was a waste of time and it lead to me burning out and losing interest, until recently that I finally got back into programming. 3. You stop thinking and you start doing. When I finally got back into coding recently with better learning habits I started learning and creating projects faster than ever before. Because I wasn't focused on ""Hmmm, maybe I should try out Scala!"", no I was focused on ""What other Data Structures should I learn to implement?"", ""How do I solve this bug?"", ""What should be my next project?"". When you start seeing languages as tools, you'll want to use those tools.In conclusion, this is not to say that you shouldn't be curious and you shouldn't ask questions and you shouldn't experiment and you should just stick to one thing and never explore. What I'm trying to say is that, a lot of the time, beginners are so excited to learn that they forget WHY they're learning. Which is to get a job, to be successful, to create something meaningful, to be good at a hobby, etc.. And I feel like if you don't focus on creating and learning and solving, and you're always thinking about what's the future and not the present, then you'll just risk burning yourself out. There are tons of roadmaps out there for whatever you want to build, stick with it or tweak it a little along the way. But don't start a course on Python today and then tomorrow it's SQL and then the next day is HTML and CSS, no. Stick to what you want to do, once you understand the core concepts and programming as a whole, everything else will follow and everything after that will be easier to learn.",134,0.96,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ls1kp8/friendly_advice_to_beginners_stop_obsessing_over/,2025-07-05 04:35:27,2025-07-11 01:48:44
1lvnifa,Why is there so much hate for functional programming,_lazyLambda,learnprogramming,"I started with OOP and enjoyed it, I can see how to get things done ofc But then over covid I learned of functional programming and thought ah what the heck I'll try this out. I personally love it and have legitimately found that it has changed my career trajectory for the better. So many advanced concepts felt clear only when I learned Haskell. Most notably concurrent programming. I also see so many posts by users in this community that they are struggling to grasp concepts or move past beginner. Not saying it will for sure work for everyone but like it definitely worked for me? Yet if I was to speak on that experience Id be called culty and just experience pure hate for FP with no explanation. I really have never experienced this cultiness people talk about. Wouldn't this hate signal that OOP is kinda culty? Like to me a cult is like a religion in that you're not supposed to question it but I've never met a Haskell dev like that, in fact they will probably happily and curiously chat about my question with me for hours. On the OOP side I've never really heard any convincing explanation as to why we do things a certain way, there's just the ""pythonic"" way to do stuff for example. But then if I point out an issue with their logic it always becomes ""how come you dont know OOP"" or some crazy question which is weird because OOP is quite simple and it often times has nothing to do with OOP theory. Before I get attacked inevitably with questions of the same category as that, I do have experience with OOP and my past project was acquired by Xerox to help plan their sales efforts. Ive also never heard any reason why Haskell is a bad choice besides it can be hard to learn, which I do agree with to an extent, but that's a very fixable problem as its often taught by researchers who are obsessed with the most advanced aspects of the language, and there are many great resources like learn you a Haskell that make it easy as all heck to learn.",107,0.8,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lvnifa/why_is_there_so_much_hate_for_functional/,2025-07-09 16:39:02,2025-07-11 01:48:44

1lwdgnp,Do not focus on languages that much,PureTruther,learnprogramming,"Edit: This is not a ""language is not important"" post. And also this is not a suitable post for copy-paste professionals. Some dummies need to study English rather than digital electronics.I just want to share my humble opinion from what I saw and experienced. This post may not be suitable for complete beginners. I assume that you already know DS&A and can build something at least in two different languages.I see so many questions, not only in this subreddit but generally on the web, like ""which language should I choose/is good to start/should I learn,"" etc. I think this is kind of missing the idea of ""software engineering"" or development.I bet most of us were stuck in ""language hell"" before. What should I learn? C? C++? Java? Fortran? Cobol? PL/I? Python? Rust? You can extend this list.Language is usually the easiest part of programming. Because in 2025, you can just open Google and type ""xyz language syntax/libraries,"" and then you get a kabillion resources about it.If language were that important, I bet most of the computer science classes would focus on low or mid-level languages like Assembly or C and similar languages.So you (we) should focus on technology rather than the syntax. You should focus on ""how can I store/manipulate/transmit this digital data more efficiently?""When you list your languages in your CV like this:* C & C++* Java* Python* Haskell* Verilog* so onyes, it shows something but not everything or big picture. It is still too abstract and does not answer ""Are you capable of using the [ARINC 429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) standard to transfer encrypted data?"" or ""Which boards did you work on?"" or ""Have you deployed a containerized microservice on Kubernetes with Helm charts?"" or ""Can you deploy a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins?""The other issue that occurs due to focusing on languages too much is that you do not know how you should create your portfolio. Since you focused on the language, you are hanging around basic implementations like a calculator, simple USB driver, or an asynchronous web page, etc.The more experienced programmers would notice that I am pointing out the ""specialization."" Let's be honest, in 2025, industries do not need too many juniors.So rather than obsessing about languages, explore the telecommunication standards, protocols, and preferred [software architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_architecture_styles_and_patterns) and technologies you’ll actually use in your target industry, then build projects around those.

1lrih6t,Getting back into programming after 15 years,thinkfast37,learnprogramming,"I was a Java programmer with a solid knowledge of SQL from 2000 till about 2010 before I moved into management roles. I also wrote two books on SQL back around Y2K. When I joined my current company I was actually hoping to get to be more hands on again, but the reality was my role didn't call for it... until now. Our new CTO wants dev managers to be more ""player coaches"". So I am actually pretty keen about learning my stack which is primarily node.js, react and postgres based and API standards are important.So my question is how best to efficiently learn the stack in 2025. I will need to learn syntax, and I will need to learn mechanisms that I have not worked with before, eg: promises - as asynchronous programming was not prevalent when I was a programmer. Back in the day, I learned very well reading good books - I remember a book about Java by Ivor Horton from WROX that I read back to front in a matter of days. But I wouldn't say all books were of that level. I even read all the IBM books on DB2 to learn the product and become strong on databases.Over the years I have dabbled with Udemy courses, but I find them far too inefficient to consume in video format in comparison to reading. I did learn some concepts in React and Typescript syntax, but I never completed the courses because frankly they wouldn't have benefited my role at the time and I haven't really coded for fun in some time.I also tried an ACM membership where I got access to some Safari books as well as well as Pluralsight courses which were better I found than Udemy - but lacked much one the node.js front (perhaps limited by the ACM offering). The Safari books were ok, but not necessarily that well written.I'm looking for what is likely to be the best path forward for me.

My issue is that I can’t seem to decide on one. I enjoy working with all of them, and whenever I spend a few hours coding in one language, I get the urge to switch to another cool language. Right now, I’ve got my eye on C++.I’m not sure where I want to go professionally, which makes it hard for me to choose a language, since I can’t even decide on a specific field.I find embedded systems and backend/cloud very exciting. ML also seems interesting, but probably involves too much math (I do like math, but I probably do not like it enough for that).Is there anyone here who has been in a similar situation? I’m not switching languages because I find them hard or don’t enjoy them. I love them all — and hate myself for it :(Every field and language I’ve explored is exciting to me. But now that I’m close to finishing my bachelor’s degree, I feel like I’m wasting time by constantly switching between them.I jump from one thing to another so often that I end up feeling paralyzed when it comes to making a decision — and in the end, I barely get around to actually coding anymore.",9,0.68,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lw9wf9/cant_choose_a_language_or_career_path_im_stuck/,2025-07-10 11:04:54,2025-07-11 01:48:44

Could you give me few pointers please?",IDontKnowWhyDoILive,learnprogramming,"Hello :)Bit of a context, I graduated from IT highschool and now I am first year undergraduate studying bioinformatics. I know a bit of C, C#, Java and Python. In school, I always excelled at tasks ""this is goal"", but when we had a ""do a project of your choice"", I struggled and done something super simple. I think I am decent at figuring how to reach a goal someone else gave me. But I realised I have no clue how to use what I write outside of the pressing ""run"" in the IDE. Best example: I wanna make a mp3 out of Pi zero. I already done python youtube downloader a while ago. But when I want to run it, I go into PyCharm, press run, paste the link into the terminal and it works. But now I want to make a bash sctipt that I will call with alias + the link and I want the bash script to use the python code and then send the sound file into the Pi. But... How do I use the python code passivly? Aka how do I input the link from outside? how do I run it? How do I know the sound is downloaded and is ready to be sent?I am not necesserily looking for answer for This One Example. Because it's far from the only time I have no clue how to apply my code. And I can probably solve it with some googling. But the example shows a massive hole in my knowlage. A hole I have no clue how to start patching, and I feel like school won't help me patch it either.

I’ve now been meaning to make a portfolio for myself and not sure if I should include it on there.The reason I ask this is because I am unsure if the mobile version of the platform is up to the standard clients and employers look for. I designed the platform desktop-first, and did not have any plans for proper mobile compatibility until I was almost finished the project.I would much appreciate it if you could go onto my application on either (or both) desktop and mobile and give me advice on if I should polish it up, or if it’s good enough for a portfolio. I’d much rather spend time making another application if this one requires a large amount of polishing and refining.I just deployed the application, the url is [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)Im just kidding, it’s hosted at [https://vellumi.me](https://vellumi.me)To be clear, I have no intention or interest in having any active users, this is not an advertisement.Thank you!tdlr; The desktop version of my application looks nice, but I’m unsure if the mobile version is acceptable to a client or an employer.

1lsmji6,Made an even/odd checker as my first 'project.' Can the code be improved or made more efficient?,AxelsOG,learnprogramming,"So I started up on learning Python again and have made more progress than previous attempts and I'm starting to enjoy it a bit more now. But I've started by using Grok simply as a baseline starting point because I've always had trouble ""just learning"" and if I have no structure it tends to be difficult. I understand its probably not great long term, but I'm just simply using it to guide, but I'm also relying on other documentation and other sources online beyond a baseline ""Try and do this, maybe try and implement this and go in this general direction""But anyway, the suggestion it gave me was a program that checks whether a number is odd or even. My first iteration was made because I didn't read what it was supposed to be and ended up making a program that had a list of preset numbers, picked a random number from that list and checked if it was even or odd.Since I realized that wasn't what I was 'supposed' to do, I actually realized what I should have done and made this.What it's intended to do is request a valid positive integer, and check if its even or odd. It ignores any negative integers, any numbers 'too larger' (which I added simply to continue learning new stuff), and anything that isn't a number.It also gives you 3 tries to input a valid integer before closing after too many tries. I also made it so the ""attempts remaining"" will either say ""attempts"" or ""attempt"" based on whether you have multiple attempts left, or only 1 attempt remaining.And this works exactly as intended on the user side. I may be overthinking this, but I was wondering if there was a way to optimize it or make it more 'efficient' when checking if the number is less than 0 or if the number is too large. Even though it works exactly as intended, I was wondering if this code was 'bad' even though it works. I don't want to develop any bad coding habits or make things longer/harder than they need to be. from time import sleep max_attempts = 3 #Total attempts allowed. attempts = 0 #Attempt starting value. number = None print('This program checks if a number is even or odd.') #Welcomes the user. while attempts < max_attempts:     try:         number = int(input('Enter a valid non-negative integer: '))         if number < 0:             attempts += 1             remaining = max_attempts-attempts ##Defines remaining as maximum attempts minus wrong attempts             if attempts < max_attempts:                 print(f""Invalid input!

A lot of my coding assignments are pre written with #include's, main(), return0; and are extremely guided. It feels more like I'm drawing on a tracing table or bowling with bumpers than actually learning to code.The labs will tell you you need x ,y, and z. Then you type x, y, and z. Then you run it. Wow it works. But I don't always really know why it works. Why? That's more important.What I started doing was writing the assignment down and figuring out for myself what I need to write the program. If things don't run I'll check my notes, search geeksforgeeks, stack overflow etc, DONT READ THE AI OVERVIEW! That code was even more confusing. Get in the habit of reading things. Im in a C++ class so cppreference is a good source too.You'll make mistakes. You need that. Thats how you become a better programmer. I finally understood the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value parameters in functions because I had to fix my bad code. Then I could really understand what the books where saying.Side note. Grow your simple programs into something complex. I wrote a small inventory program when we were learning about loops and then I forgot about it. I picked it up again and I moved the code into a function. Then the next version I separated the function into two. A reading function and printing function. The next version will use a class and objects. Your program gets an upgrade. And leave yourself notes on what you want to add or change to your program. Another thing that helps too. It's on my GitHub if anyone wants to see. Nothing amazing but I'm proud.You do all the thinking. Thats a real test.

I have a working backend and try to make a client for it to interact with it.Based on my understanding, you can use JS to manipulate the ""DOM"" (a tree) and create new HTML elements on the fly. My client creates new content based on user interaction and server responses. A real ""page"" does not exist, the content is just a ""div"" and gives the illusion of having pages by just making the previous div vanish and rendering the new one, so: document.body.replaceChild(container, body.firstChild)Where `container`, is just a div containing everything I want to show. The client initially loads with a login page (container), if the user clicks on the register button, it loads the register page (container) and so on.Note: Before I used `innerHTML` Instead but still unsure if you're supposed to use that or not, so I refactored my whole code to create the HTML from JS, without having HTML typed out as strings anywhere. Some argue that it is faster because no string parsing but I haven't measured it yet, so unsure about that one.I use the VSCode's LiveServer extension to run all of this. You can also uploud these files onto Netlify and deploy it.My question: Many tutorials use Express to do some initial setup and run the client with it. So what I did with LiveServer, they do with npm and Express. Is that the 'correct' approach for frontend development? I.e., you should always use npm and Express when trying to make a frontend using vanilla JavaScript?Currently I got into routing and realized that it is trickier without the Express setup.

Take your time. I can even pretend not to notice you obviously typing something while you “think”, maybe you are taking notes.But if I ask you about your experiences, or why you wrote what you did or said what you did, you *must* be able to answer that question. If I ask you why you used a loop there, you need to be able to explain your choice. If I ask you how you solved that bug you are bragging about, you have to be able to walk me through it.In short: I’m happy to pretend like you aren’t using an AI assist in your interviews if you can keep up the illusion.

Work at Google for a year, and you are suddenly an ex-google engineer for your entire career.No doubt working at FAANG is perceived as something that is prestigious, both technically and socially. It's life changing.But is that perception actually earned?Are FAANG engineers genuinely more skilled than the average developer? Do they consistently write better code, design more complex systems, think more rigorously? Or is it just a really effective combination of brand power, selective hiring, and market perception?I’m not denying that great engineers exist outside FAANG, but it seems like people expect the best to be there. Is that just a societal illusion, or is there some truth to it?Would love to hear from folks who’ve worked both in and out of FAANG.

1lutcsq,Anyone else notice that Jira has gone to shit ever since Atlassian started offshoring and heavily using AI?,Easy_Aioli9376,cscareerquestions,"Don't get me wrong, it's ***always*** been pretty bad. But it's gotten especially worse over the past 1-2 years, ever since they started heavily offshoring all of their development work + using AI. It's insane how fast this product degraded.Takes forever to load, extremely clunky, and basic tasks that should take seconds end up turning into frustrating multi-minute ordeals. The UI is bloated, performance is inconsistent, and the AI suggestions are more noise than help. It's like they’re trying to automate everything except the parts that actually matter to users.This is textbook technical debt. When CEOs start offshoring and using AI, it might seem like it's working at first. But software engineering is all about the long game. It takes proactive decisions in the present, to avoid extreme amounts of technical debt in the future. Decisions made today have vast repercussions on outcomes several months and years from now.This shortsightedness of CEOs is a joke. They are straight up ruining their products without even realizing it. In a few years there is going to be ***so much*** technical debt everywhere and we're the ones who are going to have to clean it up.Have you folks noticed this with any other software?",649,0.9,161,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lutcsq/anyone_else_notice_that_jira_has_gone_to_shit/,2025-07-08 16:37:18,2025-07-11 01:48:45

I don’t know if there’s non-coding roles I should try to pivot to.And I’ll be honest, I don’t vibe with the people I work with. A lot of them are socially awkward or really into anime and etc., and it makes it hard to connect. I feel like an outsider even though I’m in the same field. There’s no real teamwork or sense of belonging, just people working in silos and making small talk about stuff I can’t relate to.Lately, I’ve even been thinking about going back to school, but I have no idea what I’d study or what path would actually feel worth it.

What have people seen work now to leave this field?,Legitimate-mostlet,cscareerquestions,"Basically, I have been in this field for 6-7 years now. Mostly as a full stack developer. I am not new to this field and even with that I am just tired of this field.I felt it might get better, but I feel it has only gotten worse. Started in this field a little before COVID hit and heard that is when things started going downhill in this field (outside that window of massive hiring for 1.5 year) around then. My experience backs this.The expectations in this field are insane and none of my friends in other fields come close to putting up with this. The interview process is out of control and much of it has nothing to do with on the job stuff. So you have to learn on your own these things to do the interviews. The expectations while you have a job are insane. You are mostly led by non-technical people who fail to grasp how complex what they are asking you to do is and unrealistic deadlines because they are too scared to tell their managers no.Also, endless learning new stupid languages and stacks because someone in the world just has to create ""another language"" for their own ego, that ultimately does not make anything easier. Just makes it a new thing you have to learn.Nevermind the horrible job market in tech specifically. Endless layoffs, one of the highest unemployment rates of any white collar job field (we are higher than the average now), and clear attempts to send any new jobs overseas. So you can't even get a chance to compete for those jobs that go abroad.Ultimately I'm just over it. I'm done. I want out. I just don't see a future in this field anymore.What are some realistic paths I can take to get out of this field given my CS degree and experience? I'm ok with going back to school or pay for some training if it means there is a realistic path to getting employment. As long as it won't take more than 2 years. Ideally 1 year.

In fact, they start to just assume things about the poster and call them a doomer, when all they want to do is be heard. I do agree that some posts are outlandish, and the poster has a poorly written resume or something, but there are many of us who just want to be encouraged to keep going, or receive advice + reality checks of the current market that will actually help us calculate next steps.

I'm a front-end developer, ux-designer and startup founder who wants to become a product manager. I'm struggling to decide how I want to sell myself during interviews and on my CV. These are the points I'm struggling with:* I'm introverted, love to listen and ask a lot of questions. I have the feeling PMs are expected to be extroverted and spew out energy - especially during an interview. Should I fake it? * If I don't know something I say it. I feel like these days everybody is looking for the perfect candidate. “You don't know x or y? Next!” At least this is how it goes for dev roles. Should I pretend to know everything and wing it? (this question applies to resumes, too) * I am humble and quite frankly I should be because neither have I founded a million dollar company nor worked in big tech yet. To me it seems like during the interview phase you have to present yourself like you are the big shit and exaggerate everything you have done. Because this is exactly what everybody else does. At least for dev roles there are programming tests that show real skills. Should I exaggerate my past successes?* I don't like to throw around buzzwords. To me they hide too much meaning and If you truly understand something you can say it in a way everybody understands. But I have had experiences working with PMs who used buzzwords constantly and half the time what they said made no sense to us developers. But I get the feeling that they passed the interview and got the job at my company because they used them. How do recruiters tell if a PM “knows his stuff”? Should I use buzzwords to sound competent in an interview? * I have taken a bit of a detour in my life and focused on art/writing for 2 years. This is a gap between my first developer jobs and my last developer jobsTo me this seems like a no go to recruiters. (please tell me if I'm wrong). Companies would rather hire somebody with the perfect CV than a person who seems “real”. Should I cut that part out of my CV or own it? I hope this kind of question is acceptable in this sub.

1ltuo8e,Computer Science Education for Devs without college?,LibertyEqualsLife,cscareerquestions,"I'm nearly 40, and have shifted careers several times. In my last role, I found that I enjoyed building tools for my marketing team using no-code options and some basic SQL, so I took a bootcamp to learn to code and explore that interest further. I've been working as a dev for about 5 years now(primarily RubyOnRails and simple Python micro-services), and have found myself in a more ""senior"" role for a small company, mostly due to a combination of my broader industry experience and familiarity with our core systems. The problem is that I recognize that I don't really have the depth of knowledge that would typically qualify me for a Senior Developer/Engineer role in other companies. I know our tech stack, but when I find myself in conversations about new system design, or just more technical concepts in general, I'm quickly in over my head compared to colleagues that have CS degrees, where software conversations seem to evolve into higher-order maths concepts that I've simply got no familiarity with, or understanding of. I've made it this far in life without obtaining even an associates degree, and I really have no interest in starting from the beginning on the path to a comp sci degree, but I feel like I would really benefit from a ""computer science crash course"" geared towards devs that could build a foundational knowledge base for system design. Does something like that exist that you can point me towards?TLDR: I don't want to go to college, but I want to develop my understanding of computer science concepts as a developer to improve my system design capabilities.

1lt44j0,How to get out of being put into support role as a SWE?,fishteam,cscareerquestions,"I joined a fairly large company (non-tech, although they are trying to make it otherwise) as a SWE along with a few hundred other new grads as part of a cohort. We didn't interview for a specific team and were basically placed semi-randomly onto teams that asked for SWEs.I ended up on a team that is primarily a support team. The team is mostly non-SWEs and at no point has there been any SWE on the team that didn't have the position as their first job out of college. About 60-70% of the team's day to day work consists of data remediation and other manual fixes (e.g. directly modifying data in databases) for errors caused by bugs in the systems we support. These bugs have existed the entire 2 years I've been here, and apparently longer, from what I've heard. The remainder of the work might be other random tasks geared towards facilitating the first function (e.g. writing up documentation on how to do a certain kind of fix, setting up alerting based off of logs).The only ""dev"" work that I end up doing is writing basic CRUD applications used only by our team that are hosted on on-premise servers (our team has no cloud budget so I have no experience building applications in the cloud). There's no opportunity to work on any large-scale, high traffic systems. I essentially haven't worked on anything more complex than my college work.Other people that were part of my cohort were placed on teams where they are on actual engineering teams and the work is a lot more interesting, so this is primarily a team placement issue, not necessarily a company issue. However, I've become painfully aware that my skills have been stagnating hard and I need to get out of this role ASAP. The only thing is I've been a ""software engineer"" for 2 years, but having to talk about what I've been doing in my current role makes it glaringly obvious that I was a SWE in name only.

However, my offer letter and onboarding portal were all for a Vancouver, BC role, even though I’m in the U.S. and have never held a Canadian status.Naturally, I got super confused because the onboarding materials all referenced Canadian work authorization, SIN numbers, and pathways for Canadian citizens, international students, etc. I emailed Amazon’s onboarding team asking for clarification, explaining that I’m a U.S. citizen with no Canadian status and no idea how to start the work permit process.I received a reply today and was told that I should have received a U.S. offer, not a Canadian one. Furthermore, the Vancouver offer is to be canceled, and a new U.S. offer was promised by “end of day.”However, it is now evening, and I still haven’t received the new offer.My original onboarding timeline mentioned a deadline of July 7th to accept the offer and complete a survey (which I completed, though with answers which apply to the Canada offer).The Vancouver offer has definitely been revoked, attempting to access the employment documents states that I do not have an account. Tomorrow is July 4th, then the weekend, and then July 7th is Monday. I’m scared some automated system might cancel my candidacy entirely if there’s no active offer in the system by the deadline.I’m not sure if there is anything I should do in the meantime. I have already replied to the email regarding the promised U.S. offer and am hesitant to contact further, given that I have already emailed 2x today. I just don’t want to let this slip through the cracks.Should I follow up again tomorrow or wait until Monday?

1lru5il,Circuitous career path through academia to CS,simplysalamander,cscareerquestions,"Career started in academia doing data science/data analysis projects, that evolved into developing full-stack albeit locally-deployed mono-language applications (Python) during a PhD. These applications had users beyond just me, but all in the same academic environment and not like they were users paying for a SaaS app. After finishing the PhD, I've started working on ""real"" full-stack apps (i.e., JS front end, Python back end, database calls, etc.) for paying customers in a scientific niche, but doing so without much mentorship on developing ""professional"" software beyond what can be self-taught from the internet. Software is extensible and scalable, but I have no reference of whether this is how it's developed at a major tech company.Is it attractive to teams hiring for CS careers at bigger tech companies to see this kind of experience? On one hand, it's a lot more than junior work like building specific features and testing them - it involves interviewing stakeholders, learning their needs, and figuring out how to translate that into features and how to design the software to be able to grow sustainably without having a team of other developers to lean on. On the other hand, for all I know it could be riddled with bad habits and blind spots.Most job postings with PhD qualifications are mid- to advanced-stage roles, but having not ""grown up"" in a ""professional"" team environment, I'm not sure I have the relevant experience to be able to head a team in a conventional, expected way. At the same time, while I personally don't have hang-ups about starting lower on the totem pole, I'm not sure if my experience and degree path would make me appear over-qualified for a more entry position?

During my masters I started to go down the self-taught dev route. Now I have been working for 2 years as IT consultant and software developer in an enterprise environment (Java Spring Boot). Currently self-studying CS fundamentals through teachyourselfcs.com (working through CS:APP right now). I'm aware I have some gaps in my CS knowledge, which is why I started the self-study route. Now I'm considering going back to university for a CS Bachelor's degree (would do it part-time while keeping my full-time job. Studying evenings/weekends. Would be at a ""Hochschule"" that costs 19k€).The thing is, I could spend those 3.5 years on getting the CS Bachelor's degree OR continuing self-study, building projects, gaining more work experience and getting certifications.From a career perspective, my main question is: What looks better in the (European) job market:1. Having that CS degree on paper after already working in the field2. Having no CS degree, but a few certificates and a couple personal projects and focusing more on my career in the current company.I'm genuinely torn. Part of me wants the ""proper"" CS foundation and having something to show for it, but another part thinks that time could be better invested in practical experience and targeted learning. Also I would basically just do it for the ""academic proof"" for future employers, as I think that some of the stuff learned during the CS-degree is not practical and the important topics are also learnable by self-study, as I am currently doing.Anyone been in a similar situation?

I don’t hate it, but it’s not what I expected.Some things I’ve noticed:* Work is often just grunt work unless you have influence within the org, which I don’t enjoy.* Even profitable products face layoffs when growth slows. It feels insecure since no one nearby has any say in who’s affected.* Growth is slow. My manager isn’t bad but doesn't pass big projects or promoting quickly, especially with our now-larger team after layoffs.I also feel a lack of direction. I don’t know where I want to be in 5, 10, or 20 years. I still build small side projects, but they don’t feel meaningful anymore. I want to work on something bigger and more impactful while I am still young and have the energy to move fast.I’m thinking about an internal transfer or moving to another company for more challenging, rewarding work.Also, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with money being the goal.

1lwgzxd,Could this raise concern on my performance? I just got promoted earlier this year.,mysecret52,cscareerquestions,"At work, one of my (26) tasks is monthly patches. I move them to 2 networks after my coworker moves them to her network first typically. She'll get a drive from the security office and then I use that drive after she's done. In June, it took her a week because the file sizes of the patches were bigger and whatever internet connection she was using was quite slow. I took the drive from her the week after. I was a whole week late to finish up my part of the patches on the 2 networks I do it on. Not to mention, a few updates from these patches can be moved very easily without the drive and I usually move those first anyway and for some reason, I waited till I got the drive to do those too! I assumed the security office only had 1 drive but I JUST went and asked them and they have 3 apparently! I should have done this before.My boss wasn't very happy and there is a meeting with a few members on the team in 1-2 weeks to discuss patching. I feel like this will reflect really poorly on me. My boss also asked that I create an email chain so we all keep track of patching progress in July, so I've been working extra fast to get them all done this month!

1lttg8h,What are effective ways to transfer PhD and post industry research to industry?,emaxwell14141414,cscareerquestions,"When it comes to transferring from PhD and post PhD research in academic based institutions to industry based science, there's major discussion in terms of how everything from the pace of work to the lack of ability to ensure the best methods are being used and so on. So when it comes to adapting the skills obtained during a PhD and in me cases research assistantships past the PhD, and convincing others that you can transfer your skills, what works best?With some companies, particularly in this economic climate, they'll be looking for industry experience and that's it. It won't matter about published papers and successful projects. It won't matter if much of your research is in an applicable field such as data science. Side projects you've done independently may not even matter. It has to be experience in industry or it doesn't count. And often, it needs to be with the exact software tools, models and packages they use in addition.That said, I was wondering about what works when adapting your skills and also making the case to others about how you can do so. A primary option, I imagine, is being able to relate to them, for example how a paper and project you finished has implications that could assist them with their data handling, product development and so on. Or perhaps reaching out and explaining concisely how the skills you developed, even though they weren't directly in industry, could be applied to solve a problem they have.Are there methods and techniques similar to this that work?",6,0.99,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lttg8h/what_are_effective_ways_to_transfer_phd_and_post/,2025-07-07 12:55:47,2025-07-11 01:48:45
1ltbefz,What Exactly Is My Position As a US Citizen Who Has Spent My Entire Life in India and Now Pursuing CS As a Bachelor?,Infinite_Primary_918,cscareerquestions,"Hi guys, I'm (18M) a US citizen who has spent my entire life with family in India. We own no property or assets in America whatsoever, the only connection we have to the US is my citizenship. I've already been admitted to an American university and plan to attend there in pursuit of the CS major and perhaps a Business/Finance minor. My university does allow double majoring at no additional costs though. I realize that I'm a bit of an exceptional case here and more privileged in the sense that I don't have to deal with F1, H1B visa rat race at all. That said, on hearing the situation of the world, in particular the US, the job market seems extremely bad. My family lives on an Indian income and while the aid we got from my university was quite generous, we've still taken a federal loans from both the US and education loans from SBI, leasing one of the property homes that we have. This honestly puts a lot of pressure on me, like any other international student because India is all I've known and frankly I've never exceeded very well academically at all.I realize that my questions are a bit immature maybe, but I think I'd still like the opinions and discussions of people who are more knowledgeable about this than I am:* How hard do you think it'll be for people like me to find jobs/placements 4 years later when I graduate? * I've been hearing that the best way to succeed is to have connections, network and stuff. I've had very bad social skills my whole life, are there any tips or perhaps personal experiences that you think I might find helpful for someone starting from scratch?* If the job situation in the US is worse than it is in India, or well let's say I can't find a job in the US how likely it is that if I come back to family and start job hunting in India as an OCI Card Holder would give me difficulties? What should I expect? Is it recommended that I come back to India at all?* What are some contingency plans I should have? I'm not particularly passionate about anything, I chose CS because my entire family works there and so having their help would be nice, plus hearing them talk about their job and interest for it made me interested as well. If CS/IT is cooked, I'm thinking maybe Business or Finance is a better option? I've decided to pursue it as a minor. If I were to make a switch, how do you think I should make it happen so that even those career paths are open to me?Lots of questions here, but I'd really appreciate any and all help!

1ls65ow,Junior Developer Paradox: Finding Niche and Doing so in Wrong Time,TemporaryBaseball915,cscareerquestions,"Hello guys, I'm writing this because I recently (with full awareness) threw myself into what seems to be still waters, the junior developer job hunt. Now, this is not just another generic web dev (not my words, the vim/arch lovers' words) crying for help. No, no, and no! This is someone who found their ""niche"" but at the wrong time. Let me tell you what I mean.So, I recently graduated from a university in the U.S. During the time I was there, I fell in love with Machine Learning (and no, it's not because it's the trend). I found myself devoting my time to research, machine learning projects, doing competitions within the lab with other PhD or Masters students, etc. I was involved in the research for 2+ years for three different labs, I had the official title of ""Research Assistant"" as an undergrad for one of the labs where I was the sole engineer to develop end-to-end solution for running experiments on our university's super computer. I have published a paper in CVPR, and got the best paper award within the workshop that we've published.Now, my life had a solid plan, but due to everything changed in the states (I'm not gonna say why because I don't wanna take a one-way trip to Central America) I was forced to derail from that path. And now I am looking for a job. And man, doesn't it fucking suck. And this is where the paradox begins:**Paradox 1: ""X+ years of experience"" for recent graduate position**Let's start with the most common paradox. Now, the definition of ""experience"" differs from company to company, but what seems to be the common thing though, is that research doesn't count toward ""experience"". I know some of the undergrads who have somewhere around 1 year of experience due to things like internships or co-op (it's like internship in Canada but better), but for a lot of other students, this is going to be their first experience. Especially for someone like me who has experience but within the University, this sucks. What sucks even more, is that for a lot of international students, getting internship is very hard due to company having to justify as to why they're hiring an international student over a citizen with the same skill set. I was one of the victims of ""logistical rejection"" and that's kind of why I devoted more time within the University system because in it, it's an equal fight. Whoever has skills wins.**Paradox 2: Master's degree or PhD is required**This is especially true for machine learning engineer jobs, but the same thing can be applied to other jobs as well. Now, in my opinion, the difference between a bachelor's and master's is that if you're getting a bachelor's, what it says is you are someone who is capable of starting something small, and finish it. Maybe you have little bit of side project here and there, but nothing crazy. If you have a master's, what it says is that you can start and finish medium-sized projects, and you can also sometimes be a leader within the project as well. PhD is just matter of scaling up from master's. Now, this is what a degree ""generally"" says about you, because if you're an undergrad, companies don't expect you to develop a niche. But here's the thing, I did. I have a lot of experience in machine learning just like I said at the beginning, but company doesn't care about that because I am not a master's student. You have publications? Doesn't matter, you're an undergrad. You developed a deep learning model by yourself? Doesn't matter, you don't have a master's.Now, for those who just thought to yourself ""just get a master's bro"", here's paradox 3. **Paradox 3: I ain't got no money like that** This might be surprising for some of you but there are people who genuinely don't have money. And surprise, surprise, I don't have money. I want to work in industry to save money to go back to a master's program, but if I want to look for a job paradox 1 and paradox 2 appear, but if I want to get a master's, I need money first to even go there in the first place. And yes scholarship is a thing and definitely helps, but I need full-ride scholarship if I want to go, but those opportunities don't easily come around.**Paradox 4: Connection matters**Now, I'm not saying this statement is the paradox, but what I hear from people who are already in the system is a paradox. When I talk about these things to people who have already established themselves, they oftentimes say ""It's not about degree"" or ""If you can show that you have the skill, that's all we care about"". Now, as an engineer, they are right. It is not about degree, as long as you have the skills. But, at the same time they are not the one who is looking at my resume, it's the HR or sometime LLMs. Now I don't have the ""experience"" so I don't know how companies work, but should engineers hire another engineer? Or I guess they don't have the time so HR exists? I don't know.**Paradox 5: It's a tough time right now**For like 4 years it has been a tough time, bro. Damn.**Paradox 6: Just find a generic soft dev job**This is usually what I get from people when I talk about these paradoxes. ""You know, the hardest part is to get your foot in the system. I think you should apply for a software engineering job first and go from there."" So I said ""bet"" and applied to a bunch (I mean a bunch) of software engineering jobs. But they all say no because I am too specialized in machine learning. Welp, wtf.These are the paradoxes that I can think of right now. And I know that I used the term ""paradox"" very loosely here, but I hope you can see my point of view. And with all the seriousness, this is why I say I found the niche at the wrong time. Because I slowly began to realize that I was going nowhere with my ML skills, because the world is not obligated to take time to see what each person is capable of. I get it, people just generally don't have time.And here comes the million dollar question: What do I do now then? I am stuck between these paradoxes and the walls around me are getting tighter and tighter.

The role is fully remote (big plus), and I’d stay within the same company—but I haven’t yet negotiated for a raise.Pros:* Fully remote* Leverages my existing reputation and platform knowledge* Expands into client-facing/consulting experience* I will get out from under the 'bad VP' that Is causing the turnover in the current org.Cons:* No raise yet discussed.

I have thrown some apps out there but would like to know others thoughts before diving too far into this.

1lumwy7,Cracking an intervview in an Unfamiliar Stack – Any Pro Tips or Hacks?,invisible_here,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, I’m in a bit of an interesting spot and could use some advice from anyone who’s been through something similar. I’m currently working as a contractor in a .NET environment, but I recently applied for a high-paying, short-term (3-month) contract that’s in a totally different stack—Python with CDKTF. I used ChatGPT to fine-tune my CV to match the JD, and to my surprise, it worked, I cleared the screening round and now I’ve got a single 30-minute technical interview coming up that stands between me and the offer.Here’s the catch: while I have decent dev experience, I haven’t worked with CDKTF before, and Python isn’t my daily driver. Still, I’m hungry for this opportunity and ready to take my chances. My plan is to quickly get up to speed on Python syntax and idioms, spin up a basic CDKTF project to show I understand IaC principles, and lean on my core strengths—like system design, clean code practices, and devops fundamentals, when the conversation shifts.But I’m also wondering: has anyone here ever aced an interview in a tech they weren’t fully comfortable with? What tricks, strategies, or even psychological hacks helped you sound confident and capable, even if you were learning on the fly? Any quick wins or key topics I should focus on to leave a good impression in such a short time frame?",3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lumwy7/cracking_an_intervview_in_an_unfamiliar_stack_any/,2025-07-08 12:10:49,2025-07-11 01:48:45
1ltzgxc,How to navigate on-call support rotation ?,Appropriate-Head4188,cscareerquestions,"I’m a fresh grad with 6 months of experience as an SWE. This is my first job after the university. My team started to put me as secondary support around 4 months after joining this company and as primary last month. I have to do this rotation every 4-5 weeks, but the junior developers end up doing more frequent rotations like every 3 weeks or so since the senior developers often get pulled into more critical feature development tickets. On-call in our team is hectic, we get multiple support tickets during the day which needs to addressed by the EOD and at the same time, we get alerts through Pager Duty which needs to be looked into right away. All these needs to be done by the primary support alone, and the secondary support is essentially just for the namesake. We have to cover at night as well, so it is essentially a 24/7 rotation of non-stop production issues. We get an average of 10-15 pages every day, with 2-3 at least every night. At just 6 months of experience, I’m expected to resolve all these tickets by myself with minimal guidance from the team. Needless to say, every rotation puts me in a miserable state, ending up physically and emotionally exhausted, so much so that I dread the next one. Are such on-call rotations common in this industry? How to avoid these in the future?",3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ltzgxc/how_to_navigate_oncall_support_rotation/,2025-07-07 16:56:31,2025-07-11 01:48:45
1lsas4o,Offer at lower level than I applied for -- Negotiation options,itsbs2,cscareerquestions,"Hi There -I was recently given an offer for a role that I am very excited about but at a lower level than what I was applying for. The initial reasoning I was given is that ""This isn’t a reflection of any gap in your experience — the \[more senior\] openings we have right now are tied to some very niche and highly specific domain needs.""The salary for the role I was offered will come in lower than what I am currently making even if they put me at the top of the range -- I don't need a new job and am mostly happy where I am now, so would not consider a pay cut.I am curious if anyone has been in this situation before either as the Hiring Manager or the Employee. What are my negotiation options for trying to get a revised offer at the original level I was interviewing for?Thanks so much!",3,0.81,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lsas4o/offer_at_lower_level_than_i_applied_for/,2025-07-05 14:11:32,2025-07-11 01:48:45

1lrlnjq,Is it worth pursuing a Masters in AI / ML ?,Glittering_Turnip_45,cscareerquestions,"[This same question was asked on this same subreddit 5 years ago by someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ij71ih/is_it_really_worth_pursuing_a_masters_degree_in/), and at that time the general consensus seemed to be that the AI / ML field is ""saturated"". However 5 years is a long time and the landscape has changed a lot over the last few years.Looking for fresh perspectives in this regard :-* Is it worth pursuing a Masters in AI / ML ?* If yes, is it better to do it part-time (something like an online course which can be juggled with a 9 - 5 job) or go all-in and pursue it full time ?* Which college / university / course(s) should I enroll in, if I decide to pursue a Masters in AI / ML ? What criteria do I need to keep in mind when picking college / university / course(s) ?* After completing my Masters, I would like to return back to the industry as a Software Engineer or its equivalent role, don't see myself going into academic research or going for a PhD. Is it worth pursuing a Masters given that this is what I plan to do after my Masters ?* Do I need to have a Masters thesis topic in mind before going for my Masters ?* Given that several big tech companies have done mass layoffs to invest more into advancements of AI, **what skill sets should a Software Engineer possess today to future-proof their career ?**Any guidance is really appreciated:raising_hands:Some random thoughts I have nowadays (please correct me if I am wrong anywhere) :-* Sometimes I feel that the best way to keep up with the latest advancements in AI is by pursuing a full time Masters degree in a related domain * this will help me stay relevant in the industry and be ready for potential AI Engineer roles in the near future if that happens.* Given the advancements in LLMs, it seems likely that in the near future, LLMs may easily be able to handle mere coding tasks (something that a fresh graduate might be tasked with initially), and later on complete even more challenging tasks, so what role will software engineers play in the future ? Will they be completely replaced ?About me :-* \~ 6 years of experience as a Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science* I work with LLMs to help me out in my day-to-day work",3,0.62,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1lrlnjq/is_it_worth_pursuing_a_masters_in_ai_ml/,2025-07-04 15:33:12,2025-07-11 01:48:45
