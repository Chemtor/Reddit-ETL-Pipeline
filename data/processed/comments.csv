Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, 4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS.

Each tool ends up with slightly different calculations, and nobody knows which version is the correct one. A semantic layer gives you one source of truth.But don't you need to derive the data that's going to provide this unified view? Doesn't that involve precisely the calculations that drift apart over time? So what's the semantic layer doing other than adding yet another bunch of transformation?> The key is the semantic logic layer, abstracting the physical world from the modeling world.That sounds like horseshit to me. Both layers are abstractions, both layers are models, neither layer is physical - or rather, both layers are supported by physical hardware and eventually boil down to fluctuating voltages and so they're both physical in that sense, but neither is any more physical than the other.

For me, it's mainly used in big orgs where metrics *can't* drift without accountability and tracibility.Your point that ""five different implementations"" is a governance problem is 100% correct. The challenge is the enforcement of that governance.Without a Semantic Layer: Governance is a series of documents, meetings, and wiki pages. An analyst has to remember to `SUM(revenue) - SUM(refunds)` to get `net_revenue` and to filter out test user accounts. It's manual and prone to error.With a semantic layer (LookML in this case): You define these rules in code. You define `net_revenue` once. measure: net_revenue { type: sum sql: ${TABLE}.revenue - ${TABLE}.refunds ;; value_format_name: usd_0 description: ""Total revenue after refunds have been deducted."" } Now, the business user doesn't need to remember the formula. They just see a field in the UI called ""Net Revenue."" They can't calculate it incorrectly because the logic is baked in.

Latter helps to keep the planning team accountable to the plant (same, but they don't care if the product got sold to Amazon or Walmart). They use the same base dataset (forecasts from X months ago vs actual sales). If we tell each supply chain planner to write their own queries for those metrics, there is no way in god's green earth that they implement it correctly across the portfolio. They're ""complex"" to some extent due to custom aggregations, null handling etc. So semantic model helps me in environments where multiple users need the same metric calculated the same exact way, regardless of which slice of the dataset they might be responsible for.

n9200po,"Well, best case scenario this is a ""make lemonade out of lemons"" scenario, where you take a bad environment with very few factors in your favor (in terms of growing your skills or actually making some impactful changes), and see what you can make of it. On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).If you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and ""probably"" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary... You're trying to foment a rebellion here, but for your vision to win, you have to actually demonstrate something meaningfully different and revolutionary that COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED in their legacy stack -- if all you do is say, ""look guys I put our code into git, see this is better now"", then no one will give a shit because that by itself doesn't matter, doesn't change the business. But I don't think you are going to be able to pull it off. So jumping ship seems like it would be better for you, but to be totally honest and blunt, your post gives me a weird vibe of someone trying to ""shortcut"" the career ladder by looking to be opportunistic about what's-best-for-your-brand, instead of someone who's actually sincere about putting in the work, engaging with stakeholders, learning how to dig out of a hole, etc. If you really want to be a director, you're supposed to learn how to overcome adversity, and not just look for the smoothest easiest path to inflate your title as high as you can with as little work or struggle as you can.",strugglingcomic,2025-08-16 19:07:36,26,dataengineering,t3_1ms2j53,False,

Basically make it dead simple to turn a SQL query into an API, and then integration really becomes a question of how you handle your API routes in your backend code and doesn't really require you to ""think"" about the database.I'm genuinely curious to know how people would compare Moose vs. Tinybird - do people like the ORM approach?

Those data products are meant to keep your core available for all purposes and not any specific one. That being said, you could query to the core layer directly, but it may not perform as well as the semantic layer. The core is more about the relationships of the data at an overall business layer.

The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.In terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.Good luck!(Edit: Formatting)",Tokyohenjin,2025-08-20 10:36:49,3,dataengineering,t3_1mv97xj,False,

In order to do that you just query anything greater than the last timestamp you queried from that table/system and pull everything new in bulk. It’s extremely simple to implement and does exactly what our goal is pull all new transactions.If you were to do it by transactional ID you’d have to check every ID for all of time in your source against the list of IDs in your target . Imagine if the source and the target are in 2 separate systems that would suck to implement.

Same thing with your salary, or an AWS bill, they need to go to a cost center.Finance people/executives understand that you literally can’t run a company without cost centers. Even if you were a one person remote consulting firm you’d have your salary cost.

Profit = income - cost. You can break costs down to things like operating expenses and taxes if you feel fancy. If the business unit you work in brings in more money than it costs, you are a profit centre. There are no second order effects. When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. If your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it’s deemed essential. You’re absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. To reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it’s an unavoidable necessity. The trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics.

Then they are what’s being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he’s not the product. It’s not that he doesn’t matter, but on the books, he doesn’t get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. Transactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent. So when doing financial analysis we can say that one product, while worth the same end sale price, might cost differently when produced in different factories.",waitwuh,2025-08-15 17:32:16,1,dataengineering,t1_n8tizkw,False,

The entire purpose behind RDBMS like Postgres is that it gives you these commands to operate on data locally with all the tooling to make it as efficient as possible because it understands the source and destination table structures.Merge statements would be very generic. You could make a pretty simple jinja template to use as a code generator, just putting the target table name and column names as params. Make that output a procedure definition, and as long as you stick to the pattern that's all you have to write manually. You should be able to automatically scrape all the parameters you need using information_schema -- the whole thing could be a single python script to automatically generate everything.You have your spark insert to a staging table (truncate first if you don't include a partition column), then run the procedure.If they don't want to deal with all of these objects too much, they can have a separate schema to put them in.Ultimately making spark do the work if figuring out what is an insert, update, or delete, is going to be very wasteful in shuffling data back-and-forth, and you're running two sets of compute when it could be one.",azirale,2025-08-20 05:32:32,1,dataengineering,t3_1mult5j,False,

n9dgdf3,"I am biased (been working with ClickHouse at Tinybird for 3+ years now), though I can share some thoughts on the operational side.To me it boils down to community and support. ClickHouse community is strong and growing. The number of contributors and commits to ClickHouse has grown so much over the last 5-10 years. Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors) Pinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors) If your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.Personally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.I don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.Since you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.What kind of log volumes are you looking at? And do you need real-time ingestion or is near real-time ok?Btw, maybe you'll find this template interesting or useful as a starting point -> [https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template](https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template) (if you're worried about operational overhead, maybe Tinybird could be a landing place for you... lmk if you have questions about it.",itty-bitty-birdy-tb,2025-08-18 16:30:07,3,dataengineering,t3_1mrlw9e,False,

n9wjhvw,"""Azure Synapse SQL Dedicated and Serverless"", what? You've just used words from different technologies and slapped them together. Fabric offer pretty much nothing that Synapse doesn't - the ""one Lake"" approach is a new feature that dilutes the whole concept of ""single source of truth"". And Fabric doesn't support data flows.Synapse is a solution for enterprise needs, it can be optimised as you'd expect for that level of usage.Fabric is aimed at ""citizen"" developers, e.g. people who operate as individuals and pull reports together from different sources. The one thing fabric genuinely does better than Synapse is allows you to connect to data sources easily. It's not difficult in Synapse, it's just not very intuitive.The easiest way to envision is it: Data Factory does a bunch of legacy operations and support basically everything that on prem does, with no need to rewrite it all. it also offers newer ways of doing things but that's not what makes it useful IMO.Synapse offers true ""PAYG"" data processing which takes the load off your internal systems, and generally will be cheaper than Data Factory but needs a significant rewrite on new technologies (Such as Spark, Python) and a whole new approach to how things are processed. The upside is the power of the servers you can provision is massive, and you only pay for what you use - instead of paying for them 24/7.Fabric offers most of what Synapse does but has a very different interface to Synapse. It also leverages One Lake. The main difference is pricing. In Synapse you need to pay for each resource individually, but in Fabric you pay for ""capacity"" which can range from storage to processing - but it all comes under one payment.The reality is that Synapse is a great product that can operate alongside DF, and both of them utilise each other for specific functions, but Synapse is a whole new world. Fabric is aimed to try and give non technical people ""democratised"" data processing - which is a great idea but functionally is very close to giving someone 15 excel files and hoping they know what they're doing when they copy paste from them all that the data is correct at the end.All of these technologies need a data platform and approach - trying to sell Fabric as ""better"" is just wild. I know MS are pushing it, but having worked with all 3 technologies AND on prem, i can safely say there are more headaches in fabric than the others because it's solving a problem that data engineers didn't need solved.",B1zmark,2025-08-21 14:55:50,0,dataengineering,t1_n9uj8av,False,

Yes, you need a data platform in both. But there are genuinely significant improvements in Fabric that aren't in Synapse.Yes, Synapse is a very capable platform. But it's also a challenging platform to use well. Synapse SQL Dedicated Pools make you choose between best performance (storing in its proprietary internal tables) and open formats (external tables). Scaling is offline, and disruptive. And they require a lot of tuning to get good performance out of them. Synapse Serverless SQL pools are better on that front, but have a lot of limitations of their own.I genuinely believe Fabric Warehouse is better than them. It gets rid of that division, and has many, many improvements elsewhere, from provisioning (scaling is online like Synapse Serverless SQL Pools, but faster and more intelligent), query optimization (overhauled and distinct from either Synapse SQL Pool offerings), query execution (improved beyond both previous products), and so on. I have worked on all 3 products, seen the customer experiences on all 3, and that's my honest opinion.Similarly, if you look at Fabric Spark, it has NEE, based on Gluten and Velox, to improve performance and lower costs:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/native-execution-engine-overview?tabs=sparksqlNote that Fabric Spark has a pay as you go billing option:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/autoscale-billing-for-spark-overviewThere have been discussions about expanding that to other workloads where it makes sense, but that's a question for PMs rather than me.Feature development is focused on Fabric these days, so the engines in Fabric will continue to improve further with time. And as I said above, I genuinely believe they're already significantly better than what we have in Synapse. And unfortunately, many of those improvements are not really feasible to bring to Synapse - we had to do very significant rearchitecting to deliver them, and that rearchitecting means it's not really feasible to put the improvements into the older products, they just weren't designed for it. Anyway, you don't have to agree with me, that's fine. This is my personal opinion; that's your personal opinion.

It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.People are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.People using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.We might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.At present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.Lastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",Fridux,2025-08-17 08:39:19,7,learnprogramming,t3_1msa43x,False,

Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.For the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future. Now that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.But again, ""learning to code"" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people. If you include internet servers in the mix, the number shoots up to thousands.) The world is still getting more automated every day, and digital illiteracy will eventually became as limiting as normal illiteracy is today.",Unreal_Estate,2025-08-17 08:22:01,5,learnprogramming,t3_1msa43x,False,

It KNEW what I wanted to write correctly half of the time and this is the worst AI will ever be.If my job could be outsourced to before (and it could), there are now a lot more lower skilled people capable of producing the same code I am writing which makes it even less valuable to employ me.

You just need to dive into SOMETHING, write code ,make mistakes, and LEARN from them.Also, one thing to learn is one's own personal preferences. There are lots of actually different programming languages in use, but beginners won't even know what the words we use to describe those differences mean, and even when they learn the definitions they won't know what it feels like in practice.We also don't always get to use our favourite languages.

n968mcj,"I teach other academics to program in Python for research, and that ranges from doctoral students to senior academics. I routinely get a laugh out of the “I’m `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?” questions. Just go for it!On AI, I’ve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what’s new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they’re often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It’s nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. Programming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I’ve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.One of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That’s why diving in is the right approach. You’ll answer your “should I” question quickly, and you may love it.

n9qpkf7,"Well, my situation was a very different time initially: the 1990's. But since you asked... Ya, what surprised me was just how desperate a company was back then, and well into the early 2010's for anyone with programming/admin/networking/tech-support capabilities. Essentially, if you showed any prowess in those 4 areas what-so-ever (and especially if you had cursory basic knowledge of all 4 of them) then wow! Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). ------------------------------The need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! Like ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! I kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)------------------------------Anyways... So, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. Ya, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! But the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) ------------------------------Finally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... But if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). And then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. So believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called ""Autohotkey"" to do scripting and automation! Like who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! ------------------------------But ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. Just as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. And because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. ------------------------------Fast forward to today, and ya... Times have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. I worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery...

n9qptu6,"I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts. Active Github profile (daily commits) - not important. ""Daily commits"" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit. Well-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called ""swagger"" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman. ""Well structured"" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity. Projects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some ""real"" dev experience before getting your first job.Here are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template: * What do you do in your current position (if any)? * What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?* How familiar are you with ? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?* Walk me through your side project (if any).

Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.1. Next, implement the base case.1. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.1. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.The main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion. Otherwise, if you find yourself asking, ""Why couldn't I just do this with a loop"" then you're right: it's a poor candidate for recursion and you should just use the simpler loop solution.",AlSweigart,2025-08-19 20:47:46,4,learnprogramming,t3_1mulhd1,False,

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.Now consider doing it with recursion. You imagine the functional interface you want – let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar. Consider your base case – is the File a simple file, not a directory? Great, you're done. Produce your output. Otherwise you need to recurse – okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files. Boom, done. The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.The key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?* Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",SubstantialListen921,2025-08-19 15:45:56,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mulhd1,False,

The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.When not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!Also, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!When you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit?

I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.For me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right ""piece"" is, and is more about a general understanding and ""feel"" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial ""I'll never need to do this again"" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at ""I just did more than I needed to"" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).I'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say ""I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use"" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.It never hurts to join a coding community, either.

Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.When you move to a language you don’t know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you’re gonna have a bad time. But if you google “rust post request endpoint” you’ll get example code for the Actix Web framework.Knowing the concepts are way more important than learning the syntax.",EarhackerWasBanned,2025-08-18 10:01:51,4,learnprogramming,t3_1mtfel4,False,

There is no tutorial, there is no shortcut.Tutorials/courses can teach you the basic skills; they can lay the *foundation*.

Then venture into more complex territory, e.g. something like *Battleships*. Then, move on to more complex tasks, e.g. *Sokoban (Box Pusher)* - these are all fairly simple to make games that will each teach you a lot. To get something more dynamic, the classic *Pong* or *Breakout (Arkanoid clone)* are good starts, but only after you have progressed enough. Make a *Pacman* clone. Using old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.When you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.With each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you. At utmost, use the tutorials as inspiration and try to make things on your own. Then, if you fail and can't find a solution, look at the tutorial to see how they did it. Don't just copy the tutorial. First, try on your own. Experimenting, trying, failing, fixing are all part of learning, copying is not learning.Also, games are developed *incrementally*. They start with simple mechanics, e.g. how to interact with the player, how to set up the levels, etc. Then, they work with the collisions, and so on. Commonly, the *game art* is quite far towards the end of the development.

In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.The BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.In case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.A good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",aqua_regis,2025-08-21 12:50:41,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mw9lc2,False,

Any Turing complete language, which is effectively all of them, can manipulate state, which is what programs do. Any general purpose language, which is most of them, can do most tasks.However, where those languages can be used is a function of implementation. OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? How about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)? How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature. It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language. Choose one, block the other. A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time. Write your tests accordingly.Along the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). This is the break point between imperative and declarative. The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind. It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't. There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature. There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.Garbage collection? How resources are released is a big deal in all languages. In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer. In others, the programmer barely has a say.Virtual machines? Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox. This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.Last, but not exhaustively, libraries. The standard libraries available to a language might dictate its use. If what you want to do only has a library in C, you're either porting it to your favorite language, creating an interop wrapper for it, or writing in C.",WystanH,2025-08-19 10:56:13,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mucv2f,False,
n9hznih,"Personally, I think they're wrong. If there were an objectively best way to write a web application, why would there be so many front ends and backends, especially backend languages? Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.Think about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.It's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).To get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.Or languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.Prolog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.And was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.Functional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.It helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-19 09:21:44,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mucv2f,False,

For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:```class Card: def __init__(self, cardString): self.name = self._getName(cardString[0]) self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0]) self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1]) def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter] elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 'Ace' else: return cardFirstCharacter def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return 10 elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 11 else: return int(cardFirstCharacter) def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter): suits = [""Hearts"", ""Diamonds"", ""Clubs"", ""Spades""] return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)```Then `hit()` becomes easy:```def hit(): drawnCard = drawCard() v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard) card = Card(drawnCard) return card.name, card.value```**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts.

Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it.

Even though it does not require you to sign anything today, it can do that in the future, especially since it is Corporate Controlled by Mozilla. Python is currently owned and controlled by its creator while PERL and LISP/Scheme are being controlled by loosely organized volunteers. This means unlike GNU languages, they can all betray the users one day should someone with a lot of cash buy off the maintainers.

I'll answer them separately:>is it necessary to read ~~all of~~ the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?I'd lean on the side of yes. Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.That being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?No. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation. My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the ""reference manuals"" first, but even that is difficult.I feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.E.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.I find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work.

n9oup1b,"So first a question... If you want to change the rims and tires of your car, do you need to know about the piston compression first? Nope.While you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.Ive been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.What i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. Heres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. I want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? Assuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? This breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. I have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec. Like i said, im still learning, but im keen to hear your opinions and any more seasoned professionals on how they approach docs.

n9p77uj,"> However, I am learning Python for specific reasons: Text processing, XML handling, etc. >> […] is it necessary to read all of the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?This sounds like something of an [X-Y problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.Python as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).In programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.Generally what you want is:1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. ""Good enough"" is poorly defined, and varies by language: * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road. * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code? * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use. * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0. * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs. * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything. Your brain can only fit so much information. * Language servers / IDEs can help a lot with discoverability.",syklemil,2025-08-20 12:19:47,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mvau8z,False,

n8wcphv,"There's no one answer here, but if I have to condense it to a single sentence, it would be this: It should be mapped in the layer where it is the most convenient.A DTO isn't inherently an API thing. It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.However, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).The issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.My point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. My general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying.

n8wrimc,"I think I have to make it more clear what I meant.It makes sense, since the database resides in a database layer. To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.Then we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.Somehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. I read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:If we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view. For example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.But sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.Do you know what I mean?",NearbyOriginals,2025-08-15 22:04:20,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wcaxr,True,

n8wwyoy,"Yes, that is what I told you.Entity (DAOs) are used to map your entire entity to a database table. You do not want to return this from a service. You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary). While controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.In spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:example() { var stuff = repo.getStuff(); ...business logic... return stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;)This is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.When you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.All these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",disposepriority,2025-08-15 22:35:18,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wrimc,False,

Hibernate isn't returning anything, you are defining an Entity class, denoted by an annotation, to either generate your database schema or match it.The reason the entity class is not usable outside the repository class and some select service methods is that you do not want to couple your schema and anything your API returns.Example: You're in the process of migrating your hashing algorithm, this requires users to reset their passwords, you have millions of users - this will take a lot of time. You add a hash\_version field to your user class, so you know which hashing algorithm to use to verify their passwords. This new column in your database has no business being in absolutely any of your controllers, but obviously you want to retrieve the value when getting a user since the service needs to know what to do). This applies to any entity derivatives like projections or manual mappings with native query.Service calls one or more repositories requesting data from the database that it needs, this can be returned as an entity class, projection, manually created class mapped by a jdbc handler, it doesn't matter - this is the class that will store the data you request from the database. This class will change if you ever change your database query.

Learn something like data structures, loops, and functions, then immediately put them into practice through small, fun projects. For example, if you learn about lists and loops, build a simple quiz game or a to do list app. This way, you’ll reinforce your learning and keep it engaging.

At my first internship I was having lunch with a friend and he mentioned that I wasn't looking him in the eye when I talked to him. I had honestly never noticed that was something I was not doing. From then on, I made it a point to make the right amount of eye contact with people and get comfortable with that. I tell this story to help give you an idea of just how awkward I was at talking to people.2. In University, I enrolled in a public speaking course to force me out of my comfort zone. Honestly it was one of the most valuable courses I took in my entire Pure Math & Computer Science degree, because after that I felt comfortable giving presentations.3. As a junior dev you can mostly get by with quietly coding what you are told to code. However, even then you will have to collaborate with others. I got really good at listening. Learning a few languages can also help with accents and other language barriers that you may encounter.4. As you work your way up from junior to senior dev you will have to start taking on more of a leadership role: Giving presentations, holding team meetings, meeting 1:1 with people, discussing designs, etc.5. If you work your way up to dev manager, then soft skills start taking over almost completely from technical skills. You will have to navigate emotional conversations with your reports, mediate conflicts, liase with other team leads. At one point when I was leading a team of 12 people, all with different backgrounds and from different parts of the world, I got feedback from one of my reports that she was impressed that I could even understand what everyone was saying during our team standups since a lot of people had strong accents. This is where point 3 really helped.6. It's still not easy. Recently my manager wanted me to travel to headquarters because he felt my team was not ""visible"" enough. That meant my mission was to go there and have face to face meetings with as many people as possible. To be honest, I was dreading this trip. However, sometimes you just have to jump into the deep end instead of trying to tiptoe in. I set up the meetings, I got on the flight, and I spent a week talking to people about work stuff. The feedback I got was that the trip was a huge success. We didn't change anything about the way we worked technically with other teams - the only difference was that upper management had a fresh memory of a real person they had talked to about what we were doing.

On the other hand, working in a team mandates a decent level of proficiency in communication and a personality that is welcome (or tolerable at minimum) in a group of people.I can't say I understand what your describing that well though. Totally guessing, I'd say you're either a bit too harsh on yourself and perhaps have above average expectations of your own social performance, or maybe you do have some tendencies to be less than perfectly social, like being on the spectrum - which would not super unusual either. If there's actually something to it, it's good that you're aware of it either way, that's the first step to getting to the bottom of it. If you can describe a situation you have in mind in more detail, perhaps it'd be easier to say anything more meaningful here.Also, to add one thing regarding communication - it's probably less on you than you might think. It's the team's professional interest to maintain a meeting environment that's open and inviting of any respectful and constructive contribution. However, I've seen environments where the meeting quickly devolves into a heated debate of a few people, and it's a match of grasping at a chance to say anything for everyone else.

Steve wrote the entire program in 6502 Assembly - on paper - then hand-translated everything in the numeric machine code that then could be loaded on the Apple computers. You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.When I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.Assembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",aqua_regis,2025-08-21 09:36:55,5,learnprogramming,t3_1mw5n7i,False,

In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.it’s generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.Simple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.Here’s a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.Edit: Reddit messing up formatting here.def increment(x): return x + 1count = 0count = increment(count) # updates originalnew_count = increment(count) # keeps originalCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.As you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who’s allowed to change it, and how long it will exist.

n903b3d,"It's not clear, to me, what algorithm you are using. There's one (or more inefficiency) which is the malloc/free which is considered a bit slow. There's a question of what your objective is, that is, do you want to have an array of the factors as a result or just print it out. Printing it out would be much easier, but then it's hard to use the factors afterwards.But the optimization is something rather simple and follows a trick that you use to determine if a number is prime.Instead of going from 1 to n, you go from 1 to ceil(sqrt(n)). Here's why you can stop at the square root of n. Suppose you find a factor that's smaller than the square root of n. Let's call it x. Because it's a factor, there's also another factor y such that `x * y = n`.Now `y` has to be bigger than (or equal to) the square root of n. If it weren't, then you have two numbers smaller than the square root of n which, when multiplied, will be smaller than n.You might wonder, could we miss some factors greater than the square root of n by stopping so soon? The answer is no. Why? For a similar reason. Suppose there is a factor, `y` that's bigger than the square root of n. Then, it must have a corresponding factor, `x`, which is less than the square root. If it didn't, then both `x` and `y` would both be greater than the square root of n, and their product would be greater than n (which would mean they aren't factors).So, you could modify it something like float root= sqrt((float) n); // or however you get the square root // Crude way to get the ceiling of the root int limit = (int) (root + 1); for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) { if (n % i == 0) { // Check if it's a factor // It is printf(""%d is a factor\n"", i); int other = n / i; // Get other factor if (other != i) { // Don't double print if we hit the square root printf(""%d is a also a factor\n"", i); } }If you wanted to save the array allocation cost and do it once, you could run this loop twice. The first time, you'd check for how many factors there were (create a counter before the loop and increment each time you print). Then, you'd malloc the array, then fill in the array again.Hard to say which is more efficient, but the square root trick is pretty useful because square root of n is MUCH smaller than n, so that's the number 1 idea you can use.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-16 13:01:35,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mrslsx,False,

n90u5vw,"Squeezing this kind of optimization (to me) seems silly. You're calling the square root function *once*. On the other hand, you're computing `i * i` each time through the loop. When both are good enough (C programmers from the 1980s and 1990s obsessed over writing the fastest code, but these days, if the code runs fast enough, then clarity of code matters more than efficiency), you opt for the one that is clearer to the reader which could be you or be someone else.This is why some people use Python (with Django or Flask) on the backend or even Node. A Rust backend would be faster, at the expense of being harder to read. Speed isn't everything, and even when it is, guessing what is fast or slow is not an effective way to improve the speed: you need a way to measure your program's execution (this is called instrumenting it). There are tools called *profilers* that can do this, but it's not super easy to set up and differs from language to language.For example, you can call a very expensive function that takes, say, a second once, but if you have a loop that goes a million times, and you can shave a millisecond off each iteration, that matters more.In this case, the square root trick really reduces the number of iterations and has the biggest impact, far more than deciding whether to use square root or i * i. I think it's fine to stick with i * i, because it's pretty close to saying square root. This is where it's useful to have a comment like // Not using square root because i * i is more efficientcan help. Often, when you're trying to speed things up, comments help indicate you're writing less obvious code to help speed it up.However, many beginners obsess over speed without truly knowing how to speed it up (basically, they try a bunch of things). Algorithmic improvements are usually the ones to aim for rather than smaller things like how fast square root runs. Having said that, many years ago I wrote a program using sine and cosine, and because I computed it over and over, it was slow (I had no idea).The solution was to create an array with the results pre-computed. I only had a limited number of values I was running these trig functions on (say, 60), so placing the pre-computed values in the array and looking those values up was far more efficient.So, it *can* matter. But usually you want to spot big loops which is where things tend to slow down.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-16 15:32:16,2,learnprogramming,t1_n90lrgr,False,

Once I've done that I'll see if there are recommended solutions, or just google similar things. I think I first learnt of python list comprehension by looking at how other people solved issues, being completely baffled by this \[f(x) for x in something\] I kept seeing, and then just playing around to see how it worked. The whole process made some exercises take a lot longer than they could have done, but as I learnt not only how I could do things better, but also how other people do, I found things easier and quicker. Sometimes I'd go and look at my 'good' solutions and see how bad they really are. And on occasion I realised the brute force approach may have actually been better as it was so much easier to understand and re-use. I think, personally, brute force isn't so bad on small scripts with small data sets that I only use for simple things. As long as I'm not loading files when I don't need to, then even looping over data sets more than I need isn't always bad. As soon as I have a nested loop I pay far more attention, likewise when I suddenly have a far larger data set than expected. (Case in point, I have a script I'm using right now where I'm sorting through a text file for some specific identifiers and false positives. My first run through the input was a couple of hundred lines. I didn't pay much attention to how I was scanning through the text. Yesterday I started looking at a file with \~1M lines.

But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.Often also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)I still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.---I'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.But if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): …`I don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",syklemil,2025-08-15 10:46:47,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqr4ud,False,

This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. * admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand.

The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:# :brain: Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, “essay-like” format. People don’t usually talk like that on Reddit — especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details — which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You’ll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts — things like “After X years in the industry, I realized Y” or “Am I the only one who feels Z?” It starts to feel formulaic.4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.# :robot: Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.* Unnatural use of :pile_of_poo: emojis.* Overuse of the em dash (—).# :puzzle_piece: You're Not ""Schizo"" — You're PerceptiveIt’s unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust — not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit’s value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that’s being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.If you're feeling disoriented by all this, it’s not paranoia — it’s pattern recognition.

Show you're good, and then use that to buy yourself the entry to the projects that will make you look good.

Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)Outside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)My facebook, which back then was young cool social media, could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.This is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)Now for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the ""ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$"". People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.Futhermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get. Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.I think one thing to realize when talking about job markets is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012 are all 33 to 40. This means you have an entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus. That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)Like this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021 over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.There is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",Snoo-18544,2025-08-15 02:53:40,161,cscareerquestions,t3_1mqkqve,False,

There was a lot happening still in 'the underground' side of things, as well as tech startups.But, there were hiring freezes. There was lack of funding for startups, widespread layoffs. The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.But, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.Then, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now.

This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them. It's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement.

It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.What I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.Ultimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed. They could build something, or they could make their own luck. A shift in the stock market and a downturn in tech might be enough for VC's to think that big tech has had its day, and for them to invest elsewhere - causing a shift towards new tech.",EnderMB,2025-08-15 23:28:18,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1mr9qs6,False,

If you run out of seniors to hire, then you need to go down the chain to juniors. If LLMs are so great, you can strap an LLM to a junior now. (I think juniors should be treated better than that, but point still stands.)If you're out of things to do, that's different. But most companies aren't.FWIW - most places I've been at stopped hiring juniors due to belt tightening.

Then after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn’t know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. I had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily. Note that our online sales were better than ever and growing faster than ever too. The hassling got worse and worse until finally I was given an official disciplinary review for my poor performance. Wanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department’s outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. Got called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out.

That was the perkiest “no” I’ve ever delivered.I don’t know the best solution in your case, but if possible you should try to get them to fire you.

n9wpudx,">Quiet quitting / giving 50% on my day job isn’t an option, management is tracking quite literally ever 30 mins of my day.What would happen if you changed the 100% of your day to mean a regular, 8 hour, 9-5 work day?You're not changing it to 50%, you're not quiet quitting. You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.I don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. ""Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days"" vs ""Quit without anything lined up"".In reality there's usually a less extreme option: ""Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management"". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.The thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work ""normal"" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.So in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.That said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.I'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days...

It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.Driving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. The cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.On the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. TL;DR; NoVa is fine. I can't argue for it over any of the other locations you mentioned. Truth be told, if my wife had an opportunity in Chicago and wanted to move closer to here family, I'd probably be excited about the move.",effectivescarequotes,2025-08-17 03:12:41,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1ms7n15,False,

n98pdt1,"Hey that sounds really hard! The dual whammy of both personal life and work life being bad can take a real heavy toll. You’re drowning and the first thing to do is to give yourself some air. My suggestion would be to start by carving out some time for mental decompression every day - it can be something as simple as taking 15-20 mins everyday for a walk or workout or just sitting and staring out the window. But no phones, no emails, no bringing a family member along to make this time about them- this is your time to spend some time with yourself so that you can process your own emotions.Next, I’d focus on the positives of the situation. To me, it looks like things may not be as bad as they seem - to you it feels like everyone is weighing down on you, but in reality everyone is probably as stressed as you are and they are just passing that along to you, as they are to everyone. Second, no matter how bad it seems, it’s a temporary situation and it will change. It feels like the end of the world right now because you are in the eye of the storm, but it will pass. Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.Your employability may also be better than you feel. Even if it’s a niche industry, I’m sure there are skills you have that are transferable, and there may be opportunities in places you haven’t looked, like sister industries and customers where they may not be doing exactly what you are doing but your expertise could be valuable.

This would include guarantees about things like how much they’ll work over that 4 year period.You’ll need to make sure that the shareholder agreement outlines what happens if a shareholder becomes a liability.Ideally they offer you a reverse vesting deal as a founder. All your shares vest immediately at the price today and if you leave or lose your shares for some reason the shares that would not be vested at that point are forcibly sold back to the company. Sometimes the company buys them back at a predetermined value (often FMV at the time of issuance) but other times that’s not possible for a number of reasons and you may get a different price if this occurs.Essentially you want guarantees for yourself and from the other shareholders with a significant stake.If their company is only worth $1m today then a 2% stake is only $20k. Thats about $5k/yr or around $5/hr at 20 hours a week. That’s not really worth it as it’s impossible to know what the future may hold.

That might mean that you let Jan come and try to find a job in the meantime and tighten your belt a bit.

Anyone you know that might be at a company, possibly hiring? The market is not great right now, and companies know this, so they're pulling whatever bullshit they can for attrition (my company is doing the same thing although maybe a softer version of yours).

To me, moving would be like putting a bandaid on the solution that doesn't really fix the long term problem, while also making someone I care about suffer in the mean time.

What I've realized while searching is that with the job market the way it is right now, and how I'm lacking some of the more common skills that people are looking for, is that I'm going to have to compromise somewhere in my job search - either I'm going to have to continue in somewhat of the same niche for more money, or I'm going to have to accept a little less to get out now. You've only vaguely mentioned your job search and how it hasn't been going well. I don't think Udemy courses are going to help you much now that you've had multiple years of professional experience.

n8syoge,"Remote all day long.Here’s the problem with onsite for me. Suddenly, not just your output matters. Now your ability to social with the team, appearance, hygiene (for some people), just showing up to business events is called into question. That’s before we get to the studies that show commuting even 40 minutes reduces job satisfaction significantly enough that you’d have to earn nearly double to be just as happy. With other studies from Sean Achors research on happiness that show the happier the staff, the more productive. So, what immediately happens is you’re more likely to fail onsite. Because you have to maintain a lot for your mood.If those things are ok, then you have to deal with those who struggle to socialise outside of work and tend to like the office from the social aspect. By that I mean, they think this is the place to get all their social fill and interrupt, talk about shit I don’t care about, gossip, and generally make the day worse purely for their own benefit. That’s if they’re not disrupting you, there’s equal studies from the nords on the open office plan being cancer for focus. Anyways, that’s how I feel about it. When you’re onsite, suddenly your requirements expand 10 fold. — worked remote for 8 years, also been on site for 8 years prior. That’s just my opinion though. Hope it goes well either way.Edit: format, and appending, then telling you they’ll make you manager doesn’t mean much. And for only 10k more? I dunno.

n8t0xh5,"I think you already know the answer. You're just wondering if someone is going to chime in and tell you that there is a career benefit to taking a more ""high-stress, but prestigious job"".You'll probably be waiting a while. Ultimately wherever you work, it's just a job, and you'll be dealing with Kanban boards, tickets, unit tests, bugs, the same stuff everywhere. Without a substantial pay increase that would improve your overall quality of life there just isn't any benefit to more stress and in-office working.",EnderMB,2025-08-15 10:03:25,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1mqsnj6,False,

n94pw2b,"I mean you can go on-site if you want. But TBH, unless you’re in a HCOL city, on site is a scam in a lot of ways. I thought as remote work became more common, that there would be a race to the bottom for salaries. And while salaries have dropped (anyone in a senior position try to lateral lately? Good luck), you’re still finding remote roles paying way more than on site roles for people in LCOL, even MCOL areas. The only reasonable thing that I can conclude is that these on site companies are looking for desperate people, or warm bodies. Because they know they’d never get a talented senior who can get $160k in a remote role, offering $100k and mandating a daily commute. You seem to really want to be in management, so I’m not going to bash you for your decision. But I would choose the remote role 100/100.",Pristine-Item680,2025-08-17 05:21:52,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mqsnj6,False,
