Don't chain withColumn, generate all the column definitions into a list then do `df.select(""*"",*listofcols)`~~ edit: fixing 2am mistakes...Even though the key you pull from the map is the value in column 'v', you are parsing and defining the same map dtype column multiple times -- 150 times if it is the 10 models and 15 variables looping over the same 4 mappings. Think of the size and complexity of this query as it gets built out, where spark is generating 600 chained 'views' with hundreds of mapping objects, and every mapping gets used so cannot be discarded before processing.In pandas you don't have this because the mapping object is available in the same process directly and doesn't need to be duplicated data per row. It also processes the dataframe in full at each step, so it can discard any previously used map as it goes. Whereas spark can't access your dict directly and has lazy evaluation, so it has to 'remember' every single generation of every map field all at once when it finally runs, and will be duplicating the data into each row in its behind-the-scenes rdd.You want to only parse each model once, and only generate its map once, and reuse that. You also want to make a list of your output columns then use `.select()` on them all at once.

mopcy3u,"They can be, but you need to use them appropriately. In data systems there's often a tradeoff between latency, throughput, and query volume. You can easily get a distributed k:v store to ingest millions of entries per second, and each write can be retrieved essentially immediately for low latency results, but it will generally struggle to handle large analytical queries.Your deltalake tables can ingest enormous volumes of data, and are great for huge analytical queries, but there are limitations on the types of write that you can do in the process. Most importantly here MERGE operations have *a lot* of overhead -- you'll be rewriting entire files for an update to a single row, and every write is going to leave behind another time travel copy of the data it just superseded.You can clean up these time travel copies. You run compaction periodically, then do a VACUUM with a custom short time with the necessary override to let it delete files less than a *week* old. You'll still have a lot of overhead processing the merges, however.What is often better with rapidly updating data when using something like deltalake is to move away from merging every single change, and instead just blind-inserting new values to an append-only log with a timestamp of when that row version becomes active. From there a window function looking for the latest timestamp for a given key lets you filter for the 'current data'.Over time the total amount of data will get pretty large, and that will get inefficient. So you can periodically create a proper merged 'current state' table that *doesn't* need the window-function-for-latest filter. Then when querying for the latest data you start with that fully merged table as your base, you anti-join the keys from the timestamp filtered append log, and union data with the window-function-for-latest filter only on the new append log data.That query will skip all the 'previously merged' data from the append log and keep the window processing to a minimum, but still lets you get the latest state from the append log where it applies.You'll want to do something like a bucketby on both tables on the key, so that they are properly organised to minimise shuffles to achieve the joins and window functions.You can tune the full merge period to whatever suits. It could be hourly, or daily, or any frequency you like. Each time you do a merge you can also compact and vacuum to clear out old data. If you partition your append-log by a time bin you can also drop old partitions to save storage space there too -- and it can help with skipping files that won't be relevant.---These sorts of 'streaming into big analysis' issues seem to come up from time to time.

To 4 123rd ave, because you parse an address into what it represents (house number and street)- Nickname substitution (Tom matches Thomas)- Abbreviation matching (CIA matches Central Intelligence Agency)- Address validation - comparing an address to the US Postal Service to see if it’s real (don’t try matching fictitious addresses)- Understanding name titles - (Mrs, Miss, Sir, Jr, III, II, etc. John Thomas can match Mr. John Thomas, or John Thomas II is different from John Thomas III)Etc…. You get the point…Ultimately, there are two big things: match accuracy and match speed. Accuracy evaluates two records against each other using all the different rules, scores each one, and then this is where you come in — you set weights on the different rules to “tune” the algorithm. Essentially, you are optimizing either overmatching or undermatching — you will never be perfect. In some cases you want to overmatch (say you are sending direct mail promotions and are fine accidentally grouping father and son as same person). In some cases you prefer to undermatch (say you are grouping medial records/data and don’t want to give a child the medication his father is prescribed because you incorrectly linked the two as the same entity). Second big thing is speed. Ultimately, you are comparing each record against each record - do the math…. It’s too long to actually compute. So, these tools take short cuts - they actually only compare subsets of data against each other (important- this means some rows will never be evaluated for a potential match). For example if record 1 is “123 1st St, NM USA” I don’t actually need to compare this one against any data that isn’t from the state of New Mexico (NM). HOWEVER, what if I’m wrong about the original record being in NM? If I am, then I have no hope of making a match (let’s say it’s actually in MN - typo) so my accuracy is compromised because of my speed algorithm. So, again, this is why you pay more as features go up. Can you have speed and accuracy - sure, but it will cost you.NOTE: As an interesting aside, I was also on a Material Matching project. Materials are very different from customers, it’s actually not a data problem but an image recognition problem. Our first approach was to treat it like customer and look at attributes we stored in data (length, width, etc.) and perform the match. It was terrible. Poor data quality, and you can’t capture enough data - for example, you might have same H,W,D and weight, but you don’t capture “right hand” or “left hand” part (which makes them different). The answer is software that matches visually looking at the CAD drawings in 3d. Very cool, and very expensive. Really isn’t a BI problem at this point, but an Engineering problem since it’s in the CAD world.EDIT: you will need a manual method to override matches, and fix them. In my project our software matched 95% of the data correctly!!!! The business had to use 5 full time head count for 1 year to perform the additional 5% match. So - this should tell you how valuable the software is, and how difficult it is to manually match millions of rows of data. EDIT: I didn’t state this, but the process is to create “groups” of data (entities). So, your target data is [group id or entity id], [record id], [attribute columns: name, address 1, city, state…]. The group id/entity id field is just the master record, record id. This can be set as the first record that forms the group/entity (group id=record id) or you can use logic to ensure this is your “golden record”. You have many matching rules, each rule matches rows using the various match algorithms above (think of it as sub-matching) - we had 3 big ones. Highest weight rule was where all attributes matched between two records (name + address), rule 2: name + zip matched, rule 3 - address only matched. First step of the process was a data quality phase - ensure all records have these fields populated - ie: if zip is blank or wrong, we look up address to populate the zip. EDIT: What exactly is a “entity”? You’ll find really interesting situations in your data. For example, for us an entity was a customer/account. We found situations where a customer has multiple buildings, each on different roads (close to each other on their property) which made the addresses very different, requiring manual matching override. Think of a large corporate campus, university, or government facility (military base). All those buildings are on different roads, with different addresses - but are the same entity. It’s very unlikely the tool will match them, since it matches addresses.. so manual overrides are needed (unless you can work in reference data and additional rules about all the various streets on the campus…)EDIT: you’ll also get matching logical problems where record A matches record B, and record B matches record C, so that means A=C. But it shouldn’t…so you have this huge blob of over matched records you need to manually split up. The incorrect matching is coming from data quality problems. Essentially, you have 1 bad address row causing two entities to be incorrectly linked. This can happen when businesses use central billing locations - like a corporate headquarters, or a state/city office. For example, the city cemetery and the city water treatment, and the city transportation service all get linked because their data comes to you via the cities single administrative building with a single address.EDIT: I really liked this book. Data Matching, by Peter ChristenEDIT: Think about what you are going to do with the data. If it’s data warehousing only, you might want to build a “reference style Master Data Management database”. This essentially is only used for data warehouse/analytics, and consumes data from systems but does not push data to source systems (or claim to own customer). But if you need to create the enterprise definition of the truth, and your job is to “own” the definition of customer for the enterprise — then you need to catch customer data being entered in various source systems, master it quickly, and push it back to those systems. There are different styles of MDM architecture/tools. Same matching principles - but speed and integration becomes a more important requirement.",rotr0102,2025-04-26 14:27:15,21,dataengineering,t3_1k8dmdp,False,

mp6ylpg,"Yes - because you're retaining history at the raw/source layer, you can easily go back and create scd-2 type tables with valid to/from fields later as needed. So for your current use case, sure. I would however advise you to consider that what your stakeholders consider to be current data and what you consider to be current data may not be the same thing. So, for example, if you're doing dimensional modeling and you're choosing to only use current data in your dim tables, you're missing out on what could be critical information for each fact line in the time that it was loaded. For example, if they want to track customer activations and deactivations, you would use a historical dim customer table for that. So as long as you have this in mind and are prepared to shift to historical dim tables when these requests come up, you should be fine. Regardless, because you are retaining that history at the raw source layer, you'll be fine. It just might be extra work later on.I think I've said you'll be fine enough times here :)",financialthrowaw2020,2025-04-26 19:12:17,15,dataengineering,t3_1k8jz47,False,

Every single change can be committed or rolled back. There is also a nifty AI commit message generator that saves several seconds when checking in changes. The change control window in Coalesce is similar to Git - it has two panels that show your modifications vs the last committed version and the changes are highlighted. As for committing all changes or line item, it really depends on how frequently you commit.

Honestly with data stacks maturing line between data analyst and data engineers will keep getting fuzzier so it is good that you have background in data analysis and experience in data engineering.From an interview perspective:1. Doing a job and demonstrating that you can do a job are two different things. Interviews test the later skill so specifically prepare for that.2. Prepare well for interviews from concepts as well as experience perspective. If the entire team got impacted see if there are good peer interviewers so you folks can practice interviews.3.

moj785f,"Seminal book on the topic is “Designing Data Intensive Applications”, but that is pretty general.I think for spark specifically, the best thing you can do is inspect the spark ui. You can read about the different types of joins spark does (shuffle, broadcast etc) and even use hints in your SQL or pyspark to force a certain one.SQL and pandas and spark have a lot of differences, but one thing that’s helped me is learning the fundamental data structures at play. SQL databases use a B-tree for its index, so if I 10x my data size, my reads are only 2x slower. Parquet uses a bloom filter so you can filter it with a WHERE clause extremely quickly. Chapter 3 of designing data intensive applications goes into this.Related to this, one neat optimizations databases do is use statistics for query optimization. For example, if you have [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) statistics, the query optimizer can get more accurate cardinality estimates on your data. This can really help if you have many joins. There’s a good paper from Meta and others (including Pandas creator Wes McKinney) going into the differences between all of these systems, and it gives a good overview of what needs to happen between you submitting a query and getting data back: https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2679-pedreira.pdf",Candid_Art2155,2025-04-23 01:11:49,3,dataengineering,t3_1k5mazo,False,

If your new data arrives as parquet files on S3, you'll have to configure some kind of pipeline to detect new files and INSERT/MERGE them into existing Iceberg tables.

In order to do anything with it, you need a data engine that understands the protocol and can read/write from it. Historically, only Spark really understood this protocol (because all the logic for this protocol was written in a .jar). Nowadays, other engines are slowly catching on. 2. Yep — if a new parquet file drops somewhere, you’re going to need to run some kind of job with your data engine of choice to read that file and write the data into your iceberg table. No magic here unfortunately and different engines might do this differently :(3. Now here’s the real kicker… if you want the latest and greatest features in Iceberg I would argue (very sadly) that Spark is the only engine that can do the newest stuff. Iceberg itself is pretty much just developed against Spark, and there is even logic in Spark that doesn’t follow the Iceberg spec that other engines have had to follow because of how ubiquitous Spark-written iceberg tables are in the wild :(The problem is that the iceberg protocol itself is very complex, and all the logic for adhering to the spec was originally written for the JVM. So only JVM tools such as Spark can leverage the latest features. That being said though there is tremendous progress being made in other ecosystems such as the PyIceberg ecosystem and iceberg-rust that are promising.

mp4e1s9,"The short answer is clustering can be beneficial when inserting records if implemented correctly. The long answer:Columnar storage in general (not just BigQuery) is usually stored as read-only files that have built in metadata describing what data is in each column. This allows for more efficient filtering at the file level. It is slightly more complex than this when it comes to a Data Warehouse like BigQuery, but generally when you “merge” a record into columnar storage, you can think about the operation like this:1. Search for the file your data is potentially in based on file metadata2. If the record could be in a file based on the metadata, read the existing data in to memory3. Find the matching rows in each column4. Update them if they exist5. Overwrite the existing file in storage and update the file metadata if a record was insertedClustering improves look up speed in this process by making it more efficient to find the right file to operate on. For instance, let’s say you have a table of product purchases with a reference to the customer who made the purchase. This table has mutable attributes like product delivery date (NULL until it has been delivered) that need to be updated on delivery of the product. An appropriate clustering field for this table might be customer_id, which would logically group all purchases by the associated customer_id when writing to a file. This way, instead of needing to read potentially every file in the table in to memory to try and find a purchase to update, it is able to read in only a select file or two. In order to take advantage of this, you would need to use the customer_id in the merge predicate.",EngiNerd9000,2025-04-26 09:51:59,4,dataengineering,t3_1k82dcn,False,

Poorly written OOP can turn simple tasks into a nightmarish tangle of fragile dependencies with anti-patterns all over the place. It is definitely a skill that takes a significant amount of time to develop for most people. But, the process of learning how to write clean code helps you learn how to think about complex problems: how to break them up into self-contained modules, and make them flexible enough to accommodate the expected changes, but not so overly complex that you have a Factory to make Factories, when you're only going to end up using one instance of it anyway.Depending on what you're actually doing from day to day as a DE, you may not need to develop the ability to craft enterprise level OOP code, but being able to understand and read OOP code is a pretty important foundational skill.

If the hash key is different between the two tables, you now know which records have “updated”.Drop those customer IDs from the dataframe with current table data, then union in the “new” rows from your fresh data.Overwrite the whole table back to target.Not ideal if you have massive data, but should work.If you do have very big data, id suggest start looking into Delta etc. and go that way",Some_Grapefruit_2120,2025-04-22 19:06:07,2,dataengineering,t3_1k5d84o,False,

However, if this is true you can have a single task managing scd's: SELECT * FROM TABLE ( INFER_SCHEMA ( LOCATION => '@your_stage/path_to_files/', FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format' ) );Better yet you can create a table from stage with: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE your_table USING TEMPLATE ( SELECT ARRAY_AGG(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(*)) FROM TABLE ( INFER_SCHEMA( LOCATION => '@your_stage/path_to_files/', FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format' ) ) );This will essentially automatically add the fields for the table -- see documentation above. You can also do something like: ALTER TABLE your_existing_table SET ENABLE_SCHEMA_EVOLUTION = TRUE;On an existing table and then any \`COPY INTO\` would automatically track and gracefully handle schema changes. **\*There are limitations, so please read the docs carefully\*.** This should dramatically reduce your dynamic SQL needs to the point where only your mart/dwh layers should have to alter their SQL, but it would depend highly on any unknown complexities.If your data is being ingested directly to a raw table and not a stage -- your options become a bit more limited to probably what you are already doing without any 3rd party tooling or some large SP / Task doing the bulk of the work.The greater answer to your overall post is likely -- tasks aren't the wrong choice, but there are probably better options.

If you master one, then you'll stand out vs. others who mastered none, and you'll pick up any language required of you on the job in weeks.- DSA classes & Leetcode. Most important part of CS due to how interviews are structured. Do 250 most common LC problems and focus on easy/medium unless targetting FAANG for first job.- Build practical projects. Initially start simple, like that easy react page you created. You learn by doing 10x faster than tutorial hell. You need to learn how to structure your own projects and build something from A to Z, from having an idea to breaking it down in small parts and building it out (without guidance provided in tutorials).- Project structure for bigger applications, everything has its own place and the quicker you start modulating projects the way they do in production the faster you'll grow.- Find a specialization and focus on it. Try simple projects: react frontend page you did, then try building a backend API with CRUD, try building a simple ETL pipeline for data, then try a simple github CI/CD with github actions and dockerize one of the apps. Nothing complex. Cover basics of each, build them in a few days, and then ask yourself: which one seems most interesting to you, which one seems like something you'd like to pursue?Specialization matters heavily. Everyone spreads themselves thin, and if your goal is to achieve what CS grads do in 4 years, you should pick something early on and master one area.

These days automatic transmissions are faster than humans can shift and nearly as reliable with less and less horsepower loss as the years go by. What your instructors are getting at is similar. C and Rust are cars with manual transmissions or in computer terms manual memory management. C#, Java, and the node.js platform are automated memory management languages. Manually controlling gears, downshifting into a corner, clutch kicking when you want the ass end of your car to slide, and dumping the clutch for a nasty burnout are things you can only do in a stickshift. Similarly, manually allocating heap (and stack) memory, directly accessing processor register information, running online assembly and other features are only possible in systems languages like C and Rust. Most people just want to get to work and back safely which is why most cars these days are automatic. Business software (and jobs) are the exact same.

mommpil,"Everyone else is talking about speed and I think that's completely missing the point, there are very good reasons to use C++ other than just speed.Here are some things you can do in C++ that you can't do in Python. All of these things you can also do from C. Many of these things you can also do from Rust and other languages that compile to native code, but not all of them.1. Call native operating system APIs directly. If you're on Windows, go to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and explore the tens of thousands of APIs. The ONLY way to call these APIs directly is from a compiled language like C++. If you call them from any other language you're just calling some wrapper function that calls the function from C. That's even true for C#, even today there are some Windows APIs that you can't call from C#. Some specific examples below.2. Memory mapping. Let's say you have a 1 GB file. In C++ you can memory map that to an array of bytes with 1 billion elements. The memory map function returns almost instantly, it doesn't copy the file into RAM. When you access byte 777,000, it doesn't read the previous 700 thousand bytes, it just reads only one small chunk of the file from disk into memory at the moment you access it.3. Shared memory. You can have multiple processes on the same computer that ""share"" a chunk of memory directly. To communicate they don't need to copy huge data structures back and forth if they don't want to.4. Hardware drivers. Using C++ you can write directly to a memory address, or read directly from a memory address. Most hardware peripherals are entirely controlled this way, by communicating via nothing other than accessing special memory addresses plus hardware interrupts to let you know when something changed. On a modern operating system you can only do this if you write a kernel driver, but if you get an embedded development kit you can write bare-metal code that talks to keyboards, sound chips, push buttons, or whatever just using direct memory reads and writes.5. Hooking system functions / injecting code into other processes. For example on Windows, write a DLL that provides an alternate implementation of some common function like ShowWindow, then inject that DLL into some other process so every time they call ShowWindow, it actually calls your function instead.",dmazzoni,2025-04-23 16:00:35,229,learnprogramming,t3_1k5xqyo,False,

And if you look through it, you will very quickly find little ""baby projects"" that could be made that are very C++-specific. For example, let's look at the list for concurrency:> \[2\] Write a program with two threads: one that writes ""hello"" every second and one that writes ""world!"" every second.>\[3\] Time a loop. Write out the time in milliseconds. Do this for the default setting of your compiler and for a setting using an optimizer (e.g., −O2 or ""release""). Be careful not to have the optimizer eliminate your whole loop as dead code because you did not use a result.>\[4\] Repeat the histogram drawing example from §5.6.3 for a normal\_distribution and 30 rows.>\[5\] Use a regex to find all decimal numbers in a file. So, on that list, \[2\] and \[3\] \*could\* be done in Python, but they would not make sense. The issues that Mr Stroustrup is trying to teach here (e.g. how concurrency works on the OS or hardware level) is probably best observable in C++. Also for \[3\] this is purely a C/C++ thing. Python turns code into bytecode in a completely different way. I very doubt that Python does loop elimination or anything like that, for example. Also, to properly do all parts of \[3\], you will also need to look at the assembly language output of your code to see what optimizations your compiler is doing (and to really verify whether it is eliminating loops, and under what conditions it does that).Exercises \[4\] and \[5\] probably could be done in any language, of course Python would be an easy language to use for \[5\]. I'm not sure why Stroustrup placed these exercises in the concurrency section.

mpj31lm,"I've won hackathons before. Best tip is to practice with an existing team, as a team, and do mock hackathons. If you know react, and what packages to download, you can build something in less than 12 hours. First 4 hours might be planning and reading the docs, 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours to clean up and submit. 12 hours of productive coding. We can break down the 12 hours even further if you want, but assume also each team member knows what they are doing and we can do it in parallel. Initialize the git repo, frontend, backend and database on local host with a decided framework. Database can be hosted on the cloud. Frontend is probably react, or vue, with tailwind css or bootstrap as the UI framework or use another one with copy and paste components. Backend can be flask or django, or if you want, ignore backend completely and just connect frontend to the database directly. (don't do this with real production code). (takes around 1-2 hours) Your team of four starts splitting up work. One or two guys start working on frontend with the UI framework. One guy working on util libraries and business logic as well as api and webhooks. Another guy working on the database. You may have a floater or a guy that finished early to do merges and resolving merge conflicts. (3-6 hours)Working in parallel will require constantly preplanning what tasks are important that have a lot of other tasks dependent on it and which tasks have a lot of dependencies itself. (but at this point you should be polishing up) (3-6 hours) Cloud hosting is quick and easy nowadays, should only take 1-2 hours. It might take a while to figure out the dockerfile and which cloud hosting platform will help the most.If you know what you are doing, and use existing open source frameworks and solutions, you can cut down the time spent writing boilerplate code and just focus on connecting API calls and endpoints. ----# Just a few tips 1. Already find your team of four and practice with them before the competition. Treat it like a war game if you want. Go into what if scenarios and try and build real projects together. 2. Look into the hackathons previous winners and losers from previous hackathons. Try and figure out how the judges pick the winners. Do the judges really care about ML technologies? or do they just care about fancy UI? Some judges care about how many microservices you used and/or how big your techstack us. Do a lot of preplanning to figure out what the judges like. 3. As the competition gets near, usually company names start appearing, judges names start appearing, as well as the challenge names. Do a lot of research on the companies and judges. If you wanna score points from a company, look into what API libraries they might want you to use. If you want to score points with a judges, and they are industry or professor, do a challenge that they can relate to. 4. Never rebuild the wheel. Use other people's code. Use open source frameworks and code from github.No hackathon winner will ever build their entire stack. The use frameworks and existing solutions. The only thing they will build themselves are the connections between the frontend and the backend as well as the business logic. 5. Add as much techstack and bloat as you can. Host it on a bunch of microservices, use OAuth, host it on the cloud. Add infinite horizontal scaling. Judges for some reason like that, even if it does nothing for your app. 6. The app doesn't even have to work. It only needs to seem like it works. --- Winning hackathons is a specific skill, and only some of it is transferable to actual industry. Over representing your app to judges probably isn't something you will do in industry, and hard coding stuff is probably something you won't do.

But the tech boom of the last decade or so has meant a **lot** of people have learnt some coding skills, so jobs increasingly require both skills **and** experience.>how the heck does programming even work? What the hell is happening?Think about a simple circuit, with a battery, a push button and a lightbulb: you press the button, the lightbulb switches on; you unpress the button, it switches off.Now imagine you have a 7-segment LCD display (like the ones on digital clocks that display numbers): that's just 7 versions of the same thing, so in order to display the number ""5"" on your screen, you need to press and unpress the right combinations of 7 buttons. But that's really annoying, so instead, you create a mega-button labelled ""5"", and just wire it so that when you press the ""5"" button, it press and unpresses all the right buttons for you. Congratulations: you have abstracted away the electronics, and now you have a simpler interface.Programming is just that: abstractions upon abstractions. You can't write a ""hello world"" program by interfacing with the monitor directly - mapping each key on your keyboard to the setting and unsetting of individual pixels - primarily because that would be insane.

I'd done a lot of professional programming before I got my degree (decades ago, when one could more easily get work without a degree). I didn't start on my degree until I was 30. To me, nearly every class-required programming project until my senior year looked like a toy project to me.*(The one project that wasn't a toy project was insanely big and complex, most people dropped out of the class doing that project, myself included, and the three people who did finish the class had to spend an extra semester beyond the one semester the class was supposed to take to get the classwork done.)*Not to brag (okay, yes, very clearly to brag) I graduated at the top of my class in Computer Science. I couldn't help but feel my classmates were in for a rude shock when they had to do real-world coding projects.What helped me feel more prepared is that programming had been a hobby of mine since high school. Even before I got my first programming job I had already, just for fun, done stuff much more complicated than I had to do to get a Bachelor's degree in college.This is not to say I didn't learn anything useful in college. I most certainly did. I gained a lot more discipline and perspective on coding than I had hacking away on my own.It helps if you actually enjoy creating software and aren't just after a degree because it seems like a good way to make money. If you've got that kind of interest, I'd suggest jumping in to help on some open-source project that interests you, or just come up with your own projects that pique your interest. Challenge yourself. Find things that keep pushing the edge of what you know how to do so you're always learning something new as you go along.This is not to say you won't be able to get a job and work your way up while learning on the job. Clearly many people with your same educational background get jobs at companies prepared to train fresh graduates. Then again, if AI starts to take over some of the more basic, routine work, those opportunities might begin to shrink.I retired just a couple of years ago, but I'm still coding away.

What I would possible do in your case is to extend and improve your current work by automation with code, and not just no-code tools, but actual coding as well.

Again, while you _can_ build perfectly fine stuff with it… why not use a better language?IMO, the only thing PHP does better than any other language is the seamless integration into HTML pages. Which is how it got started anyway, and why it's so easy to pick up, and why it's become so popular. Because the progression from dicking around with HTML to adding some programming to said HTML is seamless and easy and likely a natural gateway drug for many.

morawh7,"\> I'll just memorise the syntaxThe reason you're struggling is because memorising has nothing to do with programming. Now programmers do indirectly memorise syntax, but it's only because this is a byproduct of understand the syntax.This would be my suggestion:1. Take an example of some C++ code from the internet.2. Open a text editor and type in the code. Don't copy and paste the code. The typing will help you to remember things.3. Run the code through a compiler making sure it compiles and runs. Understand what the running code is doing.4. Now go back to the editor and write one or more lines of comment for every line code in the file. Tie some of the comments back to the behaviour you saw when you ran the code.5. Now go back to step 1 and repeat this for another dozen or so different examples.Those 12 examples could easily be a day's work, only because you will need to research each and every line of code so that you can write the line of comment for code that makes sense and is accurate. But what you should also find; as you loop through more examples that process of adding a comment get easier; you should also find the typing gets easier and is more accurate.Now if you repeat this for two or three weeks, you'll find your way on the way to being a programmer.And using this approach you can actually measure your progress. If after one week you're still struggling to write a line of comment for each line of code, then you really have not learned much. Over those many examples there will be many common lines of code, meaning the comments will also be common. It is the details found in those comments that you are trying to memorise, not the code.PS: For context, here are some examples typical line comments.

Parts of the code that are stable and haven't changed in a while might still be written in an older style, including a pre-C++11 style.So if you joined a company today and got put on a C++ project, my expectation would be that it supports and allows C++20 (which has been stable in all compilers for a while), does not support C++23 (most compilers have incomplete support, the average project doesn't want to be bleeding-edge), but that lots of the code doesn't take advantage of newer features where it could because nobody has bothered to rewrite it.Newer versions of C++ standardize things like networking and threading that were previously only available from third-party libraries.

I wrote a variety of one-off programs that parsed the various input file formats and then turned them into libraries that could be used by the actual target program. Each one of these took me 1-5 days (some formats were simple, others were not, by the end I was able to reuse code as well for similar formats), then I integrated them into my main program and glued it all together and had a beta version for my colleagues.What I didn't do was try to implement all the parsers all at once (context switching between each task) or only write them as part of the main program with no way to evaluate my partially working system. By setting them up as these one-offs I was able to stay focused, generate some tests, and figure out if I really was parsing the data correctly (mostly taking the parsed data and regenerating the original files and comparing the two).If you have multiple projects that you want to complete, set deadlines. Decide that ""By 15 May I want project X to have features A, B, and C."" Then do it. If there's no external driver of priority (no work or school objective, all personal) you declare your priorities. Otherwise everything is the same priority and no progress is ever made. Even for work I do this. If I have a 12-month project with no one deciding which features needed to be done by a particular date, I just set them myself.

That means every single language your company uses, every single tool, framework, or library - all of it needs to be secure, and the security team is ultimately responsible for it.Now, if you work on a security team then you might specialize. One person might focus on web security, another on SQL injections, and another on mobile. But in my experience that's not very common unless you have a very large company. At most smaller companies, everyone in security has to know a little bit about everything.Remember, security is only as strong as its weakest link. Let's say your company has a mobile app, a web app, and a backend running in AWS with a Postgres database. All of them need to be secure. If just a single one is insecure and can be hacked, that brings the whole company down and it doesn't matter how secure everything else was.Honestly that's one of the things that makes security fun.

This includes goddamn function arguments- despite arrays not really existing, there is still a length operator- indices starting at 1 ... but ofc. since arrays and maps, sorry *""tables""* are the same thing you can still *assign* to `tablename[0]`- another consequence of this absurdness is this completely valid assignment: ´arr[-42] = ""oh uh""`- tables are also conflated with objects: `t[""name""]` and `t.name` both work the same. Not even Python is that stupid.- without `local`, assignments default to the nearest var of the same name. If there isn't one, they default to global. Meaning, accidentially generating or overwriting global state is really easy. Combine that with the silent nil-derefing, and you see why debugging Lua feels about as good as a papercut.- only the last arg to functions works as a vararg, but you can still put a vararg before the last...and silently get everything but the first argument dropped- general syntactic idiocy: the `:` pseudo-accessor, the `..` operator, the `#` operator. The lang has `not` as a boolean operator, but somehow `~=` (not-equal) is a thing. The `end` keyword to end blocks with. We an exponential operator `^` but no increment/decrement operators- metatables, aka. what happens when someone thinks: *""Hey, how about we take the worst ideas from prototyping and class based OOP, and mush them together by shoehorning them into the only data structure we cared to build into our pseudo language!""*- Since there aren't really objects (everything is a table), you can actually call an ""object"" method passing a different object as `self`- `break` exists, but `continue` does not- strings assume the unicode table ends at 255, therefore, strings are really byte arrays. meaning, handling unicode requires libs- despite tables being the only datastructure, there is no built-in way to copy a table- despite having pseudo-exceptions (`error()` and `pcall`), tons of built ins refuse to use them, returning `nil` instead",Big_Combination9890,2025-04-23 00:18:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k5kb0r,False,

Call the class of algorithm and fit - this seems easy when all of your data fits in RAM, but once you start trying to train on hundreds of terabytes worth of data, this is no longer simple. Also, when you have to wait days to train instead of minutes or hours, it becomes far more important to figure out how to validate your approach on smaller subsets first before trying to train on everything.4. Predict - in most real-world scenarios you're not just calling predict once, you're trying to take that model and embed it into an app so that it can do real-time predictions.

mofa23w,"At their core, APIs are just the public side of some service. So, when you call \`my\_dict.items()\`, you're just using the 'items' method of the dictionary API for that particular dictionary.There really isn't anything special to learn about APIs; they're just a set of calls that are permitted to use from the outside of your codebase. if we're talking about some web service, then theres some authentication to do as well, but thats not particularly special; if you can authenticate users, you can auth (a subset of) users for this purpose.The 'I' is the operating term: Interface. If you understand that concept, you pretty much know all that you need to to make an Application Programmer's Interface. You could take a read into Interfaces in Java, for example, to get a better sense. (Not all languages have explicit Interface constructs, but the concept still exists: a set of abstract calls that do something specific that can be used without any specification on how they are implemented (a black box)).",rinio,2025-04-22 13:02:14,2,learnprogramming,t3_1k55eqj,False,
mogevaw,"POV: I've taught CS for many years, including general programming and APIs.APIs are a specific style of data transfer, which is a variation of input and output. So what you're wanting to learn is a particular style of programming. That's a good goal, but you need to learn general programming concepts before you can comprehend a specific subset of coding. There are two distinct ways of thinking about APIs, and both depend on some knowledge of core programming ideas. First, you can write a program in any language that *consumes* an API. That is, you can write a program that uses an API to find the current weather in Barbados. This is a relatively straightforward process in most languages, but typically you learn this after you've learned more fundamental things, like how to get information from the user or from local files, how to handle looping and branching, and how to write functions.The other way to think about APIs is to *produce* an API. In that sense, you are writing a program that lives on some type of server that produces data in some kind of machine-readable format (usually JSON, but other formats are certainly viable). This is also not a difficult process, but it requires knowledge of essential programming concepts, and typically you'll also want to write a front-end package to test your API. I would say start with any good programming course. There's a good reason Python is taught as a first language in most CS courses. It's reasonably straightforward, and is excellent for a number of use cases, including working with APIs. You can read and create APIs with Python out of the box, but for creating an API, you'd probably be better off using a library like flask, bottle, or rapidAPI. I would definitely learn standard programming ideas first before digging into libraries. Express.js is fine, but it's a specialized form of JavaScript that doesn't make any sense if you don't already know how to program in vanilla JS. It seems to me that CodeAcademy has a more organized curriculum. It doesn't go straight into using APIs, but that is fine. If you can't drive yet, race cars don't matter. Learn to program in a language, then we can focus on the particular skills you want. FreeCodeCamp is great for looking up a specific skill, but it often makes a lot of assumptions about what you already know.

mokosj2,"Python is a good start and is enough to understand programming concepts.To be completely fair, the most important concepts you need to learn have nothing to do with actual programming or languages. Those are your foundations - Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Databases. There’s a very good reason most universities focus on theory for the first two years of a CS degree, and not so much on coding. Learning these will make you understand programming as a whole. After that, any language will be equally valuable to you.To answer the question. I’d say, after learning Python well, you can either go useful, frontend or lower level (well every other language is lower level but that’s not the point).If you want to find a job as quickly as possible, learn Java or C#. Those languages are by far the most used in the industry and there’s never lack in demand (keep in mind that there is also a lot of supply). If you choose this option, you have to know that you’ll also most definitely need to learn their respective web frameworks - Spring and .NET, as they are pretty much required by the job market. This is a very good path to take and I can highly recommend it. Also, keep in mind that there’s a very good chance you circle around to Java/C#, even if you choose a different path now, since these are one of the most essential languages and are taught and used everywhere.Another popular route is to master JavaScript and become a capable full-stack developer. That’s also where React comes in. React is a JavaScript framework used for simplifying the way to build responsive web interfaces. I think there will be time in the future to worry about frontend, so I wouldn’t choose learning JavaScript at your current stage.Finally, the lower level route. I personally encourage any beginner to go deep into the land of pointers because you gain soo much more understanding of the way a computer works, than you do by using Python or JavaScript. For this I recommend you go with either C or C++ (personally, I’d go with C). These languages are what we call “lower level” because they don’t have fancy built in features to simplify the hard stuff and you have to think a lot more about everything. Those languages have no “garbage collection” meaning you need to allocate your own memory, and you need to free it when you don’t use it anymore. They use pointers to reference the data you use. C has no Object Oriented Programming, meaning you can only encapsulated data using a “struct”, and you can’t have methods tied to that data (procedural programming).",todorpopov,2025-04-23 08:04:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1k5s9wt,False,

We all have our favorite little solutions, but if you can write a function with a loop and a few \`if\` statements, you're done.>However, the above link doesn't explain why the hashmap solution is more efficient.Hashmaps trade space for time. They offer O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, which is to say that you can find, add, or remove an element in constant time regardless of whether it contains 5 elements, 5 thousand, or 5 million. But they get that speed by using enough space to avoid collisions (where different keys hash to the same location) most of the time, so they're very efficient in time, much less so in space.>I've heard that in technical job interview problems, if you can use a hashmap, then you should. Would you agree with this?Certainly not. Use the right data structure for the job. Hashmaps are often a great choice, because if you can get constant-time access to every element, that's pretty appealing. But hashmaps are unordered, so a poor choice if you want to access elements in order. They use a ton of space, so not great if there's a space constraint or if the number of elements is huge. And they don't handle multiple values for a single key. Maybe those are reasons that you ""can't"" use a hashmap, but I'd still turn it around and say that if you *need* what a hashmap offers, then you should use it; if a different structure offers a better combination of features, you should use that instead.",iOSCaleb,2025-04-24 21:42:04,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k72fep,False,

In that case, just using hashmaps everywhere is probably better than not knowing what to do at all.

momk8j9,"Big O, `O()`, is an **abstraction** to help us _estimate_ algorithm complexity, performance, and scalability. * In _theory_ there is no difference between theory and implementation. * In _implementation_ there can be a HUGE difference.Like all abstractions the devil is in the (implementation) details.The reason we DO count instruction cycles when profiling is because it gives us an absolute time that we can use to compare against. We can compare:* _actual_ **run-time** time versus the* _expected_ **theoretical** best case. That is, we can do A vs B comparisons such as A is `X%` faster or `Y%` slower to answer the question: _Is our optimization helping, hindering, or neither?_But oftentimes we want to know HOW an algorithm scales up relative to input size. `O()` is an _estimate_ of this which may, or may NOT, be accurate:If we have three algorithms that all perform the same task and have this scaling ... * O( n )* O( n^K )* O( K^n )... then the linear `O( n )` algorithm is probably going to be the fastest, by far, all things considered.However `O()` IGNORES RAM speed, RAMaccess patterns, and branch prediction -- all which MAY be factors!The _reason_ this was done was that pre-2000's CPU speed and RAM speed roughly had a 1:1 mapping. We used to store calculations in tables because the computation speed was SO slow.However by the 2000's CPU speeds became significantly faster than RAM. As CPU speeds increased and RAM didn't (as much) it became faster to calculate more, lookup less.Unfortunately Computer Science textbooks never got the memo that `O()` has COMPLETELY failed to adapt to the changing hardware and performance uplifts of modern systems. **It is an INCOMPLETE metric.**Let's take a [simple example](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/cache_line_speed) of summing up entries in an array. sum = 0; for( int col = 0; col < STRIDE; col++ ) for( int row = 0; row < SIZE; row += col ) sum = data[ row + col ];_Normally_ stride is 1, sequential acess, but what if it isn't?We can change the stride to show HOW we access data (and the data cache) plays more and more of a role the larger the data set.For example with an array of 2^30 elements (1,073,741,824) we see this falloff:| Stride | Op/s | Time ||--:|--:|--:|| 1 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 2 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 4 | 733 M/s | 00:00:01s || 8 | 388 M/s | 00:00:02s || 16 | 213 M/s | 00:00:04s || 32 | 141 M/s | 00:00:07s || 64| 116 M/s | 00:00:08s || 128 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 256 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 512 | 100 M/s | 00:00:10s | | 1024 | 66 M/s | 00:00:15s |EXACT same O(n) but HUGE differences in the Real World^TM.HOW we access this array matters! This is why ... * AoS (Array of Structs) and * SoA (Struct or Arrays) ... can have such a HUGE difference even though we are iterating over the _same_ data. **All those cache misses add up to slower performance.** This demonstrating O() IS incomplete for modern algorithms.In modern performance programming, often times we want a _branchless algorithm_ as we are _trading latency for throughput._ We want to keep the CPU pipeline saturated with work and not cause pipeline bubbles or flushes via branching.There are 3 categories of optimizations from slowest to fastest:1. **Micro-optimization** or [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html). On older compilers and slower CPUs you would replace `MOD` with `AND` for powers of two, division with multiplication and bit shifts. i.e. Calculating `7*n` as `n + 2*n + 4*n` -- assuming your CPU even has a `MUL` instruction!2. **Algorithm.** Using a faster algorithm used to be the second step in optimization . We would use `O()` as a guideline for performance/scalability.3. **Macro-optimization** or Cache-Oriented aka Data-Oriented Design (DOD). As we deal with larger data sets optimizing for _minimizing cache misses_ becomes more important.See [CppCon 2019: Matt Godbolt “Path Tracing Three Ways: A Study of C++ Style”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6c4Kwbv4I) where OOP, FP, and DOD is compared.",mysticreddit,2025-04-23 15:48:41,5,learnprogramming,t3_1k5y2ma,False,

mpgempk,"It's just syntax.`var` isn't a pointer, it's a label. `[var]` isn't a value nor a deceleration, it's a dereference of `var`'s pointer. Assembly expects you to be explicit, and it's impossible to IMAGINE all the things that would break if you changed it.It's not that - theoretically - assembly couldn't have been written so `var` always explicitly references the pointer and `[var]` always explicitly references the value, but that's not how it played out and it's not how assembly functions under the hood.This is pretty common in every language and language-syntax. There's always things that seem like they should work, that don't seem to conflict with anything else, that simply don't work.For example, in JS we have what's called ""optional chaining"". We can use optional chaining to access an existing property's value, but we can't use it to assign values to an existing property, nor to create properties w/ assignments (if the property doesn't already exist). Why not? Seems like it'd work.But it doesn't, it isn't that simple, and making it work would short-circuit all sorts of other things JS does. However, I do believe there are some JS proposals to add ""optional chaining for assignment"" to the spec. But assembly is way lower-level; it's nearly raw processor instructions.

mphrv9m,"I'm not really satisfied with other posters' answers. There are two important facts they seem to be missing:- Not accepting ""MOV AX, var"" is a quirk of your assembler. ""MOV AX, var"" works fine in my preferred assembler, [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/).- ""LEA AX, [var]"" is semantically equivalent [1] to ""MOV AX, var"" but they are actually different instructions! [2]You can prove LEA and MOV are different by looking at their binary representation (for example if you use a disassembler, or check into your assembler's command-line syntax to discover how to make a listing file). The bytes for each instruction are: 8D063412 LEA AX,[0x1234] B83412 MOV AX,0x1234My personal opinion is that your assembler sucks. If you're doing this for a class, you probably have to live with the professor's choice of tooling. For your own projects, I recommend looking into NASM. (I hear the cool people are using [yasm](https://github.com/yasm/yasm) these days, but I've never used it so I have no personal opinion on it.)Out of curiosity, what assembler are you using?[1] By ""semantically equivalent"" I mean they have the same effects on the registers and flags.[2] The reason LEA exists is to let programmers use indexed addressing modes for calculations instead of memory access. `LEA AX,[0x1234]` and `LEA AX,[BX]` are functionally equivalent to MOV instructions, but `LEA AX,[BX+DI+0x1234]` does a calculation that can't be accomplished with any other single instruction.Experimenting with LEA can be maddening if you don't understand it. That's because 16-bit LEA will only let you use certain register combinations, you can only combine one of {BX, BP} with one of {SI, DI}. (This was a hardware decision of the chip designers, and applies to all address arguments.) With 32-bit assembly in the [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386), they added a whole extra byte to the encoding of indexed addressing modes (SIB, scale-index-base). So in 32-bit 386 assembly you can use any registers, and they even added the ability to multiply one of the registers by a constant factor of 2, 4, or 8. So the 32-bit instruction `LEA EAX,[ECX+4*EDX+0x1234]` is legal, but its 16-bit equivalent `LEA AX,[CX+4*DX+0x1234]` is not.",white_nerdy,2025-04-28 15:04:13,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k9pbq1,False,

As others have pointed out, Intel has not innovated in a while.Back in the 1990s, the thoughts that Motorola would stop producing processors and innovating was absurd. The 68k CPUs drove entire generations of home consoles, not to mention oodles of commercial applications.The fact is, they couldn't keep up with Intel. That's what buried them. Now, if anything, they build ARM designs, no need to innovate. But that's also why you don't find them so prevalent in modern markets. They still do stuff, but the Motorola of the 1990s has been subdivided and chopped up more times than a tin of tomatoes. It never really recovered it's prominence in the processor world, it just makes low key devices, that's why you only sometimes see the Motorola logo gracing various products. They license a lot of it's IP. The question is, what's burying Intel? In the home markets, maybe AMD? Samsung certainly has a major edge against either company's offerings with most of Samsung's fabric being manufactured and designed with far cheaper labour than what the Americans can do. I don't doubt that in 15 years, when we want to build a new home PC, we'll be looking at NVidia and Samsung processors instead of Intel.

Even though the tool absolutely was tracking stats at the individual-level, they just said they weren't gonna use it.Everyone knew they were gonna use it.

Even a channel that you need to pay attention to, you can often treat it more like email and check in every hour or two instead of getting instant notifications.> ...unexpected urgent meetings...If it's an actual production emergency, sure.

When the market is overall doing well and people agree spending money, that Cascades down to every segment of the economy - if you spend more money at restaurants, waiters make more money, so they spend up on Hulu without ads, so SWEs at Hulu get paid more, so they buy a bigger house, and their realtor makes more money, etc.I feel like that's the logical side of the answer.Then there's seemingly just.... vibes.For like 5-10 years, every tech company got into this arms race of spending as much as possible on DS, ML, etc. Like, you couldn't be a tech company and not have an answer when the board of directors asked ""what are we doing in ML?"".I was working at a dino Fortune 500 company - not tech. And I had to put together an entire deck for my boss to tell the board what our ML strategy was. The point is, you couldn't get left behind. Even though the ROI was trash, you had to throw money at it. Most companies had no idea what they were gonna get out of it.And I feel like at some point, that broke. I think Twitter under Elon opened the floodgates - he went the opposite way (let's get rid of bloat) and to a degree it allowed every company to reset. And sure enough, every company immediately took that as an opportunity to pivot into cost savings mode - even though most of these companies are still doing great financially.So when will the job market improve?One answer is when the overall economy starts doing better. Another answer is whenever some sunset of tech companies decide they want to play offense and start spending again to try to separate themselves from the rest",dfphd,2025-04-23 01:09:08,30,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5k197,False,

mojbqka,"Outsourcing to India sucks from the US for a reason that's entirely unrelated to racism: Time zones.Collaboration sucks. Needing to ask questions during the work day is impossible. The number of times I've seen a team work for eight hours on the wrong task, or a solution that's completely unviable, is nearly equal to the number of days I've worked with Indian engineers.And there's another reason that outsourcing to India sucks: The best developers in India don't want to work under those conditions, and they don't work for $20/hour or whatever you're paying your outsourcing team members. I'm told that many of the junior developers who get hired by outsourcing companies are making $10/day, and it's blatantly obvious that they do just enough work to keep the contact live for as long as possible. None of this is even remotely racism. Put a billion people in an area that has insufficient employment opportunities and you'll find millions who are willing to learn just enough software development to be able to do a crap job in outsourcing as part of a scam to extract money from richer countries. It's human nature. It has nothing to do with their culture or the color of their skin or their accent (though extra strong accents can impede communication, and that's a real problem).Not only that, but scammers running consulting companies run them in the US as well. Several of such companies are well known as defense contractors. Remember the debacle of the Obamacare web site that had something like 50 different consulting companies working on various parts? I'd have a hard time assigning that work to fifty people much less fifty teams. And the result was a disaster.That said, at the low end of developer skill? It may very well be permanent. For the last 30 years it's been bad for lower skill developers more often than it's been good. Higher skill developers are still doing OK even now, at least if we're willing to accept lower salaries. So the question to ask yourself is what your relative skill level is. If you have always been in the bottom of your class or the slowest employee wherever you have worked, it might be best to try for a pivot.(Edits: Fixed auto complete fails)",TimMensch,2025-04-23 01:38:40,189,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5mwwc,False,

India has plenty of amazing engineers, but those engineers are actually getting their money's worth and companies won't be saving by going with them as much as the other picks.The cheaper ones that are tantalizing to companies consist of higher amounts of self-taught and bootcamp coders. They are incentivized to focus on passing the interview rather than long-term transferable skills. I'm sure some of them are good enough for the position, but that isn't always the case.With AI and vibe coding, it's never been easier for mediocre developers to pose as a higher skilled one, especially when you only work remotely. Once the companies start to smell the shit pilings of AI generated code as it starts to cost them in maintenance, we might see a recovery.

mojn42z,"I dont think this is permanent. Tbh, i may be optimistic but look throughout history. It always takes a few years to fully recover. The 2008 crash we probably didnt fully recover until like 2012 or so. The argument i always make (and i have little actual numbers or data) is that covid made everything ridiculously high. Government was giving out money like candy to any independent worker or business. People were getting money that they didnt deserve to get (some did need it). I didnt deserve a stimulus check tbh, and i got one. In 2020 everybody stayed put to their jobs because they didnt know how the future would look like so it was best to stay put. Then things open up in 2021, companies all have the money to use for hiring so companies of all shapes and sizes ar hiring. Jobs become remote and it looks like remote is the future. But what i think happened was that companies didnt realize how hard it was to hire remote workers and have them quickly learn their codebases. Jr engineers didnt have any camaraderie with their older engineers. Then the free money is gone, people arent spending as much as they did in the high time of covid, and many projects get acwd because small companies can no longer keep up after the government help ended. Bigger companies realize that they can either get a similar engineer for less money or that they overhired in 2021-22 and can fire PIPd employees quicker without having to give severance. Companies have still paused hiring for some time and because of that many people have stayed without a job. I also think potential candidates are too in love with the idea of remote work that anything less than that they are avoiding. But i applied to many jobs and sooke with many recruiters.

We came out of a huge hiring spree in 2021-22 and when things normalized it forced the market to produce mass layoffs and slowly reduce hiring. In CS there are a few types of people. There are the ones who love it with a passion, will spend 50-60 hours working each week and creating new tasks for themselves. These are the overachievers who likely will end up working st faang or will dominate their mid-level company because they are the one employee everybody goes to. There are the types who like it but dont want to spend more than 40 hours unless it’s crunch time to finish their stuff. They do what their asked and sometimes they will look for things to do to show some motivation. They will do what the role entails. Then there are the types who also kind of like it but it’s clear it’s mostly for the money. They wont overacheive but theyll try to not underperform. They wont be front and center. There is nothing wrong with being either of the 3. But id say the 3rd person should never be in a job thats too demanding because this person wont have the motivation to do it.

mp7f0ep,"I've worked at a smaller defense contractor (in comparison to Lockheed Martin, for example) and then moved to big tech. I'd say there are two primary advantages of working in defense. One is that you have better WLB as you can't really work at home with a laptop since most of your work has to be done on a clearance computer, so after your 8 hours you just check out which you can't really do at big tech because your laptop is basically expected to be always with you. The second is your job can't be outsourced and you won't be H1B'd either.The disadvantage is that your pay reflects that. Another disadvantage, although this is team based, is that the work we were doing also reflected that - we were using JavaFX in 2022. Like what. IMO, if you have on call or if your WLB is ever compromised in defense, flat out no, definitely not worth it. If you don't, it depends on what you prioritize - do you prefer better job security, but lower pay, or do you prefer less job security, higher pay? I will say that defense as a stepping stone is very good. Getting a clearance is super helpful because it's possible to leverage that into a high tech job which requires a clearance, so you have the higher pay and higher job security.",So_,2025-04-26 20:42:00,24,cscareerquestions,t3_1k8k1zh,False,

You have to actually choose to put in more work than you necessarily have to at some point.However you reach limits of what you can do without it because at a certain point your job is no longer about doing well defined widget-adjusting tasks, and furthermore this comes more suddenly than you'd think.Most of the times I've seen people flame out in this industry is because they precisely fell into this trap. They got comfortable doing simple things at lower level that didn't require curiosity and ended up digging themselves into a point where it was either psychologically or practically impossible to get up to being a ""grown up"" eng in the timeframe they needed to, because so much of what they were doing was just learning to invoke what may as well have been magic spells by rote.",OkCluejay172,2025-04-22 20:25:53,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5dvrp,False,

Do you know what you want to do specifically? If you could work anywhere and do whatever you wanted, what would it be? Even with internships on your resume, something like ""I want a job in tech. Anything is fine"" will turn off employers and your resume will go straight into the trash. Think of what interests you personally.Once you have a solid idea of what companies are ideal for you (because of the work they specialize in), you can build two things that address real problems for it. They don't have to be glamorous but it should be something you work on consistently, at least five days a week. I'll give you a made up example.

Frontend interviews (not that I've attended many of them) also seem to focus mostly on whether you understand `#selector` or what a particular React or JS construct does, and very little on how to communicate with the backend team on APIs you need.I guess my point is, if you're pure frontend, you're both viewing the world (and being viewed in) a similar light.

mohw68g,"OK, real talk, this industry is the most all over the place industry ever.There are 5 man shops that do everything by the book and have strict hiring practices and all that.Then, there's multi-billion dollar companies with thousands of employees that just YOLO their way through things.Nothing is permanent and companies come and go pretty quickly.So, just because you work helpdesk today, that does not mean that in five or ten years, you can't be an engineer.You did mention that you felt unqualified. Welcome to being a reasonable adult. You will never be ready for everything an internship or a job will throw at you. You figure it out as you go.The joke used to be ""fake it till you make it"". Not exactly true, but not exactly false either.There are things that I need to learn every week in my job and I've been doing this for close to 20 years. There's always some new change to a tool or a framework or some new thing that just go introduced, a business process than changed, new requirements from the clients, new compliance consideration, etc.If you are fully qualified, you have a boring job which is very repetitive and you should leave because that type of work will rot your brain.So, words of encouragement:1. Don't have impressive projects? Well, do something about that. Make something. All the tools are free at this point. The only thing holding you back is you. Don't know how to do something? Learn it and then use it.2. The job market is rough, but if you keep at it, make a reasonable plan that lets you have a roof over your head and food in your belly while you search, you will be OK in the long term.

It's analogous to civil vs electrical, they have some surface level commonalities early on but you have to fully commit to one in order to achieve a minimally employable skillset (and then commit to some amount of effort again if you're going to switch).Within SWE, there's a lot of variance, from the super-competitive big techs of the world to startups that are hungry for scrappy go-getters to ""boring"" F500 industries to the consulting world. Some don't even do DSA questions. Some don't even have recruiters.

In all of my recent interviews, nobody came close to starting me at $20 per hour. Even for a position I would deem mid-level, the starting pay was $18 for an “expert”.It seems like part of the market is filled with companies looking to hire talent at slave level pay, and there is talent willing to take that because some money is better than no money at all.While I would love to believe that everybody in the west is making bank bank, I know thats not really the true story.Another ugly truth people in this sub like to pretend doesn’t exist is 98% of people working in tech atm are being paid well below a salary one can live on independently. 1% have a livable salary.0.5% have a 6 figure salary.I don’t have enough YOE yet to be considered mid/senior level.

moq0kln,"are you checking r/ExperiencedDevs ? I have 2 Bay Area centered 10 YOE friends who got jobs both through LinkedIn reach out from recruiters. They spent months and didn't have as much luck in beginning of 2024 in doing the cold applications. They've had more luck during the end of 2024, though one moved to NYC. Both based in the Bay. One hired an ex-FAANG recruiter who was a resume writer but basically they both filled in their linkedins and got premium and connected with as many recruiters as they could to start the process, sent some cold messages. Basically SEO gaming to show up higher on a recruiters radius. I think they were averaging between LinkedIn big company applications and startups on Wellfound about 1/50 call backs per application. This included top companies not just FAANG and local + hybrid positions not just remote. Focused on the Bay Area geographically but NYC as well for one of them. One is a former .Net dev the whole time and the other was an embedded systems/C++ developer for half their career, then Data Science focused developer the other half. They both did around 6 months of cold applications, one did maybe 100 since they wanted to make their own cover letters and the other did about 300. Both non FAANG but F500 company SWEs. One BS in CS and one BS in ME, no MS nothing else extra. Some side hobby projects on their Github but apparently no one has looked at those. The both got full time positions again in F500 companies, one as a senior SWE and one as a staff level SWE. So I'm not saying that you don't get call backs from cold applications and you're doing the right thing with applying as soon as possible, but I think your geographic region matters a lot too. A lot of it is just luck. The numbers are insane. We're into a new presidency and past Q1 2025 so things might be looking different in terms of effective advice compared to even 2023 - 2024 which were both brutal for the SWE market. While you do cold applications, polish your LinkedIn profile, increase you SEO with recruiters. You don't need to pay anyone for that, I think the various job search subreddits have a lot of LinkedIn tips all for free. You just need to pay for LinkedIn Premium. I'm averaging 1/100 ratio of applications to call backs as a data engineering applicant with 2 YOE of direct DE experience, though on prem and I'm working with a huge gap of almost 18 months. I only use cover letters on applications to startups on Wellfound or YComb jobs. Otherwise I've just been submitting without a coverletter following the advice posted on r/EngineeringResumes for working on my resume using their wiki and template. I've applied to around 400 jobs, almost all of them directly through the HR portals of the company but a few through easy apply because I saw someone on reddit say it worked for them, totally by chance. I've applied for mostly on site or hybrid positions in most of the major geographic regions of the US. I've had recruiters reach out on linkedin, after I changed my LinkedIn seeing their success. 2 actually, for contract work but better than nothing and if my shitty profile can get it then there's hope for others with even some experience. Also not to shill for a service but to really maximize the cold applications I used hiring cafe because the Job Title + multiple Geo region search was a bigger time saver compared to LinkedIn and just opening all the jobs in new tabs and working through each one, one by one.
