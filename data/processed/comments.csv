nlgugf7,"A few of the other comments hit reasons why you would do partitioning, but there's a common underlying mechanism for it.Partitioning allows you to do isolated operations on a lake table, so that you can limit an operation that works on 'all' the data to only work on a single partition, or allow multiple otherwise conflicting operations to run concurrently on different partitions, or both.Z-Ordering inherently adjusts the ordering of data across files so that file skipping mechanics work better. It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.The same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.But that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning.

Instead of physically co-locate files to nested folders (partitions) it just mark in a metadata that ""this parquet file is related to cluster (partition) X"" in a corresponding metadata JSON-file. This is not my understanding. Liquid clustering, and clustering in general, is about how the data is physically written in a specific order in a file. It's not just metadata (although there are). If your clustering keys change, then the files do need to be rewritten. (Edit: to benefit from the new clustering. But Databricks actually allows keeping old files with a previous clustering, see reply.)Please let me know if you have a source stating otherwise or if I misunderstood your comment.The difference between liquid clustering and simple clustering, is that liquid clustering is dynamic based on the access pattern statistics. If your access pattern is shifting, the optimizer will decide at some point that it is worth it to rewrite some files to reduce cost. This dynamic aspect is great, but it may also create new unexpected costs.

The China team was very effective despite the time difference, the India team was not (and frankly, the competency gap was embarrassingly stark).This resulted in a ""snap-back"" in jobs that there offshored back to locations in NA (the US specifically). Essentially, almost all offshored employees were laid off, and all contracts canceled.The business argument that was made was basically: ""It costs almost as much to employ Chinese DEs as in the US, with comparable competency levels, but a timezone gap issue. Meanwhile, we can employ 2-3 Indian employees/contractors for the cost of one competent US employee, but not only is there a timezone gap, there are seemingly a ton of communication issues, like sudden unannounced PTO/Holidays taken during product launches for example, and even when you can reach them, you're lucky if even 1 of these employees can write basic SQL code.""The result was a much more robust vetting of US based employees, including several rounds of technical interviews, and thorough background checks...Edit to add context: The hiring practices when offshoring to India were pathetically lackadaisical.Basically, the process was: Recruiter: ""Do you know SQL?"" Candidate: ""Yes"" Recruiter: ""Are you willing to work for peanuts? (~30-40% of US-based DE)"" Candidate: ""Yes"" Recruiter: ""You're hired!"" Candidate: ""Yes"" Recruiter: ""Great!

Our latest Sail 0.4 release introduces native Apache Iceberg support and provides major architectural improvements to Delta Lake execution. The release also lays the foundation for distributed DML operations across open data formats and marks a key step toward Sail’s goal of a fully unified lakehouse engine.# What is Sail?Sail is an open-source, Rust-native, multimodal computation framework which includes drop-in replacement compatibility for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built from the ground up in Rust, Sail runs \~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by up to 94%. Our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads all in one compute engine.# What’s New in Sail 0.4* **Native Apache Iceberg integration:** Iceberg tables now run directly inside Sail’s Rust-based query engine for a unified experience across open data formats.* **Added support for the Iceberg Catalog REST API**, including **Polaris** and **R2 Catalog**, enabling connectivity to standard Iceberg catalog backends.* **Reengineered Delta Lake integration:** Delta operations have been refactored into modular nodes for scanning, writing, and committing, enabling more advanced DML operations.* **Shared abstractions across Iceberg and Delta Lake:** A common foundation that paves the way for a unified, format-agnostic lakehouse architecture.# Join the Slack CommunityWe invite anyone whose interested to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and get involved on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail)! Whether you’re exploring Sail for the first time, migrating workloads, or contributing code, here you can collaborate, ask questions, and help shape the future of data infra.Check out the full release post here → [https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/)Would love to hear your thoughts!",lake_sail,2025-10-29 19:49:32,6,dataengineering,t3_1ojemmf,True,

nmf2dr5,"As a general rule, you want to have at least:- A clear area where data coming from the sources lands with as little changes as possible. That serves as some subset of a basis for downstream transformation, a storage to replay history, evidence for reconciliation if you need it, decoupling from the sources. This is called bronze in a medallion architecture - A clear area where you have data that has been validated for quality and consistency across sources, with as little detail as possible lost. This serves as the source of data for more comolex/aggregated reports/analyses, feeds your ML models (if you have them), offers consistency across different domains for general business rules for derivation data (when it applies across the board and at a granular level) and is overall the ""single source of truth"" for all your data platform. This is called Silver in the medallion architecture- A number of schemas serving specific business applications/domains/data products, with heavy transformation (often aggregation) to fit the specific requirements of each, also optimized for performance for specific access patterns and tools. This is what most users will ever see. In the medallion architecture, this is called gold.The 3 layers above are pretty much the standard and have been so even before the name medallion architecture came along. I remember calling them staging/ODS, DW and Data Marts over 25 years ago.Besides these 3,there can be a number of intermediate structures to help the data engineering processes integrating them. These intermediate layers are more specific to each case, and may not have nearly as much persistence. I have seen designs where I could count 7 layers, and I guess there may be more in some places. But most places will have at least the 3 I named.It's also not unusual to have a one or more lookup, control and Metadata layers, but these are more support for the platform than actual data layers (some people will disagree).I have also seen cases where some of the 3 basic layers was skipped, but that makes it harder to manage things after a certain size.

nm1hxhj,"I'll comment from a Snowflake perspective on the numbered points you raised ...1. Snowflake have recently released OpenFlow but it has a limited number of connectors, so may not meet your needs. People generally use tools such as Fivetran to pull data from source systems and push it into Snowflake, or they have some process that writes source data to cloud storage where Snowflake can load it (using COPY INTO... commands)2. Straightforward to transform data using SQL (normally wrapped in a Stored Proc if you're building pipelines). A lot of people use dbt for transformations and Snowflake have recently released the ability to run dbt within Snowflake. If you really want to go down the low/no code route, have a look at [coalesce.io](http://coalesce.io)3. If your analysts can write SQL then they should be fine. You can also write/run SQL in VS Code if you want to (and probably in other tools too)4. Not sure how this differs from your point 1?5. Snowflake can probably do all this; depends on your precise requirements6. Depends on your definition of ""seamless"" but making Snowflake a datasource for PowerBI is pretty trivial7. Snowflake allows you to keep data within Snowflake or externally (Iceberg and external tables). It also separates storage and compute so you can scale the compute power you want to use for running a query independently of the data being queried, and this happens almost instantaneously.

I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)).

General dev pods for engineers/devs/datascientists 100 GB NIC. Use case is a bunch of image processing some machine learning . 7 servers 6 compute with storage in and 1 GPU node might expand to more depending. Most work isn't LLMs but Machinelearning and Vision.

DLT is another great python library to add in for easier ingestion. Don't use SCD unless you are dealing with a volume of data that demands it.

nlisgpa,"1. ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc. But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow: * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up). * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI. * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there. * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)). * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",TJaniF,2025-10-26 18:51:14,2,dataengineering,t3_1ogop8w,False,

nme1049,"Hi, as mentioned in my post, I'm actually using excel for this work now, but problem is, it is now a monolithic mess, and its already biting me in the ass a few times,let me give you one of the example, about the attendance problem that I said in my post.I made a formula that can count how many weeks have passed since the day a student joined the class, and then from there, it can calculate how many sessions have they spent joining the class up until today.Works fine and all, except there's a few bugs, like what if they took an absent and asked for leave? I can't find a way for that except just making a long list of notes on when they took a leave, and then adding back the number of sessions they took a leave. It is a mess. After all that mess, my manager still wanted me to also keep track of transactions in the monolithic spreadsheet. Well, that's the bell for me, I need to make this right. Haha.And then I also need to synchronize this excel sheet to an external spreadsheet for my sales team, and my company is a bit warry of google, so they don't want me to completely upload everything on there, I then need to manually select them, copy them, and make sure I don't copy the wrong stuff, and it's hard to synchronize the data if sales team managed to change some of it.

Then you can use a couple different techniques. You can use something like minhash lsh if you have lots names you need to dedupe. Whether or not you use that, you’ll need to match names in a way that discounts common words and prioritizes uncommon words. Most distance metrics don’t work well for this because you’ll get really high values for names that aren’t actually that close. For example, using Levenshtein distance “apple corporation” and “Snapple corporation” (different companies) are very close, but “Bernstein Partnership, LTD” and “Bernstein” (same company) are not. You can look at various text vectorization models on huggingface that should be able to account for the fact that “corporation” is basically meaningless while “Snapple” is significant. If you have enough data you may even be able to just use tf-idf.If you want you can then lay on hierarchical clustering or just use a score cutoff.Last, you’ll probably want this wrapped up with some kind of feedback mechanism so you can make a lookup table to unify known alternatives over time.

nlykida,"I've done something similar at a previous job at scale in the health tech space. I had a dataset in the hundreds of millions of rows with fields of of text for medical notes where I had to identify specific key terms related to specific medical codes (eg ""Used X medical device to do Y procedure.""). The problem is that this wasn't just for one hospital, this dataset captured 80% of hospitals in the US, and all have their unique implementation of medical records.Where to start:1. You have to understand the business logic and what a ""meaningful"" match entails. This was especially true in medicine where I had to coordinate with doctors employed by the startup.2. Create regex for each form of business logic and validate that it accurately matches data for samples. You will quickly start seeing edge cases (note them, but don't optimize for them yet).3. Create a script to apply the business logic and regex matching, then run it on a sample of data if the data is large (in my case it was the difference between running in 30s vs 3hrs). 4. Apply the script to your dataset (or sample) where you only count how many times a separate piece of regex matched with a row. You can then quickly see your coverage (ie match count greater than 0) and where your logic could be wrong (ie match count greater than 1).5. Determine what level of coverage and accuracy is needed for your stakeholders (they will always say ""as much as possible"" to which you respond with time/effort tradeoffs). Since I was in medical, it had to be high, but a lower threshold could suffice.6. Take a new sample of the data (about 1k records) and manually label them with what they should match with. Then apply your script to the sample and determine your accuracy. I often represent this as a confusion matrix (my background was data sci before eng). Id often pull in some of my colleagues to help with the labeling if we all benefit from the data asset.You now have levers for coverage and accuracy, iterate on your regex logic script until you meet the requirements of your stakeholders. Bonus, if it's a huge success, you now also have direct metrics for employee reviews/resume.Please note that this was back in 2020.

nmamuo2,"Assuming the data is a time series and query range is unpredictable a single shard with more replicas would be best. The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.If you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.Bottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.And finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes.

nm3htt3,"I’ve been in this exact bind with locked-down Oracle. A few things that usually de-frag it: build a true idempotent landing in Postgres first, then let dbt do the modeling. In Go, upsert into a raw schema with a unique constraint on a surrogate key like sha1(coalesce(key1,'') || '|' || coalesce(key2,'')); that kills dupes at the door and makes retries safe. For historicals, don’t chase “active only” upstream land everything and model “active” as an attribute. In dbt, use snapshots (Type 2) with unique\_key = that surrogate and check\_cols='all'; you’ll get valid\_from/valid\_to/is\_current without depending on Oracle MVs. For incrementals from Oracle when you can’t do CDC, keep a high-watermark table in Postgres (last seen version or updated\_at), and also compute a row hash; diff by hash to catch silent changes.

Then use `is_active` as a flag in the dimension to mark current vs historical rows. But I need clarification: should `is_active` live in the dimension table itself, or should I create a separate `fact_active_jobs` table and build off that?**On CDC and row versions:**Right now I'm pulling from an Oracle view that filters the ERP's fact table down to active jobs only—but that fact table has no `rowversion`. Should I (A) remove the filters at the view level and hash the full fact table as-is, or (B) go down to the base tables, use their `rowversion`, and rebuild the fact tables from scratch in dbt?Also, on the `is_active` dimension question: should that column live in the dimension table itself, or do I need a separate structure?**On soft-deleting dimensions:** I thought dimensions were supposed to maintain unbroken history by their nature. Wouldn't adding `is_active` and deleting rows break the sequence? And isn't it the fact table's job to differentiate active vs inactive in reports?**On dbt and orchestration:**1. I have IntelliJ—should I stick with that or move to VS Code + SQLTools like you suggested?2. Should I consider sqlmesh instead of dbt?3.

nmii5rn,">use string functions to extract values then arightematic('arithmetic')Agreeing with the other reply - this would be the 'good' way to do it in a real-world business situation, in my opinion.In real-world situations you don't get the choice of what data is given to you, and you won't be getting informed when new data is added. So you want to choose approaches that work for the data as it is today AND will continue to work as the data changes in the future, without you ever examining the data again later.You should have a test somewhere that all the data conforms to a general pattern of ""number + text"", then extract the number part and convert it to a database numeric type (integer or decimal, as required). Separately extract the text part, to another next column. You will then need to hard code the SI prefixes to factors: K means x1000, m means x0.001, M means x1000000, and so on. But these are a universal system worldwide, and there are only so many possible values. You should capture these in a data table that you reference or join to, rather than in code.Then do arithmetic using the numeric part as you were thinking.Hard coding would break if the data changes later once this process is in production and you've moved into a different project. Just looking at the top 10 values is based on how the data is now: a different unit might be in the top 10 next month or next year. So again, it's a fragile approach.

nmdgiyu,"Totally valid. You're probably seeing a few things here. The first is abstraction. Professional code bases use services and third-party libraries for a lot of their functionality, so you have to use your IDE to find those and figure out what they do. If it's a third party library, you might have to check their documentation to figure it out. They may also be using more advanced programming concepts and design patterns, and if you haven't seen those before they might give you some WTF moments. They're also most likely using dependency injection, which again might reference third-party libraries. But what you're doing in trying to read those codebases is a great idea. My advice is to get help from AI. Ask Copilot or Claude specific questions like ""Give me a detailed breakdown of what this class does"" or ""explain line 149 to me."" I've been coding professionally for ten years and I still ask questions like that. It's very helpful. In my opinion, it's actually the *most* helpful thing that AI does. If AI tells you something is a library, go look it up and see what it does. If AI tells you something like ""this class uses a singleton pattern to do x"" you can follow up with ""what the heck is a Singleton?""If the code inherits from something else, trace it back. It's not always super important to know exactly how the parent class works, but it's good to know what it does at a high level. Again, AI is very helpful for this sort of thing.Navigating codebases and figuring out what they do is a core skill for developers. You'll spend a lot of time doing that in your career. If you're talking about an Enterprise code base, it can take months to get fully comfortable with it.

Then I start drawing or creating a map of the code flow. I'll usually start with listing classes/methods (it works in my environment) and essentially making a class map, but for methods. What parameters, can I quickly guess what it does by the name or the code? What does it return? And then I get any methods or objects that method creates or calls. I work down that list. Essentially figuring out where I am in the web of function and method calls. As far as reading the individual methods, I literally rewrite it into ""make a PB&J sandwich steps"" like this:If my pseudocode looks like this: int[] myMethod(int pAddToI,obj thing){ int[] retArr; for(i=0;i<thing.size;i++){ retArr[i]=i+pAddToI; } return retArr; }I might write:**Function: myMethod** ?Creates an array of integers based on size of object**Params:****Integer pAddToI**: number to add to i, **object thing**: object with a size.**Returns:** Integer array**Process**: 1) Creates a integer array for return2) Loops over i thing.size times, adding pAddToI to i, and putting it in the retArr at i. 3) Returns retArr---------If there's any steps or symbols or syntax I don't understand, I *stop*, look it up.

But step by step, I learn the new (or probably 40 year old) thing, and once it's written down, I now have my own reference for what that does.I usually keep all this in a Obsidian notebook, and I create links between the methods, so as methods are called between on another it's easy to click and follow the process. I also have a custom template that has some JS Code that uses custom ""Calls"" and ""CalledBy"" properties of the markdown files to build me a call flow diagram of each method. I can quickly see who it calls, and who it's called by, up to 5 levels of grandparents. My real notes are much more detailed, and will often contain a ""model"" of the objects given an example starting point (like values sent into the API). The benefit to doing this is by the time you're done you've got well written technical documentation for whoever is modifying the code (even you) and you can build a good understanding of potential errors in the code.

The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.Reverse proxy servers can perform so called ""TLS termination"", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS.

nm34buk,"> So I decided to build something, and http server in c++This is an excellent exercise and perfect for your academic level.> I know nothing about network programming, sockets or even portsYou don't need to know shit about any of this.HTTP is a text protocol. That makes it REAL simple... And - as it happens, standard streams are text streams. It's a marriage like it was meant to be.This means you implement the HTTP protocol: namespace methods { class GET; class POST; class PUT; class PATCH; class DELETE; class HEAD; class OPTIONS; class CONNECT; class TRACE; using method = std::variant; }I'll let you fill those out in detail, but I'm going to still jump around to get to my point.Next you need a request and a response type: namespace messages { class request: method { /* an incoming request is implemented in terms of one of the HTTP methods */}; class response; }Now here's where we're REALLY going to build on some of the magic: class request { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &); }; class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };Barring the rest of the class details, you need these functions. Now when it comes to the request, you'll start parsing the incoming text stream until you get the HTTP method, and then you know which method type above to instantiate. Then your method types implement their own stream extractors, and THEY extract their own bits. So understand that transport protocols tend to have enumerations - whether they're numbers or text tags, doesn't matter. We don't need a data field to store the method, we can translate that into a C++ User Defined Type. The enumeration of all the methods? That's implied by our type instance stored in the variant. That's you enumeration! We've enumerated the method types with actual types!I'm droning on about that because you wouldn't believe how much code I end up seeing where people read data out of a source and plug it right into a runtime data field. Wholly unnecessary and missing the point.But this means that all your IO is over text, and it's over streams, and your types work with ANY stream, including... `std::cin` and `std::cout`.See, you don't have to know shit about networking because you don't have to write any of it. C++ is a systems software language, you're expected to make systems of software, not these gigantic monoliths. The desktop and the GUI is not the operating system, an operating system is a system of software FOR YOU - THE ENGINEER. You make this one part that can extract and then insert HTTP, and then you can combine it with other software to do the networking and the encryption. > nc -l 8080 -c your_serverSo now when a request comes in on port 8080, an instance of your program will launch, and all TCP IO will be redirected through `std::cin` and `std::cout`. Your program doesn't know, doesn't care.You want that shit encrypted? > nc -l 8080 -c 'stunnel | your_server'It's a bit more than that, but it's the basic premise. It's why unencrypted HTTP is default port 80 and encrypted HTTPS is default port 443.As for servicing the request, you've got a variant, which means your handler is a visitor, and of course you can make a visitor that can dispatch to different handlers for each type. You can initially make a catchall visitor that always returns a 501 - not implemented. If you can hit your server with your browser and get a 501, that's not nothing, that's something - proof that your server actually worked and talked HTTP with your browser. Remember, a response is going to be in text!So now all you have to do is read the HTTP standard and figure out the nature of the protocol. Are fields fixed or floating? That is to say, are they order and formatting specific, or can fields be anywhere in the message payload? Which ones are optional and which are mandatory? You know - I'll give you another hint, that URL and RESTful resources LOOK like a file path for a very good reason... You can also deliver binary payloads, but I'll let you figure that one out, and it's also common to base64 encode content because it turns binary into text to get past some of the text fuckery that is assumed by the protocol and implementation, like how line feeds and carriage returns get mangled.Continued...",mredding,2025-10-29 21:53:21,9,learnprogramming,t3_1oj1nr8,False,

Then wouldn't you want to test that it works? You could easily have a bug in your code. What if it works most of the time but fails for small numbers? What if it crashes if you give it a negative number?Unit tests can be useful for this sort of thing - trying a wide range of inputs to a function to ensure it works correctly.As far as where to put them, the standard practice is to make them part of the same repository and to make an easy way to run all of your tests. The idea is that every time you change your code, you run all of your tests and make sure you didn't break anything.So that brings up the second value of unit tests - they catch future problems.

You could rewrite your square root function and then re-run the unit tests to make sure it still gives the correct answer.There's no rule for how many tests you need, but one goal that a lot of people strive for is to cover every line of code with at least one test. So if your function has an ""if"" statement in it at the top level, you'd need at a minimum two tests to cover it - one test that covers the true branch, and one test that covers the false branch.There are tools that will run your tests and tell you exactly which lines were and weren't covered by tests.Finally, as to what to test, unit tests are generally for testing individual functions. A good rule of thumb is to test all of the public interface of any class. So if there are some helper functions inside of a file that can't be called from anywhere else, you don't have to test those, but you should test whatever public functions or methods other parts of your code might be able to call.Testing systems is also a good idea, but then they're not called unit tests, they're called something else, like integration tests. They tend to have different tradeoffs, like they're usually slower so you can't have as many of them, and you might care more about the tests being robust than them being comprehensive.",dmazzoni,2025-10-29 06:24:32,76,learnprogramming,t3_1oiwnd1,False,
nlytw0w,"Looking at your example specifically, A square root function could have plenty of side effects you’d want to test, and they may not be related to the math. Like logging abnormal inputs. If you replace your logging provider 3 years from now, you may forget about the log message until it breaks. Unit tests help catch that, if you have a test ensuring a log message is written properly. All of the following questions could be behavior you want to test so a) you know it’s working as designed, and b) you know it continues to work every time you run the tests.- depending on how strict the type system is for your language, what happens when the user enters “fish” or the string “42”, rather than the number 42?- What if the user provides a negative number - how do you want to handle that? Do you check the input before the calculation and exit gracefully? Or attempt it anyway?- Do you support the imaginary portion, or do you throw an exception? - What exception do you throw, and what is the message?- you may want to know if the input was abnormal or caused an error, do you have logging? You can unit test that a log message was emitted. - what happens when you provide 0? Or the largest input number? Or the smallest input number.- does it handle fractions correctly?- if it’s a sensitive calculation, you may care about the precision of the result - is that correct?",TzarBog,2025-10-29 06:49:17,9,learnprogramming,t3_1oiwnd1,False,

nlz8mnu,"Lot's of good answers on the technical implementation but I think some things were left unanswered.1. How many people are working on the code2. What is the domainIf you are working on your own you can think more greedily about your own productivity. For example, only create tests when you start developing something and you know it's going to be annoying to test manually (like someone mentioned, a reimplementation of calculating a square root). Another good point to write some tests is before a big refactor.Once there are more people working on the project it makes sense to add tests to provide some stability to the project. Most contributors are not able to test a project comprehensively, often code lacks the proper data to test the program, and tests can provide that. In general, a small team of experienced developers can work with less tests, only adding tests were it truly makes development easier. Once you go into bigger organizations or open source you will need more tests, because there is going to be people whose main task is to review and merge code and their life is made so much easier with tests.Second, what is the project? I've seen application UI code has usually less tests because a lot of the output is visual. Sure there are some methods like monitoring visuals changes, or component libraries where you can click though individual components. Something as simple as just checking all components render can be a good enough test. But in general the passing test for UI is that it looks good and is usable, and that needs more often than not some manual testing anyway.Data processing oriented code, infrastructure code, and code that has difficult inputs or outputs on the other hand rely more on tests. Like how are you ""manually"" going to test that some data objects coming through your kafka stream are processed correctly so they can be sent to the database? The whole premise just asks for some kind of programmatical test.While 100% code coverage can be good, it is not the ultimate milestone. You can have 100% code coverage but still you are not handling some cases correctly and have bugs in your code.",Independent-Fig6042,2025-10-29 09:21:40,6,learnprogramming,t3_1oiwnd1,False,

A thing I like to do is make asserts or early returns specifically to break tests if my assumptions about the world has changed going into the function.Once you have real world data (reported bugs by users) you need to add additional tests to make sure those cases are covered as well.",brand_new_potato,2025-10-29 06:21:18,5,learnprogramming,t3_1oiwnd1,False,
nlyri37,">For example if you have a function that calculates the square root of a number, it's quite easy to unit test. But is that really necessary?Well you know its supposed to calculate the square root of a number, someone else might see the function and think it just devides by 3 because they put in 9 and 3 came out but now they put in 16 and it doesnt work so they ""fix"" the function so it devides by 3. Ofcourse this a rediculous example but in the real world even a lot of short and easy to write functions dont have a super obvious expected output and sometimes multiple outputs are equally possible but you this case needs one and another case needs another output. So you write a unittest to make sure if someone changes the function to fit their usecase they see that something else now is broken.>What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?Well again simple to understand/debug/modify code doesnt equal just one possible expected output.>And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.Thats something each dev or each team needs to decide on their own and depends on the projekt. Think about what happens if that piece of code fails and how likely it is to fail. If the code fails and people die you wanna absolutly test as much as you can. If you are using that code to turn on an LED on a personal project well no cares if it fails. For me personaly on the current project the goal is to have atleast a unittest so that every piece of code is atleast called once. So if you have an if somewhere in there (that depends on the input) you need two write two unittests so that both sides are called. >Finally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?Per function is absolutly a viable option. if you know each function gives the expected output and your code is deterministic (which it should be) your code should pretty much never fail.

It simply boxes in the solution, leaving as little place for bugs as possible (but we’re only human).In some sense the tests are more important than the solution.

She'd made some really fun stuff in Scratch, with graphics she drew herself, but there's quite a bit more to programming than dragging little boxes around.

nmloj40,"Well I don't know what things are like now or will be like two years from now... I'll say that I learned both C++ and Java in college and nobody ever paid me to code in either of them, instead, all of my jobs were in languages that weren't taught in my colleges at all. While I can't see the future and advice is a dangerous thing, there's a good chance that you could learn C++ now and get a job in Java later or learn Java now and get a job in C++ later. Or learn both now and get a job using some other language later. Or learn both now and get a job using both later.Again, though, I learned those languages a quarter of a century ago and I don't know what things are like today. It was fun to learn both of them.Another thing I will say from my own experience... without actually doing a specific type of coding as a job it was hard for me to predict what I would or wouldn't like. Most coding I found enjoyable even if I assumed I wouldn't before-hand. So perhaps you would love being a backend engineer. For me, it was very hard to predict. I had to work on real projects with real people to actually know what I liked. I'm not sure if that will be the same experience for you or not or how common that is with others.I do get that there's jobs that will have requirements like ""Minimum years experience with "" and I can get why one would want to pick the ""right"" language as a result. I don't really agree with these requirements as a good C++ programmer should be able to be productive in Java in a week and rather proficient in a month and (mostly) vice-versa. I don't feel like you're ever really more than a couple months behind if you pick the ""wrong"" stuff to learn with.So, those are my thoughts. If you are enjoying C++, I really can't make an argument for you to not learn C++. Or just learn both at the same time. Personally, I feel like I got more out of learning Java than C++. This is because I already knew C and so learning low-level stuff wasn't as crucial for me, and I felt like the types of software-engineering challenges I personally like revolve more around managing domain complexity in which case a higher-level language lets me be a bit more focused on the stuff I like. But you could be the opposite. Only you can really know.I will also say... and maybe I'm wrong about this expectation... but I feel like university students, at least by the 2nd year, should probably be able to learn any language necessary on their own quickly without it being the main focus of a course (maybe I'm wrong about this, though.) Meaning, at that point, the language is irrelevant and not what the teacher is actually trying to teach. It's just a vessel for teaching the real lessons. I think one has to get past the language-learning part and into the deeper software-engineering challenges and other concepts at play. Not the syntax/mechanics of a specific programming language. I think learning programming languages themselves is something you should just be able to do rather quickly as-needed/desired. Along those lines, if the question is... I can take a CS course taught by teacher A using language X, or the same exact course but by teacher B using language Y, I really don't think it matters that much to be honest. If X and Y are Java and C++ then just pick C++ if you predict it will make the class more enjoyable. Whether teacher A is better at teaching than teacher B is probably more important, actually. But, I think there's a good chance you might learn the actual lessons of the course better using Java than C++ so if you really can't make up your mind I suppose I would recommend Java for that reason but my suspicion is that I don't think it will matter much in the grand scheme of things and that it's not as crucial of a decision as it seems to be at the moment.Not sure if good advice but that's my experience with this stuff.",azimux,2025-11-01 21:45:03,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ojx0op,False,

nmax52e,"Something that helped me when I first learned recursion, and still helps me even now when I understand it (and I really like recursion, it’s fun) is to pretend your function already works. So to take your factorial number, what is 7! ? It’s 7 * 6!. n! = n * (n-1)! So when writing that, (the following is pseudocode)def factorial(int n):return n * factorial(n-1)Now, factorials only work for positive numbers, so put an if statement in there at the beginning to make sure n > 0. And also, we want to stop the recursion once n = 1 (or 0). Essentially, we don’t want to multiply 0 to our return stack. So either if n=1: return 1, or you could also do if n=0: return 1, cause it doesn’t matter how many 1s you multiply to it. That’s the base case. It’s the case that you don’t call the function, thus ending the recursion and letting the whole stack catch up. You usually put the base case above the rest of it, because most of the time, you hit a return statement, it auto exits the function, put you could have the recursive part in an else block.

nmbvkfo,"A lot of the time, I find refactoring a solution really valuable. By either eliminating distractions or drilling down into the details, I can often cross the intuition gap.Using recursion as an example, let's say that I've seen the code```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```So, let's analyze: I can see exactly what happens when `$n == 1` and `$n == 2`. The default case, however, recurses, and it's not clear what that means. I can do a refactoring, making the code worse in order to look at it in more detail. For example, I can add the `$n == 3` case explicitly:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```Since I've already determined what `fib(1)` and `fib(2)` are, I now know exactly what happens with `fib(3)`.And I can keep doing this, substituting the value of subexpressions into cases to see how the expansion would work. By the time I'm at `fib(6)`, that expansion looks like this:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } when 4 { return (fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2) } # fib(3) + fib(2) when 5 { return ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1)) } # fib(4) + fib(3) when 6 { return (((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))) + ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) } # fib(5) + fib(4) default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```By making what each recursive call does explicit, I can see the relationship between the last line and the lines before it. And I can see that in every case, the subexpressions are simpler than the overall expression and lead inevitably to the base cases.Anyway. That's one technique. Might work for you, might not.

Your job prospects would be very different.Generally it isn’t super recommended to do a bachelors in data science because you’ll be better served with a data science minor and say a stats degree. A lot of institutions only offer a minor in data science for this reason.Computer science is a very general degree that acts as a framework for you to go into anything in tech. The elective classes you take, projects you do, and internships all determine what you do as a career. That could be cyber security, software engineering, or even data analysis. Yes there is overlap between the two fields but data science is super stats focused while computer science is math focused. Since it’s so general a CS grad can totally become a data analyst or do a masters in data science if they take the right electives. A data science grad could not do the work of a CS grad just because there’s so much fundamental knowledge that is not covered. In DSCI you’ll barely touch programming outside of maybe a first year intro class let alone any computer theory.To go into anything machine learning you’ll need either a masters in data science or an extensive resume. So this Data Science and AI degree would really set you up poorly unless you plan on going right into grad school. The CS degree will be harder but it will set you up better. I just have to make it super clear that a company hiring for a CS position would 100% reject someone with a Data Science degree, they’re just different things. Keep in mind the job market for CS grads is fucked right now but that applies to data science too so given your age you might want to reconsider. I’m not trying to discourage you from CS, I’m a CS student myself, you just have less time to wait around for that six figure job.

All docker does is containerize individual processes. You can use either your own docker “images” or install them from docker.io or other registry. Images are basically just scripts to run the application. Kubernetes is a lot more complicated to understand but it gets pretty easy once you get to the heart of it. Services are what matter in kubernetes. They take the containerized application and assign an id to them. Since kubernetes deals with multiple ports if you were to handle it traditionally you would have to manually allocate ports to reroute traffic, however services work to reroute the traffic automatically to the assigned port of your application.

Without the link step, every little bit of code must be compiled each time a change is made to any part of the program. This can be a time consuming process even today, but back in the day they could measure this in hours and days, rather than seconds or minutes.To reduce the time needed for recompiling library code that hasn't actually changed, they invented the concept of relocatable code, that is code that only requires minor alterations before it can be placed anywhere in memory (and therefore anywhere in the output file). Those minor alterations are the *entry points*, typically functions and other things that the library exposes in order to be useful. All you need as a caller is to know their names/signatures, which is why these are placed in a header file that you #include in your program. The compiler then knows the names and can verify you are using them correctly, but doesn't have to care about how they are defined.The linker then takes your compiled code and figures out (by size) exactly where each piece fits, then changes all the necessary addresses so whenever you call a specific funtion, you actually call the correct address. In order to do this, the linker needs to know what object file(s) each of those header files were for. You see, in their infinite wisdom, the people who created this concept forgot that it would probably have been a good idea to either keep the name of the necessary library files *in the header file* somewhere.

You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?When you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.I'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.So when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is ""yes"", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you ""know"", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.Once you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.Watch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.So focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore.

nlszwh6,"I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.There are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:The code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.On the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.This in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.Lastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. Code has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",aanzeijar,2025-10-28 10:33:19,2,learnprogramming,t3_1oi54ny,False,

The bigger the steps, the more likely it is to fail, so ideally you have a CI/CD approach where you can just make small commits and daily pushes and slowly things switch over.Then you execute.Sometimes this approach doesn't work because you're building a whole new stack with different tech. In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over. For example, you might start by implementing one use case on the new stack, then divert calls for some test users to it. If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved. Then you add another use case, rinse, repeat until done.You also want to have a good experiment / feature framework for this. This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack: if (ENABLE_X_THING) { return // result from new stack } return // result from existing codeTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.So now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.After you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",severoon,2025-10-30 19:32:09,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ojukgn,False,

nlskwrd,"I'll just echo what others have said. If you already know the basics of writing code, find a problem you think is small enough that you can complete it, and then do it. I would strongly advice to NOT find random tutorials, walkthroughs etc. to help you with this. The main skills you want to accomplish solving these problems goes (IMO) something like this:1. Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of ""create a program that does X, Y, Z"" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand. 2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself. 3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of ""I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so"".Of course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good. But you need to ensure that actually writing, debugging, testing code is the main part of what you spend your time on. I would suggest only reading for an explicit aim in solving something you are currently working on for the foreseeable future. It is very easy to fall into the trap of reading instead of doing and then thinking that you're becoming better book by book.

Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. 3. I don't know what you mean by ""completely""? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql ""completely"" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. 4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. 6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. 7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. 8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. 9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity!

When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on.

nm82gev,"The API is how programs make requests to each other. You usually don’t want to expose your program’s internal logic to outside sources, that’s just asking for trouble, so instead you define an API that lets outside sources make requests to your program with predefined parameters about what they can ask for, what data you need from them, and what they should expect to get back in response, and then you build a function in your program to parse and handle the request.Likely the most common implementation of this pattern is Rest API that allows your front-end web service to communicate with your back-end code. An analogy I like to use is ordering food at a restaurant: imagine if you went to a restaurant where there was no waiter, no menus, just a chef in the back kitchen. To order your food, you just yell whatever recipe you want to eat at the chef. If he knows how to make it, he will, although it might not be exactly what you asked for because you couldn’t see a menu to know that their version of grilled salmon comes with Broccoli while you were expecting asparagus, because nothing was there to tell you so, and you aren’t allowed to go poking around in the kitchen. And, if you ask for something not on the menu, the chef sends you back an empty plate. If you ask for something REALLY not on the menu, the entire kitchen might catch on fire. That is your code with no API, where the front end is allowed to just make requests to public methods in the back end.With an API, you have a more standard restaurant. The waiter (API client) comes out and hands the customer (user / front end) a menu (API schema). The customer now knows what is available to order, and what they should expect to get back once they place that order. If the customer asks for something not on the menu, the waiter can tell them “no” before that request ever makes it to the chef. And the chef, instead of waiting around trying to listen to 500 customers all screaming nonsense from the dining room and trying to pick up orders, can instead just rely on the waiter to carry valid requests back to him as a single point of contact. The chef also just needs to hand the prepared food back to the waiter and let the waiter take care of interacting with customers, instead of having to sprint out of the kitchen to drop food off and then rush back to handle the next request. And finally, say something changes in the kitchen — they run out of paprika and need to substitute chili powder, for example. Now, instead of the customer having to *know* that the chef is actually using chili powder and, if they order a dish with paprika, the whole order gets thrown out… they can just order off the menu like normal, and the chef is responsible for knowing “menu item #17 uses chili powder now instead of paprika”, make the dish, and send it back out. The customer doesn’t have to *care* exactly what spices are being used, just that they wanted a dish, had a standardized and codified way to ask for that dish, and then whatever happens between the waiter and the kitchen is a black box, but results in the dish being served to them.",INTstictual,2025-10-30 17:11:01,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oi1y99,False,

Now the key here is not to Google the entire problem, but rather just the parts or aspects you're stuck on, as this simulates how you would solve real world problems that can't be googled.For example, say you're tasked with sorting the letters in an arbitrary string, and are required to return a string with all the same characters but sorted in alphabetical order using X programming language. In this case, you might Google:- (1) how to iterate over the characters of a string in X- (2) how to compare two characters in X- (3) how to keep a count of every character in X- (4) how to dynamically create and add to a new string in X.You might even look up what the best algorithm or structure to accomplish something is",iLaysChipz,2025-10-31 01:35:13,3,learnprogramming,t3_1okhi5a,False,

It's just part of the job.It's true that there are some jobs where DSA problems come up less often - but it's inevitable if you ever build anything that scales. The only way to avoid DSA forever is if you only build stuff like tiny one-off websites that never get a lot of users.I think of it like pilots learning to land a plane in zero visibility, or doctors learning about rare illnesses. It's not that you use this knowledge every day - it's so that when it does come up, you need to be prepared.95% of my job is exactly what you say you like - building websites, backend systems, and so on. Most of the time DSA isn't relevant.But that 5% of the time when it is, I'm really glad I know it. I know what to do when we discover one part of the code is getting too slow, or when we need to walk all of the nodes in a nested data structure.In the real world, nobody cares if you have every possible case memorized. It's fine to Google it. But you need to understand the fundamentals so that you know what to look up and you know how to use the solution when you find it.It's true that leetcode problems in interviews can be annoying and many companies do it extremely poorly. Most of us just treat that as a necessary evil. Some people just avoid those interviews and there are companies that do technical assessments of coders without ever asking leetcode problems.Competitive programming shouldn't even be mentioned, it's extremely niche. 99% of working programmers have no interest in it.",dmazzoni,2025-10-28 05:47:19,31,learnprogramming,t3_1oi190s,False,

This is because most jobs use mainstream programming languages, where there are many libraries, which you glue together to make something work, and those libraries themselves already use the appropriate data structure, or, if they don't, then that's too bad, but possibly not a problem until it becomes a bottleneck. Most jobs will not require you to implement a new database from scratch. You will mostly rely on things already in existence and very mature. No need to dig out your lecture notes about how to implement a B+ tree or stuff like that.However, ... If you want to have fun and explore maybe some more niche languages, then you might run into these situations, where you wish you had that one data structure that is appropriate for the situation. You might even find it interesting to write it yourself. And in very few jobs, you might even be given the chance to work with elegant but non-mainstream languages or technology stacks.Having a good grasp of data structures is and will remain respectable. For imperative data structures there is tons of code available online to work with though, and you need to know how to look up what you need and then you will be able to deal with the issue when it arises.

Unlike in Python, C won't check the boundaries for you, but now we know that anything trying to access `array[100]` is definitely an error.Your number handling logic may work (I didn't bother validating it), but it'd be much easier to validate if it was split into a function that took an array of N integers and sorted it according to the same rules. Then you can collect the input into an array, pass it into the sorting function to sort in-place, and write the results to stdout for the user.If you haven't yet, absolutely check out K&R (""The C Programming Language"" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie) and ""Modern C"" by Jens Gustedt.

If positive, set element at positive position and *decrement* positive position.You will end up with an array that contains all the negative values in correct order followed by all the positive values in reverse order, and your insert position variables tell you where the divide is.

So I put it aside and started reading a more beginner friendly book called ""C Programming Language: A Modern Approach"" by K.N King who does a great job at making C look fun.

So I’m kind of wondering if there is another better method to sort it?

There's not really a great use case for VLAs compared to just using `calloc(3)` when you need a dynamically allocated array of `N` items each `M` bytes large. There's not usually a significant amount of memory overhead for declaring an array of 100 ints if we know we need fewer. This can change if you start doing embedded development, but it's generally fine to have unused array space. Save worrying about memory usage and efficiency for after you're comfortable writing code in the language.2. Yeah, pointers are where things get tricky for most learners. You use them all the time in python and other languages without thinking though, like when you pass an instance of an object to a function, or use `self` in methods. C just doesn't hide those sorts of implementation details, so you have to learn them to be productive, otherwise you won't be able to solve certain problems efficiently.3. K&R may be technically outdated, but if you get the 2nd edition on ANSI C (first standardised version), it's still an excellent learning resource. Pointers will still be baffling at first, but once you start messing with them more it should start to make sense.Fun fact: your sort in place function would have to take a pointer argument, as it can't possibly recieve the unsorted array otherwise without it being a global variable. It should have a signature like `int sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` if you want to return a value indicating success/failure/already sorted or `void sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` to simply perform the sorting.

He was the person who solved the big problems and helped everyone on a daily basis. Nice guy who would gladly explain anything and wasn't stuck up about being an expert.Why the ""layoff""? - to improve the Q3 numbers. The work load didn't drop, not only was there more work, but less of us to do it. And it was no longer fun. Everyone expected to be terminated. Why? We have bloated middle management who only care about the bottom line.It got so bad that another senior engineer just quit. He HAD to be backfilled asap as the work is quite skilled. You can't put just anyone in these jobs and expect them to cope. So they brought back the Senior Guru canned in Q2 - at a reduced pay.The whole place just sucks. Everyone is now only about making their numbers. No help. No camaraderie. No extra anything. It doesn't help there is no OT, just comp time IF you make enough each week and its approved after your do it. You have to work at least 2 extra hours per day to qualify for comp time. 90 minutes? Nope, you lose.Senior nice guy has horror stories about the job market. He no longer does anything extra. He'll let you watch him work but won't comment and just puts his head down and outdoes most everyone else. Making it worse on the junior staff as they take longer and their numbers are dropping.

People don't really want to talk about it, but there have always been a tremendous amount of people in the industry who did very little. At least that's how it has been since I started in 2007.The reason why it used to be like that is because you used to be able to predict revenue growth by adding warm bodies and new projects, but now that tech (particularly the web) in a lot of ways matured its a lot harder to increase profits in this way. There are far fewer obvious ideas not being done out there that you can make bank on by doing. Thus the incentive has become cutting through the layers of fat and excess in engineering orgs.Going forward I see tech as being far leaner than it has been and more focused being placed on building high-performance teams that are spearheaded by high-impact individual contributors. Whenever those teams yield significant results you'll probably see them hiring reliable warm bodies again to maintain and extend what they've built. Even with lower interest rates I don't really see this dynamic changing much. Because back in the day you could just mill out CRUD apps and rake in cash but that game is tapped out.With that being said the experienced engineers who aren't finding jobs are the ones that never really applied themselves to achieve significant things for the organizations they worked for.

nmce2b4,"I think I can speak to this. Basically the path isn’t a clear career plan. When I was fresh out of college with a CS degree (sort of many moons ago) it’s been a decade for me. I came across similar feelings. At first I just applied to tech jobs, but I soon figured out that that was just small thinking on my part. There were layoffs (not as bad now), but super competitive considering much of the roles that a new grad would take was not only outsourced, but also those positions in the U.S. wanted decades of experience to work with the offshore teams. So I started looking at big corporations not known for IT with an IT department. Randomly applied for a project manager position where they needed someone with a working knowledge of computer languages and know how to speak to people. Took the job at a publishing company where I did more data analysis and project management. I got laid off after two years post graduation. At the time I was just looking for a job and landed at a revenue cycle company. They didn’t have an IT department they contracted with IBM at the time. While I was working in medical records, I continued to keep up with cs trends and followed my current employer on LinkedIn to keep up with what they were doing. It’s funny how many people do not keep up with what going on with their employer. (This is relevant) Believe me I tried applying at other well known IT companies like IBM, Apple, Google etc  and interviewed but never panned out during my tenure as a medical records specialist. Then my current employer announced internally that they were creating an IT department. Which led to subset departments like software engineering and data analytics. I also had read in Wall Street journal they had just landed a 10 year contract with one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and part of the partnership employer acquired a few of their subsidies, one of which was analytics. Knowing things were coming up so really watched for the job posts and applied to nearly of them. I landed in data analysis and I think it’s because I had a background in healthcare ops and computer languages. I could speak to people non technical and understood how to speak to engineers. So while I never thought I’d be in data analytics, I just went with the flow and kept applying for jobs I got my degree in. Oh and due to the fact that I follow my current employer on LinkedIn, I was able to stay ahead on their partnership with an AI company. Learning about AI company because I had a feeling one of the products I oversee is now part of companies KPI - they would want to use part of our data. Now I’m on the project that integrates data that flows through the product I built into AI companies platform. Sorry it was a novel, but I wanted to share my experience because it’s so unconventional and yet familiar to others as well on their career path.",Moussechocolate4051,2025-10-31 09:55:20,59,cscareerquestions,t3_1okoxjk,False,

Lots of things I know tech companies do this company had no interest in doing.I even worked in my free time to develop a prototype of how something like Jenkins could help by running automated tests nightly. When management found out they literally told me ""if you want to work extra on the weekends work on project priorities or don't work on anything at all."" The issue was management didn't care about things I was trying to solve.They were content with the speed of development, which was slow. They were content with how automated testing were run at the whim of people who owned the tests and sometimes issues would be found late in to the process. They were content with all the tech debt, because it wasn't preventing them from meeting their goals of getting FDA approval.At the end of the day they know creating an FDA approved medical device takes a long time and they were confident they could talk away any issues that did not affect patient safety. There were 100's of bugs that did not affect patient safety in the bug tracker, but fixing them was only priority when doctors or patients complained.

It probably didn't help him get the initial interview, since I think that was more about the fact that we were recruiting at his school, but it definitely helped him stand out during the interview process. When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.One side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.On the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project. The thing that made my experience different from yours is that our app had very few users but a ton of publicity (it was kind of a wacky idea). This helped recruiters find us.

The first movers here, as in any labor struggle, will likely be casualties. Workplaces will -- as has been happening -- retaliate. People will be fired and blacklisted, whole departments shuttered, etc.In the \*absence\* of a broader cultural context around labor consciousness, the lesson these retaliations teach is ""that was a bad move, you can't win"". Whereas in a context of solidarity, it is more acceptable to take personal risks to advance the greater good.

nlfhcby,"Unionizing is a great idea but unfortunately there are problems with this idea that in my opinion this will exacerbate the problem. First and foremost, if software devs unionize then it will give the companies a golden opportunity to push for more AI and outsourcing. Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.Secondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. Thirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. Fourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.This is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.Other commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy.

nlq52os,"Jobs become less and less standardized, and it makes less and less sense to talk about them as a group, as you move to the top.Executives don't have a predefined job function in the same way that a swe does, with policy around it. An executive's job is to run a section of the business, make it work well, and be accountable to its results.An executive's job security is based on how important their piece of the business is, how hard/risky it is to remove them from that piece of the business (either to replace them or reorg the function away), and how politically influential the person is (like who else will leave or become a problem if I fire this person). If your org can just be eliminated or you can easily be replaced, and everything else will stay standing without you, then you have no job security. If you are directly driving the company's financials, no one else can run your machine, and everyone else that is important to the business likes you and will be pissed and follow you if you are fired, then you have near-infinite job security. The title means nothing. It's just about what power you have. Generally, the title of an executive is supposed to be descriptive, not prescriptive. You are VP of eng because you are the person controlling eng. You aren't controlling eng because you are VP of eng. Where these are misaligned, the person with the title needs to be pushed out and replaced with who's actually in charge, and will be in any functional org.

The last director I knew who left not on his own accord was fired (or you know, replaced, 'left to pursue other opportunities' or whatever) was fired because his project went against architectural guidelines which led to risks that the business was unable to accept.It's also expensive to lay off directors, and VPs especially.

There's a chance that you can apply to go remote if you get your manager on board. It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.You should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.WLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week.

The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.The negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it). I’d recommend industrial if you go the path. It’s more dangerous as you work with big stuff but you keep plants running like you can work for a refinery, brewery, stuff like that.

But even in this case 2-10 is a big stretch. Practically no company will support this permanently.I sometimes do and see people do something else: You start your day at the beginning of the work hours, check in and be available but do not actively work. When somebody needs to reach you, you respond. If you have a meeting you join. Then when it’s 2, you start actively working. After official work hours end you continue working until 10, but tone the communication down and stop answering to people who want to reach out, until next day.

There are plenty of hands on CTO roles out there looking for real experience right now.

But they might end up flummoxed when the site is broken due to bad DNS config, load balancer problems, certificate issues, etc.Specialists can be super productive when they are in their lane and things are working on the happy path. But they can end up struggling when troubleshooting failures and problems that occur in systems they ""own"" but fall outside their speciality.I'm happy that I've spent time working on provisioning systems for bare metal servers, fumbled my way through setting up networks and getting BGP working across VPN links between sites, built my own AD domains and a thousand other ""IT"" tasks which most Software Developers are never exposed to. Its been amazingly useful when it comes to troubleshooting failures and being able to identify all the places where problems can be injected into the environment where services run.So ultimately, I think it is most valuable to be a specialist in one or more domains, but with a broad exposure and experience outside of those specialist silos.

If you burn out or slide into isolation, the pay won't feel good.**Try this:** pick a small target for change. Could be *""Meet one teammate for coffee/virtual chat this week and ask what their blockers are.""* Or *""Offer to pair on one small task.""* If you get zero response, that’s an indicator.Keep the radar up for your next move. You’re already coming from a team with good support... so you **know** what better feels like. That’s strength.If it keeps feeling lonely and unsupported for 6-12 months, seriously weigh whether high pay + poor teamwork = “worth it” for you.Bottom line: you’re not stuck forever.

Sustained curiosity - can you stick to this topic for years and still be eager to do your own experiments, even if you don’t have tasks/projects at work?2. Feedback. You need to find the sources of feedback - side projects, hackathons, showing your progress on social networks and meetups, mentors, interviews. If you avoid feedback for some reason - this may be a sign that you are not really interested.3.

nlizfst,"You’re not a fraud. You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.I don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.Think of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. Once you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. It really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience.

Once you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack.

Like if you need to modify a part of something in the codebase, use AI to find where the code is and understand what patterns this codebase use and get suggestions.Need to build something from scratch? Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.I don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools.

nlj368s,"The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.Larger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.The more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.I wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than ""Write some code to do X"", focus on ""How do I do X"" and try to understand the underlying concepts.Also, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!Got a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.Funny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like ""I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!"" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.Funny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.So back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.So learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to.

nm1de2m,"I, a native English speaker, listened to my native-English-speaking level 6s on my team as they spent 100 hours commenting on software design docs. In that entire time, they never committed to someone taking responsibility for solving a problem. They seemed to think that generating commentary was the objective in itself, rather than someone taking responsibility for solving a problem.Just to illustrate the ridiculousness of this - there was one instance where a level 6 proposed a design, level 6s reviewed and approved and delivered the design, and then I talked to them 2 times about how the delivered solution did not address the problem that it needed to be used for. And then I was assigned to use their solution, their un-modified solution failed to actually solve the problem I needed it to solve, and I did my best to deliver my part of the project and then resigned in contempt for the leadership of my team. And in my engienering handoff meeting, as I was resigning, after my project had been impacted by this deficit in their design, I mentioned again that it was not fit for the purpose it needed to be used for. One of the level 6 reviewers just said ""This was not identified as a requirement."" And that was it. Life goes on, they just didn't have to take any responsibility for failing to deliver something which solved a problem and engaging in denialism for months.Anyway, I suggest you ask these people plainly if their commentary is contributing to someone taking responsibility for solving a problem, or if they are generating commentary for some other objective, and figure out whether their commentary is making measurable progress toward that objective. They will probably say that they are trying to contribute valuable implementation details on *how* to solve the problem, so you should be ready to ask if they are sure that their comments are commensurate with the prioritization of problems that we have; because it might be that commissioning a smaller group to solve the problem is a lot more effective than sitting as a group talking about details that are germane only to a subset of people.",NonSequiturDetector,2025-10-29 16:56:40,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1oj96np,False,

I'd definitely suggest framing these as questions to understand why it is how it is, rather than statements about how this or that could be better.

By developing it yourself, you've just demonstrated to everyone that no one really needs them to develop internal apps.

For example, instead of saying ""We need native notifications because this is how the system works, and everyone else does it this way"", say - ""If we go this route, we'll have to maintain a home-grown notification system. This will incur an ongoing maintenance cost, and it may be difficult to go back on this decision if we run out of resources"". It helps if you bring up these points with your manager before you speak to them. Tell your manager that you've thought this through and what really matters here is that we ship something the users want, and ship it relatively quickly. \- Show the prototype to users and use their opinion as an anchor point when having discussions. If there's an outcome you don't like, find a relevant data point to support your claim and point them to it. Create a perception that you don't really care either way, but it seems that this is what the users want. \- If you can, roll it out to some beta testers and gather feedback to strenghten the above point. \- If you can provide numeric data to support your claims, that will have a much stronger effect than anything above - if you can say 9 out of 10 users want regular sized widgets, then there's not much to talk about. \- Speak with your manager and try to get him to buy into the following narrative: ""we've already spent so much time on this, our users need this ASAP, they love the design, so let's just roll it out and spend the remainder of the time on this project adjusting it to their liking"".It's important to create a perception of being detached emotionally from it, this will bring their guard down.",jasiek83,2025-10-27 12:10:50,0,cscareerquestions,t3_1oh99n8,False,
