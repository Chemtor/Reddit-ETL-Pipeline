n7dywxi,"Duckdb is an “in process” database. It has its own scheme for storing data in memory and disk. However, it’s also able to “connect” to other sources besides its own duckdb stored data file. For example it  can access and query parquet and csvs as if they were tables. Even more interestingly since it’s “in process” it has full access to the memory space of the process. What that means is that it can actually connect to a in memory pandas or polars dataframe and run queries on it as if the df was a table and it can write the results back to pandas df. So you can do something like this:```df1 = pd.Dataframe(…)df2 = pd.Dataframe(…)df = duckdb.query('''    select a, sum(x) as x    from df1    inner join df2 on …    group by a''').df()```",HNL2NYC,2025-08-07 09:33:12,141,dataengineering,t3_1mjudxc,False,

We were less dependent on each other, and if something blew up on our face, the repo separation contained the blast radius.At the same time, we actually had some monorepo happening too. For the sake of fast shipping we opted to use Meltano to run Airflow and dbt.

n83iumi,"I think you are using ""surrogate"" in a different sense than I would consider conventional.If you are constructing your primary key determjnistically from one or more columns, then that is effectively a natural key, you're just doing some of the databases work manually.Surrogate keys are keys which are not derived from the data of the entity. The idea is that they identify the row as a first-class thing in its own right. This is useful if the data model (or your understanding of the data) changes. For example, many things which _should_ be natural keys can end up being non-unique in practice due to dirty data, particularly at a large enough scale.Surrogate primary keys have to be unique, but can't rely on the data from the row to provide that uniqueness, so the guarantee that no two rows have the same key had to come from somewhere else. The basic options to guarantee uniqueness are:- Generate keys randomly and check for duplicates- Generate keys randomly from such a large keyspace that collisions are ""unlikely enough""- Generate keys in some way that is mathematically guaranteed never to generate the same key twiceJust about simplest mathematical approach that is guaranteed never to generate the same output twice is an incrementing integer sequence. It's also easy to implement, and produces an output (a smallish integer) that is very efficient to work with and which often has relatively nice properties for things like database indexes.",qlkzy,2025-08-11 12:08:28,18,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,
n83v18q,"I'll take MSSQL as the example hereYour question is more related on what makes a clustered index. Per default, the primary key is used as the clustered index, but it does not have to be. Anyway, when I say clustered index, you pretty much can think ""primary key"".I won't go to deep here, but essentially, the clustered index is the physical sorting of the table. If the clustered index is sequential, you add a new row, it gets appended at ""the end"". The number sequence is irrelevant, nobody cares, its only used to ensure the sorting order. If your clustered index is not sequential, the new row needs to get added ""in the middle""That will cause something called page splits. With a page split, the data can not be written where it should be, since the 8kb page at that position is full, so instead a pointer to a new page is written there. When querying the data for that row, the page where it should be is read, pointer to other page is found, other page gets read as well. So it is not good for performance.That's why you quite often see maintainance jobs, that rebuild / reorganize the clustered indexes of the entire database, running during some weekend night or something like that.The reason it is common to have that sequence as an integer is, the size. Int32 is 4 byte. Every non clustered index will reference the clustered index, so having a larger field for the clustered index, will bloat the size of all non clustered indexes, which is again bad for performance, since more data gets written / read / cached.That's the gist of why you often read about and see identity columns as clustered index.Why would you not use that:Now here it gets a bit harder, to not write a small book. The clustered index is your physical data on disk. The more efficient you can look up a value given your data access paths, the faster your queries will execute. On a typical OLTP database, you will see 90%+ read traffic, so read access is very important.Lets say you have 100 million rows in your table, that contains a lets say zip code. Lets also say, you usually query by a filter on that zip code. Something along the lines of WHERE zipCode = @@param1 AND .... In that case, for read access, it would likely be a good idea to create a clustered index, with zip code as the first field (you can create a clustered index containing more than one column). Since the search trough the B+ tree can be more efficient that way.If you had an identity as the clustered index, you would create a non clustered index on the zipCode, which works, but after the relevant data is found in the non clustered index, it will have to be looked up in the clustered index to get the actual data. As long as it was not a covering non clustered index. It also depends on data distribution an the statistics on the table, an index is useless if in that example your data is split between two zip codes.You see what I mean by saying, ""hard to not write a small book"" ?Random Guids should only be used in special cases. Massive concurrent users, where you run into hot spots on the ""last page"" data needs to get written to for example (would be called latch contention on mssql), or distributed systems.The reason for that is, that the data ends up essentially unsorted, which is not good, while also causing the page split problem, which creates the need for regular maintenance tasks.I'll try to give a bit of a TLDR on how you should choose your clustered index :* It should be chosen with intent, it is the most powerful tool for performance optimizing on the data modeling level* It should be narrow (small data size)* it should be selective. Think along the lines of a hash table, you don't benefit from a hashtable much, if you end up with two hash buckets, containing 50 million rows. Still a hash table... but you are far from O(1) in such a case.* sequential ID's can work but don't have to. They are rarely ideal, but are better than nothing* Think about how your data gets accessed, and choose the index to best support most of your workload* At least as a health check, keep an eye on your index fragmentation (there are system views for that on mssql, I'm sure there is something like that on any serious database)* The clustered index does not have to be unique! Sql Server, will append a small row identifier if needed behind the scene. It is not a good idea to append a guid in the datamodel* As a default when creating a table, the primary key gets used as the clustered index, that does not have to be done. It is usually a better idea to have a thought out clustered index, instead of just defaulting to the PK. In cases where the PK is not the clustered index, a non clustered index gets created, to ensure uniqueness of said key.Edit: Jesus Christ that ended up as a blog post pretty much, and I tried to be brief...",svtr,2025-08-11 13:23:26,6,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,
n83lghv,"History: initially the database in the late 80's & early 90's, we only had string or int, and the application had to manage PK & FK keys. So often the PK & FK were text based, and this was slow.Some vendors in the DBase III+ era, Foxpro, started copying the popular Informix & SQL-92 ansi standard, to have a database ""engine"" assign the PK key with an auto increment column of type INT. These early DB engines were only 32 bit of course.They allowed the DB engine to lock the table, assign a PK automatically on INSERT based on last value used, write the record, unlock the table. This was seen as a more secure way, since the engine was assigning the key, not the application. Because of course in a network, you get network errors, and the application would often hang or use an incorrect PK causing duplicates.My early DBA days mid-90's was handling duplicates on micro computers and mini computers (like the VAX). A mini computer used ASCII terminals, so everything ran inside 1 computer with a multi-threaded CPU, why they were huge & expensive.Micro computer decentralized the expensive mini computer, and you could use Wordperfect & Lotus 1-2-3, not just a homegrown ERP/WMS/MES application. So all the micro-computer vendors mid-90's offered auto increment with their SQL db engine because the demand was there, CPUs were only 32 bit, and the GUID() or MD5() functions didn't exist yet.Some companies had to use datetime strings instead, like Wall Street, or the UK-France tunnel car tracking system, because auto increment had reached its limit in transactions count.Was still used for lookup tables, like a string PK for a product table, but category, sub-category, color tables used auto inc for PK.Merging data from various systems was a major PITA (duplicate ID #'s with different data) and by the late 90's the auto inc was being abandonned globally for GUID instead, or a datetime string down to the milisecond 5 digits, I've seen both.Then Lo' & Behold, 64 bit CPUs, and now we have BIGINT with MSSQL 2000 in the year 2000, and auto inc came back with a vengeance because who ever hits the 2\^64-1 limit?I blame Microsoft for bringing Auto Inc back to life when it should have died out in 1999 and the Y2K bug.",SirGreybush,2025-08-11 12:25:32,6,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,

Really depends on what your database is doing although the idea of something being fully normalised when you just don't need it i.e. largely static data, is just a huge waste of time and energy compared to simply having duplicate values in a table.I used to work with somebody who absolutely insisted on everything being fully normalised, was the type of person who can't see somebody else's perspective, and could only do things one way. Every time they saw a duplicate value - normalised. They normalised so much they actually went full circle and started duplicating data, but across multiple tables instead of duplicate values in a single table which didn't change much.Personally, I think normalisation is a lot more nuanced than it can appear.",MikeDoesEverything,2025-08-12 10:25:13,19,dataengineering,t3_1mo4ouk,False,

So, there's always a small (nonzero) risk of losing data if the system instantly crashes. Postgres doesn't really have this problem, because it doesn't complete the transaction until the data is safely on disk.Because Mongo just appends to a file, you may have to deal with compaction, which is when old entries get garbage collected (more or less). This isn't a problem if you're always creating new entries, but if you update or delete entries often, compaction can take time.Postgres also has compaction, but it's called vacuum and is done differently.It's supposed to be easier to use partitions/sharding in Mongo.

It's an unfortunate side-effect of changing jobs every year or so to keep my salary competitive.**2. How do you gather and translate business requirements in your teams?**Varies a lot. Either meet with a department head or manager who wants something done, or meet with an individual who's been asking for something to be fixed for months. I prefer working with individuals, they typically use the data daily and know exactly what they need. Managers tend to have lots of lofty ideas and designs that end up translating poorly into implementation details. **3.

n7g9nd3,"A ""data perspective"" btw - another guy wrote about the messaging part, also valid.SCD is slowly changing dimension, and there are type 1, 2 & 3 - then hybrid variations depending on how old the design was.In modern times, we simply use SCD2 or SCD Type 2, which is row-based tracking of the business key - what makes a row unique and never changes, and tracking changes to the data portion, what does change over time.A good example is a credit score, ship to address, customer address.Some ERP systems have SCD2 tables labeled as \_HIST or \_History, but for DW purposes, we break down information from top-down, then bottom-up, then build what is missing in the middle as layers of transformations.So if you tie sales to geography and your customers are the general public, they move a lot, so you need to track at-that-point-in-time where they lived. A transformation would be calculating longitude & latitude for that address, that the X & Y coordinates don't exist in the source system.So the world of DW is easily a year full-time university course, of course lots of courses online too.So... At least once... A relationship between to tables, inner join or left join. In DW world you avoid left joins like the plague, unknown data will actually have a pre-defined value.This is domain / entity specific, like when you specify 1-to-1, 1-to-many, 1-to-0. So at least once would be 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.If you load a product table and a sub-table is color, another is category and sub-category, depending on the (various) sources you can have a product with no color, no category or sub-categ, you must assign a value for the missing data, so that INNER JOIN always works.So you'd have a DIM\_PRODUCT\_CATEGORY with a surrogate key and business value 'UNKNOWN' or 'NOT DEFINED' even though in the source system that category doesn't exist.You have to remember that DWs are report orientated and tools like PowerBI and the analysts using them will not appreciate having to render NULLs and won't be happy with missing sales numbers.",SirGreybush,2025-08-07 17:18:14,3,dataengineering,t1_n7g2iif,False,

If you're very strong in all aspects of SQL (Joins, CTE's, order of execution, etc), then you're solid for a DE role. Now focus on data modeling which is very hard skill to get good at even after years of experience and many fail interviews even at senior levels, it's unfortunate truth but it is what it is. Take some Udemy courses, watch YT videos on dimensional modeling. There are plenty of free project YT videos on building pipelines. Since you're good with Oracle, start there for a valid certificate that you think can relate to DE role, even a data or solution architect certificate would be good on resume but experience always precedes certificates. Learn distributed compute and storage (Snowflake, Databricks), one is fine. Databricks has uphill learning curve compare to snowflake. Pickup little bit of cloud (AWS or Azure), one is fine since the concepts can be applied across. Google cloud isn't very popular compare to the other two. You can also pickup cloud related skills on the job, doesn't have a steep learning curve. If you're aiming for FAANG, then you'll need to learn DSA (Python works).

In this case you'd want to make sure you're building relationships there and ask about a potential conversion to FTE after graduation, or at the very least an extension on your internship.If you find yourself enjoying data-related work but don't necessarily see yourself staying with the company, you'll want to start researching about different data-related roles (Data Engineer, DBA, BI/Analytics Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.) and continue building applicable skills.

You can hold the data in a single place and, in theory, any engine can query it.

IMO this has a significant downside in that iceberg is the “lowest common denominator” so you lose all the benefits of the proprietary format. It also seems unlikely that many companies migrate between platforms where having data in an open format would significantly benefit this migration",NW1969,2025-08-09 20:35:21,3,dataengineering,t3_1mlzcv6,False,

While snowflake can handle this, many systems (e.g. BI tools) have severe performance issues with varchar(max) columns.My view is that you need good reasons to move to iceberg, not good reasons to stick with snowflake native - which should be the default option.Also, if you are looking at having multiple engines querying iceberg, the catalog is not going to support enterprise-grade features. For example, if you tag columns for tag-based masking policies in snowflake those tags are not in the catalog available to other engines - so you would still need a separate masking solution in every system.",NW1969,2025-08-09 21:03:02,3,dataengineering,t3_1mlzcv6,False,

Once the data comes in raw file, you can very well do data transformation for reporting and other down stream use cases.

It looks like quicksort but its a very inefficient implementation of it. Usually it will create new partition arrays and concatenate at the end which is very slow and not ""quick"" like it implies in the name. The proper implementation is done in-place. If you are solid in DSA and coding fundamentals, even if you don't know the quicksort algorithm, you will probably be able to look at it and realize that allocating a bunch of new memory each recursive iteration is very inefficient. Almost all sorting algorithms implementations are done in place since speed is very important.That said I think AI has huge potential value in acting as a teacher and mentor if prompted the right way. My recommendation would be to turn off copilot, don't use cursor or any codegen, and prompt it to not give any code examples. A prompt like 'I want to study binary search as if I'm reading a textbook, from first principles and with theory, without many real code samples, in order to learn it through and through.

The output of that prompt is actually pretty good stuff, it was trained on textbooks so get that level of information from it like you're taking a class on it.A soft skill I would add to that is to learn how to learn. Ask probing questions. Seek to understand at a deep and innate level. Ask for explanations in different ways and analogies that help you understand better.

I am often doing something where I struggle to explain it so I can't even google the blasted thing; or maybe it's just that the stuff that I find easy flies by.But what always works for me when I'm stuck like this is to try and write something. But wierdly I am still resistant to this.Sometimes I sit for literally hours trying other approaches. I know! I'll write it out on paper! I know! I'll draw it!And I'm a f\*\*\*ing idiot because every time I end up having to write a small program to test the theory of what I'm doing ... and that will lead me to the answer. I feel like I experience a lot of impedance to simply switcing windows and opening up a new program and doing the thing.AND what's even more interesting, the best programmers I know (but of course that's subjective) do this too. Not necessarily that they get stuck but they do this switching context to experiment thing. When programmers I admire pair with me I see them do this all the time.So that's my answer.

If you were to re-write this, I would phrase it as a question, and not assume you know more about how to teach students than the CS Department of your University. It's good to be curious, it's good to question things, but remember they've likely been doing this a lot longer, and they likely have an answer as to why they choose XYZ first. I have a few thoughts for why they might teach Syntax first. **Easy Victories lead to greater motivation -** Almost invariably, everyone's first program is 'Hello World'. This is a very easy first step that teaches you some basic syntax, the basics of how your IDE work, and the basics of runtime/compiling. If your code doesn't compile, you have a syntax error, that's likely your first bug! And it's easy to solve. This will quickly become trivially easy, but you had to learn it at some point, and if you can see that the basics of coding is no harder than installing a few programs and writing a sentence with good grammar, that might be enough to get a few students who were on the fence to stay in the game. **Most people learn what to do, and then how to do it, then why you do it -** You likely don't have kids, but my daughter is learning to walk and talk right now. She knows 'danger hot' and that the trash cans & toilets are 'Ew'. As she gets older we'll start filling in the gaps of why these things are dangerous & yucky, but it doesn't do us a whole lot of good to tell a one and a half year old about germs because even if she could learn the word, she doesn't know what it means.Bringing this concept back to programming, One of the first apps taught outside of CS degrees is building an API with CRUD operations. The REST routing concepts are pretty much set in stone at this point, and don't require a lot of creativity, so it's pretty easy to give newbies a tutorial and help them through the concepts as they work up the project. **Yes this is eventually going to cause a learning plateau -** So yes when you get into algorithmic thinking, assignment operators, functions that pass a value, etc. you're going to hit a wall. This is not easy stuff and you are going to struggle with this as you rewire your brain. But as you practice, you are going to hit a point where it clicks, and when that happens you're going to be glad you have all of your syntax memorized because it will fall into place easier, rather than having to go back and learn it all at that point.",JanitorOPplznerf,2025-08-09 18:39:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mlnc7i,False,

The whitespace handling enforces good practices, the simple syntax is really great, the robust libraries available make it easy to not-worry-about parts of the code that aren't the focus of the current lesson.On the other hand: Python is a great language for Getting Shit Done, because generally speaking people are in agreement about what's ""the Pythonic approach"" to a problem. Lots of libraries already exist, and also, most of them have easy-to-pick-up interfaces because they're generally developed ""Pythonically"".Now - when you're learning ""programming"", you're learning several things at once: the fundamentals of programming (data structures, algorithms, what a variable is), and also a specific programming language (do statements end in a semicolon? how do I import something from another file?), and also a particular development context (how should my project be structured? How do I invoke build tools?).**Python is very good at simplifying some of this**. The ""learning a specific programming language"" part of it is pretty simple, and the development context is easily simplifiable (it can get complicated in real-life deployment situations, needing to navigate pyenv etc - but that's not anything a beginner needs to worry about in order to get started).**The tension is this:** Because Python has an active community of senior developers, who have coalesced on specific ways of working (canonized and blessed particular by the BDFL), there are some corners of Python that don't feel right if you've been exposed to other kinds of programming - some of which might actually be ""harder"" than the level of abstraction that Python works at!For a long time, this manifested for me as: *every time I try to learn Python, I pick a simple project and implement it - but feel like I haven't gained any knowledge about the language*. It was like it was too easy - like there was so little friction that nothing stuck in my brain.What made it click for me was to fully synthesize the idea that ""programming Pythonically"" is a distinct skill, and that ""knowing how to program"" *in general* was helpful for it but by no means sufficient for it.

I can tell you have a C model because you used words like ""iterate"" and ""insert."" I know Python programmers use them too but these words don't mean quite the same thing as what you have in mind.

I will just use colloquial naem since a lot of higher languages all share these types. They are scalar, array/vector, hash-table/named-array, and pair/dict. Note they are not interchangeable. When you program them you have to keep track of which type you are dealing with. This may seem trivial but it is a big difference especially with the issue you have. You see, an array in Python is not the same as an array in C. An array in Python is ***a type of object*** while in C it is just ***an array (a continuous line) of memory boxes.***This means you cannot think of insert as ***iterating*** to the right spot of the memory and ***insert a box*** and move the rest of the box over to the right (assuming going from left to right). In object oriented languages like Python, you just simply use the object's method to insert. Doing it any other way is just creating trouble for yourself. In some sense this gives Python its ease of use but it also creates a strange weakness. Python programmers often have trouble adjusting to lower level languages like C. It is your problem in reverse, except it is a lot harder to overcome. I do not understand it completely but I feel it is like learning a manual clutch car versus automatic. It is easy to learn automatics because you do not need to understand much to start much. On the other hand, you need to understand the gear boxes to have that mental picture of the gear switching process when you drive to feel the gears switching into the right positions to get it. If you are already accustomed to something easy why would you ever bother and want to struggle with something hard. You will just quit. So, congrats for learning a C based language first.e: a big weakness of higher level languages, most but not all, is that you cannot create new fundamental types. You might be asking what other types could there be? A lot actually, pretty much everything you find in the standard C/C++ library.",kcl97,2025-08-06 03:12:25,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mismzw,False,

You want the code to become concrete applications/servers/… that your public can use (website visitors, mobile application users, other companies,…).The devops job is made so that the work produced by devs can be made concrete.A code always needs resources (like a server, a domain name, CDNs,… there are many kinds of resources), informations (like username/passwords, ip addresses, urls, …), and we generally setup different processes to fill some needs.Like, for instance, the pipelines you mentioned, are like pipes in a way. Once code (for short) goes in a specific pipeline, it ends up to the desired location. A pipeline could be created to provide new versions to a test environment, or to a beta version, or to prod. There is no fixed recipe but its frequent to see test/staging/beta/production.The role of the devops is to try and automatise that. So, for instance, when devs deliver a new version of the code, the magic behind happens and the cogs spin until the new version of the application is delivered to the clients.The job is highly technical and highly complex. Depending on the needs, the team can require high technical expertises in multiple different domains (security, kubernetes/dockers, azure/aws/… cloud vendors, …). It can be as simple as being a ""clickops"" (the devops guy goes on a cloud vendor like azure or aws website and clicks/fills forms manually) up to a more fully automated process (also possible with cloud vendors, terraform,…).So, if you wanted to learn visually something about how your devops team functions, you gotta be more precise.But I think management 101 would tell you to learn directly from your team, if good communication is possible.",Merry-Lane,2025-08-11 12:41:55,10,learnprogramming,t3_1mnate2,False,

(You can find tutorials for all of that in this sub's FAQ.) Watching is not the same as coding, and you will get a lot more if you are following along while you watch.Longer Answer:Coding is not 'Learn one language and fight about why yours is better for the rest of time'. There's a very good chance you're going to learn 3+ languages at a basic level and a couple dozen technologies including an IDE or two, as well as multiple frameworks & runtimes over your career. As a Junior, you probably won't get a job unless you can navigate a terminal, use a debugger, write unit tests, do error handling, test APIs through something like Postman, manage an environment through NPM or Docker or the like. Honestly there's probably three things I'm forgetting.I've watched the Harvard video and the professor is very good. He makes the class easy and fun. But he's also fast, he assumes his students are Ivy League level and have read the source materials, so he may lose you if you aren't pausing regularly and checking documentation and course materials.As for Python or C++; if this is pre-university, I think Python is PERFECT for you. It'll be much easier and it will set you up well to learn another language and follow along better at Uni. You'll have plenty of time to switch languages over the next four years. Keep in mind C++ may not even be the language your game will be built in. C++ would be for something like Unreal Engine, while C# would be for Unity, and Minecraft was originally in Java. So it's not like you can make any game ever with C++, well you could, but it's not necessarily the best choice.And yes as others have said, make sure you're WRITING code, not just watching videos.",JanitorOPplznerf,2025-08-09 16:52:18,10,learnprogramming,t3_1mltl8b,False,

n7tsz6t,"I think whether Codefinity is worth it really depends on your starting point and learning style. I took Codefinity after dabbling in Python on free platforms like freeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials, and for me, the biggest value was its structured, hands-on approach. A lot of online courses dump all the theory up front, but Codefinity mixes in small, interactive projects from the start, which kept me engaged and actually helped me remember the concepts better.One thing I noticed compared to something like CS50 is that Codefinity feels more guided and less overwhelming. CS50 is amazing, but it can be intense for beginners because it covers a lot of computer science theory. Codefinity, on the other hand, is more focused on practical Python skills — working with data, building mini-apps, and slowly introducing libraries like Pandas or NumPy in context.It’s true some lessons can feel repetitive if you already know the basics, but for absolute beginners, that repetition actually builds confidence. The quizzes and small coding tasks at the end of each section made it easier for me to track progress. I also liked that they emphasize applying what you learn — I built a simple web scraper and a basic text-based game during the course, which were huge confidence boosters.Price-wise, it’s not the cheapest, but if you compare it to some coding bootcamps or other subscription-based platforms, it’s reasonable — especially if you grab a discount. The key is to actually follow through; no course is “worth it” if you just skim it.If your goal is to move from understanding Python syntax to building your own projects, Codefinity can absolutely help bridge that gap. If you’re already at an intermediate level, you might outgrow it quickly, but you could still benefit from its more advanced project modules.For me, pairing Codefinity with side projects (like Raspberry Pi experiments in robotics) made it much more valuable. If anyone’s wondering “Is Codefinity legit?” — I’d say yes, it’s a solid, beginner-friendly platform for learning Python in a structured, project-focused way.",potty__mouth,2025-08-09 19:57:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mlmu16,False,

n7z6xqx,"I went through Codefinity after completing a couple of beginner Python courses and found it to be a solid option for building practical skills. The lessons are laid out in a way that makes them easy to follow, and the gradual progression from basic concepts to small projects helped me feel more comfortable applying what I learned. I appreciated how each topic had examples that connected to real use cases instead of staying purely theoretical. Some sections did feel slow, especially if you already know the basics, but I think that pace works well for reinforcing ideas. For me, it helped to go over familiar topics because it meant I didn’t have to constantly look things up when working on my own projects. The mini projects were one of the highlights since they gave a sense of accomplishment without being overwhelming. They also made it easier to remember concepts because I could connect them to something I had actually built. I wouldn’t say Codefinity is perfect the interface is simple and the pace might be too slow for advanced learners but for someone who wants structure and consistent practice, it’s effective. I also think combining it with something hands-on, like Raspberry Pi projects, can make a big difference.

You can’t contribute meaningfully to something you have never used.After using it for a bit, start looking through the codebase. Get a feel for the main language and all the supporting technologies (frameworks, libraries, build system, etc). If you’re new expect this to take a few weeks. Then download the project and try to get it running locally. Make a tiny change (change a text) and see if you can get it to show up.Then try setting a debug point. Now go and trace a specific feature and see how it works.If you want a cheat sheet look at recent PRs that got merged and see what changes were required.

But, once that is done, ask the AI to explain the concepts that dont make sense. Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it. Each step sounds awful, because it lowkey is, that is the pain of dev onboarding. You also will need to be patient with yourself in the beginning as you try to figure out where to even make code changes given an issue to resolve and how to actually resolve it properly without over engineering.Good luck, though, working on intense projects helped me get a job at amazon, so hopefully it helps you out with ur financial goals too.",Aperswal,2025-08-12 06:25:34,4,learnprogramming,t3_1mnv74w,False,

Add basic tests, use basic GitHub actions, create a CONTRIBUTING.md. Then create an issue, assign it to yourself. Complete the issue and submit a PR like it's someone else's project. 3. Review your own PR like you're a maintainer and approve it when it looks good. At this point you at least understand the process of contributing to open source, now it's about finding issues you can actually handle.4. Find a small project that has some good first issue tags. Usually this is someone just trying to do what I outlined above for themself. The codebase and issue should be simple. Work on getting assigned some easy issues and getting your PRs merged. 5.

Big corporations in the US, Germany, Japan, etc. may indeed have strict degree requirements for SWE roles, especially entry-level. Highly competitive graduate schemes and certain government and defense jobs do require accredited degrees. In these contexts, projects and open-source contributions can help, but HR filters simply will block applications without formal education.In contrast, startups, scale-ups and smaller companies often prioritize skills, portfolio projects and interview performance over formal credentials.Many US tech companies (see Google, IBM, Apple) do have officially dropped strict degree requirements, though competition means degrees still give an advantage. Also countries with high demand for developers will sometimes hire based on bootcamp training or self-taught experience.If you look globally, there’s a shift toward skills-based hiring in tech. Portfolios, GitHub contributions and competitive programming results (from LeetCode, HackerRank) can open doors. Networking and referrals indeed do often bypass degree filters.Without a degree, you will need a strong portfolio, relevant certifications, and networking to compete. In markets with “degree fever” (as one commenter called it), getting past automated HR filters is harder. In more flexible markets, you can get hired without a degree, with proof of skills and good interview performance.But even with a degree and relevant certifications, you will still have to prove that you have been able to apply the knowledge and expertise you acquired, combined with quantifying the use and profit your work has.

n7ebxgi,"There's a common misconception among those new to the software industry that all code is brand new. Most code is legacy code, that is, code that's been around a while, maybe years and years, and you're fixing bugs or adding features. It's rare for a company to ditch their code, find the next new language, and rewrite the entire codebase. One big reason is lack of documentation.I worked on software where the customer would want various features added. It had grown over the nearly two decades it existed until no one really knew the full extent of what the code did because, surprise, surprise, it was never documented. But even if it was, rewriting is only nice for the programmer. The end user generally doesn't see much. Rewrites often introduce bugs and leaves out key features because the developers never knew what all the features were.This is why certain languages hang around. Many newcomers think the industry is quick to jump on languages like Rust and abandon Java, but it's not just the language, it's the massive amount of code that runs and works. More than that, it's the data. If you switch platforms, is your legacy data compatible with the kind of data the new platform expects? In electrical engineering terms, this is called an *impedance mismatch* (which causes inefficiencies in power flow).For PHP, what I heard was it was easy to write, but hard to maintain. That is, people wrote bad code. It was blamed on PHP, more than the coders. It also came when the web was young, so there were still chances for other web frameworks. I'd say the 2010s were the era of these web frameworks. React, for whatever reason, won out over Angular. Vue and Svelte came later, but when a community heads to one framework/library, it creates a critical mass which forces others to join.For example, most web devs need to know Javascript. They could use Dart, but Javascript seems more essential, and so Dart (other than through Flutter) didn't come to replace Javascript.Often, there aren't exactly technical advantages. For example, most people agree Python is a pretty slow language. Despite that, it's become the language used in numerical methods, data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and AI. How did it do that? The main attraction was its simplicity (ish). But also, it allowed for code written in C to look like Python functions. If it were written in native Python, it would be very slow, but because it was optimized in C, a compiled language, these libraries run fast.Python has a huge set of libraries that do all sorts of things. After Java, Python may be the second most popular language taught in US colleges. It's become the language to use for AI coding, so everyone jumps on that bandwagon.But, it could have been Ruby. It could have been Clojure. It could have been a brand new language (unlikely).

The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and ""something"" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.In your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say ""hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x"" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says ""ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database"". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.This, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve.

Then I ""discovered"" that FP is production ready in maybe 2008, never came back.To me OOP is related to stateful objects (that aligns from the original idea of Alan Kay who invented the word ""OO""). In today's world the most actor systems approximate closely the original idea of OOP.encapsulation, polymorphism etc are not specific to OO. There're problems:\- it's extremely hard to reason about state. Mathematically hard, think Hoar's logic, so OOP composes badly \- mutable state doesn't play well with multi-threaded executionSo to my opinion the OOP as concept is dead (as is FP as concept). We're living in the world where polymorphism and encapsulation is as readily available as juggling closures in most languages. The real difference is ""state oriented programming"" vs ""value"" (or ""expression"") oriented programming.

For example, in the context of back end web dev you've used Express to specify a chain of handlers/behaviour that each request will pass through at runtime (using .use(), .get(), .post() for config etc.). One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.It contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms.

You'll build familiarity and comfort with this over time. For example, I used to TA an operating system lab where everything was written in C. It was PAINFUL for most students to internalize that all file IO would be handled by system calls, or that the computer knows what folder it should be referring to by referencing the file system relative to the folder the console or executable was launched from.

Don't try to build a project from zero knowledge. Start with any course that walks you through how to write code.2. When you're ready to begin a project, start with what kind of project you want to build. Be really, really specific and don't try to do everything at once. A good answer would be ""an Android app"" or ""a website"" or ""a bot that responds on BlueSky"". A bad answer would be ""a program that's always watching everything I do on my phone and my laptop"", that's too much to bite off. Start with one thing.3. Follow a tutorial on how to build that type of project. If you want to build an Android app, a tutorial will teach you how to get started, how to make the app, how to put it on your phone to try it out, and where to write your code.4. Once you have an empty application working, start adding things, one at a time. Start small, extremely small. Add one button. Now make that one button do something.5. From time to time, it might make sense to set your project aside, learn to do something (like how to call a specific API), then go back to your project and apply it.As you gain more experience you will get faster at this, but you will never stop learning.Good luck!",dmazzoni,2025-08-08 23:32:18,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ml78tv,False,

Getting questions about different projects also requires some context switching and disrupts the ""flow.""

n8bs0gj,"Nand2Tetris is basically a survey of CMPE, covering hardware through compilers and operating systems (which brings it back around to CS). If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.SICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.On that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall.

My go to test is to let ChatGPT generate an image of a sailing catamaran using Dall-E and although the result looks nice at first, the generated image still shows a badly functioning yacht.Things are different when you start using local LLMs. Due to hardware restrictions, my currently best running LLM ist mistral:7b, a downsized version with usable coding knowledge, language support and overall world knowledge. I can use it to improve code and get help when I am looking for what I need to change to achieve a specific behavior (take THAT, CSS!). It is not perfect, but so far it was useful in my work with Angular and NestJS.This is also supported by the availability of systems with a lot of shared memory. Although it is slower than real VRAM, it makes it possible to run larger models on a MacBook or something powered by AMDs Ryzen AI series. A medium sized LLM (20-30 billion parameters) can have very good world knowledge and if it is optimized for a specific purpose (reading documents, helping to code, looking for abnormalities in log files) has the potential to safe a lot of time and work.All that said, the use of LLMs can lead to catastrophic misinterpretations of the data given, so the models have to be tuned to give info on their thought process so you can manage and fine tune them. The way of Google to dumb down search and try to shove down Gemini as the next big thing is an example of what not to do - the results are sometimes funny at best, but can be deadly.

Executive comes up with ""great idea"" that is neither great nor feasible2. Executive hands idea down to VP, who loves the idea3. Executive hands project down to Director with timelines and super aggressive goals. Director already starts getting nervous because this idea sounds unreasonable, and so do the timelines. Also, maybe not that great of an idea once you layer reality on it4. Executive breaks into smaller projects, hands to Managers. Managers shitting bricks because they *know* this shit is unreasonable and they start pushing back while simultaneously getting ICs lined up on how to get things moving in a direction that is most likely to be palatable to leadership when it inevitbaly becomes clear the original idea wasn't possible.5. Manager pushes on Director, Director pushes on VP, VP punches Director in face, Director pushes back again on VP, VP starts softening language with executive, executive punches VP in face, VP pushes back a bit harder, executive punches again, VP remembers that executive doesn't know shit so he starts redifining things so that they sound like what the executive wanted while banking on the possibility that the executive doesn't even really know what they want.

n7sfi04,"I agree with some of your points, but I'll slightly disagree with you on a few things.AI is a factor in the job market, but not what is being pushed. AI isn't replacing entire industries, but companies are so worried about missing out, they are throwing tons of money at it (and likely getting very little return). So, AI is a distraction, but it's drawing lots of investment that could be spent elsewhere like employee salary and investment in non-AI projects. A lot of professional services companies are trying to become AI gurus, because that's what clients are currently looking for. That's part of why I think it's a bubble that has to pop eventually. I've seen lots of non-technical consultants opening up small AI consulting companies, becoming heads of AI practices (mostly sales and management roles), and so many people going nuts on LinkedIn. One or two people who I've worked with in the past, I trust some of what they are posting. Most of the people are just trying to become business world influencers. There are certainly other factors contributing to the poor job market.One thing that feels unique is the current US administration. It seems to be actively trying to destroy the job market. I'll be blunt, I think there are a lot of unqualified people in the current administration, and I'm not sure what their main motivators outside of personal wealth are. They want to lower interest rates. Well, a weak job market will help with that. And they are actively firing thousands of federal employees, killing grants, and all sorts of other actions putting people out of work. But they don't want people to think the job market is weak, because ""Republicans are supposed to be good for the economy."" We'll have to see what long-term impact it has and how long it takes to recover. Other countries are also dealing with inflation, but it feels like the US is dealing with inflation and a bunch of other things. I'm no economist, but I've read a few people argue the tariff policy reminds them of the time before the Great Depression. So, things might get really bad and ""it's different this time."" Or, this is a spot where I can be in the camp that predicted things incorrectly, which has happened plenty of times. I was originally in the camp that the job market would turn around in a year or two in 2022. Thinking back to working during the dotcom bubble, it might have taken 4 years or so for a recovery. But the government was trying to improve things. Now, it feels like the exact opposite.

They're justifying layoffs as cost-cutting due to AI as they don't want to admit they overhired. Pair that with the huge cultural changes affecting large parts of the industry and this is definitely a pivot point for tech, if not totally unprecedented.The more important point is that the number of junior roles in the tech industry has crashed in a way that, historically, it never has, and that specifically may be due to (misplaced) confidence that AI can improve the productivity of mid- and senior-level workers to a degree that means junior employees are no longer necessary.

A junior who quickly learns the above and acts more grown up will do well ""overseeing"" LLM coders. How to upskill people like that is a difficult question. One of the most useful classes in my university ended up being our software engineering class where we went through more ""BS"" type stuff like requirements, project planning, etc and built a big project as a class. Universities might need to dedicate another semester to that type of classes including LLM coding as part of building something large and making changesOf course, the next couple of years are going to be rough as companies try to upskill their current juniors, drying up the need for new juniors. Ideally what would happen is that any efficiency improvements would result in more projects so the labor market would be the same, but we're in this in between where that hasn't materialized, so companies are hedging their bets and holding off hiring until they know if there are efficiency improvements and more projects can be put in their 2026 plans and/or how their HR budgets change.",ZenEngineer,2025-08-08 18:01:56,34,cscareerquestions,t3_1ml190k,False,

n888yi7,"Despite what it may say on a job posting, most of the requirements aren’t actually requirements. Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.That said, yeah, if you’re self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There’s still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.Right now there’s a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don’t have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.As someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that’s just where the market is at right now.The best advice I can give you is:- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it’s a long shot and don’t get your hopes up, but it doesn’t hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren’t “tech” companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says “developer”, “software engineer”, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you’re probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",Drugba,2025-08-12 03:28:09,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1mnx0jd,False,

Their recruiter process questions that should have been an hour were 45 minutes. Making it near impossible to solve the leet code - which were on the long side. The system design interview took 10 minutes to try the app which completely failed until I opened up windows paint to complete. I did bad and knew I didn’t pass - but at day 5 they asked me to schedule a meeting which was a Friday. So I scheduled one thinking - no way did I pass but maybe they want to tell me something else. Nope on Monday I wasted my day for them to call into the meeting - seemingly from their car to say “you failed try again in 6 months”. Like I get you want to be polite - but just call me. I don’t need to schedule anything. I legit could have gone out Monday but now I was wondering what they wanted to tell me. Completely wasted my day to “be polite”, Amazon if you’re listening call people and leave a message if you want to be polite or send a rejection email with the option to talk to the recruiter. Seriously worst interview process by recruiters I’ve ever seen. It’s like their recruiters are as over worked as the rest of the company. It legit feels like a terrible place to work - I’m not upset at losing the job opportunity- I could have done much better maybe but it did feel a bit impossible - the last guy wanted a suggestion class by frequency but just typing that in 30 minutes is a lot and he didn’t know what a trie was - also I didn’t know how to write a trie anyway ( my bad ) but I didn’t study it because the amount of code is too high for a question like this. Basically end to end terrible experience - the study links were nice but the system design links were bad - like those weren’t great answers honestly and in general system design with a mouse is bs. If I ever do system design in the future I’m buying a touch screen laptop or a touch pad. Even the Amazon leadership principals just scream terrible place to work - “Amazon devs are right most of the time”, and some stuff about challenging everything. These are toxic traits IMO.

n7lrdn9,"Having interviewed with them three times, the answer is an unequivocal and resounding **yes**.First, there is little to no communication between recruiters, much less between departments. The first time I interviewed, I got the OA from two different recruiters and the one who had actually reached out had to send the other one an email letting them know I was already working with him. It's absurd that they don't have a system to take care of these issues.Second, they have way too many ""leadership principles,"" and they contradict each other - you can't ""dive deep"" and ""insist on the highest standards"" while also having a ""bias for action."" Their methodology for evaluating them is also extremely flawed, as they ask a question per LP and that is the only data they use to determine how you did. I told a story in one interview about being asked to lead a technical presentation for one of the biggest banks in the world after being with the company 90 days. I then learned (shout out to my recruiter for giving me any feedback) that I scored poorly in ""earns trust."" Yeah, okay.Third, they basically abandon the whole ""data-driven"" methodology with their myopic ""raising the bar"" principle. Who decides how good the ""average Amazonian"" is? Through what process? Twice I was told I was ""at the bar but not raising it."" Another way to say this is that they acknowledged I was better than about half the people there but they will continue to be employed by Amazon but I'm not good enough. Never mind that one of their LPs is ""hire **and develop** the best"" - if you're not one of the best already, you're not ""raising the bar"" and they're not interested.There are some things they do well. They leave the qualifications intentionally vague to cast a wide net, and it's not just for show; they do genuinely give interview opportunities to a lot of engineers (like me) who wouldn't get them from someone like Apple or Netflix. They move quickly compared to other big companies and usually give you a definitive answer within a month of applying.

It is a buyer's market right now for new grads (you, the candidate, are selling).Lastly, imo, $80k starting now vs $100k starting in 3 months is likely going to come out pretty even in the long run. Two reasons for this:1 - After 1 year, the $80k/yr earned you $80k. After waiting 3 months to land a $100k/yr job, you'll earn 9 months of the $100k/yr job with is $67k. After 2 years: it's $160k vs $166k.2 - The sooner you reach the ~2 year mark, the sooner you can look for a new job and make a very large pay increase without being seen as a job hopper, changing too quickly and having little loyalty.It may even take longer than 3 months to land a $100k job.My advice, accept and optionally keep interviewing.",chesterjosiah,2025-08-11 17:27:57,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1mndksr,False,

You're only just over a year in.Obviously you just can't 'wait' to get better and something has to change because people have been noticing. One thing i think this is evidence of is you may be hyper-focused on 'requirements' vs just putting yourself in the shoes of a normal user. And what i think that kinda means is, forget about work and the requirements of the task for a moment, and just use the app like you would any normal mobile app or like you would visit any website in your leisure time. What things do you notice? Or maybe you aren't thinking about these things when you're browsing the internet because you don't want your experience to feel like work.This is how I got better at form UX and really tightening up my code before review. In my casual use of the internet I come across forms all the time, and i think about how annoying ABC is because its clunky, or why XYZ is so frustrating to use because it doesn't respond how i would expect a modern form should. I take those real human feelings and use that when I code forms. A great real-life example is how annoying government web forms are because if you mess up you have to start over; how dated the UX feels and functions when you have to fill out all your HR paperwork online for a new job. How annoying and inconsistent the experience is when applying for jobs holy shit! hhahhaAnd so what that translates to on the job is ""I just know how I want to feel when I use a form"" and in my effort to achieve that UX i just happen to check most if not all the acceptance criteria.

n7n486w,"First, stop worrying about wasting time. Time invested up-front trying to figure out what you like will unlock a lifetime of enjoyment. Second, feel lost but don’t stay lost. I don’t know a single person who made it anywhere worthwhile who hasn’t felt absolutely and hopelessly lost at some point in their life. But if you sit in your own mess you’ll get nowhere so don’t underestimate the power of starting small to try and figure stuff out.Third, who cares? And I don’t mean this in a condescending way. But more like, so there’s other students who do better, so there’s people ahead of you, so there are millions of calculator apps or whatever, but frankly who cares? Unless you’re trying to become a billionaire with your first app (which is a wild delusion for most folks at some point) your thought process is wrong on this. You need to crawl, then walk, then run. Which means build the things others have made, at least you have guides. Build off of those if you want, I promise you some guy on stack overflow 9 years ago has answers for what you’re stuck on. Personal projects are about learning what you enjoy doing. To that effect who cares what others have done, if you enjoy doing it go for it. I promise doing what you enjoy will push you that 10-20% above based on motivation alone.Fourth, just start. Whatever it is, just start. Internships, coffee chats, mock interviews, career counseling through your college. Just start. Analysis paralysis is very real. The only way past it is to make some decision even if it end up being suboptimal. You need to break the tie.Fifth, discipline. I hate it, most people hate it. But the phrase “hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard” still rings true. Whatever you choose to do, stick through it. If you’re an international student I’m sure that alone comes with a fair amount of discipline. Being thousands of miles away and still doing what you’re supposed to do everyday. It doesn’t matter if you join leadership or be an IC. You need consistency and discipline to see results.Lastly, I’ll say is, while learning to keep going is important, learning when to pivot is even more important. Note I didn’t say quit. Pivoting is just redirecting your energy to what makes more sense for you and your interests. You have limited time and limited energy, you can’t do everything heck even Superman can’t. So you need to learn to prioritize and pivot.For right now, rest assured that 2 years is a drop in the ocean for a potential pivot to a rewarding 40-45 year career. You’re not a lost cause, you’re just young. I promise you everyone is as confused as you are. Just start something small even if everyone has done it and stay out of your head so you can keep marching forwards with whatever pivot you choose in your life.",styada,2025-08-08 18:03:12,14,cscareerquestions,t3_1ml0zcj,False,

The more unique and personal this idea is to you, the better. Lastly, something important to note is that you likely won't get all the knowledge you need in your classes. You're more than likely going to have to learn some stuff on your own, but luckily, YouTube makes that fairly easy!",joliestfille,2025-08-10 23:11:12,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,

n80r2of,"You got some morale advice already but concretely speaking, you're on the right track with projects. You do need them. Priority should be internships, however. When you're a freshman it's harder, they mostly go for sophomores and juniors since they're closer to grad and thus return the company's investment quicker.If you're a freshman now, it sets a pretty good schedule for you. If you can't get an internship, which is usually the case, you spend the first year working on projects for the resume, and then use that for internships the next two years, and try to get a return offer after grad from one of those. When you're a sophomore, set yourself a fixed (# of apps) daily goal, even if small, and start.As for the projects themselves, I can't tell you what to make, but I'd started with a website with three.js. It was fun to write thanks to Three, it lightly dabbled in the process of hosting it etc., and it resulted in something permanent online, which imo is more satisfying than a local terminal program unless that serves a real use. Even better if you do something with even a small amount of users, so you can get started on databases.If you want to go more hardware/embedded CS, look into making an RC with as many functional systems you can put into it. I made one last year that I remotely (from the library lmao) attended some in person courses with and had classmates charge it in the room. Very transferable to swe? Not really, realistically. But it made me get to know many people and boomed my enthusiasm, and you really need that.TLDR don't care about my experiences: For your projects I'd recommend trying to solve a real problem but realistically, people usually fail to find something like that, you just need to start with anything to fill the resume and get the habit going.",2016KiaRio,2025-08-10 23:06:03,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,
n80rdo6,"Welcome to an awesome field! I also did C++ in high school xDAs for projects, there are a few things you can do now that you're comfortable with the basics:1. Expand on uni projects, especially those you find interesting. You're already doing them, you can work on them further and put 'em on GitHub.2. Think of whatever CS topic you enjoy or think you might enjoy (gaming, data analysis, web development) and/or real-life topic (history, finance, music, medical) and make something related. Doesn't matter if it's overdone (web shop, library record keeping) or novel, do something you'll like :)3. Don't go too big, you'll burn yourself out.4. On a similar note as 3, don't worry about perfection. Make something perfectable first.5. Use Git with all of your projects (publishable or not), get in the habit of writing good commit messages, and push everything to GitHub (and/or GitLab, if you want). These are greay habits for later. I think only 20% of my repos are public.Don't worry about publishing a project. Play around, take tutorials, make dumb scripts, and write whatever code comes to mind. Maybe some of it will be interesting enough for you to work on it further and take public.You can also try Advent of Code for code challenges similar to what you know (algorithms, data structures), with more flexibility than LeetCode/CodeWars. You can make your solutions public too (not the inputs!).You're very young and have tons of time to find your niche(s), so experiment early and cheaply.Things to keep in mind:- Try learning testing (unit testing especially) early, it's insanely useful and highly required in industry.- As mentioned, use Git with all of your projects.- Don't let LLMs like ChatGPT write for you. Especially this early, your skills will stagnate. This includes BOTH code and regular text (comments, commit messages, README files).- Do use ChatGPT to learn what you don't know, but also read documentation. Both are very useful skills.- Write a Readme for all of your projects (not right away, but over time). Markdown and documentation are both very useful in industry, and for those repositories you make public, READMEs are super important (arguably more so than the code).Don't overwork yourself into early burnout. Work on what you enjoy (and obviously your actual uni work), and if something is good enough, feel free to make it public. But until then, explore as many areas of CS as you can (embedded, low-level, programming language theory, AI (many subfields here), web development (front and back), operations/devops & Cloud (maybe a bit later), desktop applications (like your console apps), etc.).There's no deadline for this, do it in your own time :)",CaporalDxl,2025-08-10 23:07:52,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,

The situation is exactly like yours. Continuously moving targets to always make me feel inadequate, never praising any kind of work I do even though the previous manager and my manager 's manager were giving me very good reviews etc. He is exactly like your current manager, giving no clear expectations, no clear communication and always saying that I should have thought of XYZ from the start. I don't mind feedback and I actually implement a lot of his technical feedback. It's the continuous subtle accusation about lack of professionalism, carelessness etc. there were many times that I was the only one looking at prod issues, I would resolve them, put a summary in public channels of what was the issue and how i resolved it, and then instead of getting a "" good job for figuring this out"", I would have to explain to him why did it take me 2 hours to resolve for example instead of 1. But what REALLY pisses me off is that he doesn't practice what he preaches about professionalism. He will release stuff without testing, release stuff without updating the database to be on the same version etc. But no one tells him anything because the rest of them are nice people. Anyway there is not much we can do. I actually did go to my previous manager and asked him if I could report back to him. I didn't go into details about my current manager though, I tried to avoid all the extra drama. I just want to get out of this situation. He said yes and he would request for the change. So I guess it helped having someone higher up that I had worked with in the past and he knows me already. But it's been a few weeks and nothing has happened. Maybe he didn't think it was urgent.

I will ask again and probably this time I will be more specific about what the issue is, because I can't keep asking without giving concrete reasons.

You didn't do bad, its just the unfortunate need to filter down the candidates. And generally that's because interviewing is a costly process for companies. But, it's not always the case that you get filtered out after that call - but generally the sign I look for from the recruiter is they'll go into: telling you about the interview process, and telling you that their scheduling assistant will be emailing you to get your interview availabilityI've had good calls that I just don't understand what might have went wrong, and what I've picked up on is when the recruiter goes into that spiel, then I've def made it to the first technical, I can relax. That wasn't the case when I was interviewing Jan 2023.One thing I adjusted in my phone screen approach with the recuiter is I try not to go into deep or prolonged detail which sorta invites them in and gives space for an actual normal convo. They have your resume in front of them anyway so you dont' need to go deep into it, and in fact, letting them prompt you for that info is good. But other than that, I think you're doing the right preparation - and if anything I don't think this call requires any rehearsed or extensive preparation.

Not strangers you message on LinkedIn to try and milk them for a job, not randos you run into at a meetup and aggressively shake hands and exchange business cards, not some random redditor you DM'd.Your friends, family, and colleagues.So ""networking"" as a verb, means expanding one of those 3 categories. Colleagues is only really expanded by actually working, or going to school.... so that's a tough one to grow. Family we're stuck with. But friends can be expanded.Meetups are a common suggestion here not because they're job factories, but rather because if you go to an event with a bunch of people all interested in similar things (tech, rock climbing, playing cards, drinking, what have you), *you make friends*.So maybe that's not the answer you wanted... but it's the answer. If you want to network, you need to make *genuine* connections. Not connections where the entire reason you're talking to them is to milk them for a job. How would you feel if you had a job, and the one and only reason someone was talking to *you* was to milk *you*?",SouredRamen,2025-08-11 21:42:17,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1mnojyz,False,

I cannot tell you how many times, pre-COVID, I'd get a call from a new agency recruiter (always the same agency; it was a revolving door) and their corporate-standard script was ""just calling to do some networking with you about..."" **No**. That's not how you do it and that's partly why your call went right to voicemail. We've never met before and you don't even understand what my job is, and you're not interested in learning about me or what I do. I gave you my elevator pitch and your response was ""hmmmm...yeah, I don't have anything that's anywhere near that right now, but let's keep in touch"" - but I know you won't. I was a keyword hit on a search and you're padding your KPIs, that's all the call is. And you're trying to figure out what keywords to use so you can get a hit off a job posting database where you can throw me in as a candidate, ignoring my salary expectations. Not that it matters anyway, because your approach is going to bear no fruit, you'll wash out in a year, and the next batter will step into the box to take another swing (and miss).And this is why I removed all LinkedIn connections to 3rd-party recruiters 6+ years ago, and don't accept connections from new ones.

n85qfx6,"I think LinkedIn is trash to actually look for jobs, but it does have a good company search tool here: [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies)There's 16 million companies on that search page with just the US filter set... obviously not all of them will be hiring right now, or hiring SWE, but there's literally an endless number of companies out there, you shouldn't be running out. That said, something important for a new grad to be open to is relocation. If you have your pick of the litter, sure, stay local, but *most* new grads are relocating for their first job so that they can apply country-wide. Especially in a market like todays.Another approach I take is just searching Google for search terms to find lists of companies I'd be interested in applying to. ""Top companies in \[industry\]"", ""New up and coming companies in \[city\]"", ""Best companies for new grads"", etc. There's lots of different search terms, each of which will find you multiple lists full of companies to apply to.And especially as a new grad, the F500 list is your friend. The super large companies are the ones bulk-hiring new grads because they have the infrastructure to support them, whereas a small ma & pa shop likely doesn't and wants someone with at least a little experience to hit the ground running. This is another reason why being open to relocating is so important early career, there's only so many F500 companies in any single city.Timing also plays a role. A company that's hiring 0 SWE's today could literally be hiring 20 SWE's tomorrow. If Pepsi doesn't have any roles I'm qualified for right now, I'm not going to give up on Pepsi.
