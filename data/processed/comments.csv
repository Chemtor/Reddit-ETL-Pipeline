nnfkk05,"I don't think data quality is purely owned by product managers any more than security, availability, and scalability are.The biggest issues in my opinion are: * Data & software engineers and product managers have little understanding of the impacts and contributing factors to data quality issues. * Data engineers build systems in which they copy the encapsulated schemas from source systems into their warehouse to then transform them. Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems. As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts. * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time. dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this. * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment. Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.It doesn't have to be that way.

The way they do so is perfect for them.Marketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.The only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business. Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X. They couldn't give 2 hoots for the fact they bought product line A which is different from product line B.

BI for short.Data engineering can be, and often should be, a part of doing BI, but doesn't strictly have to be (depending a bit how you define DE, which is a different controversial topic). And DE is also applicable to situations that aren't BI. And BI is more than just DE, as you've observed - choosing how to model the data uniformly, for example, isn't really DE (IMO), although many data engineers also know a lot about data modelling.A platform that does all this stuff is traditionally called a data warehouse - and these days, that can encompass things that aren't strictly a data warehouse in a micro sense, but could still be described as a data warehouse in a macro sense. (Very little terminology in this area has really super-precise definitions that everyone agrees on.)Normalisation is actually not necessarily the way to go at all, for data you want to use for analytic purposes (""making sense of data""). _De_normalisation is often more appropriate. This is a huge discussion area within data modelling: a great place to start IMO is the book ""The Data Warehouse Toolkit"" by Kimball and Ross. Get the 3rd edition. This is not just a random book rec, it's a really foundational text in this field, covering ""dimensional data modelling"" aka ""star schemas"" Not everyone agrees with it but I don't think anyone should be critiquing it without having read it.In terms of tooling and platforms, you can build your own stack using tools (often open source) that each focus on one smaller thing, doing it well; or there are big enterprise offerings that aim to provide everything you need in one package. Databricks and MS Fabric are two of those that get discussed quite a lot.We settled on MS Fabric for my org (mainly my choice) and it's been a huge success for us.

And it is because most of their business systems are built by software engineers. * Sometimes they mature and separate the marketing/acquisition teams from the product teams and that is usually the death knell for centralizing product and marketing data.* That leads me to marketing data. It is usually the lowest requirement on the totem pole and at the same time it is the most difficult to deal with - it needs the most modeling, it doesn't ever rationalize (compared to accounting data), and its systems and tactics change the fastest. Almost no one ever gets this properly centralized/joined/productionized.* Sales-led companies (particularly the ones that don't have a digital product) revolve around the CRM (as they should, it is the *sales* system in a *sales-led* organization). Parallel efforts to pull data out of the CRM and join with other business systems are competitive for dollars and brainpower of decision makers. It is easier to build out the functionality of the CRM (apps and integrations) than it is to build out the data practice in the org outside the CRM.* In ecommerce of the last 6-7 years there has been trend toward Customer Data Platform, which I see as directly competitive to data warehouse. I have never met a company that said ""we are soooo glad we invested in that CDP"". Most never get fully integrated.

Since MotherDuck rolled out support for the DuckLake lake house format (and DuckDB recently introduced white support for iceberg tables), this might fulfill your catalog needs as well. If you really need a rich ontology of your data rather than a simple data catalog, you might want to check out some data virtualization options such as star dog. Ontologies come with a ton of additional complexity, and you will be more restricted in where you can store your data / what formats are supported, so I would recommend avoiding the ontology route unless it truly is a critical part of your business. If you need to support very large scale, I would look for options that have a serverless pricing model available and incorporating that into your own customer billing.

nngmmh4,"The cleanest most ""correct"" solution I've seen on GCP is to switch to the KubernetesPodOperator. The gist is that every single task in your DAG runs in its own isolated Pod in GKE. This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\_id, task\_id, and most importantly, customer\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny But if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a ""good enough"" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\_in\_hours \* cost\_per\_hour\_of\_worker.

If your Airflow workers are not dynamic or they use the same pools of compute for all tasks, having a tagging system that trickles up into GCP/AWS billing is likely not possible. However you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. Regarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.My opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go.

(Ironically now we want to jam everything ino columnar store table file formats, that can partially trace to Vertica - Stonebreakers columnar OLAP db (fit for purpose)). The core issue is that our infrastructure layer never evolved to make fit-for-purpose systems practical at scale. We know different workloads need different data structures, different storage engines, different consistency models. But the operational reality of managing multiple specialized systems, keeping them in sync, and reasoning about data flow across them remains prohibitively complex for most teams. State management is a big reason for this.So we get stuck with pragmatic compromise. Teams choose Databricks or Snowflake or whatever and then bend their problems to fit the tool, because the alternative is managing a constellation of systems that might be technically superior, might better fit the different business needs, but is operationally untenable.There is a ton of conceptual inertia in industry too. We think in terms of linear data flow: source to warehouse to consumption (ETL or ELT). But that framework doesn't naturally accommodate materialization into multiple fit-for-purpose targets. The tooling, the abstractions, the operational patterns are all built around central systems of record (BI, Analytics, Dashboards), not around dynamic materialization.This is a key problem I'm working on. Until we have infrastructure that makes it trivial to materialize data into whatever shape and system the workload actually requires, without creating operational chaos, we'll keep defaulting to whatever single system we've already adopted, even when we know it's not right for half (or more) of what we're asking it to do.The inertia isn't just conceptual.

nn6epnv,"I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.First, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.Second, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.Third, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.That said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.I am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this.

nn1o6n6,"I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.As for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",Kardinals,2025-11-04 12:49:22,2,dataengineering,t3_1oo5u6o,False,

nn1ps3k,"Thanks! That absolutely makes sense. I’ve heard similar things while discussing this with other data engineers. For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.What’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously. So it feels like while in some industries it’s still considered a “risky zone” for newcomers, others are already investing in dedicated governance teams.",UnusualRuin7916,2025-11-04 13:00:53,2,dataengineering,t1_nn1o6n6,True,

Because of that, roles inside data teams overlap a lot and people end up wearing many hats. So the recommendation to enter through any data role if you want to move toward governance is valid. It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.It can also be risky.

I was young and inexperienced and stormed in and demanded an explanation why they had ""regressed our performance"". He calmly explained the situation. To get the release out on Saturday night he had to modify the structure of the data slightly...in a way that was incompatible with my traversal. He had spent about half an hour trying to figure it out, writing unit tests to test the old and new structure...old passed, new didn't, the issue he was troubleshooting came down to the algorithm. It had no tests other than the ones he wrote. No comments explaining the reasoning behind it. It was not obvious to him why a convoluted and non standard algorithm was used. He had to fix it, and had to support it, so he did the reasonable thing and replaced it with a well known algorithm that worked with his new unit tests. Problem solved, release shipped.Starting to sympathize with the predicament he was in I explained my concern...the performance wasn't ""optimal"". ""'Optimal'? how do you know yours was 'optimal'?"" I stammered a bit and conceded I didn't actually know...but it \*was\* more efficient. ""Benchmarks?"" ....""no...I never benchmarked it"". ""What cases does it work with""....""oh..this and that and the other...."". His response was ""how do you know?"". ""I tested it!"" .....""No...no you didn't. There were no tests. There are now. We know this works, when it works, and how it works."" I responded indignantly ""but it's slower"". ""By a couple milliseconds, a few dozen times a day it runs. Do you care about that? Why? Isn't it better to know it works because it is tested with cases we expect it to handle?""""Yeah. If I write unit tests to fix the trivial issue with the original algorithm can I replace it?"" .... ""I guess you can....but is a few milliseconds of execution time a dozen times a day worth the effort? Don't you have actual bugs to fix?"" ....""Yeah....""....""Then do it the next time you change that code"". It never had to change. I never put it back.If I'd written unit tests showing the conditions the traversal handled, what it's preconditions were, etc he would have fixed the trivial issue with it and gone about his way, me none the wiser. Because I did a shoddy job it became his problem, and he fixed it the most expedient way possible...reasonable while the entire release team is twiddling their thumbs waiting for a critical fix.If you don't unit test your code it doesn't really work.

The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project.

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. Through coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.At the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.Anyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. While this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.All in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years. It's never too late of course to start but I can't help but think if I had put that effort in when I was 15 I'm sure I wouldn't have ended up in a warehouse.

nmunn5u,"First of all, you have your boiler plate stuff. Creating the solution and the main project, setting up configuration. I have separate projects for different parts.* Main program - UI / API (+web) * Business layer - called by the UI, contains operational logic* Data layer - called by the Business layer, houses Entity Framework code or anything that accesses the database.* Models - usually a sub-folder in the business layer, this is where the DTOs go* Services - also usually in the business layer, this is where classes that do stuff not directly related to the business logic (fetching/processing external data like HTTP or file calls, CSV, etc)* Database scripts - I'm a database-first guy, I like to write SQL, and use EFgen to (re)generate the context and models whenever the DB changes. I use DBUp to sync changes across environments. This is obviously optional. Then I think about the data it's going to be working with. I usually start with the database first, creating tables and indices, thinking about what kind of data I need to store. I might miss a couple of things that can go in later.I then think about how I want to access the data from the outside. I create a business layer class for each ""domain"". A domain is usually one table, but it may access other tables as needed. I don't do repositories as they are mostly just extra work, also EF is a repository, but you do you.The business layers job is to restrict how data can be accessed. What goes in when you create a new object? Usually the pattern is* Search - a way to list and possibly page through a set of objects, returning a summarized, smaller object that contains only the stuff that needs to be displayed. If paging is required, I have a generic class that returns the paged set and the total count. I also have a common extendable filter class.* Get - returns more detail about the object. May return child objects as needed.* Create / Update / Delete There may be more, specific ways to interact with the domain, those get added as needed. Sometimes you want to update only one field, like status, progress, without updating the entire object. Separating thouse out give a nice, clean, clear API and shows intent.If this is a web project, the controllers are mostly interfaces to the business layer. I can sometimes call multiple business layers in one place, but I never try to reuse code from one business layer as-is unless it makes complete sense. Don't be afraid to repeat some code. Or if you do, push it to a service that gets shared. The main goal is that each method should be doing something unique, and that if it changes, then everything affected should be minimally affected, i.e. the change shouldn't affect their core behavior.I separate (as much as possible) security from the business layer. So business logic should only care about what to do, not who is accessing it. Sure you will pass in some user information for filtering, and you will have logic that changes based on who is accessing the data, but you should have up-front checks before the business layer is called. This way you can test or use your business logic, either via unit tests or in a prototyping project without having to deal with setting up security contexts.",rupertavery64,2025-11-03 09:06:10,2,learnprogramming,t3_1on6g8o,False,

Correct thing here would be allocating memory (excuse my C++) like `char* p = new char;` and then dereferencing it to assign the value to the memory block that you just allocated `*p = '\n';`The thing with text in "" "" works because thats a string, and string type is const char* which is the same as char* so there is no unkown conversions. Btw, im still not sure on the mechanism of this, like, what adress does it take from the literal value? Does it create a new memory block?

Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, ""signal processing"" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.Expect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \*massive\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.Break everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility. Don't know how to do something in order to know how long it will take? Break it down into chunks that you can research until you know enough to have a good idea of what is involved and how long it will take.Did I mention breaking things down into manageable chunks?

Which is probably why different languages (and APIs) calls it write, print, log, out, or >> ... So what should your translation be? And if you choose the Spanish word for ""write"" as the function name for ""print"", then what'll you do when you suddenly come across another function called ""write""? Should that be called the same, or something different?And even if you succesfully translate all the functions, classes and methods, you still can't translate words like if, while, for, function, class, return and so on - you you'll still end up with a mix.And the worst part is - when you forget what a translation means, and come across some of your earlier code - you'll have no way of understanding what it actually does, if the Spanish-named functions are part of the program itself, or translations of the system-functions.

nnadgly,"> How to figure things out on my own?Kind of ironic that you're even asking this, rather than figuring it out on your own, no?The process is pretty straight forward - you think about it. You read about it. YOU BEGIN BY STUMBLING AROUND, LOST AND ALONE IN THE DARK until you trip over something that might possibly happen to lead you somewhere. You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.Figuring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...If what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff. Every failure informs you of what not to do and how not to do it. You have to know what you want to accomplish in the first place so you can measure how far off you are.> I want to know how I can truly figure things out on my own and study effectively without missing important or essential informationYou need to embrace that you're totally missing shit, all the time. There is a depth of knowledge in front of you that you have no idea is even there, but the more you learn of it, the more profound all future insights would be, the faster and better you will find future solutions.But don't miss the forest for the trees. I've been programming for over 30 years - I'm tickled that Unicode is backward compatible with 1830s telegraph equipment, and that means something to me, but it doesn't mean anything to you. You're not there and it doesn't have to matter.> while also avoiding wasting too much timeThis bad attitude is not going to serve you. NOTHING is a waste of your time. Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, ""wasting time"" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you. You may not yet be on the path you want, but you're learning all sorts of other things, and it always comes back around to aid you.",mredding,2025-11-05 19:08:35,2,learnprogramming,t3_1op92xf,False,

There are comments, descriptions, attachments, and workflows, backlogs, and sprints (or kanban). It is pretty easy to create simple tasks and you can go as deep into it as you want.

nnmqdpc,"Jira is absolutely a solid choice (when it isn't atrociously slow, but that's not something you need to worry about). I won't try to convince you of something else. Below is more of a personal observation to put my recommendation in context.I have worked with a lot of bugtracking/planning software. bugzilla, trac, redmine, jira, codebeamer, github issues, IBM doors... big and small, well-known to self-made. At the end they all do more or less the same with varying degrees of usability and features.And some things never change:- Planning is mostly garbage. This isn't a slight against you, this is universal. The entire agile movement at its heart is about the realisation that planning longer than two weeks ahead is reading tea leaves. If you need to plan, plan only enough to keep people busy for a week. Ideally the subjects of what needs to be done should fit on a single screen. Jira can do that, a text file can do that too.- Any planning tool is only as good as the people maintaining it. It's a non-trivial commitment and it is thankless work, and people who like coding will quickly forget about it. Only commit to processes you can also keep up. Jira can model entire epics and release plans and whatnot - and will gladly rot away with outdated information unless you slavishly document everything there.- Text is king. Whatever you do, a few month from now you'll need to find it again within the hundreds of tasks you did in the meantime. You can search for text, but you can not search for audio or images. Try to keep everything as text as long as possible. The tracker may have fancy images or support draw.io embeddings, but as soon as you try to export to pdf or copy paste into a code editor or try to localise it breaks in creative ways.- Locality is also king. Every external tool is a chance for things to go out of sync or to get lost. There's an old open source project where I have been contributing for over two decades now. We've gone through 5 different bugtrackers in that time. Every time the decision to move was correct in the circumstances, but every time it meant we lost the entire bug history.",aanzeijar,2025-11-07 17:44:12,2,learnprogramming,t1_nnl51dn,False,

We will only do this for a short period of time, like 3 sprints (6 weeks), then we go back to the process.The process is good and it works, but it is a slower more methodical and sustainable thing.",Ok_Substance1895,2025-11-07 17:31:57,2,learnprogramming,t1_nnmkg76,False,

If they have an operating system (e.g. linux) then you can use VM langs. These tend to be your bigger devices with more power. If battery operated customers really care about battery life. If you have 30,000 sensors around the country with button cells in, you want it to be 5-10 years before you have to replace those... so we use microcontrollers and C (sometimes C++). Custom protocols are sometimes seen, but LoRa(WAN) etc. are common too. You need to be comfortable at the bits-and-bytes level ideally.

And these are all scenarios where a solution like site builders, CMS etc are not only easier, but often the most appropriate solution. Any experienced dev will tell you there's no point reinventing the wheel unnecessarily, and you really want to avoid building yourself from scratch anything that handles money or PII.Companies that do need custom web app development/maintenance, are hiring teams of them on long-term contracts or FTEs, via job postings/recruiters/consultancies, not from bloody Fiverr or the local community notice board.

You’ll get a subdomain they give you and also can add your own custom domain. I love them.Why SQLite? SQLite doesn’t require a database server. You basically read/write to a local file and that’s the database. For small to mid size apps it’s great. If you are lucky enough to need more rails will make it (relatively) easy to drop in MySQL or postgres. And by the time that happens you should have the knowledge or money to make it happen. LiteFs makes it so you can have one server be primary with reads and writes and then have your SQLite db replicated around the world to different servers acting as read replicas. Fly.io makes it so that all post/put/patch/delete requests go to the primary and get requests go to the geographically closest server. For things like verify a users account from an email - a get requests that ends up writing to the db you will need to have an intermediate page which auto submits a form and/or allows a user to click a button to do so. That way you just execute read from the email link and then a post request for a write.

I'm not super familiar with the details; you'll have to do some research.Honestly, if you're targeting non-technical users, it's probably easier to simply rent a VPS and have users connect to it.If you rent a VPS and register a domain name, you can set up a standard HTTPS cert with Let's Encrypt, then use an nginx reverse proxy to do the actual encryption. There are plenty of tutorials of how to do this on the Internet, and LLM's understand how it works, so you can ask them questions about the details.If you don't have a domain, or for self-hosted servers, [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77510803/how-to-make-a-simple-https-server-in-p) is how to get started doing HTTPS in Python (as opposed to using nginx). Note, you have to generate a key / cert on the server, and then you have to somehow get the server's certificate to the client.",white_nerdy,2025-11-05 03:02:02,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ookjgh,False,

Had to move back in with my parents, it all made me miserable. Finally decided if I wanted to do something worthwhile, I would need a degree.

Transferred to a different (better engineering school), COVID hit, decided the work I was doing in CS was remarkably boring, did really poorly, felt wayward again.

nns2uxn,"Yep, this is one thing I think a looooooot of execs either underestimate or don't even think about when they decide on a layoff.When I was laid off in early 2023, half the engineering department was let go, so from 16 people down to 8. Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.In the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.One of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, ""If we offered to bring you back, would you?"" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.Layoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.The entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.There are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay. I'm not saying layoffs should never happen or are never necessary, but for all the ones I've been through they definitely felt too reactionary and didn't consider the aftershock among those who remained.",ModernTenshi04,2025-11-08 15:38:28,139,cscareerquestions,t3_1orqj3y,False,

Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass. So there’s a balance you need to find where you come up with how to test and the AI just writes it.

My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.There's 2 approaches to this:* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one.

nmxiy6g,"One of the big issues right now is the industry is in a downturn. There’s debate if and when things will turn around. There’s a chance by the time you graduate, the market will be better, but there are no guarantees in life. There is a general shift away from remote work. Hybrid is more popular these days, although there are some places going 5 days on-site. It won’t be impossible for you, just hard. There’s value being in-person, especially earlier in your career or time at a new company/team. You don’t need to necessarily love programming, but you need some combination of competence and caring. When I say “caring,” I mean wanting to do a good job rather than half-ass it. You don’t need to work a million hours. There are a lot of really lazy devs out there. And a lot of people want to gatekeep the industry to those “who truly care.” I’m not trying to contradict myself. In latter scenario, caring means people who eat, live, and breathe tech. You can still be quite successful without that. There are some online universities, if you really cannot stand your current state. There are about 3-4 that are regularly recommended, but their names escape me at the moment. Definitely a step above University of Phoenix. You will be getting a real degree. One other thing to consider is some women don’t like tech working environments. Men in tech can be weird for several different reasons. You have the original nerd types, and now there are tech bros. There have been initiatives to increase the number of women in STEM, but YMMV how each company has done. I saw this post in another sub and thought it was interesting. It’s open to some interpretation. https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1n5xc3s/im_told_that_our_engineeringfocused_culture_is/There are also tech roles that are don’t require coding.

nniwr7u,"\> start letting them fail immediatelyThis may seem like a harsh way to phrase it, but it's not a bad idea. For example, when you know people underestimate, why aren't you calling them out then and there? I don't mean it in a accusatory way, I mean are you aware of where the discrepancy is coming from, e.g. ""code complete"" vs ""rolled out 100%"", does it account for KTLO/distractions, high intensity work (focused dev) vs low intensity work (babysitting some request to another team), are there unspoken social pressure dynamics, etc. And have you articulated the impact of these heuristics on your team's estimation skills? I've literally had to tell people ""don't tell me the number you think I want to hear"", for example, when I smelled a ""going through the motions"" estimate.On the code quality front, ""letting them failing"" is another way of saying to give people autonomy to potentially shoot their own foot (and then own up to it). Rather than taking over the driving seat, you can ask questions like ""what have you tried"" or ""have you considered X"" to put the bulk of investigation work back on their court and indicate that they own the outcome of that task.",lhorie,2025-11-07 01:46:37,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1oqflk2,False,

EM does a lot more in the realm of fielding requests for work coming from other teams. Understands our capabilities, commits us to work that is in our ballparkand so our tasks to start are usually very broad in definition, something like ""Add Drawer Login Component"" with really just the design files attached and some bigger acceptance criteriait's on us to break that down to the smaller manageable tasks, and point them as a group. Then they're just added to the queue for the sprint, that's what we've committed to. All unassigned.and so now, anyone can pick up any of those tasks, let's say given an assumption we all have similar skillsets. Maybe a junior picks up a task that is a little more difficult; they can either take on the challenge, or maybe a more mid or senior stops them and says - ""oh hey this might be a little more involved, but you can help me build this part of it"" and create another ticket.So now we're all trusted to get the job done by doing all the discovery and now we have to work a little bit more together, and everyone has an idea of who's taking what. Junior A is prob waiting on bigger design things from Senior B before they can start. The senior would be inclined to prep the junior on what they have to do. or get them to focus on something else while Senior B finishes.You, just kinda make sure that you're aware of the progress, and the more senior engineers are there to identify risks. And you need this teamwork to happen, in order for you to be able to focus on the more important thingsEngineers handle their own PR reviews, since they've been working more closely together they already have context of the changes, they've prob already done an initial once over, and things move a long quicker.anyway i think you get it but keep in mind this is the IDEAL state of things.

Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company.

nn8yf0v,"This is kind of a brain dump, but hopefully it helps:There are four types of layoffs (at least):1. The company is doing bad and they need to cut costs to stay afloat2. Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more ""efficient"", which actually means ""overwork the shit out of people""3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fineAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.A company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.A company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.And lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.I think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market.

Stability of position may ""feel"" stronger and your psyche will appreciate it.

With a company doing layoffs expect lots of changes in direction and reorgs.So basically, your thought exercise while not totally impossible is hinging on two assumptions: the company was hurting before and the layoffs are improving their standing, and that these companies would be even interested in hiring in the first place.

He also noted they couldn't pay as well as startups tend to pay.I just told him that two of the startups I worked for laid me off in under a year, and the middle one went public and fell off big time after that, so I wasn't exactly keen to stuck with that kind of volatility since I was married with a kid and a mortgage now, so something more straight forward and established sounded really good.Now, full disclosure?

I did want stability, but I definitely saw them as a place to hold up while the market settled, but I would very likely be out of there when something better came along, even if it was a startup.

nnzzpeh,"Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).One last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!Good luck, you’ve got this!",ConceptOfWuv,2025-11-09 21:22:33,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1oskmf5,False,

nn4lesf,"Did this about a year ago. SA / sales-adjacent roles were not on my radar at all, I had 8YOE as a SWE. I just thought the role sounded interesting and applied. In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. I’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.I’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet.

It just sort of happened because those teams took me in early career and it just... sort of kept going on like that since then.I am purposely rerouting to full stack side from purely BE as I am noticing more and more job postings want full stack (so doing best to adapt to the job market for future job searches).>what factors helped you choose your pathtbh, I don't know. I think for most of my career, I didn't know much so I just adapted given the work I was given. And I never really gave much of a thought. It's really difficult to know anything early career and all I knew during college was I absolutely wanted to avoid networking, C++, OCaml, machine learning. Looking back now, I feel thinking in absolutes is not good and I should have given those fields a try.I did do data engineering side (more niche) early on but quickly pivoted away because I noticed data side was going to get paid less than general engineering (the trend was dying and the number of job postings were too slim so I escaped while I could early career).>How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?Job Security - Feels nonexistent. I think this is the worry with generalists. I am way too easily replaceable by offshoring as offshore infra matures more and more. I wish I would have specialized and am doing my own sort of specialization in some ways (explained later on).Compensation Growth - Leaves to be desired. If I could redo I would have run immediately to Machine Learning. The pay premium is so much greater. It's noticeably more. Basically about $80\~200k more a year when you are senior/staff. And career growth (promos) seem much faster for more niche fields. For instance for those in security or ML, they can get external Google Senior offer at 5 YOE. A generalist might need 10 YOE in comparison and get paid worse.Day to day satisfaction - I find working with motivated coworkers with a decent manager is what sets the day to day satisfaction. Not the type of work I do.>specializing in a niche vs being a generalist?While my skills are generalist, I am 'specializing' in business domain. That's how I plan on 'buffing' (?) my resume. So while my coding skills are generalist, the domain I am working on is becoming more specialized.I definitely noticed how helpful that was when doing a job search recently.[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025\_job\_search\_2\_month\_long\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025_job_search_2_month_long_results/)Applied 18 companies and 15 gave interviews. All 3 that didn't respond were for generalist roles that were far off from my business domain. And the 1 recruiter who ghosted me after recruiter call was also for a role far outside the business domain I worked on.If anything, I noticed throughout the interview process the jobs that were closely in lined to business domains basically just gave me offers (freebies). It's a huge advantage to have experience in closely related niche fields.I say specialize early on in potential in-demand fields if you can because the ones with high barriers of entry like GPUs, AI inference, etc are extremely difficult to offshore. And basically have no competition once you have sufficient experience (best for job security). And can command huge premiums in the market as you become senior+ (+ promos are easier and quicker).If you cannot specialize like that and you are a generalist, at least specialize on the business domain. Why wouldn't a hiring manager pick someone who is exposed to similar business domains over some random candidate who worked on something completely different? That said do keep in mind generalists are the most replaceable so offshore worries will be a bigger threat over time. :/**I honestly feel generalist just sucks. Most easily replaceable/offshore-able.** **Specialize in what companies need but cannot find. It's all supply demand and promos/compenstions do reflect such as well.** **Have knowledge in many stuff but be deep in 1 topic.**In a bad economy, also keep in mind while generalists can apply everywhere, specialists (in domain or busines knowledge) will be first in line for those jobs.

nmvr66b,"Love the question. makes me think more carefully about my path.First off, I have intentionally never hired full stack engineers, so I vote for specializing in front or backend. That's an interesting topic to get into, too.Myself, I've serially specialized in both my roles and what industries/segments I've been focused on. In both cases I've tried to get as deep in the speciality as practical. Roles: backend dev, product manager, project manager, software & systems architect, no-hands-on people manager. Bouncing from one to another hasn't held me back. I honestly couldn't say which I enjoyed more and the world needs all of them. With industries, I specialized in systems (primarily app servers and orch platforms), dev tools, data agg/monetization, and vertical search engines. That might not seem like a huge range, but each of them are pretty specialized and their first choice is to hire people from their own space, so the segments are a factor.I don't think specialization necessarily holds you back from making changes. As a hiring manager, for a mid-/senior dev I want to see people have been in 3-6 companies in at least 2 industries over 4 to 12 years digging as deep into whatever they were doing at the time to be great at it.

For example, tell me about a time you couldn’t get consensus on something. You could say, I got feedback. How is by holding a meeting, getting feedback from a doc, one on one questions. Why is because it’s good to offer many avenues of feedback. Etc. Next, if you can, be sure to listen to the interviewer and offer ways to help them if possible. For example, after they ask you this question, you could ask, have you been having a hard time getting consensus on your team?

Because of this there's a sorta schism in the talent pool for consulting. My advice is to really read into their resume and figure out if it's fluff (it usually is).

If it's a large company, a fast-moving company, or both, it can take closer to a year.Two: We are all our own worst critics. We see all of our deficits and fuckups. Meanwhile, when we see other people's work, it's because they landed something, solved some problem, gave some slick presentation, etc. Don't compare yourselves to others. You will invariably be comparing your messy practice sessions to their greatest hits.Three: When the great jazz guitarist Pat Metheny was asked by an interviewer how he got so good, he responded ""easy, I made sure I was the worst guy in every band I was in."" Talk to the people whose work you admire. Ask them how they think about problems. If you see a slick piece of code or a clever solution, give it the old \`git blame\`, figure out who wrote it, and message them saying it's cool and asking how they came up with it. Pay attention in code reviews. Get a mentor who is more senior in the same org and role as you. Even if you are the worst guy in the band right now, *that's the position where you do the most improving*.I've been where you are now, and it sucks, but it doesn't suck forever.

nmxvo1p,"I wouldnt use the market as a way to make that decision. You gotta do what's best for ou. Personally i think the only way to get a master's is if you got it for cheap (i.e. a job paid for it, or you got a lot of scholarships). Basically if you need to take a financial hit to take it, it's not wroth it because you wont really see much of an immediate upside iwth it. I think in your case, it does makes ense to go for it. You can get it in a year, and even if you got loans it's not going to be enough that once you land a job you couldnt pay in a year or so.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-11-03 20:26:48,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1on2rlx,False,
nmu4sho,"Personally I would say stay at your school if you’re going to finish faster. Really unless you’re at a school that no one has heard of you’re going to be fine. Especially applying for full time positions, a single internship with relevant experience to what you’ll be doing in the position you’re applying for is worth WAY more than a degree from like CMU, MIT, Stanford, GT, etc. That said, these places might get you better connections, but at the end of the day you can make up having a less prestigious school in your resume by having strong projects and or internship and co-op experience. Also once you get your first real position, no employer really cares about what school you went to or what your GPA is. If you’re interested in graphics programming, I would start with picking up a book on OpenGL and actually building stuff. Possibly using something like Open3D. As for if you should get your Masters, I would look now at the types of jobs you would like to apply for after you finish school. If most of them require a master’s degree, then yeah get it now. Speaking from experience it’s way easier to get it straight away than trying to go back. I tried after i started working full time and my wife and I had just started a family and finishing my masters program was more than I can handle. So if you think you might want to and you have the means to do it, I would say do it now while your brain is still in “school mode” and you don’t have a bunch of other extra responsibilities to balance. The other alternative is to get in somewhere that will pay for your master’s, but that seems to be increasingly rare nowadays.",skeletalfury,2025-11-03 05:56:22,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1on2rlx,False,
nng1rhj,"I got my master's in a year and I wouldn't recommend it, but it depends. If you do the thesis option, you simply won't have enough time to do significant research. I did the thesis option and my research project was pretty much an implementation of existing research. I was paying out of pocket though so I couldn't afford to stay longer than a year. If you can only stay a year I would do the exam option in which you need to take a final assessment instead of doing research. My friend did the exam option for his master's and he found employment rather quickly whereas I'm still struggling to find a full time job.",NEK_TEK,2025-11-06 16:52:23,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1on2rlx,False,
