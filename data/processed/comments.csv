DuckDB is far more advanced than just an implementation - handling data types, optimize query plan, and it needs to consider other things like scalability and generalization for other cases.

Handling a collision at write time would mean shifting the entire array in memory.And if you are pre-allocating the memory for collisions, even if you account only for one you are basically doubling the size of the table. And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.If the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.Super cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",StefanBelgica,2025-09-14 09:18:00,1,dataengineering,t3_1nfxgze,False,

The real problem is not just the raw throughput, but the architectural fragility. This is tightly coupled and brittle, and has other issues apart from scalability:* Adding another consumer requires us to change the existing architecture/code* DB failure causes data loss and downstream reporting failures* Schedulers like pg\_cron/cron lack automatic retries and timeouts>Would this stack you have built be required for the typical workloads you'd be working with in a real system?Yes. These patterns are fundamental to high-volume data platforms. I've chosen each component to solve specific problems that emerge with high data volumes, complex workflow orchestration, and advanced processing requirements, though not all of them may be required in every case.Thank you for your feedback.

So not so much of a circle, but building on top, it kept the data catalog and added a snapshot catalog. Also, Delta and Iceberg are designed for huge data, in this case it makes sense to not be limited by the scaling of a single machine OLTP database, even for the metadata, by storing it with the data.

Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won’t line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it’s a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn’t create too many tasks. I’ve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute.

Seems like Dremio allows users to build folder structures to align data product collections with the business model (e.g. sales folder, finance folder), so a different way of organizing your catalog. But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts. Something like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics. It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves. They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts. Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a ""semantic layer"".Is Dremio working toward adding that capability as well?

neu90h0,"As to advantages:Some very useful features become much easier if you have multi-table transactions / true ACID compliance. Sure, not all use cases need those. But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. To begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transactionWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. There are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. For example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portalOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshotIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.Performance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.Locking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't.

Performance of those views might suffer with a lot of scalar UDFs?I'm not sure how you're calculating your final combined DQ score: I'd be wary of that as it's easy to end up with something a bit meaningless.I use a different approach where each individual _relevant_ data quality concern gets its own view (one ""rule""). So a validation of website format would be one view, returning 0 rows if everything is correct. Each problem is one row, then. I would probably use SQL UDFs if I needed to abstract one piece of logic for multiple views, but that doesn't happen really with our data. The views all follow a consistent approach with common column names etc, then I have a process that collects and merges records from all views. Because each view is doing just one thing, it's very performant. But the view quantity does rack up. The overall data quality measure is just count of problem rows collected that day, and count of rules with at least one problem.There's also metadata in a special magic comment in each view (written using JSON syntax), describing why the rule is important to the business, who is responsible for keeping it empty, and how to go about clearing it. For me, that stuff is essential to maintain somewhere, because it ensures the results are actionable. This metadata is snapshotted daily to a SCD table, so business users can explore the full ""rulebook"" for data quality independently from current extant problems.

If I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications).

Way too many people in a similar position to yourself spend so much time trying to min-max, find the ""best"" or ""most efficient"" approach that they have already wasted a week just thinking about it. That week becomes a month.Most efficient method is to start with something and build from there.> Honestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insightsBy all means, take an introductory course into DE. I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful. That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.A lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say ""I started with a course and 6 months later I got my first DE job"". Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job. For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.The process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy. It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a £20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure. It's not to say that you can't do it. In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can. Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead. >Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?I will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head. Just go for mid. The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago. The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market. Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated. One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.Forget junior level positions. Aim for mid level positions. Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced. Be good at communicating. Practice being a mix of honest about what you don't know as well as curious to learn new things.

I tried Airbyte and Meltano for quick ELT demos, but DreamFactory was the tool I kept because it instantly exposed my Postgres tables as secure APIs without extra code.

These gadgets would activate, or maybe deactivate, upon becoming wet, and send some sort of message to an app on their owners’ mobile phones. For example, I could put one at the bottom of my garden near the drainage ditch. If it got wet it would alert me, and send a message via my phone to a server than could then push messages to my neighbors and maybe my town public safety people. The gadgets could probably be the size of AirTags if you could make them efficiently. That would give you a crowdsourced network of alerts.This sounds like a fine project.

neh5sjb,"So, how serious are you in working in this?For near real-time river water level (around 15 to 30 minutes delay), you can get information from https://publicinfobanjir.water.gov.my/. Which also has rainfall data. So you don't actually need to develop a device and place it your self. If you explore the website above:* Water level information, such as normal, warning, danger, caution.* There are links to some states sensor telemetry website.* State specific infobanjir. With more detailed information, such as camera feed.* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.These are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.You can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.You can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.As for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.I'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. You may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.As for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.So, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. For flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. This is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?Here's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.I do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.Anyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.If you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\_id=1059.Anyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",zemega,2025-09-16 05:23:49,7,learnprogramming,t3_1nhtsu3,False,
neh7p3v,"I’ve done my Masters thesis on low-cost flood and water level detection at uni, and there are ways to implement this with relative ease, even if you have no support or collaboration with local government. One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs. If you want, you can also place some reference point on the bank and measure its visible portion’s length on every image.If you’d like to chat about the data collection and processing aspect of things, drop me a DM.",ilsandore,2025-09-16 05:40:39,8,learnprogramming,t3_1nhtsu3,False,

I always recommend starting away from the computer, and simply **sketch out what you are going to do**. It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:* start the game * reset score, health and positions* game loop: * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer * move enemies * move player * check collisions * if player hits enemy: inc points * if player-health < 0, exit loop* game over * display score * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the gamesomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.Then when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then ""run"" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *""Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...""* and you try to put it somewhere else.This doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of ""playing the game in your mind"" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!As you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",peterlinddk,2025-09-14 09:03:10,10,learnprogramming,t3_1ngif2e,False,

neve673,"I will go in the exact opposite direction if some comments here: This is a tough question to answer, because it doesn't really matter. I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. The more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for ""applications and tools"", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? If you want to be the most versatile, able to learn ""anything(TM)"" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to ""count""): \- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! You should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. Additionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. I think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production.

The CPU just sends the signal to the chipset which handles the actual I/O data transfer. The data read/written are handled in RAM. When the operation is done then the CPU is notified by an interrupt.This was truly enlightening to learn and helped me understand asynchronous programming in C#. If you do an I/O operation synchronously then you're just blocking the thread and at most waste the CPU with instructions that wait for the interrupt (this is handled by the OS).But if you use await/async with Tasks then you're really sending a fire and forget signal. Once the I/O operation is done the interrupt is handled and continuation of your code might run in a different thread (based on the task scheduler).,0x0000000ff,2025-09-13 04:17:57,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nf3tju,False,

You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==""1"" : list.append(input(""What do you want to add?"")) elif input()==""2""...')- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself - level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.For bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called ""designer"" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.The more you do, the more you learn.

Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift.

This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.Reusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.Or if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip.

nedmhfx,"1) at a university? Yeah. You'll learn enough of coding but especially good programming practices which will make you a good fit for jobs in the future. Though i recommend padding out your resume whether via internships or simple certifications cause entry level can be rough to get into. 2) Not really, AI is here and it'll affect things but even if AI is used for coding it'll require actual programmers to fix its problems and implement things. It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. 4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good. Generally uni will teach you coding from scratch so it's not like you need to learn a whole lot by yourself beforehand. Ofc that will help with assignments and allowing you to feel comfortable with coding but not required. I do recommend you learn a little with whatever language your school uses the most in order to be ahead of the curve.

nedm4qm,"Yes, do it.It's a great idea to start learning on your own. While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.It is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.I'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.My advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner.

nedz0s8,"Hey :) I am currently writing my Master Thesis in Cybersecurity at a University in Germany. I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better. I can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. I feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience. If you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.Regarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law.

Now that you know that, you have 5 years to get familiar with the ways you will interface with AI tools so that you can make sure your skills stay relevant. Keeping your skills up to date is a requirement of most jobs, certainly most tech adjacent jobs, so you just know one space you’ll need to focus on well in advance.

They teach entire college courses on it because it is an incredibly good demonstration of \*a lot\* of proper computer science concepts. And the way those games render is not at all how modern stuff renders, so you're going to have an extra step going from oldschool pixel plotting to modern programmable shaders.Those games were made in C. You could use C++ or rust or java, I would suggest C++. You'll need to pick up a graphics API. Anything that can plot pixels arbitrarily would be good enough, something like SDL.I'm not trying to discourage you, but \*making\* something like doom is very difficult. \*Porting\* doom is not, because Doom itself is built to be portable, you only have to rewrite like 7 files to port doom, but \*making\* doom is and of itself a very, very difficult CS problem. You don't just need to know comp sci, you need to know best practices, and have a good grasp of boolean algegbra. Doom is going to be throwing around terms like ""R-trees"" or ""Binary space partitioning"" so be prepared.At the heart, what you want to make is a raycaster. Not \*ray tracing,\* but raycasting. The idea is you will write something that shoots rays out into the world, checks what they collide with, then renders that collision. It shoots a ray for every vertical column on the screen. That will get you a basic wolfenstein-like look, but those games, \*especially\* doom, do way more than just ray cast out in to the world.

As for how long it took me, I mean it took me about 3 months to finish just the JavaScript course because I was really taking my time with it, but in reality the amount of time it takes you to learn doesn't really matter.

Also, if you're planning on building real and useful skills I would suggest staying away from AI as much as possible when coding. If you want to learn how something works or you need project ideas then sure, AI is great for that, but as soon as you start using it for generating code your skills will go downhill because it gives you a false sense of learning.

You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.If it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.So it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.Understand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.There are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.The important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app ""feels slow"", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request ""fans out"" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.Test automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?Understand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?Impossible to answer in the abstract. A system is ""overengineered"" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?There are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [""The Grug Brained Developer""](https://grugbrain.dev/):""grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too""""seem very confusing to grug""",teraflop,2025-09-14 15:12:58,5,learnprogramming,t3_1ngt349,False,

Is there desire to grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. To find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code) products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans.

I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.But there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.The good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.Just as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [""Simple Made Easy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [""The Mess We're In""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.Also, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.EDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit.

neytehq,"""App"" is just a modern mass-media washed name for ""program"", they mean the same thing.The code is just text, it's a text file, you can use any simple text editor, like notepad, that can edit text files (.txt files, not Word docs).But using notepad is a huge pain, only really useful as a last resort.There are programs for this, which will help you highlight important things, tell you early about errors, even run your code with a button press, and ton of other stuff. They're called IDEs, those are the ""everything and a kitchen sink"".There are also ""text editors"" or ""code editors"", which are a bit simpler, less powerful, but still powerfull enough for professional work. Lot of people like them because they're smaller, simpler and faster than IDEs.You'll also need some way to run the code.For JS, the most obvious thing is the browser. F12 in firefox, or Ctrl-Shift-i (i think) in chrome opens dev tools, where you can type javascript straight into the console, no other program necessary.But if you want to be able to save it, the simplest way is to make a file something.js (you'll have to make sure it really ends in .js, some naughty operating systems like to hide it), write some code into it and drag-drop it into the browser.But for anything more than half hour of messing around, get Webstorm (IDE) if you can get some student license or trial or something. Or a text editor, like VScode (I hate it, but most people love it), or SublimeText, or one of million others.There's also Vim and Emacs. Don't touch those for at least a year. Vim is a DIY text editor that beats most IDEs, and Emacs is a text editor that beats some operating systems. They are extremely powerful, but they have brutal learning curves and require lot of programming skills to set up.As for learning material, lot of people here often recommend something called ""odin project"".

ne9ibvk,"> What’s the best way to approach learning so that I can really understand Python and reduce my dependence on AI? Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?This question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.This especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.If you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?If you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.If you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.Finally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries.

In that case you can use those.Or it could be none of the above.

I'm also usually a huge believer in throwing oneself into the deep end and just figuring it out, that's how I learn.But... I don't think that it suits every kind of person.

As for your complaint about matching exactly (which is what I'm more interested in responding to) I disagree that it's overly pedantic which is the impression I get that you have of it. For one, in an actual dev environment that's approximately how pedantic the tests are (although usually you'll have access to the tests which helps with matching strings). For another, most of their projects are reimplementing other projects that are in use and define a communication protocol. So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.As to your point about whether to recommend it, sure I agree it's not right for everyone, but I personally feel the tests are quite reasonable.

It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.We all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.But it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.Nowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot ""Why am I getting \[pasted error\]?"". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.I also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.AI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.I'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",SouredRamen,2025-09-16 18:25:07,97,cscareerquestions,t3_1niov8g,False,

nej0cdq,"I would say remember that “personality cannot be taught” does not necessarily mean “be neurotypical”. It ABSOLUTELY CAN mean that in SOME work environments, but I have found tech is generally more forgiving than most.Most of the autistic people that I personally know are not combative, or pointedly rude, or generally frustrating to be around. You don’t have to have a maxed out charisma stat, you need to not be miserable for your coworkers to interact with. I have ADHD for example and I interrupt my coworkers all the time but they live with me.ADHD is a poor proxy for understanding what it’s like to live with autism, so please do not take this as me attempting to be reductionist toward legitimate struggles, but one thing I have found helpful is to stop assuming my condition is the barrier I’m facing. It might CONTRIBUTE to the barrier, but plenty of people before and after me have had ADHD undiagnosed their entire lives and they never even knew. I’m glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded. Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.I had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I’m getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I’m extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.Don’t panic, you’ll be fine.edit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven’t.

nerk8w7,"The pattern you usually see is this: if someone comes from very humble beginnings with no networks, no capital, and no guidance, and still becomes wildly successful, there’s usually an incredible amount of luck involved. Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.Take Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.If you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.Finance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.So if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper.

It all sucks.Managers are either do nothings or know-it-alls. Everything rolls downhill to the devs. Insane requirements. Insane deadlines. Insane constraints (oh hey - now 90% of your code has to be crapped out by claude - enjoy!). More politics than DC.The mba's are only 2nd to the tech school grads in terms of being insufferable. Everyone critiques everything endlessly and in the end it doesn't matter how impactful you are - someone else takes credit upstairs for everything.Succeed in this cesspool and you are rewarded with more and harder work while the execs hire their college buddies and leaders from companies they acquire fill every high level tech roll without so much as an interview. You will stay in the mines and you will like it!And that's the thing... you kinda can. If you let go a little and you don't worry about that next promo - or the product - or the customers or any of it. At the end of the day you take a task - you do it and you move on. It's kinda fun that way.No it won't make you a superstar. But - if you are looking for respite that's where I've found it when I needed it. In the day to day grind. Ignore the politics and the idiots - don't volunteer for anything. Don't attend any optional meetings or answer anything on slack that you don't have to respond to. Let someone else do it. Give yourself luxurious timelines and estimates and then just code for a while. The code is fun - it's interesting - it's a never ending experiment in order and logic. It's the best part of the job. Don't worry about fixing the architecture or righting any ships - just do the fun bit. Let others code be buggy - let the tests be a joke - let the libraries be undocumented and uncommented... and for all that's holy - don't worry about upgrading anything. Just code for a while.

What you see on social media is the top 10% of all tech. It would look completely different - perhaps even bleak, if someone actually showed the day in the life of a median (50th percentile) or worst (100th percentile) job.They certainly don't have free lunches, nap pods, and may be even lucky if they get free coffee. They might be filling out time-sheets and staring down some of the worst-maintained technology with very strict deadlines and constraints for changes. Depending on the country, the median can range anywhere from $40K-80K. Does that sound super cushy to you?>Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers.

The phenomenon is more broadly categorized as ""keeping up with the jones"" within the last century. Only with the internet it has allowed people to share their accomplishments across a larger audience that would not have been possible before.Previously such people would only be able to reach as far as people similarly within their economic circle.

Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids.

If you prefer the testing route you can look into QA or support roles as well. Software dev isn’t the end all and be all of the tech world and there’s plenty of ways you can stay in the space but find things more interesting to you. You may also find that a certain niche is more up your alley, like data, backend, database developer, etc. there’s a lot of places you don’t have to be as “creative” and can just plug along with tasks.

nehck37,"So we had a very similar start (also got into game hacking which led to reversing which is how I learnt x86, and then started programming in assembly before eventually moving to C and other languages). I’m not sure if it’s the case for you, but I struggle with abstractions if I don’t already understand everything that makes up that abstraction. So if you’re the same my advice there is to approach everything in a similar way, learn the underlying concepts (even if they’re “outdated”) before moving onto the more modern approaches. For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.).

I heard it's growing but it doesnt seem in vogue.I'd recommend leaning into trying to become a security engineer or reverse engineering research. It's very niche but so is your skillset.

Keep in mind there are many different software domais to know, you are simply more familiar and comfortable with lower level code. To me it seems it sounds like you would benefit from studying things from the ground up. Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.Alternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.Git and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.Testing your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.As for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.Don't give up!

ne8efcn,"I am going to touch on the retirement finances side of things.Are you going to be paid for this? Will you be a 1099 contractor?If yes to the above questions then you'll have an opportunity to open a solo 401k. Why a solo 401k? Say you leave your main employer. You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.Why do this?With a solo 401k you get two advantages:* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.There is also a third advantage.A 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.The employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.So with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.You just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k.

You need to not only finish your own work but also grow people and that’s pretty hard to do remotely. Maybe you are the exception… Have you done that successfully while leading junior dev’s growth remotely? you just confident because you’ve been an effective IC remotely? Those are two different things, tbh. Your manager’s concern is not unfounded. Especially since you’ve never been a manager before. Learning how to be a manager as a remote manager…good luck. I’ve had 3 remote managers at this point in my career and none of them grew me nearly as much as my co-located managers.Also, managers are supposed to (imo) shield their reports from unnecessary office politics as much as possible. How would you do that if you aren’t even in the office to keep tabs on the said office politics? Your reports, especially the junior ones who don’t know how to manager up, may suffer alone and not know whom to turn to or how to deal with it.Another thing to keep in mind…it’s fine to stay an IC and prioritize family. Not every stage of your career has to be growth oriented. Please don’t become a manager for the sake of the next promotion - those usually end up the worst managers. Become a manager when you are ready to mentor and grow people. When you are thinking about starting a family, it’s ok to take a backseat and coast/autopilot a bit in your current job.

ne5sthx,"TL;DR: I wrote a goddamn novel so here's the brief. A lot of fresh graduates go through what you're going through. You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.I never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. The issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. Because of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.That's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.You should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. A lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during ""ramp up"" which usually takes about 6 months. You got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you.

Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level. For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can’t have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).Also L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something.

I spent probably the first year there feeling like I didn’t know what I was doing. Because I truthfully didn’t.But they hired me knowing what I knew, they liked me personally and believed I would figure it out. After a year or so I felt comfortable with HOW to ask questions, which is a HUGE thing. And to do that, I had to work on things to understand why I was doing them. That’s very much how I learn, and I think many engineers find a level of enjoyment from the field, and that’s what a lot of teams look for. It’s worth it for a company to invest in someone who will learn to do things the right way.Related: The code base was a mess, as it turns out, and direction was directionless as this newly minted unicorn startup ramped up hiring. So a few months after I felt confident they fired half the engineers and the other half 6 months later. This was a week before moving to New York. I spent 3 months applying to jobs and interviewing and practicing questions from my new apartment for no joke, 12 hours a day. I went out after that and enjoyed my new home.

It's not that you have to have a deep understanding of every layer, top to bottom, but at least be able to sketch it out and know a little bit about what it does. It's totally normal if the parts ""far"" away from where you normally work you don't know so well. Nobody will care whether or not you can describe how CAN signaling works. You should probably at least be able to describe what it looks like when the CAN messages are delivered to you though.This in particular is a red flag, so hopefully it's a joke:>“Tell me something about RTOS”>“Uhhhh…you have tasks and the scheduler schedules them….”You've worked on this thing for 2 years and haven't put in the work to understand *any* part of it?

nexjnc5,"I came from defense company where i worked on a radar for 4 years. I then went into one of the companies you listed and worked in their cloud services for aobut 3 years. Your concerns are valid. I dont know how closely related my first job is to your job but here was my experience. At defense, work life balance was a lot better. I didnt have to think about work after 5 pm. The tasks were good enough to keep me engaged but i didnt need to know anything crazy or expand my knowledge really. You could get by and not understand everything. So when you said the quote about not really understanding RTOS, i get that because i worked on things that at the time if you asked me to explain it, tbh i only knew the basic overview of it, not the ins and outs. One of my tasks was actually coding a lot of the receiver and transceiver code too lol. But i was a big overperformer even if i only did like 20 hours a week and chilled the rest. In defense, nobody really disagreed as everybody was just there to give their hours and go. We never really dealt with customers as our project wasnt fully completed. After 4 years i wanted to go for bigger and better and i got in the big tech company (again it's one of the ones you lsited). They wont give you an embedded engineer to ask you things but they may ask you a system design question and the question could be related to what you have experienced at your current job. So youd have to explain how the receive and transceiver work for example. When it comes to coding questions, i think praciticng leetcode and really understanding Data structures is good enough. I think the problem in the interview iwll come when they ask questions like ""tell me a time you disagreed with an older engineer/customer?"" or ""tell me a time you had to deal with an angry customer?"". Unfortunately in embedded stuff, that doesnt come up as much, especially in defense industry. I cant speak for you job but can you answer those questions?"" The vibe i get from your post is that you just do you and there isnt much pushback from either side. Also, be careful chasing these big companies. Like i said i got into one of the cloud systems and for 3 years the work was hectic. I was doing 5x the work and it still wasnt enough for them. I got PIPd after two years and then fired half a year later. Personally the project was just a lot and they expected 60+ hour weeks but it was more like ""only do 40 \*wink-wink\*"". Seniors and principals were too stressed and overworked to helpout and get on calls to help jrs. Everything was a meeting. Standups would take 2 hours because they wanted to discuss something. As a mid-level i was expected to lead meetings and projects. The culture was just toxic and the thing is they can be like this because they know there's a million other people gunning for your job. During reviews you were compared to what your coworkers were doing not what was expected of you. so if you exceeded your own expectations, but all your coworkers are working 60+ hours and have 60+ hours of work to show while you only have 40 hours of work ot show, your manager will go ""why are you so behind?"" and telling them you stick to 40 hours isnt enough. Again this isnt all projects in big tech. Like i knew a guy who worked at AWS which is supposed to be the worse of all of them, but his project was very chill where he doesnt think aobut it after 5 pm. It's very project dependent. All im saying is dont just do it for the money and fame, really consider it. There's plenty of big companiees that dotn fall in that faang bucket that pay just as well. Remember our career pays very well regardless of industry. Even if you make 120k, you are making more than most careers. So dont sell your life for that 200k. Apply to these companies, but make sure it is a right fit for you. Also dont fall in love with the bonus/RSUs they will throw everything at the bonus/RSUs to get you in the door, those are not guaranteed.

If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. Your other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time.

Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home.

new0fsz,"People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.Some background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.Our original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.Towards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. So in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.My wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.TLDR;My situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.My advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.DM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",natey_mac,2025-09-18 13:59:13,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1nk5eig,False,

neqvwfm,"Azure deployments, scripting with Python and Bash, FastAPI, and Databricks is good mix of cloud engineering, automation, and backend development all valuable and marketable skills. Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. Your role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.Before you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for.

Your instinct to prioritize algorithms practice is spot on. Google has a very standardized interview process where they want to see your problem-solving approach, coding skills, and ability to optimize solutions rather than test your memorization of computer science theory. Save the CS fundamentals review for other companies that explicitly test those areas.That said, having solid fundamentals knowledge never hurts and can sometimes help you think through algorithmic problems more effectively, but it shouldn't be your focus right now. Google interviewers are trained to evaluate candidates on coding ability, communication, and technical reasoning within the context of algorithmic challenges. Spend your remaining prep time getting comfortable with medium-difficulty problems, practicing coding on a whiteboard or shared document, and being able to clearly explain your thought process.

neyxv0v,"This will likely be an unpopular opinion on this sub, but I'll just say it.Assuming you have the capacity, I think you should consider working extra to make sure you're learning and progressing at a ""reasonable"" pace. It's up to you and maybe your manager to figure out what ""reasonable"" means. And sometimes, ""reasonable"" isn't really reasonable.I know this sub hates working extra, but I look at it that you are investing in yourself and learning something new. As you skill up in this area, it will give you additional options long-term. Ideally, you won't have to work extra, but anything you do should, in theory, help you learn more and faster. I was speaking to a guy I used to work with. He is extremely smart. He was recalling when he first started working, he said he knew nothing and put the time in to get better. Yes, it can happen naturally with just your job, but there are places that might think you're too slow. It kind of sucks, but especially in this market, I think it makes sense to be willing to spend some extra time, assuming it benefits you in the long-run. Is it full protection against layoffs, etc.? No, it's not. But there are times you can put in extra effort to get out of your existing comfort zone. There's also something to be said if you're genuinely interested in the subject.There are a limited number of ways for you to get answers to the questions you're raising. Either you'll have to ask someone who knows, or you'll have to get your hands dirty and learn. A project I was on years ago had utility functions to read all sorts of settings, etc. I originally wondered how it all worked. Eventually, I had to make changes and understand the actual code. It wasn't doing anything amazing, but it was literally doing what you'd expect, reading environment variables, etc., and using the utility functions to expose the data. In some ways, it makes sense, but there are times we are scared to peek under the hood for whatever reason.You're being given an opportunity, and a worst case scenario is you don't spend the time, and they decide to take the opportunity away. I'm not saying work extra forever, but there is likely some value in doing some extra to help yourself get more comfortable and confident. It's a short-term time investment.I've been working on some scripts related to local environment setup and configuration. Everyone has been doing things very manually. Some people have complained. I'm hoping this makes the team more productive and increases quality of dev life. I stayed a little late at work because I was enjoying the progress I was making. Honestly, it's been kind of refreshing compared to some of the things I've had to do at other jobs.The extra work can consist of your real work, or it can be self-learning about puppet.Edit - Think about it this way.
