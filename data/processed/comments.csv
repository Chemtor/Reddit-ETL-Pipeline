nc76w6m,"Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s. I think there’s three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we’re in today:First and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you’re a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. **Quick edit based on some responses:** I’m definitely not saying there aren’t any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it’s *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor’s recommendation is. Maybe I’m just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn’t exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. Second, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you’re migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There’s a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you’ll have to rebuild it anyway. Third, while the concept of “data” has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that “Can I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?” has become such a ubiquitous question that you can’t really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren’t documented particularly well, if at all. IMO modeling is still important, but it’s largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",No_Introduction1721,2025-09-03 14:31:47,86,dataengineering,t3_1n7fu2f,False,

nc7vx8r,"ooof what a wonderful topic to discuss... shame its not a Friday as I would have more time for a reply. Im being serious this is a ""pub"" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.This industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. When I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.Compute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.With this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.It does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel. What was learned will be forgotten and re learned again.Modelling will always be important, but modelling relies of having some key information.... like what do you actually want to achieve? What are you measuring.... I think most of this sub will admit.... actual requirements are always few and far between. Keeps us busy rebuilding stuff though lol.Id love to see what the modern equivalent of erwin is?Anyway... your not alone...Do you know what would be cool.... a podcast going through the datewarehouse tool kit and data modelling!",ObjectiveAssist7177,2025-09-03 16:34:49,16,dataengineering,t3_1n7fu2f,False,

They don't want to talk about it because they don't have a solution to make it more productive. So, instead of admitting that it's a hard problem and they mostly work on the easy problems, they instead just try not to talk about it.They *should* talk about it - since it impacts performance, data quality, query functionality, usability, and operational and development complexity. And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason. But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult. So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.But that doesn't mean nobody is. It definitely still matters when operating at scale, whether that's data volumes, performance and query response time or its the number of fields, feeds, and models.",kenfar,2025-09-03 16:02:21,9,dataengineering,t3_1n7fu2f,False,

nc90qmp,"As a DW professional with two decades in the domain, I’ve lived through the transition data modeling and data architecture have gone through during those times. When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it’s already 2 years gone!Nowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it’s an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. I guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they’d need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. I’d say it’s just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).Edit: also wanted to mention how the term “datawarehouse” has now been usurped by the vendors to mean “snowflake, redshift or GCP”. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he’s in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",DJ_Laaal,2025-09-03 19:51:44,9,dataengineering,t3_1n7fu2f,False,
nc7pvbg,"Data modelling crowd knowledge has dwindled over the years because of a few factors:\- in the late 70 to the early-90's, large orgs tended to develop their own in-house applications for everything (ERP, Finance/Accounting...etc) so there needed to be practitioners who could design stable, well considered data models which supported OLTP applications. With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff. While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions. This is not as much a concern now. \- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design.

They either make the switch in-house or move jobs and suddenly find themselves in a position of autonomy to build.

ncj6gat,"I worked 2 years with Airflow, then changed to a new company where I have integrated dagster into the tech stack.From a dev ops point of view, deploying dagster to k8s was a nightmare but once done, it works good.When it comes to developer experience, the DBT integration is brilliant. It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.The main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule. Dagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. I ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.Dagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.Testing is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. Can write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.To conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks. Data pipelines are good in both (however, in dagster it gets tedious to integrate a random pipeline with the rest of your asset lineage)",mind_pilgrim,2025-09-05 10:30:25,23,dataengineering,t3_1n912uv,False,

One task that extracts, one that loads and one that transforms. Of course this is highly dependent and it helps to be pragmatic. In some instances you'll need to break these patterns. For example when we need seperate retries, resources or parallelism.For example:- Task one: triggers a lambda to extracts data from an API & stores in S3- Task two: lambda that fetches the file from S3 & loads it into a Snowflake table.- Task Three: Python operator within Airflow that triggers dbt run (could also have this in a lambda).Then on the topic of passing data between tasks. Using the above example, passing the s3 uri from task one to task two would be a great use of xcom. Here, we're mainly passing metadata (row counts, S3 keys, schema versions, URLs, run decisions).We'll typically want to use object storage for larger payloads (CSVs, json, etc).",-adam_,2025-09-03 17:10:43,14,dataengineering,t3_1n7k1wv,False,

And there are tools like Alembic which someone’s already mentioned to help you version, test and deploy these sorts of changes easily and reliably.So “my Data is going to change and evolve” is really not a good reason to use a document store like mongo.The use case for a document store is really when your data is literally arbitrary. By this I mean that it will be completely different from one document to the next. And there’s no particular reason to expect any record to overlap with any other.Even if there is a subset of your data which really does fit this description, you can still allow for it in Postgres with the use of the jsonb column type which others have mentioned.But from what you’ve described, your data probably is very similar and predictable from one record to the next.

In this context, you are giving up a lot by using a document store, such as the ability to reliably query the data, to enforce rules that maintain quality and integrity, and to optimise for certain use cases.

nbsbhcv,"- Understanding their point of view and their background. At my company we have the chance to shadow people in other teams or other groups/departments, like a mini internship. We're encouraged to use these to understand different aspects of the company. When you understand what they do, how they're talking with their counterparts you get a better feel for what they need communicated. Alternatively, having a mentor-type person who can give you direct feedback.- Talking with people directly, asking: ""hey, I just gave you this explanation but I want to improve and want to know which information is useful to you and which one isn't. Knowing what you know now - what would the ideal explanation be for you?""- asking directly how technical the explanation should be, and adjusting on the fly.- slightly different background (R&D) but I learned that explaining the thing that happened in the order that it happened makes for terrible story telling. You need to figure out what the value is for someone, and then cut all the explanations that are not useful in, well, explaining it. That's a tough one for me because it also meant having to let go of my ego - as in: having to drop some information and explanations that I really found good / useful when they don't help in making the messageseven clearer.Maybe ""Storytelling with data"" is helpful for some situations?- I'm not saying that's the case for you but for me one big learning was that I'm probably not the most important person, and that what makes my job interesting to me is not relevant at all. It also doesn't matter whether my solution is picked - not whether it's implemented in the way that I envisioned it. What matters is that the team as a whole benefits from an idea - I had to shift to a broader view of things rather than just of me and my work. This takes self-reflection and it also takes experience. - Also, what I do is a service to others. Have a look at leaders who have a service-mentality to their leadership style and try to emulate them.Generally, what helped was direct feedback and interacting with colleagues. What worked less is trying to figure things out by reading and thinking it through - that useful sometimes but it doesn't cut through my echo chamber. What's still missing for me, some people need an explanation that's not an explanation but a story that they can digest on their level of understanding - I sometimes struggle if I have to simplify it so much that the story stops being meaningful to me.",norfkens2,2025-09-01 04:55:18,3,dataengineering,t3_1n4n346,False,

nbpx881,"The short but slightly rude answer, because this question keeps popping up and no one seems to read the answers: If you have to ask, you're not ready. When you are ready, you will know you are. Data Engineering is like getting a Ph.D in random intertwined data problem solving. It's not entry level, and it's certainly not something you can do with a class or two. Start with analytics, dashboards, learn where the pipelines go, and then start moving up. Once you understand the processes going on, find the next process in line. Keep doing this until you can look at data and understand the whole business use case and story behind the data you're looking at.

nceuw3t,"Firstly, you are asking a good question. You're trying to get a benchmark and basically a decent KPI. Secondly, the answer to your question hardly exists. I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. Myself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. For a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. I learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done. Churning out tickets and bug fixes is a good way to inflate your performance numbers, but it rarely amounts to career growth or any of the stuff you work on actually being used by the business as a whole.",BoringGuy0108,2025-09-04 17:48:38,22,dataengineering,t3_1n8g9il,False,

For example the NFL starts next week, you could scrape fantasy football rankings from multiple sites and calculate each player's average rank (or some other analysis). Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).Then it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer. If you want to get fancy that could be a sql database with a few tables (rankings, sites, players). It could also be a csv. Then another process to aggregate by player across sites and store in the gold layer (if you want you could automate collecting daily snapshots and analyze the change over time). That might be something like another sql table that exists to serve a dashboard.Sports is just one example, there are lots of domains where you could scrape (or otherwise obtain) multiple sources of data then (fuzzy) join and aggregate them. If you don't want to do fuzzy matching and multiple scrapers/interfaces, you could do daily snapshots of something like pokmeon card prices or the weather and aggregate across time.

nbln9xp,"Hey - I worked in the health informatics/interop space as a DE/applied DS.Just some thoughts without digging through the code... most people have HL7 figured out. Some of our biggest challenges are mapping CCDA's (QHINs have a million special snowflakes), FHIR, and EDI X12 (claims). While Synthea can build CCDA and FHIR, we also are lacking EDI X12's big time.The MS CCDA/HL7 -> FHIR converter is meh. We still hit the same issues... mappings mappings mappings.As someone who interviews DE's in this field (in the US)... if you want to demonstrate you understand these datamodels, just put a bunch of ADT's in a dataframe and display a chart. Doesn't need to be more than that. If you wanna do something fancy, you could do something with CQL on FHIR (this would cover all kinds of topics and show you know how to work with a real world problem/scenario).Good luck homie.",Odd-Government8896,2025-08-31 02:56:46,2,dataengineering,t3_1n4emel,False,

Synthea produces pretty clean data, at least in the sense that I believe it places data in the fields where they need to go, the fields are used as intended, and the data is relatively predictable.

Especially if what comes next is a long and complex query that would otherwise be hard for the optimizer to build a proper plan for, if it were to run on a big table.Generally, write operations are slow and resource-heavy.

Go across your files and grab only the most recent data you want/need, merge into a new file, discard the old ones. Whether you want to implement this and how kinda depends on your exact data needs, so it's hard to say. At the very latest, I'd do this before archiving any data.The other is to just track all changes in the data in your silver layer and grab the latest value.

Ship fast where the blast radius is small, slow down where correctness matters.* Invest in tooling mastery. Know your editor, shell, OS, browser devtools, and typing. The compounding payback is huge.* If you cannot explain why something is hard, it is probably incidental complexity. Remove that first.* Fix bugs by establishing invariants one layer deeper instead of sprinkling checks in leaf code.* Use history to debug. Read the commits, narrow the regression window, and run git bisect when the shape fits.* Bias toward shipping to get real feedback. Use pragmatic shortcuts like asserts on invariants, deferring DTOs, and skipping trivial tests when risk is low.* Make debugging cheap. Seed data easily, add local tracing, keep a scratch REPL file, enable frontend debug toggles, dump full state with diffs, and add helpers to jump the UI into target states.* On a team, ask questions early. Do the five minute search first, then get unblocked fast.* Protect shipping cadence. Aim for quick deploys, low bug rates, fast cross-team handoffs, reusable patterns, and lean process. Cut the 10 percent of a feature that eats 50 percent of the time. * Treat slow shipping as a problem to root cause.* Learn to code review. a code review is an invitation for feedback and to get another pair of eyes on your work.

ncirtcb,"Programming languages are called ""languages"" kind of like an analogy to human languages, but it's not really a good analogy. With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are ""Turing complete"" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. Programming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.It is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.In Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to ""modularize"" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.Also SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would ""hello world"" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me.

It's unproductive, disruptive and will likely cause you to make strange learning decisions instead of rightly pursuing what is relevant or interesting to you. It is a journey and you should celebrate your milestones, even the little ones, rather than wasting energy by lamenting the fact that you haven't magically become a programming savant overnight.It's a marathon, not a sprint, do not burn yourself out trying to 'catch up', but do be diligent as there's more than enough to distract us all these days. Anything you learn, even if not immediately applicable, is very rarely a waste of learning.Lastly and probably most challengingly, really reflect on that hatred for maths. Maths is a lot like programming in that, for the most part, it's dozens if not hundreds of fairly straightforward concepts all stacked on top of each other and its the concepts you misunderstand / misapply that trip you up.

Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?The OS is not **written** in binary code. But because it is **compiled** to binary code, which the CPU directly understands, there doesn't need to be any other layer ""underneath"" it.The compiler, too, can be written in a high-level language which is compiled to machine code.> Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer? Yes, this is basically it. You can compile an OS, and you can also compile a compiler, but you have to have an existing compiler to do this. So there's a *historical* question of where these compilers came from. And the basic answer is that if you were starting from absolutely nothing, you would have to work your way up from very simple compilers/assemblers, and use those to compile more complex ones.For instance, you start out with a system that has no assembler at all. It only understands raw binary machine code, fed to it using some input method. This might be a paper tape reader, or a punched card reader, or toggle switches that let you manually enter data one bit/byte at a time.Then you write an assembler in machine code, and feed it to the computer. Now you can write programs in assembly code instead of machine code. Then you can write a C compiler in assembly language. And so on.Once you have a C compiler, you can rewrite that compiler in C instead of assembly, so that it's easier to maintain. And then it can compile new versions of itself. This is called [""self-hosting""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29).But remember, this is a *historical* account of how programming languages were ""bootstrapped"" over the last 70 years or so.

nc3n5ss,"Higher level languages get converted into machine code. Everything gets converted to machine code whether it's an OS or not. It's what the CPU understands, by definition.Generally the process goes something like this:1. You write source code: C, C++, Rust, Java, C#, Python, whatever.2. The frontend translates it into some machine oriented but still cross platform instruction set. It's usually called bytecode or intermediate representation or pcode or something like that.3. The backend eats the intermediate code and gives actual CPU instructions for your hardware.Introductory programming classes love to obsess over whether a language is ""compiled"" or ""interpreted"" but there hasn't been a difference for decades, if there ever was. People just say it's ""interpreted"" if the whole 3 step process normally happens at runtime. It's all going to machine language through some intermediate regardless.A lot of code expects to be executed in the presence of an operating system which is kind of hard to depend on if you're writing the OS in the first place. So we may have to talk about ""free-standing"" versus ""hosted"" environments if we want to make our operating system, and yes, we're more likely to talk about that in the context of a language like C that's widely used both ways and even enshrines the difference in its specification.But the real reason C and C++ (and increasingly Rust) are used for OS development is that they give you tight control over how you use memory, and there's a well established tradition of actually using that control to do things people don't typically expect to lean on other languages for. You can grab at arbitrary bytes of memory through pointers and do things that might be ""undefined"" i.e. specific to your hardware and your compiler. A lot of other languages expect that some kind of runtime environment is running under the hood, maybe including a garbage collector that cleans up memory for you, so it's more like the language tries to bring along all this infrastructure that you might want to implement yourself or do without.Also you've got to keep in mind that there are many different levels of writing an OS. There's the kernel which can be complicated in its own right. Then there can be lots of drivers, utilities, shells, and built-in apps. A lot of the ""OS"" might be more or less just normal application code running in a hosted environment. That stuff can be written in anything, so a whole OS is not necessarily written in just one language. For example, Google did a huge project to try to start writing more of Android in Java, Kotlin, and Rust a while back, though there is still a lot of C and C++ in it.

(Edit: They were less than 50% in [new code](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html?m=1) that version.)The point is it's all machine code in the end.

nc3cd34,"That's an excellent question. Computer hardware and software is largely designed as a big old stack of layers, and understanding roughly what they are will help you understand things tremendously.In this case, the bit you are missing is that a computer program, once compiled, is already machine code. You write a program as a text file, the format of which is the C programming language. A special program, a C compiler, takes in this text file as input and outputs a file that contains the machine code that is equivalent to what you wrote.When you tell the operating system to run the program, it reads the file and puts the machine code section of it somewhere in memory, then points the CPU to that spot in memory and says ""run the machine code at this address."" The computer hardware, which knows how to run machine code, takes it from there.The operating system itself works the same way. You write the operating system as a C program. A C compiler compiles the operating system into machine code. That machine code gets shoved into the spot where the hardware expects the operating system to be (let's ignore how that works for the moment), and so when the computer starts, it finds some machine code and runs it.Even the C compiler works the same way! You write the compiler in C, then you turn it into machine code by running it through an existing C compiler, and now you have a nice new C compiler. You may ask ""well, where did the first C compiler come from, then?"" and that would be a great question.

nc3dog7,"Machine Code (aka binary) is what the computer processes at a hardware level. It’s the 1s and 0s you hear about. But people don’t actually write in it because it’s impossible to read and understand. Assembly is a human readable, near one-to-one translation of binary which gives programmers direct control over every bit of data and where it goes. It’s not the same as a programming language, because you’re not programming instructions, but manipulating data. Compiled programming languages like C, C++, and Java take a different approach, where instead of directly manipulating the data programmers are given access to more abstracted tools, like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and nodes. Complied languages like C still give you more control over the hardware then interpreted languages like Python, but there’s still more abstraction then you’d find in Assembly. But in the end, it’s all complied down into machine code. For clarity, compiled languages are not a step above Assembly in the sense that complied languages are complied into Assembly which is then complied into Machine Code. They’re two different branches of programming with different levels of abstraction, but both lead back to the same root. Now compilers are generally written through a technique known as bootstrapping, where the first version of a compiler is written in one language, and then the second version is rewritten in the language it’s meant to compile.For example, the first C compiler was written in Assembly, but all subsequent versions were written in C.

The C code will get complied down into machine code and run fine.That's broadly correct.One of the nice parts about C is that the language grammar is completely divorced from the standard library. This is not true for C++, but it's not that difficult to replace the portions of the language grammar that are linked to to the standard library (eg, the *new* keyword).It is entirely possible to implement some of the C standard library functions in format that is suitable for use in kernel space. For example, most kernels will have memory allocators similar to malloc (Linux has kmalloc()) and print to a kernel console.>But if OSes don't need to be written in Assembly or even binary, what does? Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?The C programming language was designed to allow the Unix operating system to be easily ported to many different machine architectures. Unix Version 7 was the first version of Unix that was easily portable. It was ported from PDP-11 to Motorola 68K, x86, VAX, and more. Approximately 98% of the operating system kernel was written in C, the remaining 2% was platform specific assembly. One of the nice parts about C is that it easily integrates with assembly.>Are compilers written in machine code?Sometimes, but not always.C is an evolution of B. B is a stripped down and modified version of BCPL.The first C compiler was written in B. Eventually, it became self hosting such that a C compiler written in B could produce a C compiler which could compile itself, producing a C compiler written in C.The first B compiler was written in TMG, and the first TMG compiler was hand assembled using the TMG compiler specification. In other words, that compiler was written in assembly, but it was written in such a way as if it had compiled itself.>Is there something beneath that? The BIOS? Some fundamental code on the processor itself?Processor microcode. That's a different beast all to itself that programmers rarely ever need to worry about.BIOS is just a name for the startup routine and machine interface used by IBM PCs. It's usually specific to a particular motherboard and has the ultimate objective of finding and loading an operating system bootloader. BIOS has been depreciated in favor of UEFI. All modern operating systems generally shutdown firmware services and make little use of them, preferring their own drivers instead.>Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer?C code that is compiled as a part of an operating system kernel and C code that is compiled as a part of a userspace application are no different. instructions are instructions.",Mr_Engineering,2025-09-03 17:03:36,2,learnprogramming,t3_1n6wn93,False,

And to do things like save register state when context switching between processes, switch CPU exception levels, etc. All things that can't easily be described in C in a standard way.

nc4f1oc,"A couple notes about system calls and machine code since self hosting compilers were already explained.OSes don’t use system calls because they are the subject of system calls. They exist to manage hardware and memory resources and provide them to running programs that they organize into processes and threads. A system call is when a hosted program asks the OS for something the OS has sole control over like access to the file system, a network peripheral, or the display. If you want to write an OS, part of what you’re doing is creating that management layer and providing entry points to ask for access.On machine code. If you want to know what that really is, it’s a combination of an operation code and operands. The operation code is a number representing an operation like add or and or left shift or in complex instruction sets like x86 things like moving memory around. The operands can be the numbers of temp storage registers, a memory address, or a literal number. These enter a circular buffer of registers in the cpu and feed physical mux (input selector) components that route the operation to the appropriate physical hardware and open the correct operand supplier gates so it processes the right data. It’s more complicated than that. Look up stuff like branch predictors and the Tomasulo algorithm for examples of doing multiple things at the same time and simulating in order execution. But, machine code contains the literal control switch positions to run the cpu hardware for a given clock cycle or two. It’s the only thing the cpu actually understands.Also, if you would like to viscerally experience self hosting compilers without much effort, there’s a Linux distribution called Gentoo which is irrationally interested in building everything from source. Setting it up takes days though a lot of that is waiting. You take a bootstrap configuration, build a customizable OS kernel for your exact hardware, and then experience using the supplied copy of the GCC c compiler to compile well everything in all its open source source file glory. Often you end up using the out of date copy of GCC to compile an updated version of GCC and GCLIB (and holy hell that takes all night sometimes). Now any rational person will tell you that there is absolutely no reason to build all this stuff from source yourself when the build command you’re using is the standard “gcc -o2 [whatever]” that built the compiled binary distributions, but if you’d like to see it, you can. Btw, I know this because I had a friend who told me that if I really wanted to learn Linux I’d do this.

The difference is just what you need it for. The biggest thing you need to get comfortable doing is breaking things down into smaller steps. Say you've got a project in mind, something simple like making a little calculator app with HTML and JavaScript. Maybe you don't know how to do this at all. Well, how do you break that down? You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of. The trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up ""JS how to add 3 + 5"", look up ""JS how to add two numbers."" Then apply it to your situation. You get a little thinking involved, and you get a little better. Keep at it and it won't be too long before that kind of stuff is easy and you're struggling with harder things. And APIs?

nbovitr,"Partially. I know ""enough"" about ""most things"" (TM) to have a rough idea where to start, for most projects I could feasibly do. But I never look for tutorials. They are really not that helpful at the stage I am at. Normally I go through the following, roughly in order: 1. Libraries. Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. 2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and ""first steps"", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. 3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow. At this stage I will probably have some questions, so I look for people who have either had the same questions and found answers, or I will look for blog posts trying to explain it. This is the only stage where I sometimes use AI, but very very rarely. I have gotten pretty good at getting to the answers with classical search engines, and getting the answers that way is normally better, since I stumble upon a lot of other information that might prove useful later. Another important skill is to find good blog posts. I blocked [medium.com](http://medium.com) completely in my browser, since it's just 95% time wasting blogs that copy and paste directly from the documentation in order to farm clicks.

ncf1o9q,"There are a lot of reasons.For one thing, a stateless component always produces the same output for a given input. That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify. It also makes it much easier to test.For another, when a component has state, then its behavior depends on the order of operations that are performed on it. If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.Usually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible ""region"" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.Just as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",teraflop,2025-09-04 18:20:55,85,learnprogramming,t3_1n8hh96,False,
ncf1nzx,"These are great questions to be pondering, and your observations are good.1. Generally, substitution model vs machine model. If it's possible to just substitute values into a computation to get an answer, it's very easy (in theory) to see where something is wrong. Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become ""pure"" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.Edit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now.

They just need to specify those fields and will get a predictable response.If your function additionally relies on implicit, mutable state, e.g. certain fields being a certain value at certain times that can be updated by anything anywhere, including randomly or by the mere passage of time, then it's way more difficult to use the function correctly because you don't control the inputs directly.No one's saying ""never have state"".

Instead of having memory-local variables, state should be managed by a service that also manages save files (games), or by a SQL database (web services), etc.Local state that isn't persisted is something that you lose between program instances - for a game this means things that the game doesn't ""remember"" when you reload the game, for web servers this means things that you can't distribute across a fleet of multiple servers (which gets both slow and expensive to maintain).It's not wholesale _bad_, but it's also much easier to isolate state and avoid it in cases that call for statelessness than it is to work around the constraints that statefulness brings.",sessamekesh,2025-09-04 19:08:41,6,learnprogramming,t3_1n8hh96,False,
ncf5a3j,"I think you misunderstand what ""state"" is a bit - you are right in that a game is very much dependent on state, basically any game is an ordered collection of transitions from state to state, and a save-game is basically a technique to restore the exact state of the entire game. But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the ""data-model"" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.Statefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.OOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object ""remembers"" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.Statelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.At least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",peterlinddk,2025-09-04 18:38:50,6,learnprogramming,t3_1n8hh96,False,

ncf8ga1,"2 first: Objects are *data and their operations*. State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.1 and 3: Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.Let us back up a little: Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data. At all scales, this is what a program is. From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output. The ""provides transformation and provides output"" is the key part. This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected: Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.This is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance. They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.Now, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches. This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example: In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*. If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\^2 possible state transformations).It is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.Some programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state. With a resulting large amount of bugs. It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).The graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs. Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all. But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way. It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.That minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.So, statefulness is ""bad"" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program. OOP is by definition state and operations.BUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully. And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.Ed: I forgot to address the side-effects problem. State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state. That's the entire point of functions on persistent state. Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",tellingyouhowitreall,2025-09-04 18:54:20,2,learnprogramming,t3_1n8hh96,False,

nc0823b,"Some thoughts on what you have so far:I'd say 1 isn't too important, to be honest. Sometimes it's nicer to have hairy code inlined for developer sanity. Code that tries too hard to separate every little thing into a function is often much more taxing to read. It depends what you're writing. Long functions aren't intrinsically bad. Minor idealism.In 7, avoiding unnecessary assignment is fine and can be very beneficial, but this is getting into the functional realm a bit. In other styles/paradigms, and in practice, assignments are often done for readability where there wouldn't otherwise be a need to create a local to hold temporary state for the computation. Again, depends how general you're looking to be with these rules. Same with 8. Lots of useful functions will never be deterministic. E.g. a function that timestamps something couldn't be considered good here. This works fine for canned computation but can break down in real software.9 also has lots of exceptions. There are many reasons you may want an infinite loop and you rely on them often without realising. Yes, you probably don't want to write one very often in general application dev. It's more important that infinite loops don't block event loops, UI threads, don't spin-lock (unless you intend) a core, and that when errors occur in code that runs as part of the loop, they're handled properly (e.g. recovery if possible/desired) or the process exits, or device is reset etc. Sometimes there is no useful work to do outside of a loop, the whole program is a big loop, etc.I'd add:\- Function is necessary and worth the extra code. Compilers are pretty good at inlining but that doesn't help me reading the code. E.g. You rarely need to pull a single operation into a function (e.g. n << 1) or something. Just write it in place.\- Function interface is fully documented. This includes types of inputs/outputs, and full details of any possible exceptions (and their types), behaviour on error, error codes etc., what behaviour is defined/undefined for given states. Reentrancy (if it isn't, e.g. stores state elsewhere!), thread safety (if it isn't). Locks it will take on resources etc...\- Function output params are reasonably obvious too (not just input params).\- Function code is all roughly the same level of abstraction.

Although the main way to control for maintainability and correctness should actually be the testsuite.Sure we can observe various attributes that functions tend to have in a maintainable and largely correct codebase. And I think you hit some good points, but for many of these points I would actually say there is a 80%/20% or 90%/10% rule, etc. For example, X% of functions should be deterministic and Y% should be non-deterministic. And X% of functions should always terminate and Y% should loop forever.For example, when using the actor model, it is expected and useful to have exactly one forever-looping function (with exception of its shutdown mechanism) per actor. It would make sense to have all the other functions guaranteed to terminate. For other paradigms, the rules should be different. In async based projects for example, it makes sense to have rules when a function is allowed to be async.

Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don’t waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?I don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.My advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",Fridux,2025-09-04 19:58:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1n8evlj,False,

nbht43h,"* **_Code Complete_ by Steve McConnell.** Strengths: provides a strong, comprehensive foundation for how to think about programming and software engineering that I recommend to all developers. Weaknesses: the book is on the long side; the book is a bit dated, so no mention of open source, cloud, CI/CD, TDD, etc; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with no mention of functional programming. * **_Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin.** Strengths: an excellent guide to writing code that is readable, maintainable, changeable, and testable; includes tons of examples, so instead of getting just a list of ""rules"" to follow, you get to see how to iteratively improve code, step by step. Weaknesses: has taken a lot of flak recently for some of the recommendations (e.g., very short functions), or perhaps due to hate for the author (who admittedly can be off putting), but I still think it's well-worth reading for all programmers; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming.* **_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout.** Strengths: does a good job of defining complexity in software and the key causes of it; good discussions of information hiding, error handling, and conventions; contains some interesting counter-arguments to the practices in _Clean Code_, so it's good to read the books side-by-side. Weaknesses: focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming; the discussions of strategy vs tactics and trends felt a bit weak.* **_Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_ by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.** Strengths: the best book I've seen on teaching you how to write automated tests; makes a compelling argument for how tests lead to better software design; includes many examples, and shows you how to use tests to iteratively produce better code. Weaknesses: the book focuses entirely on Java and OO, so yet again, functional programming is ignored; the book can get boring at times when it gets deep into the weeds of the Java Swing threading model.* **_Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_ by Bruce A. Tate.** Strengths: a fantastic way to get exposure to not only multiple different programming languages (Ruby, Haskell, Prolog, Io, Erlang, Clojure, Scala), but also multiple different programming paradigms (OO, functional programming, logic programming, meta programming, concurrency constructs, type systems), which is a terrific way to become a better programmer; lots of great exercises in the book that give you a taste of what makes each language and paradigm unique. Weaknesses: it's hard to be an expert in so many different languages, so some of the chapters are stronger than others.",brikis98,2025-08-30 14:12:50,23,learnprogramming,t3_1n412gy,False,

nbhwjmp,"It can be hard to put these into practice. You end up picking a few things and trying those out first, then slowly add other ideas. Your priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.Also, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.So, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.My advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.You can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.There's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.For example, I encountered something similar to the following: code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30Let's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.It would read better as boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) { return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 || taxCode == 30; }Even if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.The other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.If you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.There are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-30 14:31:26,9,learnprogramming,t3_1n412gy,False,

nclllfb,"I remember a very early coding course I did, and one of the assignments was to build a hangman style game (console only, no graphics). I was at a complete and utter loss, I had no idea where to start. But... the assignment was broken down to small parts. Ask for and take user input. Store the letter choice. Check if the letter has already been used. Pick a word from a dictionary. Check if the letter is in the word etc... It took me far too long to learn that the assignment wasn't about a hangman game, it was a lesson showing how to split big problems in to small ones. Every step was laughably easy and suddenly I had a silly little game to show for it. If you ask me to build almost anything, I'll be at a loss. But I have got a bit better at biting off small chunks and doing those. As another poster said, pseudo code is good. I tend to start fairly high level, and I may even write outlines of what I'll actually need. Load Dictionary from locationPick random word from dictionaryGet user inputStore users letterCheck if letter is in wordIf yestake letter out of word?If notincrement count (decrement towards zero?) (I needed to initialise a counter somewhere) (if the letter had previously been used I should warn the user, and not count the pick) Even if I do those out of order I can make some progress. I'm working on a personal project now to build random playlists from my music library, based on genre, artist, and whatever parameters I can think of. I have *no idea* how to do that. But I know I need to start with reading my music library. And I don't want to do that every time I run, so I want to store that somewhere and rerun periodically (either to a file or database). So I need to think about whether I want to write data to file or database, and figure out how to do that. And I want to take in some parameters for the playlist, but I can do that from a config file of some sort for now. And I'll want to pick a set of tracks which match my params - can't be that hard. Then I need to randomly pick some, and maybe randomise the order. Hmm, maybe I should try and limit the number of tracks from any one artist, or maximise it - that may be a nice parameter. I'll need to know the standard playlist format. Etc etc.Suddenly the whole project seems like something you could do in a weekend. Which makes me wonder why I haven't gotten around to it in the past year... although in that time I have written some code that gives me some nice data on my music library, and lets me do some housekeeping and cleanup on it.",SnooMacarons9618,2025-09-05 18:22:19,6,learnprogramming,t3_1n99osr,False,

For example, you choose to use PyCharm. There's an installation process for that as well, which you skipped. Then, how does one get PyCharm to run the right version of Python.You gloss over *what* a text editor is. Why can't you use Word or Google Docs to write a program? You could say an IDE is a text editor plus a lot more, but we won't get into the details.There is the idea of writing code, then running code, and while you do write and run code, it might make sense to explain the process more explicitly.There are questions left unanswered or partly answered.* What is a programming language?* What is a program?* How do you write a program?

nbx12s4,"Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one). The best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project. The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit. Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound. We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else. The key is the input. What a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground). This is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code). The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***. A library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox. It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks. A good example of this in JS is JQuery. They are typically very specific uses and very tiny. You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine. SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer. A game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic. Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware. In general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them. They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic. Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer. You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",kcl97,2025-09-01 22:31:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1n5x6l2,False,

You might only use a subset of it's functionality, and you might change libraries if one isn't working for you etc. (provided you've achieved loose coupling)Frameworks are more fundamental to your app. You won't change framework, you'll rewrite the app if you do. Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this. When your problem is the problem they're built to solve everything is great, and when you need to do something bespoke, it can be very difficult unless the framework provides some escape hatch. E.g. When Angular 1 was popular it had two-way binding, and you very much had to write your front end ""the angular way"" to keep everything in it's digest cycle (or whatever, it's been 10 years) or it wouldn't know state had changed etc. Digging into the same page with jquery often backfired.",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-09-01 19:16:00,2,learnprogramming,t1_nbvx5oh,False,

Some of them you'll fail multiple times.Life is about learning, picking yourself up, learning, and moving on with the experience you learned.

Think about what you can do to move you closer to the solution. Doing this for complex problems requires experience, so start with simple problems that you can solve with your experience. Do it for years and it becomes a natural way to approach problems.This is what you do every morning when you plan out your day. If you have a meeting at 10:00, and it takes you 20 minutes to get there, you need to leave at 9:40. But if you have to stop by the post office on the way, and it will take 5 minutes you need to include that in your time. But, it also changes the time calculation since you need to go to post office, spend five minutes there, then go to meeting.So, IF you go to the post office THEN add time for travel to it, time at it, and travel from post office to meeting. ELSE you don’t go to post office and simply add the travel time to meeting.Have other errands to run in addition to, or instead of, the post office? Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it. Get to the point where you would need to have left half an hour ago? Some errand needs to be removed…then you need an algorithm to decide which one to do later, or to reschedule the meeting. That can similarly be broken down.It may seem very tedious, but this is how complex decisions are made. You take all the variables and conditions into account, at whatever level of detail is required to give an adequate solution. Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it’s ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.It is tedious. Very tedious. Encapsulation helps with this by focusing on the smallest set of details for the immediate problem at hand.Decompose problems into manageable encapsulations and build up from there.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.At the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.I examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing, select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base.

It is centered on web dev but since you want to get familiar with those tools and programing languages it is a great place to start. They break it down into sections with step by step on how to set up, what it is for, how to use with personal project based learning, you can ask for help on their Discord, and they provide links to additional readings. 1.

You can also look into [CS50 on edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) to practice general programming skills.

ncjloz5,"In the end it all boils down to practice. The more problems you solve and program, the better you will become at it.The first thing to do is to make sure that you *fully understand* the problem. You cannot solve what you don't understand.Then, sit down with pencil and paper and solve the task *your* way, as a human would do. Track down the steps. Test the steps on paper. Refine the steps until you have a clear, minute description of the solution to the problem.Ideally, your steps should be so detailed that they correspond 1:1 to code statements.Practice is what helps. Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.For your current problem: What does being a Palindrome mean? It means that a word read in both directions is the same, like *racecar* or *RADAR*.How could you detect this? By checking the original vs. the reversed word.How could you reverse a word? There are a couple ways, one of which is to loop over each character in a word and to push the current character into an array from the front.You could also just simply concatenate the letters with the current letter being added at the front of the reversed string.Last, you need to compare the original and reversed strings.What definitely is important as well is to *sanitize* the case, e.g. make everything uppercase or lowercase.",aqua_regis,2025-09-05 12:20:02,4,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,
ncjo4yw,"For such problems it may help to first work out a simple example ""on paper"" or ""step by step"" and think carefully about how you're doing it. Is ""DAD"" a palindrome? Why? What steps did you do? Can you write it down step by step like you would do in algebra class? Now do it for ""MADAM"", etc. Now do it for a non-palindrome like ""MADMAN"". At what step in your process did you realize MADMAN was not a palindrome?Now can you write a general procedure for doing this? Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.If you want to get really ""serious"" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to ""stress test"" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an ""industrial strength"" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.In any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome? Maybe it's not defined anywhere, but as a programmer you have to handle that possibility appropriately, either by defining a safe default (e.g. """" IS or IS NOT a palindrome by arbitrary fiat) or else return an error, saying you need at least one character to determine palindromeness/palindromitivity.",chaotic_thought,2025-09-05 12:34:51,3,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,

Then, do it again. Do it again in an hour, then a day, then next week.Each time, you may encounter different bugs that challenge you.

ncnd1cl,"This is a great example of a problem where you can just solve it in real life, CLOSELY observe what you did to solve the problem, and then just write those steps in code. Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.So like, the way you would check if “racecar” is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter. And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say “letter”… I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.If EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome). If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn’t a palindrome.You could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen. So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you’re working with. And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you’re checking the first half against the back half. So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything. But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).Etc. But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part. Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely. Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part. And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part). And then you have to deal with making sure you’ve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",monster2018,2025-09-06 00:00:31,1,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,

nchehl3,"Because code is just the user interface of the internal system. It is not the internal system itself.When you do 'const a = 2' or 'async function fn(x1) { body }' , you are just writing syntax (interface).For the syntax 'const a = 2' , you need to know the js namespace, how it stores value, how scopes works. And then you'll need to know how module import / export works. But under that it's the internal of v8 engine which is a C++ process , and here you'll need the OS structure.For the syntax 'async function fn(x1) { body }' , you'll need to precisely know the dynamics of js event loop , task queue, and the Promise data strucutre. Again they are not just syntax, but the internal mechanics.Just like you won't understand how light-bulb works by just knowing its interface – how to turn on or off. Or you won't understand the computer if you only know what happens on the screen when you type or click something. Sure, you'll know some instance of the (input, output) , but it's just a small portion of the entire space, and without that understanding of internal structure you won't have the reasoning power to effectively prune the searching space. So the result is that you're only memorizing the (input, output) instances and try to abstract it with your empirical understanding.The people who make these tutorials are mostly experts in the software field. But they don't actually know how understanding works. It's the interplay among human internals and system internals. It's why they know something but they won't help you know that.Another huge factor that prevents your understanding is that any piece of tech is designed to its users be less worried about the internals, so the internals are hidden. But it's usually not perfect abstraction to an extent that you can totally not care, so as a user you'll still need to know about that.Also I'm matching people to ship industry-oriented LLM project, and we practice a lot of self-learning strategies here.The desired state is that you don't know something, but you know the criteria of clarity, and you know what you don't understand, so you allocate your focus to hit that and not getting distracted among huge amount of technical details.

Having the path and following it are two completely different things.Also, being around computers is something most people do now. Playing video games is being around a compute a lot, but just loving video games doesn't mean you'll be good at programming. To be fair, being afraid of a computer isn't great news.What's difficult to assess, and you won't know until you start, is how well you'll figure things out. Some people have a knack for programming even if you wouldn't expect it. Maybe they've seemed very artistic, but they also have the kind of mind to program.So, you have three resources. The question is what do you expect from each resource?I'd probably suggest (and you'll get others, so you have to decide)* MOOC with Python (https://programming-25.mooc.fi/). Free (it's also a college course, but you won't be a student earning credits).* cs50p (CS50 is a set of courses offered from Harvard via edX, a consortium of universities offering college-level courses for free)You could do those two at the same time. The goal is to get good with Python (or good enough).Then, CS50w, which gets you into web programming with Python and Flask. It's the same guys that made CS50x (which is Scratch, C, and a few other topics) and CS50p (the Python course just mentioned).CS50w covers some backend stuff.You could use FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript to learn some basic front-end technology. They do also have Python, but I don't think it's quite set up in a course format.Of course, someone will suggest you dive into projects, but I think it helps to know some basics before you do that. The belief is that a good project will keep your interest because you'll be interested in what you build.

For instance we could talk about electrons moving between different atoms, or we could ignore the atoms, and abstract even higher and talk about electricity flowing.In a computer we have the software that controls the hardware, decides how the electricity flows, but it is impossible to grasp all the details - most computers have billions of transistors that can turn on and off, so we ignore the details and talk about the CPU storing numbers in memory, and performing mathematical operations on those numbers. Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the ""world just as it is"" with it's particles and whatnot.In programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on.

To explain, CS50p will cover these topics week by week for 10 weeks aka 10 online lectures:1. functions,2. variables,3. conditionals,4. loops,5. exceptions cases,6. using libraries,7. unit tests file I/O,8. regular expression,9. Object-Oriented Programming & classes,10. recursion.This is more about applying little programming technique week by week. Each week has a few problems to solve using and expanding on the skills you learned up to that point. These of course are not full projects, but still very good practice to learn skills in a controlled and friendly environment. They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.# The Odin Project:This has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.The structure is:* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources* Make a project which is a website such as: * Basic HTML page * Landing page with styling * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.This is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it. For the beginner course they just make these websites hosted on Git Hub, but in the advanced course they show others ways of hosting and using more advanced tools.If you have more questions feel free to ask!",Valuable_Alps4139,2025-09-05 04:56:39,1,learnprogramming,t1_nchy74y,False,

The line: char buffer[MAXSIZE];is telling the compiler, ""reserve a chunk of memory as big as sizeof(char) \* MAXSIZE in the stack frame of this function"". There is NO PROTECTION to make sure you stay inside your MAXSIZE-sized buffer; if you ask the compiler to do this: buffer[MAXSIZE + 5] = 'x';it will happily do that. which will, of course, go stomping on some other variable in your function's stack, or off into unallocated memory, or who knows what. You are responsible for always being aware of where the end of your fixed size buffers are, and always checking your offsets (or pointers, if you go that way) to make sure you are still in bounds.

Even without AI, the job was getting easier due to better tooling and specialization of SaaSes. Ie a newer architecture takes significantly less manpower to maintain even at high scale compared to old architectures. I was a VP at a startup founded around 2013. Their first product took a team of 60 engineers to maintain. Our second product, built on a more modern stack, took 6 engineers and made as much revenue and processed more scale. This led to a limited refactor of the first product which removed the hardest to maintain parts, freeing up engineers to work on new things. I'm talking simple stuff - like using SQS, lambda functions, etc. Anyways I think companies are dialling in a new cost -> revenue ratio wrt to engineering resourcing. Twitter is one extreme (but not recommended) example of this, ie everything thought it would crash and burn and yeah, there were a few pains, but overall the service stayed up with a third of the engineers. Google/Meta have also done a ton of reorgs, and while some of those are layoffs, a lot of them is reshuffling people to new team and new bets because less people needed to work on each products.

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.Look at what you wrote:>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.This is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, ""why don't you just talk to him?"" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.You will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.You should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.So many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.The dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy.

Part of our job is to help stakeholders understand what they’re asking for. On a good day, you get to drive them towards a particular decision and make them think it was their idea.It sounds like you’re hoping that we, as a discipline, get recognized purely for performance on tasks that are hard to understand, and I’m not sure how that’s supposed to work.

nccqxxa,"> It's also pretty easy to create a practical coding test in gitpod, and then do point-based scoring. But most managers never thought of that, nor attempted to do so. They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.I'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.I have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says ""5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT"".* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.---As for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.Yes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement.

ncbl32z,"Hard disagree as someone who is currently an IC, has been a manager, and in both roles have conducted quite a few interviews. I conducted over a dozen last month.For the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).When I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just * How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).Don't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",TehLittleOne,2025-09-04 04:51:23,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1n7xtw4,False,

I think we are in the early stages of a recession, combined with us having high interest rates and over hiring in pandemic has made the job market really tough for entry level talent. I don't think tis going to get better in 1 to 2 years. However, what I do think is that tech and CS is not going way. My personal educated guess is that there will be new types of roles emerging that will be more like product person + roles. Essentially where you would be expected to do project managing plus software development with AI tools. I don't think software engineering that requires extensive OOP experience are going anywhere. I think AI is going to make certain areas of tech explode that people aren't thinking about enough today. The biggest one is I think cyber security, fraud detection etc. The thing is the tools that tech has pushed the last ten years (AI, Crypto, Payment servies like cash apps) are eco systems that have encouraged sophisticated criminal activity and thats only going to grow. That also means the opposite is true jobs meaning to minimize fraud risks, protect data are probably going to grow.People talk about AI automating jobs, but most of the people doing the talking have never even sat in a labor economics or macroeconomics course. AI is the type of technical innovtion that compliments the skills of some workers and replaces the skills of others. USually what these type of technologies replace are repetitive tasks. So the more your job is doing the same repetive task (i.e. generating the same reports/analyitcs over and over again) the more likely that job is replaced by AI. This is why I think the future is being more in the product type roles (which are the ones getting laid off the most). However, these jobs will evolve into something like product + software, instead of just product,I also think the industries in general are going to reward people who think outside fo the box and push creative boundaries. AI is very good at creating simple designs. I think any company that is relying on AI to be the drive for their innovation will probably fall behind in the long term.",Snoo-18544,2025-08-31 23:38:20,32,cscareerquestions,t3_1n594ze,False,

The folks who stay on long term tend to be high performers who carry onward business knowledge.It's no longer acceptable to just have an ""OK"" investment from the budgeting process. I've been involved in presenting proposed bodies of work all the way up to the CFO of a F500. Effectively, the view from executive management is that every project needs to be a home run out of the park in order to get approval in the current environment. That means you need to staff it with experienced people who already know the business domain, and can execute quickly without any hand holding - because the promised timelines to executives are aggressive. I've directly been told by middle management to ""accelerate"" certain projects because other initiatives got approved, and that meant ripping our existing juniors off and re-staffing them on other work.That means as an engineering manager, that you no longer want to hire juniors. There is really nothing you can do - because the roles don't exist in certain companies now.

That said, there's things you can do that will help.Break your team's responsibilities down into pillars or silos of knowledge (your manager can help with what your team specifically works on). Usually, it's these:* Infrastructure/Networking* Application Orchestration* Observability* Internal ToolsTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.When you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future. Do personal retros on particular projects/tasks that you struggled with and try to internalize the knowledge that you gained. This takes a lot of effort, and some of it may come after hours. That's why DevOps/SRE tends to get paid more though, so...swings and roundabouts.Total honesty here: people will tell you that you don't need to be a hardcore techie to be successful, but if we define ""hardcore techie"" as ""someone who is really into understanding why systems behave the way that they do and is not content with just a surface-level understanding"", then not being one is absolutely career limiting in DevOps/SRE.

nc4k7jg,"Work life balance is subjective. That's why asking directly about it doesn't work.A company that demands everyone work for *only* 60 hours a week instead of 80 hours week could truthfully claim that they have a good work life balance. And they do, relative to that other company.That, and if you're asking questions that have an objectively right answer, of course they can just lie. They know the answer you're looking for. ""Do you have a good WLB?"" --> ""Yep!"". Easy peezy.Instead, you have to ask questions about the things that in your opinion make up a good work life balance. Questions that don't have objectively correct answers.For example, a favorite one of mine is to ask them to tell me about a time when the team was missing a deadline, and what was done in reaction. There is no ""right"" answer to that question. It's also asking about a *specific anecdote*, so people are much less likely to lie about that, and if they try it's much harder to come up with a good story-lie on the spot.If an interviewer said something like ""The team really came together and rallied to hit the deadline despite all odds"" for example would be a good answer to some people. To me? Red flag. That means when the team gets bad deadlines, they do crunch time to make up for it. The answer *I'm* looking for is something about dialing back scope, extending the deadline, or allocating more resources. Those are green flags. That indicates management knows how to do project management 101, and developers aren't asked to work long hours to make up for unrealistic deadlines.Another example, I like to ask about how frequent after-hours production support calls are. This gives me insight into product stability, and in turn what the on call rotation will look like.Again, there isn't really an objectively correct answer to this question. Everyone might be looking for different answers. I remember one time I asked this question to the hiring manager, and he got this big grin on his face and said they only get called after hours 1-2 times a month. He genuinely thought that was a good thing. Maybe it is compared to a place like AWS, but what *I* was looking for was a stable product that only gets after hour calls 1-2 times ***a year***. Not a month. I politely rejected that company.Think about what makes up a good WLB *to you*.

Similarly, are there other Leads around that you can compare with? If your org doesn’t have Leads, that’s a very different situation.There are a lot of different implementations of this. At some places, a Lead is a line manager. Other places, you have a Tech Lead, who is essentially a particular archetype of Staff, but people stuff is handled by someone else. At some places, there’s what’s called a “Tech Lead Manager”, which is sort of in between the two – usually they have project-level accountability and input into performance discussions, but maybe they don’t do salary review, etc.One useful way to frame this is, “I’m enjoying the work I’m doing to lead (or ‘help lead’) the team, and I’d like to talk about my growth path. How close would you say I am to being a Lead Software Engineer, and what are the areas I need to put in work to get there? Can we plan out that journey so that I’m doing the highest impact things?”Basically, it gets you a lot more information while looking really good and not coming off as a squeaky wheel. A lot of the other ways to approach this can come off as whiny / demanding, which can be totally fine, but is sometimes not fine… and is often not fine for reasons that you don’t have visibility on. Framing it as about your growth gets your leadership thinking about ways to grow you lest they lose you, but in a non-confrontational way.

Coding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it).

Every single person who had worked on the system had quit before I got there and there was basically no documentation. Here’s what I did:1. Spent about 1 month reading, understanding, and *documenting* as much as I could. What’s the path of a regular request? What is each backend responsible for? I also drew a massive map in LucidCharts (whatever, pick your favorite drawing site) with arrows and boxes for the different backends and whatnot. I wrote 12 pages of documentation that is likely still being referenced today. 2. Make sure to make absolutely clear how cooked you are. Right now, you are learning how to navigate and understand a large, unknown codebase. Inform your manager that whatever change they’re requesting will take over a month (or however much time) because you need to orient yourself and nobody can help you. It also helps to bring up that you are only here for a few months and want to help make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you’re gone. 3. Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can’t make the fix. This may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. You have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they’re trying to push for that fix. You’re an intern lol.

nc7xv3g,"Building confidence in this market requires focusing on what you can control rather than external factors. Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.For quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.The harsh reality is that ""quickly"" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.Focus on financial preparation over trying to become ""layoff-proof"" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.Consider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.The confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring. The market has normalized into something more similar to other professional fields, which means standard job search strategies and realistic timelines matter more than they used to.",g2i_support,2025-09-03 16:44:16,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1n79rai,False,

It's crazy how much of an edge knowing people gets you in the interview process. Make friends, friends graduate / have internships, gives you a leg in. This is so overlooked in CS in my opinion. Idk if it's just not generally understood, or if people willfully ignore it because they are super introverted and/or socially anxious, but seriously - make lots of friends.
