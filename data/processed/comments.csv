These are not being migrated away from spark, but are being tuned a bit as we move them to ingest from redshift instead of hive. And I’m going to say that length of runtime when reading from hive to generate an extract is not directly related to decision to keep in spark or migrate out. Some of our jobs run for a very long time in spark due to the hive partition not being ideal. These will run very quickly in redshift because our distkey is much better for the type of pulls we need.

myaldfm,"tl;dr: 50+ year old SWE embarking on the transition back to DE, so I know the struggle.On a similar journey - been programming for almost 30 years (C/C++ stuff in DoD land) and now hoping to go back into data. First gig was moving a company from solely paper to Microsoft Access. Things have changed in the intervening years and while “select * from ” still works, my SQL is rusty as hell - so feels like starting over from scratch.Anyhow, I am going through a lot of free resources, but I need to be more disciplined with the learning and actually finishing projects/courses. Bad ADHD keeps me starting or reading about new tech, but not actually fully understanding them before I move on to the next shiny. The tech environment is festooned with tons of shiny stuff that actually gets in the way of finishing a project.So, been doing the DE ZoomCamp free course. It’s a bit janky, the instructors vary in quality (although I really like Alexei) and not everything is straightforward, but I think it’s a pretty realistic way to learn DE. Real life is not going to be laid out well either and projects will develop their own idiosyncrasies that have to be navigated. Also taking Joe Reis’s Data Engineering course on Coursera. It’s very AWS focused, but I think I’ll be able to sit for the AWS Data Engineering Associate Cert with some extra study time. I’m not a certificate enthusiast but the job market seems to like them, so why not help our your resume. It’s very streamlined and I am only in course 2 but he does talk about the non-tech skills DEs need to have to do their job. That’s been helpful.Also looked at Joseph Machado’s StartDataEngineering newsletter. That’s been informative and has exposed me to some new ideas. Since it is a free news letter, it doesn’t hurt. I also joined a couple of groups that SeattleDataGuy has running over LinkedIn, but haven’t really done much with them at the moment. There is a LOT of noise in the DE space, with “influencers” pushing a ton of crap on hopeful DEs, so being skeptical of some of the recommendations is wise. My LinkedIn is flooded with them since I put a data engineering focus to my profile. I have a couple of ideas for some projects I’ve been mulling over. I have one in mind to grab all the publicly available BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) data/projections and then see how they’ve revised them in the following months.

my2eicu,"estimator is hot garbage in general. more specifically, your workloads and compute engines really specifically influence your capacity and your usage.for example, sql database in fabric refers specifically to the OLTP database, which CRUD events are events billed as interactive usage (\~10 minute billing window), whereas your OLAP queries are billed as background jobs (24 hour billing).it also doesn't take into account that you can host your semantic models in non-premium workspaces, therefore the refresh (background) and report (interactive) usage is not billed against your capacity. this will work to reduce the actual estimate because an F32 will still require each of your 100 users to have their own pro licence. at F64 and above, your regular users will not need a licence. if your org already uses Fabric in general with E5 M365 licences, everyone would already have a pro licence completing taking out a big chunk of the cost estimation.DFG2 is also the most expensive engine in Fabric at 16 CUs per second for queries that sink to a destination. this means your four hours of estimated DFG2 usage may equate to 230k CU(s) PLUS whatever you incur on the SQL endpoint read side. however, you could write Spark jobs that do the same thing as the DFG2 for 0.5 CUs per second, in reality this ends up being jobs that are 10% of the DFG2 cost.long story short: you can always start small and scale up, avoid publishing content in premium capacities if everyone already has pro licences (keep your Fabric capacity for your Fabric items), avoid DFG2's where possible, understand what PBI Pro licences the org already has",radioblaster,2025-06-16 12:02:27,27,dataengineering,t3_1lcqqh6,False,

IMO that's not a basic tech stack, a cron pulling some data directly into powerbi is basic, that's a tech stack powered by three separate vendors that can get very expensive.The first question is: are you part of the product the company is making or is it a cost center? I assume you've priced out what it would cost and what you expect it to cost in a year, in addition to how long you think it would take to move to that stack? So that's the first place you can sell it, that it will return you more money as part of a better/more robust product feature or that it will be cheaper overall than paying devs to maintain these scripts.The second question is: what does it give you that you don't already have? A very reasonable question you might receive is 'yes it's a hack but it's working for us, is rewriting it the most important thing to be pursuing at this time?' Like if all the data is there and I just want to see a report about how many frobnozzles we foobricked and or how much uptake my great new feature is getting and you're like 'first we should rewrite the entire tech stack' you need to be able to articulate the value of it beyond 'these JS scripts offend my aesthetic sensibilities'The third question I would ask is what are the long-term expectations of you in this role because IMO startups don't actually need DEs, but since titles in this industry are relatively meaningless, it's possible that what they really want right now is a 'data analyst' (often code for 'pbi monkey'), so the third question to me are everyones expectations aligned here?

With that said, I feel qualified to speak on it as a data engineer given I've devoted the past ~3 years to this problem and I'm writing an O'Reilly book on the subject.First and foremost, ""shift left"" pulls from already established paradigms in security and DevOps; and applying that to data. The core problem in those two spaces was disparate and high volume changes that downstream teams could no longer manage, and thus responsibility needed to ""shift left"" to upstream software engineers to manage such requirements.Key to this is not just shifting responsibility, but making it as easy as possible for these upstream engineers to engage in the desired practices within their existing dev workflows. Thus ""shift left"" isn't respective to where you are in the data lifecycle (e.g. upstream vs downstream), it's clearly looking at application code if we are following the same patterns it was established in other domains mentioned earlier.Thus, ""shift left"" in data revolves around prevention at ""design time"" as compared to ""run time"" like observability (both are valuable).

I really want to emphasize that before my next comments, as you did ask for a roast =). Also really appreciate you showing your limitations and where you asked for help in this. Now for the actual roast part...While I have no issue with the whole ETL as a tech process and completely agree with it, I wonder if going for a full analytics/column-based solution as your destination was the right call here. From what I understood, you want the users of your product to be able to look up the weather for their next climb. Meaning your back will probably have to serve data a couple of rows at a time, at most. Look up a crag, get the weather, yeah no it's bad, look up next crag, and so on. But no aggregation on the average yearly temperature at 6pm every day on all the crags in Cumbria. The first example is a row based workload, or transactional; the second is columnar, analytical. Parquet and duckdb are really good at the latter, no so much at the former.I understand you tried using PostgreSQL then failed and went to duckdb in order to make some progress, that's good. Going forward I really think you should give PostgreSQL another try, it's way better suited to what you want to do. Also it has a great extension (postgis) to deal with geodata, which you will need to. For the same reason I think you would benefit from reconsidering your data model, as I think a fact/dim approach is going to be deserving you. Your model feels like you had to forcefully bend it in order to fit in. Sure, it works, but there's a lot of tension between your data and the model. Don't know how to express it otherwise.Hope it helps, don't hesitate if you have questions, I'd be happy to provide further guidance if needed.",Thlvg,2025-06-15 09:10:03,1,dataengineering,t3_1lbi0re,False,

my2bhma,"You need to ingest your data.You have to orchestrate what runs when.You need to clean and transform your data to make it usable.You need to store your data.You need to access your data.That are the fundamentals which will never change.With that being said all tech stack depends of a lot of factors.Ingest : could be done in any language. I would say Python is a quick and easy language that is the most broadly used in data. So learn it. Orchestrate: airflow has been around a long time and is very good. Some people tend to say it’s way harder to get setup than the “new” stuff. Usually they used an old version were a lot of things needed to be managed for the system to run correctly. Then you have “new” orchestrator in the market which try to make it easy like Dagster, prefect, mage.Clean and transformation : you have the python frameworks (pandas, polars), you have your sql engine (DBT, trino, presto), you have spark, you have your DuckDB.Most compagnie would be fine with an up to date version of Postgres. But they usually run old 2010 version of sqlserver that run REAL slow, so they think they have a lot of data and switch to an OLAP system when they migrate. If you heard something like I have a LOT of data to transform. 1 million rows, 10 million rows, 100 millions rows you can assume that the company DOESN’T have a lot of data at all. And that any db would work. If it’s 100 millions rows every hour that’s another thing but usually people talk about their global table size unless they have really a lot of data and usually when they do they already know the solution because they already hit issues so many times with their systems.For OLAP (managed) you have snowflake, Databricks BigQuery, Redshift.OLAP (OSS) Pinot, clickhouseThere’s a lot more but that cover most scenarios or “new” companyAccess : you have a bunch of tools here but like tableau, power bi, sigma if you are 100% snowflake, metabase for small company, superset for bigger. And a bunch more.So no real definitive stack but you have those.If I was to start fresh in a new company that has received funding and that I know there’s going to be A LOT of data (multiple terabytes at least) I would probably do Dagster, DBT, snowflake, sigma, python ingestion in Dagster.Why? Because if they have investors and the company is pretty small they want to delivers new things fast even if it cost them more. If the couple of new things works or fail fast then it’s good for the business, they’ll hire more and continue growing the business. And the stack is pretty much all managed so you pay for maintenance and upgrades and everything you don’t have to do those things, and you can focus on business requirement.If it was a small company that expect a lot of data with no funding, I’ll go the datalake approach. Because snowflake will be expensive no matter what.If you don’t have a lot of data Postgres Dagster python, DBT might be a good fit.There no real stack but those are nice.Personally I would always go with a sql framework for transformation at start not because it’s better just because sql is easy enough that mostly anyone can understand and build some stuff while python transformation can get confusing when you chain a bunch of stuff together and it require programming knowledge which not everyone has.Good luck",Commercial_Dig2401,2025-06-16 11:40:53,26,dataengineering,t3_1lck2tc,False,

mxs4wj4,"While the general recommendation is to use taskflow api, and for a reason (readability, less bloat), I highly recommend that you get a hang of what operators and tasks are in Airflow. They are the backbone of Airflow and, in fact, they are being used underneath the taskflow API. It's important to understand that there's no direct value passing between task-decorated functions in Airflow (xcom is used for that). Note that I'm talking from my experience with Airflow 1.x and 2.x, and the newest 3.0 release may invalidate some of my knowledge :)Always treat Airflow tasks as separate processes running on separate virtual machines, even if they aren't. It'll save you time when you decide to scale Airflow workers. E.g. use shared object storage or database to exchange the data between tasks. Make tasks granular enough for ease of retry and debugging.Use idempotency for complex data pipelines to its fullest.

mxsubfl,"Here is a list of common causes of failures I encountered:1. Use airflow for orchestrating not for data processing, while that is not a hard and fast rule, I see a lot of failures when workers run out of memory because their pandas ingested too much data. Worst part of that is, you loose all your logs, so it’s hard to work out what went wrong. What to do? Track the size of data you are processing and compare them to the memory you have. If you see a trend that tells you you are headed for OOM situations, export the data processing function into a serverless option, be it a k8s pod or any other option.2. When you download files to a worker, make sure you clean it up reliably, to avoid running out of disk space eventually. Use the tempfiles module appropriately.3. Avoid large xcoms. It stresses the meta data db and impacts overall processing. If you have large data to pass between tasks, consider using external storage.4. Avoid dags that run more frequently than once every 10 minutes. The round robin nature of the scheduler means for a non trivial setup can exceed several minutes and you may not be able to keep up. 5. Avoid dags that watch for file changes and do that every few minutes (as above). See if you can have an external file watcher trigger the day instead. Alternatively space it so it checks every 30 minutes.6. Review the day code for expensive functions at module level. The dag gets executed every few minutes and everything at module level gets run every few minutes. So variable.get uses your database, why stress it with hundreds and thousands of such calls. Move these into your python functions.7. Use logging but use it judiciously, your logs can end up in your metadata base, or at least in your file system. 8. Monitor and manage the size of your metadata base. If it’s too big you can’t run snapshots/backups.",smeyn,2025-06-14 20:44:50,11,dataengineering,t3_1lbenix,False,

Many SWEs (understandably) tend to consolidate logic within a custom application layer instead of finding/learning another tool (I’ve seen hugely complex orchestration engines built into an application, with minimal/zero observability or expectation for flaky connections or late-arriving data). Distributed systems SWEs might approach things with a more modular mindset, but I haven’t seen it often. 2. DEs, in that scenario above—would reach for a dedicated orchestrator like Dagster, Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or similar. There are many more tools out there (likely too many).

I would suggest maybe getting some free cloud resources and use one of the big data warehouses in one of the clouds. Create tables there with DBT. Maybe your extra data can be weather history.

my2yhas,"Lost cause. These DE's probably evolved to their job positions, didn't go to school / uni and learned proper techniques. I've had Unit Testing drilled into me ever since Microsoft started Dot Net 1.0 back in 2005. So SWE's tend to be better DE's than business or functional analysts.If tests are not integrated before actual code, and maintained perfectly, only one other way to test. A different environment, like a UAT. You copy from Prod data into UAT and test there to see if anything breaks, or, build in UAT pre-determined data with SQL scripts, so that results from any process / pipeline can be tested.So test for missing columns, null data, business rules. This is also work-intensive, this approach, but DE-person agnostic. Have each DE that does a change, in JIRA, write some conditions for success. Have a person dedicated for the DevOps / UAT testing phase.A great place I worked at, every sprint rotation cycle, a different person was assigned the DevOps/UAT, so that we all gained the experience. Over time the code base improved.I've seen many companies not even have a DEV environment, only one, that is prod. Ideal is 3 environments, Dev, UAT, Prod. Since it's for dashboards / reporting, if something breaks, not an issue, we will fix today and tomorrow you'll have your data (maybe). So usually the VP that controls $$$$ says No Way, no multiple environments, we are not XYZ company.Then, you get to end-of-month, end-of-quarter, and a very angry VP (usually the same VP-Ahole) asking why he doesn't have his numbers at 8am for his afternoon presentation.It's unfortunate - but remember this old & great Murphy's Law annectdote.If architects built buildings the same way programmers built systems, the first woodpecker to come along would utterly destroy civilization.

mxv5u0p,"At least 2 layers, 4 for most cases.First is for the landing, as dbt needs to have the data loaded inside a database to work on it (it's not an extraction tool). Second is to join adjacent tables. If you have like 3 tables about the same thing and it make sense to just have 1 table you join them. The second layer is where you test your data extensively. At this point there was no business rules applied or anything. Just renaming, retyping, null value handling at most. Your tests will return errors present in the system you extract. Third layer is where you add your business rules. I like to make one model for each business rule as dbt with duckdb takes like 1-2 seconds for 200k rows. Having multiple transformations together is exhausting to debug, and not really more efficient. Forth layer is where I make my Kimball modeling. One fact for each thing I look at. Dimensions all around. Junk dimensions are build using a SELECT DISTINCT to only have values that happens. Just remember to generate surrogate keys with dbt so you can joins dimensions and facts using a single column. And never join facts together, it's not how a star model work. Having multiple facts inside a single powerbi dashboard works well if you keep it classy. Also remember for each dimensions to have a default value for missing keys. Like adding a ""missing customer"" to your customer dimension.Lastly with dbt and surrogate keys you do not need to join fact and dimensions during the ETL phase as you do not need to use the foreign keys to retrieve the surrogate keys.

my5ilkk,"I would understand if you’re hesitant given the current political climate, but have you considered looking into the national lab complex (DOE) ? Some labs have pretty narrow research focuses, but most do work on more fields than you’d initially think, and likely have groups/divisions dedicated to what you’re interested in. This is especially true for teams in the computational science sector, and having practical experience in data engineering and knowledge of the subject matter you’re into is very valuable. On the upside: Pay tends to be a little better than other non-profits, though certainly less than industry. Also, while national labs are partially funded through and ultimately report back to DOE, most are actually run by contractors (Battelle being one of the big ones). This means that we’re usually treated similarly to government employees by everyone but the actual government, so we don’t (always) have to deal with the same BS federal employees are going through right now. This can also make it more straightforward to get access to certain data that wouldn’t otherwise be available. On the downside: Most funds that come into the labs still come from other government offices like NIH, DOT, DOE, etc. So there is still susceptibility to political trade winds, especially for environmental stuff. Fortunately most research staff are pretty savvy at making subtle/small changes to existing projects to fly under the radar and appease their sponsors, as it were. Also, in my experience (YMMV) labs tend to be insular, so it can be hard to get in, but it’s easier to move around (even between labs) once you’re in and making connections. My advice would be to make connections with staff whose research you’d be interested in assisting with. Some will be more open than others, but if they like you and need your skill set, they may be able to create a new DE position with you in mind, or at least point you to another group that might need you.ETA: I ended up in renewable-adjacent work with a background in mechanical engineering and experience with machine learning. I’ve learned everything I know about DE on the job, and I’m not the only person I know who’s done that. I will also admit I knew someone (outside of research) at a lab who was able to pass my resume around more directly. So I mean it when I advise making connections with existing staff.

mxi3xjd,"Obviously 11TB is a lot of data and so there are a few additional details needed. First we could start with limiting the amount of data you are trying to process? Are you trying to scan all 11 TB to find certain information? Can you partition the data based on additional knowledge to reduce the amount of data you need to scan? If you do need to scan all 11TB, can you add additional indexes to your data table to help processing. Clickhouse has data skipping indexes called bloom filters that are used in scenarios like these to filter out what data is NOT there. There already also projection indexes that you could add to help with the processing. You could extract specific keys from the JSON string you are trying to scan and index off that. I’m on mobile so I can’t test this in Clickhouse but a quick query of Claude gives a few examples on l indexing on the key value of the JSON string. If those don’t work and you are running into issues, it may be time to consider a different processing engine. Spark is excellent at processing large data with distributed processing. If it needs to be in Clickhouse, you may consider re architecting the schema you need in Clickhouse and transforming the data with spark and then reloading.",deep-data-diver,2025-06-13 03:30:15,5,dataengineering,t3_1la1lcw,False,

I had in mind a bit of technical ability and then get into the project management leadership roles as I already have experience as a manager/leader…. I have no chance for anyone to invest in me as I’m not a code monkey and no one does anything these days because of the budget… It’s just pushes us into other jobs until we are able to find a team to fit ourselves into and then that belonging will be limited until this will again happen.

my6fe48,"Networking is the main thing. Self-taught can start at a managed services provider (MSP), or some other glorified tech support role. There are usually varying tiers of support and services at these places. Website support is one of them. With your skills, you can do some webmaster work. At this point you’re just a glorified artist. What you lack is database knowledge. :) I would recommend picking up some cloud certifications too. This will enable you to ensure that a website or a network resource is operating in addition to maintaining the page itself, and making sure it looks good. You’ll pick up additional skills and make friends at an MSP. Within a year or two, you can apply for analyst work. And once you land your first analyst role, the gates are open to pretty much anywhere you want. To be most rounded, I would recommend learning a little bit of shell (zsh, bash, batch, PS). Because being familiar with a shell is helpful no matter what your IT role is. You can make a lot of useful custom tools for yourself with the shell. For instance, in my role on a fairly regular basis I’ll find myself migrating large amounts of data. So I’ve modified my .bashrc to alias the “cp” command to basically be an “rsync” command with arguments to show progress and ensure file integrity.In the .bash_aliases file I’ve alias’d “ll” to be “ls -la” with a couple commands to “df” and “du”, to show me all files, hidden files, attributes, the device that the current working directory is on, and the total amount of disk space that current working directory is using. Different little things that help keep important information at my fingertips without needing to always remember complex, unintuitive syntax and arguments. I’ve made wrappers for system functions like tshark and udisksctl… anything that makes my job easier. That’s what’s super important about shell. You can use it to create whatever tools you need to make your life easier. You can make tools with any language really. But knowing how to do with a shell is very helpful because you won’t need to download or grab dependencies for some specific language.",Ultra-Instinct-MJ,2025-06-17 00:19:57,4,learnprogramming,t3_1ld5wh6,False,

You need to research/evaluate these trade-offs and decide, which side your projects want to be on.Traditional databases are on the left side and provide a lot of ""safety"" and strict reliability for clean data.NoSQL databases typically fall on the right side. They sacrifice a lot of ""guarantees"" for scalability. If you choose one of these you have to consider issues that might occur from ""eventual consistency"" and not being able to really rely on the data structure returned by your database.Relational databases offer quite flexible queriing. Need to now which `Product`s a `Customer` has added to their shopping basket? SQL can query that! Later, need to now which `Customer`s have bought a certain `Product` (reverse)? That's just another SQL query! You don't have to change your database structure to support that.NoSQL often are not that flexible. If you structure your database to efficiently support the first query, it won't be as efficient to support the second query. Worst case, you'll have to completely restructure your DB to support the use case.Paradoxically, NoSQL makes it very simple to store/retrieve an object structure, without much upfront-thinking about how your data looks like.

Try to do that with any other SQL manager - good luck.There's a catch though, you don't have the safety the schema is giving you. So you must be EXTRA careful when you change the schema of your database. We abide by the following rules : \* A collection only holds one type of document \* If we add a field to a document, we must add it to every existing object in the database \* If there's a relationship, materialize it with a foreign key ( basically, \_id)Just following those 3 rules got us really far with a very homogenous and reliable DB, so much that we are transitioning to supporting both SQL and no-SQL - we want to offer an on-premise version of our app, hence using the customer's favorite DB.

mxmutlq,">With OOP, you have to plan very carefully how you plan your inheritance chain.You don't, really. You *should* of course think about the relationships between different objects, and you *should* prefer interfaces/protocols and containment over inheritance. But at the end of the day, what you really need to do is to be willing to aggressively refactor as needed. And that has little to do with OOP specifically... you're bound to make some mistakes as you write code in any paradigm, and you have to be willing to reconsider past decisions and change course.>Your object can't be two things at one.Of course it can. That's practically the definition of *polymorphism* \-- ""many forms."">Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ?Well, you *don't* do it with an inheritance graph like Object->Character->Player->\[Fighter|Mage|Archer\]. Instead, you could give the class that represents a player an attribute, like \`role\` and a corresponding \`Role\` type that sets the expectations for what a Role is. Fighter, Mage, and Archer *could* be derived from Role, or they could just be instances of Role -- i.e. all exactly the same type of object, but with different data. For example, it might be that any role can hit an adversary, and any role can cast spells, but a Fighter might just hit harder, and a Mage might have a higher probability of success with magic. If a player can have more than one role at a time, then the \`role\` attribute should really be \`roles\` and refer to some kind of collection or combination of the roles.>Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.That depends on the language. For example, in Swift you don't have to write any accessors -- you just use whatever attributes an object has. But there are implicit accessors there, and if you later want to modify them you can do so at any time.>With ECS you have a relation of ""IT HAS"" instead of ""IT IS"".With OOP you have both types of relationships.

It works when your domain is more or less fixed, and you can draft the entire type hierarchy from the start. But if there's enough uncertainty and you need to add new types to the domain over time it's just too hard to get right. This is where something like an ECS shines because it's designed to give you maximum flexibility when defining types and assigning properties to them.I also don't think that DOD necessarily conflicts with OOP.

Joe Armstrong, the inventory of Erlang (a functional/actor language) once said that he thought Kay would disagree, but he considered Erlang more ""object-oriented"" than almost any other language, and Kay agreed.Now, that's a bit of a minority opinion, but it just goes to show how widely the definition of ""OOP"" can vary.IOW, I think your view of OOP is frankly very incomplete.

At the end of the day, it’s still you who needs to understand the problem, connect the dots, and come up with the real answer.That guidance is incredibly valuable, especially when you feel overwhelmed or stuck.

Then, focus on optimizing only that part of the code.3. In order to understand why code is slow, you can look at it from an algorithmic standpoint, like for instance noticing a double for loop, meaning a potential N\^2 algorithm, which could maybe be redone in some clever way to become O(N) or NlogN, OR you can look at it from a systems standpoint, for instance you are only using 1 thread/1 cpu core but your machine as 128 cores available, or you should be doing CPU work and IO at the same time, etc. to maximize utilization of the resources.4.

myd9ojx,"I think it depends on the concept. Computer science itself is inherently mathematical, but most programmers don’t really engage with that side of CS outside of academia. I think you sum up your issue here:> I only had occasional sporadic 1-2 hour studies of a programming video, mainly copying the code line by line and aimlessly googling every keyword in the documentation while being confused by the meaning of the syntax and still unable to make anything by myself, mainly being more concerned with schoolwork. I would focus heavily on trying to understand math on a more conceptual level or at least get enough practice to be prepared for theoretical computer science, but I consistently failed when implementing algorithms for projects. Algorithms typically employ a type of math called discrete math, and understanding it is crucial to understanding algorithms; but you also need to understand programming principles. A lot of discrete math is, unlike the higher-level continuous math in a CS curriculum, much more intuitive. It is much more logical and “common sensical” than, say, divergence of a series. Sorting a list or traversing a tree, for instance, often just makes sense without delving too deeply into the underlying mathematics. You should be focusing more on the data structures themselves than deep diving into the theory at this point. There are many clever tricks used in DSA problems (I’ve always liked the sliding window problem), but this is more about creative problem-solving than applying mathematical foundations. Having a theoretical understanding of DSAs will not get you far there. Mathematical *reasoning* is much more important here. Outside of a few fields such as data science, the most math you’ll use is probably basic statistics and algebra, and perhaps discrete math such as bit-wise logic and graph theory. Ideally, however, if you’re struggling with simple syntax and concepts, you shouldn’t be too focused on *any* of the math yet. If you’re not understanding conditionals, loops, logic, and native data structures, you shouldn’t skip to DSAs, since the foundation of data structures and algorithms lies within those rudimentary concepts. You should be able to solve basic to intermediate problems before DSAs. If you can’t write a program to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit or find the factorial of an integer, then you need to revisit the fundamentals.",sch0lars,2025-06-18 01:03:23,5,learnprogramming,t3_1le3ksf,False,
mydeyfo,"Data structures are hard even if you are good at coding. They're also more advanced tools, so if you're not using the basic tools, it makes it even tougher.My best advice would be to get coding. Reps to get comfortable with the syntax, and going from idea to functional. When you're stuck, talk to AI and tell it you don't want the answer, but to help it tutor you. You have this problem, you're here, and you got this error. Ask it to help you step through the code to identify where the error happens. Ask it to help identify few different possible avenues that may cause an error that you should look to check, and how to prove if that is or isn't where the problem is.Next I would take on studying big O. You want to understand how optimized your code is. If you rewrote the same code using a hashmap or array, which would be better? why? In all scenarios? Big O helps you understand efficiency.Once you understand that, then DSA comes into play. A lot of DSA is purely conceptual. The code looks similar to other code with if statements and some variables. I've also seen most DSA just use an array to accomplish it, so it makes it even more confusing. If they're just using an array, why add all the the complexity?Some problems, that are not even that hard of a concept to understand, are tricky to code efficiently.

myecb0x,"> mainly copying the code line by line and aimlessly googling every keyword in the documentation while being confused by the meaning of the syntax and still unable to make anything by myselfThis is an indication that you did not get enough practice.As you can clearly see, copying the code line by line does not actually teach you anything. Even if the teacher is explaining things, and you feel like you kind of get it in the moment, that's never enough. You managed to complete your assignments before the DS&A class, so you've obviously written some code that solves problems based off the learning material and your ability to google the rest, but what you should have been doing is spending some extra time with each assignment after you finished it making sure you understand the code you've written. This could involve things like messing with the code and seeing what happens, or coming up with your own slight variation on the problem and solving that. It could involve asking other students about how they solved the problem (after it's been submitted, and without seeing their code), or discussing things with them (again, without sharing code) while working on it. If there is time to ask questions during class, make sure you ask them when you're unsure about something. If your teacher has office hours, make use of that. You don't have to learn entirely on your own, but you do have to be willing to recognize when you're not getting something and take the initiative.What you need for DS&A above all else is a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming. What I mean is understanding how things like loops, conditionals, variables, and functions combine together to create specific behavior in your program. And I don't mean at a conceptual level, I mean understanding it deeply enough that you can actually write programs that solve problems on your own (this does not mean without looking up functions or syntax, but it does mean knowing roughly what you're looking for). Without that, you are woefully unprepared for DS&A.even a solid understanding of discrete mathematics alone would not get you through a DS&A class, because in the end your assignments will be primarily implementing specific data structures or algorithms, and while that math certainly helps, it doesn't magically make you able to write code on your own. It only helps you understand what you're writing.The only way you develop this knowledge is through practice. You need to sit down, and actually try to solve problems with code enough that you actually develop a feel for how to use the tools you've been taught.Here's an analogy. Let's compare learning to program with learning woodworking. Following along line by line is like the teacher explaining each tool, giving you a complete blueprint, and then telling you *exactly* how to make that specific thing out of your wood. Sure, you came out the end with something that more or less resembles what the teacher showed you how to make. But that alone is not going to teach you the nuance about how to actually get a nice straight cut, what steps to take to go from a block of wood to the piece you need, what order to take those steps, or any of the nuance involved with using each tool. Those are all things you develop through experience actually using the tools.College expects you to be smart enough to recognize when you are not actually understanding things. It also expects you to be willing and able to learn on your own.I want to be clear, I'm not trying to say you're completely screwed. What I'm saying is that what you've been doing up until now is simply not enough. You need to devote more time and effort into actually learning the material properly. If you are in a position where you absolutely cannot Devore the necessary time and effort into learning the material, them maybe you need to take some time off, self learn during that time, and come back later to finish things.Consider this: can you write a basic text based program that plays rock paper scissors against the user? If you think you can, go write it. Try the same with tic tac toe. Writing the code to check if someone has won a game of tic tac toe is an algorithm, albeit one with a single very specific application.If you don't think you are capable of writing those, then you need to sit down and figure out how. You have at least learned all the necessary building blocks to put together to make those programs by now. It's up to you to spend the time playing with those blocks and finding out what ways you can put them together that makes those programs.If you don't even know where to start, don't think about code at all. Think about the steps a program would have to go through, and write them down in plain English, or in pseudocode. Once you have the basic structure of what that looks like, think about how you might convert each step into code. If a step seems too complex, try breaking it up into smaller steps, then try to convert each of those.The idea here is that before you actually write code, you should understand at a conceptual level what your program should roughly look like. Not the fine details, just a rough outline. Once you've come up with a rough idea of what your program looks like, then you know enough to actually try to write it. If you just jump in and try to write code without some idea of what your program should look like, chances are you'll have no clue where to even begin, or you'll just flail about trying to randomly slap different ideas together until you get something that works.",Bobbias,2025-06-18 05:10:17,3,learnprogramming,t3_1le3ksf,False,

What you need to do is learn to write a function that takes inputs, aka parameters. The basic idea is that you write the code once using the functions parameters, and then you can call the function any number of times with whatever values you want. You can use parameters for anything that you want to be adjustable in the function. If you write a function that draws an enemy, you can use parameters to specify the location of the enemy, but also what color(s) to use, how many legs or teeth the enemy has, and anything else that could change from one enemy to the next.Once you’ve got a function that draws the enemy, you can create a list of sets of parameters. Then, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and call the `enemy` function with each set of parameters, and the function will draw all the enemies in the list one at a time.This is one of the fundamental ideas in programming.

mycjf03,"You need to start managing this project by capturing the business requirements and tracking how long it takes you to deliver them.The temptation is to just work on features as quickly as you can, to the best of your ability, and try to hit the deadlines set by your manager. *Don't do this: it's a recipe for burn-out and failure*.Instead, you need to plan your work up front, calculate how long it will take, and manage the business's expectations accordingly. You're a junior, and your working alone, so you need to give yourself time to do the necessary research and to correct the inevitable mistakes you'll make along the way.Businesses like *certainty*. They are less concerned with *how long* things take; they want to know *when* they will be ready so that they can plan accordingly. Your job is to give yourself enough time to deliver your work to an acceptable standard, to tell your manager *when* things will be complete, and to warn your manager *when* they will be late *as soon as you are able to*.Below is an outline of how to do this effectively: You have some high-level requirements already. Break those requirements down into units of work that deliver business value. We'll call those units features. The features need to be as small as they can be, such that completing one delivers some value to the business, even if it isn't usable in isolation.As an example, imagine you need to implement user accounts so that people can log onto the system and use it. The complete set of features that make a complete working implementation might be the following:- Registration- Login- Reset password- Update credentialsAll of these can be delivered as separate features. Even though registration is useless without login (and vice versa), they can be developed independently and each add business value independent of the other, so they count as separate features.The reason we try to make features small in this way is that it makes them closer to each other in size; therefore the time it takes to complete any of them will be of a similar magnitude. This will be important later.Once you have a collection of such features, you can begin working on them. As you work on them, you want to set aside some time in your week to plan the next set of requirements while you deliver the first.It's up to you to find the right balance between planning and delivery. Basically you want to be delivering as much as possible, but doing enough planning that you always have something in the backlog to work on. You want to make sure you capture all the requirements in the planning phase.You should have a nice predictable cadence to your work. You begin a task and you work on it until it is done. If you have to stop half way through a task because you failed to capture a business requirement, or failed to predict a technical problem, this is an indication that you didn't do enough prep work. We call these issues *blockers*. They happen to everyone - even experienced devs - but they will become rare if you are able to identify and fix their cause.You should keep a record of the features you're working on somewhere. It could be a Trello board, a GitHub project, a spreadsheet, a list in your diary, post-it notes - it doesn't matter where it lives. What matters is that you move features from the backlog to *in-progress* while you're working on them, and then into *done*, when you complete them; *and crucially*, you need to record *when* you completed them. Tools like Trello do this automatically for you.Once you have completed some features, you will have some real knowledge of how long it takes to complete a feature. Let's say you complete 5 features over a 2 week period. That means you have a velocity of *2 days per feature*. *Now* you can predict how long it will take you to complete the remaining features. As you complete more features, your velocity will become more accurate. Maybe by the end of the month, it turns out that it takes 2.5 days to complete a feature. Feed that back into your predictions.If you break your features down into small units of business value, like I outlined above, you will reduce the margin of error in the prediction. Realistically, some features will be completed sooner than others, but it all averages out over time.You can also use your velocity to make long-term predictions. If you count the average number of features that make up a high-level requirement (let's call it an ""epic"") then you can get a rough estimate of how long it will take to deliver an epic.Don't *guess* how long a feature will take to complete. You'll just get it wrong, but you'll still be obligated to achieve the deadline you set for yourself just the same. Use the velocity to *predict* how long it will take to complete your features, and keep updating that velocity. It's a good idea to put a couple of days on the end of the prediction in any case, to give yourself some wiggle room if anything goes wrong.Initially, you won't have a velocity. Tell your manager that you'll give him an estimate just as soon as you've completed a few features. If he really needs an estimate now, give him your best estimate, but update it as soon as you have a velocity, and update it again every time that velocity changes.Sometimes businesses actually do have deadlines they need to meet. Once you're tracking your progress effectively, you have the means to tell your manager if those deadlines are realistic. If you can see that you aren't going to deliver all the features required for a deadline, you and your manager need to negotiate what you're going to do about it. You're likely to have one of 5 options:1. Move the deadline;2. Remove features;3. Hire another developer;4. Work overtime;5. Cut some corners.4 and 5 are real options, but they are riskier, and they need to be managed carefully. If you're going to work overtime, you ought to be getting paid overtime, and you'll also need to take a holiday afterwards to recover your energy. There is also the issue of whether or not you *want* to be the one making all the sacrifices, and whether or not your company is taking advantage of you.If you're going to cut corners, you need to fix-up your work as soon after the deadline as possible. Time needs to be set aside for this and future deadlines may need to be delayed. This is called *paying back your technical debt* and failing to do so can ultimately sink a project.Along with features, you're also going to have to perform other tasks, such as bug fixes, refactors, meetings, and so on. You only need to track product facing tasks (i.e. features and bugs), but you can track other things as well if it helps you organise and manage your workload.Bugs are an important dimension to measure. Together with velocity, they give you a real measure of the success of your project, and some actual quantitative data to share with you manager. (Managers love data.)You can track bugs on the same board, but track them separately, and *don't include them in the velocity*; that's for features only. More bugs will usually coincide with a reduction in velocity, and both trends mean that you need to fix some underlying issue with your code. Maybe it needs refactoring, better linting, or more unit tests. Maybe it's outgrown its architecture. They're an indication that you're either delivering too quickly and neglecting the quality of your code, or have some limitation in your architecture that you need to overcome.You need to pay attention to what is causing these issues because it will help you inform decision you make about the project going forward. E.g. have you finally outgrown those Google Sheets? Or, are you spending enough time keeping your code tidy.Again, all of this is intended to help you make room for yourself to improve the parts of your project your manager won't see and ultimately doesn't care about unless they produce a failure (which they will if they go unchecked) while providing the velocity that shows predictable progress. You need to give yourself room to try unit testing, or some library that you need, or whatever it is you think the project needs.Don't hide these kinds of data for fear of being criticised. You can use them to demonstrate why you need the things that you know you need.",marrsd,2025-06-17 22:35:59,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ldpb8b,False,

mxe7o3k,"I think the main expectations around juniors tend to be more about aptitude and trainability than specific technologies. Those help, and certainly when you're flooded with applicants you can throw resumes in the trash that don't have the technologies you're looking for, but that's an early filter. (which technologies get you past those early filters? that is location dependent as you've already intuited - the only way to know for you area is to check local job boards)Another early filter is ""do they have a 4 year degree in CS?"" You don't *need* one but, again, if a company is flooded with applicants you can toss all the resumes without a 4 year degree in the trash and still have plenty of choice. If you don't, you're going to need some networking (as in leveraging and building your network of personal contacts, not TCP/IP!) skills, so work on building those up.But the really important things are - can you *think for yourself?* Can you *solve problems?* A lot of young programmers have never really solved problems by themselves, they've either just been following tutorials or, worse, using AI for everything. Once you get past the HR filters, getting through the interview is going to be show that you've got the interpersonal skills every job needs (can you take direction? work as a team? self-motivate?), and then your problem solving and thinking skills.Not every interview is going to have a ""whiteboard coding"" problem, but all of them are going to try to do something to capture how much skill you have versus just how much you've memorized.",PoMoAnachro,2025-06-12 15:17:16,16,learnprogramming,t3_1l9otfl,False,
mxg3j3p,"Hey! Recruiter in the tech space (building a tech talent community to upskill + place talent) here, and I work with a lot of junior devs trying to break into the job market. Entry levels are really competitive because of a combination of a couple things: 1) AI is replacing a lot of aspects of a junior role, 2) as a result of the AI influence, companies seemingly want more specialists vs generalists in the market rn (this is my opinion though from speaking with companies and seeing their sentiment), and 3) in general, less companies are looking to spend the time mentoring + training junior talent when they know they can use AI for a certain amount of tasks + hire intermediate/senior talent to come in and hit the ground running right away.What I'd recommend: build your projects and experience in a way that shows your adaptability to pick up new technologies/skills as fast as possible. Show that your insight, productivity, and understanding of how to solve a problem is there, something that AI cannot show! Some things you can do: build an awesome portfolio website to showcase your projects and present them in a case study like format (showcase your thinking and process), align your resume to the very specific skillset that the company is looking for and if you have some dream roles/companies, building projects very specifically towards that, and most importantly: build up your network. Reach out to people on LinkedIn/reddit/conferences/forums etc and build connections to learn and connect with them. You never know where a connection can lead to - I've had people that I met 6 years ago offer me a great job when I needed it most! And finally, as I always do, you can always check out our talent community where we help you upskill on exactly this and find directly recruited jobs for you (but ofc, you're welcome to apply outside of our community too).

Youtube has videos of people doing the challanges.Once you get through that you should have solid foundation to judge your own code for security flaws.Owasp also has a list of tooling that can assist in testing for security flaws.For performance you optimize the bottlenecks and leave the rest. Learn about caching and some basic database optimization.Step 4. I believe that editor/ide configuration is highly personal. Try different stuff and do what is right for you.

my8shsm,"\> I was hoping I’d be half decent by the end of the yearUnlikely. First, you need to learn the ""alphabet"" of programming such as variables, loops, functions, algorithms and other basic concepts that are applicable to any programming language. Then you need to learn idioms for the programming language of choice, e.g., object-oriented programming for C++ or trait-oriented programming for Rust, as well as the standard library for that programming language with basic string operations and so on. Then, finally, you need to learn the chosen problem domain, such as blockchain API and smart contract API.That's a lot of material and that's why a proper Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science takes 4 years. I rarely see a programmer who writes maintainable, usable code with less than 2 - 3 years of experience. Five years of experience is the minimum to be able to build serious, larger systems without constant supervision.My advice: don't waste too much time on passive, video-based courses. If you want to get good at something, learn by doing.

I think deliberate practice is a pretty undervalued method of learning in this field, and I would recommend that you apply it to your learning process. Other than that focus on learning and understanding the concepts and tools deeply. If you know what concept you need to apply to get some problem solved, you can always look up the syntax how to do so.For example; You want to parse json data from the APIYou would need to use ""encoding/json"" for converting that json data to a ""programmable format"" called parsing. To do that you need to know concepts like parsing, json unmarshalling/marshalling, learning what even API means etc. You don't need a deep understanding of these concepts first and I think they can be learned by doing projects and then asking chatGPT or fellow humans for assistance when you hit a roadblock or need further explanation. When you do project based learning you will encounter many points, in which you have to dive deep into the inner workings of a computer to get past something or after you are done building for the day, you can further your understanding on some new concepts that you encountered/applied. Basics can be drilled by practicing for loops, if statements, variable declarations, playing around with data structures like looping over them, learning some basic searching and sorting algorithms and then diving deeper into paradigms and how to identify some of the key patterns found in some of the problems.",Fancy-Letterhead-692,2025-06-17 11:59:44,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ldjnyt,False,

The Qt framework has 30 years in the market as a native speed, C++ solution… 15 years of QML in the market, and it’s in in cars and medical devices. There’s a million developers today. That’s less than half the number of Flutter developers right now, but Flutter is too new for me to trust.The next product I’m working on will be on an LTS Qt 6 release. I researched the options and Qt came out on top for our team.BTW, if you are making a medical device, it is possible to get a perpetual license, but you must request it. The perpetual license only has 1 year of upgrades, maybe 4 patch releases, but you can modify the source code and fix GUI defects forever. Get at least one perpetual license and enough 3-year subscription licenses to complete the development phase, then get a 1- year upgrade for the perpetual license before going to 510k so you pick up the latest patch release versions.

myg644x,"One surprising lesson you might discover: learning about something doesn't mean you can create something.Let's say you want to learn to hit a forehand in tennis. You listen to a bunch of tennis teachers on YouTube explaining how to hit a forehand. Maybe you choose to imitate Roger Federer's forehand. You watch how he hits in slow motion. You shadow stroke it.Then, you go on the court, and you don't hit anything like him. What happened? There are subtleties about his game you can't see if you just watch video. Maybe you focus just on his hand, but ignore the rest of his body: his torso, his legs. Maybe you don't fully understand how he gets acceleration. You observe things, but they still don't fully capture what's really happening because you make assumptions.OK, maybe this didn't happen to you, but it did happen to me. It made me realize looking at someone do something doesn't teach *me* how to do it. I lack a lot of information despite paying attention.I think the same may happen to you. Yes, you'll learn some things looking at projects, and yes, programming isn't tennis. Programming is more quantifiable. But, like watching a pro tennis player, looking at a completed project may not be enough to understand it.Even when the person who programmed it explains it, they're likely to skip all the beginner stuff and assume the person listening is not a beginner. If I built a website using Python and Django and you didn't know how a loop works in Python, then I'd spend forever going over the basics of Python just so you could understand it.Instead, I'd assume you know Python, you had some idea of how Django works, and then I'd go into the specifics. You'd miss out on the details of the Python language or a big picture view of how Django works.But give it a try and see what you learn.

mxdllyg,"I'll give 3 I can think of. Or 2.5, maybe.1) Honestly I'd already learned most of the important lessons the hard way before hearing advice around them. One piece of advice I can think of though that I didn't stumble into myself was that an engineer once said they view passing self/this to a method/function to be a smell. I hadn't considered that and I don't even really know why it's true if it is. Maybe it's true because it reveals a potentially unnecessary bi-directional dependency/coupling. Sometimes I can't figure out a way to prevent this where the pros outweigh the cons but sometimes I can and in those cases it seems to result in a much better design.2) Not advice per se, but, If I go back, as in really really far back to before I programmed professionally, I saw somebody diagram a program top-down before implementing it. This indirectly resulted in organizing the procedures by level of abstraction and exposed a mental model of the program to latch onto while implementing it. Thinking of things that way (or bottom-up works, too) felt like it unblocked me to create much more complex programs before drowning in my own mess.3) Some advice I got but debatably not ""software engineering"" advice, I would say it was actually a soft-skills thing. A product manager mentioned to me after a meeting that instead of saying things like ""we can't do that"" it would be more helpful/productive to say things like ""Do you think X would be a problem if we do that?""In other words, it really matters how people feel as a result of technical back-and-forth. I think this can be overlooked if you only interact with engineers. Seems obvious in retrospect but this helped me be more effective when communicating with non-engineers which actually made me a more effective technical lead as well.I think in certain types of software projects cross-team communication of technical mental models around the problem solution is crucial. So this was a breakthrough for me and arguably made me a better software engineer than any technical advice I'd ever received.So I would say to your ""but I wonder if there's more"", YMMV but I would advise to focus on people stuff and notice that people problems are actually more likely to kill certain projects than technical decisions are. And also along those lines I think for certain projects the value is actually more in the understanding of the problem/proposed solution and effective communication around it than the implementation itself is.",azimux,2025-06-12 13:26:34,2,learnprogramming,t3_1l9lb7e,False,

myclnx1,"> I know I should validate the input format with something like the express-validator middleware, but what about for something like a text-area where a user might have a perfectly valid reason for including ""dangerous characters""?Characters are not dangerous, and any system that treats them as such is poorly designed.You don't need to escape *inputs* i.e. strings that you receive. You must correctly escape *outputs* when you embed them in anything that's going to be parsed: an SQL statement, an HTML document, etc. (For that reason, I think that having HTML escaping in an ""input validation"" library is pretty nonsensical.)Escaping is essential for the parsing on the other end to work correctly, even leaving aside the dangers of XSS.When you're running JS code in the browser, and you set a property with `textContent`, you don't need to do any escaping because the string you're providing is not going to be parsed as HTML. It's just being directly passed into the DOM. On the other hand, if you assign to `innerHTML`, then the string you assign will be parsed as HTML. So if you have text that should be interpreted as text rather than HTML, it must be escaped.If you are using EJS to generate HTML code, then HTML escaping is likewise necessary. But EJS already handles this escaping for you. (But it's very important to read the documentation to ensure you understand when and where this happens!) You can use ""View Source"" in your browser to see the escaped output for yourself.> However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?The whole point of escaping *outputs* is that no matter what string the attacker puts into your database, if you escape it correctly, the recipient of your output will interpret it as that same string of text, rather than as HTML tags.Reddit does not prevent me from typing `alert(1);` in a comment, nor should it. Me causing that string to be saved in Reddit's database is not ""manipulation"", it's just normal usage. But that's why it's crucial that Reddit correctly escapes the string when generating pages.> Finally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?As long as you always use parameterized queries, and never build queries with string concatenation, then yes. (And as long as you don't do other silly things that would enable *indirect* SQL injection, like reading a value from the DB and then executing it as a query.)",teraflop,2025-06-17 22:48:16,3,learnprogramming,t3_1le0uos,False,

my0j0my,"I keep hearing and seeing this question everywhere and want to answer this once and for all.1. The United States is a much wealthier country than most of the developed world. Look at [this link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income) of disposable income after transfers - the US is literally 50% ahead of even many wealthy European countries, and nearly double that of South Korea. So part of the reason why American wages are higher than that of Canada is the same reason why American wages are higher than that of Nigeria or Pakistan.2. Silicon Valley emerged as the global tech capital due to unique historical timing. While Europe and Asia were rebuilding from WW2, the US had intact infrastructure and universities pumping out engineers. Stanford, Berkeley, and the defense industry created this perfect storm in the Bay Area thanks to much looser non-compete agreement laws in California (read the story of the [Traitorous eight.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight) Basically a bunch of elite engineers who left some batshit crazy micromanager's firm realized they could only create their own startups by staying in California due to them not enforcing non-competes, and ended up founding Intel and Kleiner Perkins - which funded Amazon, Google, Sun Microsystems, and basically jumpstarted the modern VC scene). By the time other countries caught up industrially in the 70s-80s, Silicon Valley had already established itself as THE place for tech innovation.3. This created a self-reinforcing cycle that’s nearly impossible to break. Top talent moved to Silicon Valley → venture capitalists followed the talent → successful companies emerged → created more high-paying jobs → attracted more top talent. Repeat for 50 years. Now you have the densest concentration of tech talent, capital, and successful companies on Earth all competing for the same workers.4. The US has a massive advantage other countries can’t replicate: 340 million people in a single market with one language, one currency, and one set of regulations. A startup in San Francisco can instantly sell to someone in Florida. Meanwhile, a startup in France has to deal with 27 different EU regulations, multiple languages, and a much smaller domestic market. Canadian startups have to follow separate securities regulation for every province dramatically limiting scaling. This scale creates far more valuable companies that can afford to pay more. This effect also explains why sky high pay is available for elite engineers when adjusting for COL in India and China.5. The regulatory environment in the US is far more favorable than other countries. European bankruptcy laws until very recently would destroy you personally, while Chapter 11 bankruptcies were very lax. At-will employment means companies can hire aggressively knowing they can pivot if needed. This risk-friendly environment creates more unicorns, which drives up wages for everyone as they compete for talent.All of these factors combined together supercharge American wages across all sectors of the economy compared to other even developed nations.",Ok-Contract-2759,2025-06-16 02:27:15,1052,cscareerquestions,t3_1lcgitw,False,

mxuwfbe,"Advice from someone that was at FAANG and went to a startup.Even if you are introvert, force yourself to engage with your stakeholders.Startups go at a difference pace, and sometimes they don't rely as much in designs and documentations and they might care more about output. That's not to say that you shouldn't document and do proper design, but balance and know when to prioritize a less perfect solution that solves the problem.Also FAANG tries to build everything from the ground up. Need a pipeline to load data from X place? Cool, let's build it. Orchestration? Sure, maybe we get an open source tool that requires some time to set up. Or build our own taking a quarter to do so. Or use the in-house solution that does not rely on external libraries and no one else outside of the company knows.Startups are messy and sometimes cannot wait for that clean code that only uses internal libraries, passes compliance and security requirements in all known legislations including countries where they don't even have customers and optimize for the best design and algorithmic solution at the cost of spending more time planning.Lastly if nothing works it is totally okey to change companies or to leave the startup world to go a regular employer where the pace is the right for you. Even if you don't get a fancy stock package (that might be worth 0...), your mental health is important.PS: some startups would rather hire from other other startup than FAANG precisely because FAANG tend to house in-house tools and focus on building from the ground up instead of just using a vendor.PS 2: IMO, 2.5 years at a FAANG probes you are a capable engineer.

Sometimes you're learning a new area of the code base that takes you longer. If your manager/team don't know, they're gonna just assume you're slow because you're slow. These things should be brought up in standup, or as they happen directly with your team or manager. Being proactive and vocal is the key here.

That's like... Principal SWE at least, and those roles aren't frequently hired externally. They may even be more of a fit for a Senior PM or an EM role.But a regular run of the mill Senior SWE role? They're not gonna want to touch somebody like that with a 10 foot pole. They're too expensive.

Their 10 years as an AI/ML scientiest may or may not be relevant either. So that would leave them with... 13 years of SWE?

mxeq5r7,"So, I think it's a bit more difficult than that in that higher salaries -> more people -> higher housing costs -> higher salaries -> more people...I live in Austin, and before COVID, housing costs weren't crazy. But then COVID hit and a bunch of tech jobs moved here, and it made the housing market go completely batshit crazy - and it was largely because a bunch of people with a bunch of money flooded the market.At the same time, that drove salaries up - because to afford working in Austin, you need to afford living in Austin. The issue was that salaries didn't increase in every sector - so teachers and government workers got completely fucked. But us in tech? Doing great.Now, Silicon Valley and NYC are a different story - those are cities where that cycle of salaries -> people -> housing has been going on for decades now. Now things are someone shifting because jobs are moving out of Silicon Valley to lower cost areas, and that implications of that are going to be complicated.Now, offshoring - yes, it's 100% tied to cost of living differences. Not just housing - it's also food, services, healthcare, etc. But the same issue above at a city level also happens at a country level - countries with great quality of life and resources can offer better pay to attract more talented people who then have more money to spend on goods and services, etc.I do agree that the US has a ton of opportunities to lower cost of living - and I think you're right that housing is a big one (with healthcare being the other one).And I think you're also right that the nimby movement is extremely damaging to our ability to deliver affordable housing.

The truth is that offshore salaries have increased a lot in the past few years because as more work gets offshored the costs go up since there are only so many quality devs out there. Also, an effect of that is that the cost of living in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, etc. is increasing because now that they have more money to spend, realtors can now increase the prices of rent and houses over there.

mxz7kp8,"You might need to think about if you hate this specific job, or if you hate ""working"".Daily standups, time tracking, etc are all pretty standard in the industry. If those things are draining to you... even if you take a year off to refresh, you're just going to immediately get drained again once you start working again after the break.That's why I always recommend *against* people wondering if they should go for the nuclear option of taking a year off in order to combat burnout. Taking a year off will feel amazing, you'll be super happy during that year, but you're going to just burnout again the moment you get back. Taking a year off will not be a magic fix. You need to try and actually fix the root cause of your issue. Taking a year off is treating the short-term symptoms, not the long-term root cause.I hate working. I only work so that I can afford to live my actual life. I have a very clear separation between my work life and my personal life. I don't like daily standups, I don't like time tracking, I don't like pointless meetings, I don't like having to be available 9-5 M-F. I don't think anybody does. But we all do it with the understanding that yeah, some of it sucks, but we do those things because we get a deposit into our bank account every other week that lets us afford the things we actually like doing.As for where you're in your career, it's also not a smart move. You have a year of experience. That puts you firmly into the ""entry level"" category, which is objectively the most difficult category to be job searching in. When you're that early into your career, everything is very fragile. Taking a year long break now, versus taking a year long break when you have 5 YOE are completely different. When you're mid-level, you have a lot more stability, and your re-entry into the industry will be *significantly* easier.All that said, it's also not a smart move financially. Early in your life is when the money you save is most important. The money you put into a mutual fund today is going to be worth *a ton* when you're older. The more money we have stashed away, the more money we make. The rich get richer. When you intentionally nuke your entire life savings to do a big year long trip, that's a decision that extends far beyond the immediate impact. Sure, immediately you lose $X. But you also are losing a very significant amount of unrealized income that would've made if you had kept that money invested.Even setting aside the income aspect, money you have saved is supposed to be your emergency fund. Sure you can afford to live for a year without income... but what if something unexpected happens, as often happens in life? What if god forbid you get into a car crash? Now you need to buy a new car, and you have 5-6 figures of medical bills. What if your sister has a destination wedding? Now you get to decide if you want to miss your sisters wedding, or shorten your vacation to be 8 months instead of 12. What if a million other things pop up? Financial planning isn't about the ""happy path"".I'm all for taking a year off, traveling, living your life, etc. But I think you need to do it for the right reasons, and you need to understand all the costs and risks associated with it. Personally, I would wait until I had at least 5+ YOE before even considering something like that. If my job sucks, I'll find another job, not take a year off. Anecdotally I have enough money saved up to live for over *a decade* without income. But I still understand it'd be a massive financial decision to actually go voluntarily unemployed.

I answered behavioral questions as transparent as possible even though it wouldn't put me in the best light. After the interviews, the recruiter will give me great feedback especially on the behavioral questions, which I thought I obviously bombed. Coding interviews and system designs are also mostly positive, only I bombed the FAANG-adjacent one due to communication issues I think.Just like you, I think luck does play a major factor in my process.

If they have a “nice to have” section do some research on some of the topics. Maybe put together a small project or a larger project design doc including some of them. It will at least get you thinking about how they might be using that particular skill to solve a current issue or what they might be trying to do to improve a current problem.Think and research how they might solve some of their more technical problems. Come up with some questions around them. “How do you prioritize x’s backlog when z seems to change often and requires a lot of maintenance.” Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions. “With Company A partnering with Company B to build a platform that allows users to do X. What strategies are being considered to compete in that space?”This is the kind of shit that’ll separate two candidates that performed equally well on the technical parts.

my1q0e2,"The contractor situation in France has gone downhill. What most big employers do (banks, insurance companies, pharma, etc.) is that they choose 2 or 3 ESN's to work with as preferred vendors based on bids they offer for that position. The tender requires they have x number of employees, that they have been in business for n number of years, and that they exceed a revenue level. They also require they charge no more than some ridiculously lowball rate like 250 euros a day. Once the three vendors have been selected, an independent contractor \*must\* go through one of them. Even that is hard because many of the big clients demand that the ESN's only send them employees of their firm. They do that so contractors can't just up and quit without giving 3 months of notice. So, even if you're the best in your field, the guru; you'll never be able to get a decent rate because even the ESNs' hands are tied by their contractual obligation to only charge the agreed upon amount.",NoSmarter,2025-06-16 08:24:13,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1lb9rzr,False,

If you think you will struggle to become motivated to succeed in school after the gap, then maybe it isn't a good idea.> I got pretty deep into math and cs competitions, and I feel like I would forgot most of what I’ve learned after the gap yearI was once told by a professor of mine that learning something is not about retaining that knowledge, but how quickly you can *re-learn* it. Everybody forgets over time, but if you know something, it will come back to you quickly after being exposed to it again. That rings true, in my experience. If you feel confident now, you'll be fine later. You'll be taking university classes, not doing calculations for the moon landing. There is plenty of time to ramp back up in first-year courses.> I’m kind of afraid that this would ruin my careerIt absolutely, and I cannot stress this enough, *will not*. I know more kids who burned out after college from the endless grind throughout their whole student life than I do those who ""ruined their career"" before it even began. I actually don't know any of the latter, but a lot of the former.> Some people also told me that I can take a gap year anytime, so I should spend my most meaningful years at school with friends.I can get behind the friends part, but both a gap year and going to school with your friends are very valuable things to spend your ""meaningful years"" on, though I disagree that meaningful years as as limited as that sentiment implies. Also, you'll make a ton of new friends at university, and being a year older won't change much there. 5-10 years, maybe, but you're still a peer to everybody after only 1 year away. That opportunity won't change.Taking your gap year *after* university is way more likely to effect your career, however. You'll hopefully make some connections at school, and having those connections be fresh as you look for jobs is a big deal. Applying to jobs or grad school while you're in your last year is much easier, especially if you're interning somewhere that may want to hire you.This is absolutely the *best* time to take a gap year, but if you do take it you should know what you want from it, even if that is just time away from the stress of the student grind.",skodinks,2025-06-18 23:12:39,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1lev7tz,False,

If it's something as innate as racism, firstly I'd have a hard time believing they would've hired you or let you transfer into their team in the first place, but you wouldn't be able to do anything about that and your time is limited.It's not about being right, or pumping out code, or anything else. You're going to have to learn to work with people you dislike in your career, and this isn't the first time you're going to run into someone that dislikes you. You can't just leave your job every time. They're going to be your coworkers, underlings, managers, skip levels, CTO. Learn how to get along with people. That's the best advice I can give you for your career. Or you're going to be in for a really bad time.",CarinXO,2025-06-18 22:35:23,23,cscareerquestions,t3_1leuisp,False,

Bonus is that manager didn't last very long after I left, I think his lead dev leaving like that might've put a stain on his record.That really is the most realistic option, to find another job. There's a reason there's a cliche that people leave managers, not companies.Trying to transfer internally is always an option if the company is big enough.... but the manager that hates you probably isn't going to say very good things if another hiring manager asks them about you. Worth a shot though. Have you discussed with your manager about transferring internally? Depending on how much they hate you, that might actually be a *good* thing in their eyes, they finally get to get rid of you. But if they're super petty they might want to see you fail more than they want to get rid of you.Side note: Unless this manager came in after you joined which is pretty common, or there was some major culture shift, you should take this as a lesson to reverse interview more thoroughly to gauge if it's a good culture fit with the team. Every team I join I join with pretty high confidence I'm going to mesh well with the team, and especially my hiring manager. I ask a ton of questions during the reverse interview.

mycewrj,"I've seen a lot of debate around ATS in this sub. After reading through tons of posts, I get that it might not be the only thing that matters, but I still don't want to risk it. So I decided to make an ATS-friendly resume just to be safe. I used both Claude and ChatGPT to create it, and according to those tools, I got a near-perfect ATS score.But then I ran the same resume through sites like Rezi, ResumeWorded, Teal, and Simplify, and suddenly the score dropped to less than half. Each of them then suggested fixes, but only if I paid for a subscription, which is usually around $40 a month. That feels kind of ridiculous when you're actively job hunting and not even working yet.I know Rezi is well-liked on this subreddit. Teal gets a lot of praise on LinkedIn. ResumeWorded pops up in a few other places too. Honestly, it feels like some subreddits are just being run by the dev teams of these resume sites.Out of all of them, I actually like Simplify the most for autofilling job applications. It does about 80 to 90 percent of the work, which is great. But again, the ""pro"" features cost $40 a month.So here's my question: **Is there a good resume tool that actually helps with both autofilling job apps and making your resume ATS-friendly without charging a crazy monthly fee?** I'm not too concerned about the resume template itself. Mine is already clean, has no columns, and is pretty much done.Would love to hear what tools are actually working for people here.",sludj5,2025-06-17 22:11:54,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1ldgjul,False,
myiq5fc,"Should I put my software development manager role on my resume if I am looking for a developer role?Seems like a weird question, but i am curious. I am looking for embedded engineering jobs and I am not sure if I should include my management title on my resume. Situation: I have been working for this company for 5 years. 3 years ago my manager left and they decided not to back fill the position. But with that I stepped into more of a leadership role on the team. I went on for about a year and half until I finally discussed it with my boss and he agreed that I had been leading the team better than the previous manager. For the next year I would be dragged along saying my promotion is still with HR and I would follow up ever 2 weeks. Finally at my review in the beginning of the year it went through, but there was no pay increase, just my normal merit increases which I was pissed about because I have been doing the job of a team lead for the past 3 years with no additional compensation. Anyway the promotion was from embedded software engineer to software development manager. But it's more of a team lead / supervisor / product manager role. And I am still performing development tasks.Should I put the software development manager on my resume if I am looking for a developer role? Or should I keep embedded software engineer and just include my leadership responsibilities under that job title?",l_stud,2025-06-18 21:09:14,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1ldgjul,False,

That'd be ideal, but if you look at whose on my team, and who is building LLM features, maybe one has an MS in ML, and the other just has great BE experience.You want to make the case to the new company not that you know all the latest and greatest with LLMs, since that stuff is always changing.
