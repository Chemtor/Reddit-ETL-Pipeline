nmf2dr5,"As a general rule, you want to have at least:- A clear area where data coming from the sources lands with as little changes as possible. That serves as some subset of a basis for downstream transformation, a storage to replay history, evidence for reconciliation if you need it, decoupling from the sources. This is called bronze in a medallion architecture - A clear area where you have data that has been validated for quality and consistency across sources, with as little detail as possible lost. This serves as the source of data for more comolex/aggregated reports/analyses, feeds your ML models (if you have them), offers consistency across different domains for general business rules for derivation data (when it applies across the board and at a granular level) and is overall the ""single source of truth"" for all your data platform. This is called Silver in the medallion architecture- A number of schemas serving specific business applications/domains/data products, with heavy transformation (often aggregation) to fit the specific requirements of each, also optimized for performance for specific access patterns and tools. This is what most users will ever see. In the medallion architecture, this is called gold.The 3 layers above are pretty much the standard and have been so even before the name medallion architecture came along. I remember calling them staging/ODS, DW and Data Marts over 25 years ago.Besides these 3,there can be a number of intermediate structures to help the data engineering processes integrating them. These intermediate layers are more specific to each case, and may not have nearly as much persistence. I have seen designs where I could count 7 layers, and I guess there may be more in some places. But most places will have at least the 3 I named.It's also not unusual to have a one or more lookup, control and Metadata layers, but these are more support for the platform than actual data layers (some people will disagree).I have also seen cases where some of the 3 basic layers was skipped, but that makes it harder to manage things after a certain size.

The people who do understand how it works have a hard time explaining it to them and they might not have the patience and humility to listen. Which brings me to my next point. In my experience, doing DE doesn't necessarily mean I don't have to deal with people, presentations, and politics. I deal with that stuff a lot. Maybe not every DE does, but I find myself constantly put in positions where I have to coordinate with cross-functional groups of people or make presentations about how stuff works or what problems we discovered. That said, I hated the kinds of ""people"" work I had to do before, but don't hate it as much as a DE. Part of it is because I have supportive leaders who want me to do this stuff, and the other part of it is that you usually know what you're going to get out of a DE project so it's easier to propose and explain.",DeliciousVegetables,2025-11-02 04:22:09,7,dataengineering,t3_1om350m,False,

This was not the case at tech companies, but by the time I worked there, I was software engineering anyway (data engineering -> ML Ops deployments -> software engineering), so the line was blurred.

nmscbyr,"I work for government: city-level economic growth data.The first thing in the morning I do is to ssh into our Linux virtual machine, manually run a pipeline I should have automated ages ago but haven't done so lol. This specific pipeline lives in our Virtual Machine of our Azure subscription, in which we integrate our Python scripts/modules and our Postgres server. So I am basically just typing some commands in the terminal until the pipeline completes which is a very simple report that ends up in a Google Drive folder for end users of our organization to see.I then go to Microsoft Fabric (the tool chosen by our organization for all data things), go to the monitor tab, see that the scheduled pipelines and any other job is running accordingly, maybe check the Excel reports we are generating to see everything is in order even if we are confident that things are fine.Attend a virtual call only me and project manager, in which like 5% of the whole call is talking about data, issues, tasks we have to do, and the rest of the call we talk about our lives lol.That's always the same, independent of the project.Now, depending on what we are working on, the rest of the day would be doing exactly that.For example, right now we are trying to organize more our workflow, so we are trying to implement the medallion architecture. So this last week I have been creating lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric (an object that lets you store structured and unstructured data within this ecosystem) where our bronze data will reside, ideally, I am separating a lakehouse for each data source (so we got sources like ArcGIS objects such as tables and PDF attachments, Postgres tables, nighttime lights satellite rasters of the Earth Observation Group, the typical Excel/CSV/txt files in a shared Google Drive folder, etc). We want to work less with Fabric notebooks because it lends itself to poorly organized code and workflows, and replace those with suitable items like Dataflow and such.But for 4 months I worked in implementing a system to gather real-time info from one of our ArcGIS social programs surveys. This again resides in our virtual machine, not in Fabric. I did this by deploying a web server and activating webhooks in ArcGIS and a receiver in Python, so ArcGIS basically sends a post request to our server every time there's a new registry or a change in the survey, we then transform this json payload (do some calculations, merge it with other existing data —data which can be obtained via API calls—) and finally upload the structured new registry in our Postgres tables which follow a relational schema. We haven't yet implemented this infrastructure to the Fabric workflow, so that's a task I am also working on.The Fabric notebooks we have are basically for data cleaning and transformation in either Python or PySpark.There's little routine in my job, since once we have something under ""control"" we are always thinking what else we can do to implement cool tools or new data or make cool analysis. For example, by December we want to be able to implement in our workflow a ML model one economist in our team is running about city's quarterly GDP prediction by grid, but first we must automate the ingestion of the inputs of the model such as .shp, geojson, etc files and create the full pipeline so that we then run that model.Disclaimer: I didn't study anything remotely related to software or data engineering. I studied economics but my career path took me to a much more data engineering roles for reasons I don't even know lol, life just surprises you sometimes as I never had this remotely in my mind. So far I have enjoyed it a lot! I work from home, I am free to make my own decisions, people hear my suggestions and ideas, and we can implement things freely. No micro-managing whatsoever.

The concepts you learn building in Azure Data Factory (for example) will allow you much more easily learn something like Airflow versus if you were just learning it from scratch.Also, the vast majority of companies you apply to already use at least one of these and your audience becomes a lot bigger if you are an ""Azure expert"" vs. a ""Snowflake expert"" or a ""PySpark expert"". You can definitely learn any tool you want, but you also need to consider the market and what jobs will be available when you're ready....Almost all of the major tools like Data Factory, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Snowflake, XYZ123, etc. and so on will all be around in the next couple years, but if you focus on something like dbt, for example, you're going to only have a handful of companies that use that and only like 1%-20% will give you an interview - so just keep this in mind if you learn less popular tools.",HOMO_FOMO_69,2025-11-05 04:00:31,2,dataengineering,t3_1omf6qa,False,

There will be reports, there will be dashboards, there will be analytics there will be god knows what.Whatever will be the next hype cycle in the world data, companies still need their infrastructure running. As the old joke goes, whenever a data scientist joins a company, the first question they ask is 'well do you have a data infrastructure running?' and the answer is mostly no.AI/ML is really interesting and there is space for innovation. DE work is less innovation, but more hands on problem solving. I liked working in both. You can still transit from DE to AI/ML easily, you'd have a very solid foundation.I'd vouch for DE with an AI/ML flavour. If the market shifts, then you can become DE with a something else flavour (e.g. bit of analytics on side. Dashboarding maybe?). You already have an ongoing experience with AI/ML, combine that with a solid expertise in DE and you have good chances ahead I think. I'm sure i'd be happy to have someone like that on my team.Some skillset i'd recommend overal: strong grip on SQL and Python is already given for you which is great. Add understanding PySpark on top (with Spark generally), add a good understanding of a cloud provider (Azure or AWS, some relevant resources) add a data platform skill on top (Databricks or Snowflake). Get a basic understanding of OOP, maybe implement a simple pipeline platform in OOP for an example project.The market will always change and shift and we always had to adapt. Learning never stops in either field, but i agree that AI/ML is currently steeper than DE. If you cant land a DE role, go for a Data Analyst with (and i cant emphasise this enough) heavy tech skills orientation. Many business views DA jobs business only and not IT.

Helpful when you are developing on pre-built images like spark containers for example.

nn4pi16,"Devcontainer is just a containerized version of your dev environment. Instead of setting up python on your computer and managing different versions with venv or whatever, you create a container in your project by way of dockerfile and/or docker-compose with a devcontainer.json file. Then when you launch vscode in the project directory it will ask to relaunch inside the container. So now not only do you not need to mess up your computer with a bunch of installs and conflicting versions to work on multiple projects locally, other folks working on the project will have the exact same local environment as you since the devcontainer config is part of the project. And I get it with kubernetes. It takes a little work to get your head wrapped around it, but it's worth the effort.

There are infinite “rabbit holes” as capturing the richness of reality into a fixed set of tables and columns is inherently constraining… build for a set of current requirements, and understand and have a plan for how to evolve the model over time.

This becomes a single source for multiple departments and business teams within an organization, this in itself solved a lot of things and improves productivity and business insights.Examples I have seen,- better(faster) customer onboarding and handling with the Customer master.- Improved vendor insights using supplier mastering.- I have not done product master implementation but I have seen a lot of top companies doing that as well.Cons:- MDM projects might fail if an organization fails to involve a business rep (MDM requires a lot of business involvement to deliver)- MDM projects unnecessarily extend and fail to deliver if an organization has short term vision- Vendor lock might be a problem as MDM is offered as a Software product- Sometimes it can be too complex- Before bringing mdm it is important to educate clients on what value MDM can provide and what are the limitations of MDM.

nmvsosi,"MIchael Stonebreaker wrote about this in his whitepaper ""One Size Fits All: An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone"" and identified this problem two decades ago, but we're still trying to cram everyting into single systems. (Ironically now we want to jam everything ino columnar store table file formats, that can partially trace to Vertica - Stonebreakers columnar OLAP db (fit for purpose)). The core issue is that our infrastructure layer never evolved to make fit-for-purpose systems practical at scale. We know different workloads need different data structures, different storage engines, different consistency models. But the operational reality of managing multiple specialized systems, keeping them in sync, and reasoning about data flow across them remains prohibitively complex for most teams. State management is a big reason for this.So we get stuck with pragmatic compromise. Teams choose Databricks or Snowflake or whatever and then bend their problems to fit the tool, because the alternative is managing a constellation of systems that might be technically superior, might better fit the different business needs, but is operationally untenable.There is a ton of conceptual inertia in industry too. We think in terms of linear data flow: source to warehouse to consumption (ETL or ELT). But that framework doesn't naturally accommodate materialization into multiple fit-for-purpose targets. The tooling, the abstractions, the operational patterns are all built around central systems of record (BI, Analytics, Dashboards), not around dynamic materialization.This is a key problem I'm working on. Until we have infrastructure that makes it trivial to materialize data into whatever shape and system the workload actually requires, without creating operational chaos, we'll keep defaulting to whatever single system we've already adopted, even when we know it's not right for half (or more) of what we're asking it to do.The inertia isn't just conceptual.

nmamuo2,"Assuming the data is a time series and query range is unpredictable a single shard with more replicas would be best. The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.If you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.Bottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.And finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes.

nmii5rn,">use string functions to extract values then arightematic('arithmetic')Agreeing with the other reply - this would be the 'good' way to do it in a real-world business situation, in my opinion.In real-world situations you don't get the choice of what data is given to you, and you won't be getting informed when new data is added. So you want to choose approaches that work for the data as it is today AND will continue to work as the data changes in the future, without you ever examining the data again later.You should have a test somewhere that all the data conforms to a general pattern of ""number + text"", then extract the number part and convert it to a database numeric type (integer or decimal, as required). Separately extract the text part, to another next column. You will then need to hard code the SI prefixes to factors: K means x1000, m means x0.001, M means x1000000, and so on. But these are a universal system worldwide, and there are only so many possible values. You should capture these in a data table that you reference or join to, rather than in code.Then do arithmetic using the numeric part as you were thinking.Hard coding would break if the data changes later once this process is in production and you've moved into a different project. Just looking at the top 10 values is based on how the data is now: a different unit might be in the top 10 next month or next year. So again, it's a fragile approach.

nn6epnv,"I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.First, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.Second, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.Third, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.That said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.I am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this.

nn1o6n6,"I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.As for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",Kardinals,2025-11-04 12:49:22,2,dataengineering,t3_1oo5u6o,False,

We have more people with the skills than customers willing to pay for those skills sadly...even though gdpr is a legal requirement. Gdpr has many facets and some are taken less serious than others and the serious ones are easy to implement with RLS and the likes.

nn1ps3k,"Thanks! That absolutely makes sense. I’ve heard similar things while discussing this with other data engineers. For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.What’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously. So it feels like while in some industries it’s still considered a “risky zone” for newcomers, others are already investing in dedicated governance teams.",UnusualRuin7916,2025-11-04 13:00:53,1,dataengineering,t1_nn1o6n6,True,

I've seen everything, from organizations that have dedicated teams and resources for every part of it, to large organizations that have nothing in place and cannot even export data from an IT system to Excel.That being said, very few organizations actually have it figured out. Because of that, roles inside data teams overlap a lot and people end up wearing many hats. So the recommendation to enter through any data role if you want to move toward governance is valid. It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.It can also be risky. In some highly regulated organizations that are still immature, I have seen them hire data governance specialists before they even have data teams or a CDO.

nmdgiyu,"Totally valid. You're probably seeing a few things here. The first is abstraction. Professional code bases use services and third-party libraries for a lot of their functionality, so you have to use your IDE to find those and figure out what they do. If it's a third party library, you might have to check their documentation to figure it out. They may also be using more advanced programming concepts and design patterns, and if you haven't seen those before they might give you some WTF moments. They're also most likely using dependency injection, which again might reference third-party libraries. But what you're doing in trying to read those codebases is a great idea. My advice is to get help from AI. Ask Copilot or Claude specific questions like ""Give me a detailed breakdown of what this class does"" or ""explain line 149 to me."" I've been coding professionally for ten years and I still ask questions like that. It's very helpful. In my opinion, it's actually the *most* helpful thing that AI does. If AI tells you something is a library, go look it up and see what it does. If AI tells you something like ""this class uses a singleton pattern to do x"" you can follow up with ""what the heck is a Singleton?""If the code inherits from something else, trace it back. It's not always super important to know exactly how the parent class works, but it's good to know what it does at a high level. Again, AI is very helpful for this sort of thing.Navigating codebases and figuring out what they do is a core skill for developers. You'll spend a lot of time doing that in your career. If you're talking about an Enterprise code base, it can take months to get fully comfortable with it.

As far as reading the individual methods, I literally rewrite it into ""make a PB&J sandwich steps"" like this:If my pseudocode looks like this: int[] myMethod(int pAddToI,obj thing){ int[] retArr; for(i=0;i<thing.size;i++){ retArr[i]=i+pAddToI; } return retArr; }I might write:**Function: myMethod** ?Creates an array of integers based on size of object**Params:****Integer pAddToI**: number to add to i, **object thing**: object with a size.**Returns:** Integer array**Process**: 1) Creates a integer array for return2) Loops over i thing.size times, adding pAddToI to i, and putting it in the retArr at i. 3) Returns retArr---------If there's any steps or symbols or syntax I don't understand, I *stop*, look it up. Look at documentation, ask co-workers. My language is not indexed well by any AI (proprietary language, most of the documentation is hidden behind paywalls), and sometimes I do have to talk to *gasp* real people or RTFM. But step by step, I learn the new (or probably 40 year old) thing, and once it's written down, I now have my own reference for what that does.I usually keep all this in a Obsidian notebook, and I create links between the methods, so as methods are called between on another it's easy to click and follow the process. I also have a custom template that has some JS Code that uses custom ""Calls"" and ""CalledBy"" properties of the markdown files to build me a call flow diagram of each method. I can quickly see who it calls, and who it's called by, up to 5 levels of grandparents. My real notes are much more detailed, and will often contain a ""model"" of the objects given an example starting point (like values sent into the API). The benefit to doing this is by the time you're done you've got well written technical documentation for whoever is modifying the code (even you) and you can build a good understanding of potential errors in the code. Even reading single methods and writing them out, in ""make a pb&j sandwich steps"" will help in the long run. It's certainly time consuming, and reading code and writing it down like this helps you learn how to read code more quickly.",shortergirl06,2025-10-31 16:07:46,5,learnprogramming,t3_1okv4qr,False,

If you do any work with embedded development, and you get down to a low enough level to start reading MCU datasheets, you'll see that they often have an ""errata"" section explaining all the things that don't quite work how they're supposed to. Usually these bugs affect peripherals rather than the core CPU logic, and usually there are ways to work around the bugs.(For instance, the Raspberry Pi company, which started out just building boards using other companies' CPUs, recently started getting into designing their own chips for the Pico series. Their first chip, the RP2040, had a buggy analog-to-digital converter that ""skipped"" certain values instead of giving a nice clean linear output. The later RP2350 fixed that, but introduced a new bug where I/O pins drew way too much current in input mode for some applications.)Modern ""state of the art"" CPUs, like you might find in a laptop or a high-end phone/tablet, are manufactured using *very* expensive fabrication processes, which have enormously high setup costs. If they find a critical bug after the CPU has already gone into production, it might cost tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars to fix. So there's a huge incentive to test the design thoroughly beforehand. The big companies have really expensive proprietary simulators and supercomputers to do this.They also use so-called [""formal methods""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) to try to mathematically *prove* that a design is correct, instead of relying solely on tests which might miss edge cases.And finally, nowadays some of the actual functionality of a CPU is controlled by [microcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode) rather than pure hardware. Often, the microcode can be patched while the system is running, and it might be possible to fix or work around bugs that way.",teraflop,2025-11-05 01:58:54,7,learnprogramming,t3_1oopgsg,False,

The masters program definitely breaks this barrier by putting my academic reputation on the line, and hitting my wallet!In my undergrad, there were a few gaps I had being a mathematics major. I never had a formal operating systems, database, or computer networks course.

Note that I am doing this while I work a full-time job as a software engineer in the aerospace industry. So I'm learning from multiple angles. My focus in my program is to learn several computer science fundamentals that I missed and some new ones, and then transitioning to some more AI/ML related topics and applications in robotics, computer vision, etc.Do I think that an official masters degree in name is worth it alone? No. Don't get the masters if it's just about getting the degree. Do I think that an official masters degree is worth it for the structured learning and content? Definitely yes.

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. Through coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.At the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.Anyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. While this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.All in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years.

nmunn5u,"First of all, you have your boiler plate stuff. Creating the solution and the main project, setting up configuration. I have separate projects for different parts.* Main program - UI / API (+web) * Business layer - called by the UI, contains operational logic* Data layer - called by the Business layer, houses Entity Framework code or anything that accesses the database.* Models - usually a sub-folder in the business layer, this is where the DTOs go* Services - also usually in the business layer, this is where classes that do stuff not directly related to the business logic (fetching/processing external data like HTTP or file calls, CSV, etc)* Database scripts - I'm a database-first guy, I like to write SQL, and use EFgen to (re)generate the context and models whenever the DB changes. I use DBUp to sync changes across environments. This is obviously optional. Then I think about the data it's going to be working with. I usually start with the database first, creating tables and indices, thinking about what kind of data I need to store. I might miss a couple of things that can go in later.I then think about how I want to access the data from the outside. I create a business layer class for each ""domain"". A domain is usually one table, but it may access other tables as needed. I don't do repositories as they are mostly just extra work, also EF is a repository, but you do you.The business layers job is to restrict how data can be accessed. What goes in when you create a new object? Usually the pattern is* Search - a way to list and possibly page through a set of objects, returning a summarized, smaller object that contains only the stuff that needs to be displayed. If paging is required, I have a generic class that returns the paged set and the total count. I also have a common extendable filter class.* Get - returns more detail about the object. May return child objects as needed.* Create / Update / Delete There may be more, specific ways to interact with the domain, those get added as needed. Sometimes you want to update only one field, like status, progress, without updating the entire object. Separating thouse out give a nice, clean, clear API and shows intent.If this is a web project, the controllers are mostly interfaces to the business layer. I can sometimes call multiple business layers in one place, but I never try to reuse code from one business layer as-is unless it makes complete sense. Don't be afraid to repeat some code. Or if you do, push it to a service that gets shared. The main goal is that each method should be doing something unique, and that if it changes, then everything affected should be minimally affected, i.e. the change shouldn't affect their core behavior.I separate (as much as possible) security from the business layer. So business logic should only care about what to do, not who is accessing it. Sure you will pass in some user information for filtering, and you will have logic that changes based on who is accessing the data, but you should have up-front checks before the business layer is called. This way you can test or use your business logic, either via unit tests or in a prototyping project without having to deal with setting up security contexts.",rupertavery64,2025-11-03 09:06:10,2,learnprogramming,t3_1on6g8o,False,

LLMs don’t rank pages like Google does; they interpret them.From what I’ve seen while experimenting on a few AI-integrated projects, models tend to favor sites that are semantically clean, have clear headings, simple hierarchy, and minimal clutter. They don’t care about backlinks or meta tags; they care about context clarity.Think of it like this: instead of keyword density, LLMs look for meaning density. The cleaner the structure, like H1 → H2 → lists → short paragraph, the easier it is to turn into embeddings that make sense during retrieval.It’s a mix of HTML parsing + embedding similarity. The model doesn’t want to guess what the content means; it wants to know with high confidence before it recommends it.I’ve noticed smaller sites win here because they’re often simpler: fewer pop-ups, less CSS noise, and more direct semantic HTML.

Once a site has too many layers, widgets, modals, marketing blocks, or “creative” layout choices, the core meaning gets buried. The model can’t reliably extract one clean representation of what the business does, so it defaults to safer, simpler sources.And you’re right about agents. They can technically navigate and interpret more, but the cost and latency make them impractical for widespread retrieval. So most LLM-powered answers still depend on very plain, parseable structure.It’s interesting to see how that pushes the web back toward clarity.

nmloj40,"Well I don't know what things are like now or will be like two years from now... I'll say that I learned both C++ and Java in college and nobody ever paid me to code in either of them, instead, all of my jobs were in languages that weren't taught in my colleges at all. While I can't see the future and advice is a dangerous thing, there's a good chance that you could learn C++ now and get a job in Java later or learn Java now and get a job in C++ later. Or learn both now and get a job using some other language later. Or learn both now and get a job using both later.Again, though, I learned those languages a quarter of a century ago and I don't know what things are like today. It was fun to learn both of them.Another thing I will say from my own experience... without actually doing a specific type of coding as a job it was hard for me to predict what I would or wouldn't like. Most coding I found enjoyable even if I assumed I wouldn't before-hand. So perhaps you would love being a backend engineer. For me, it was very hard to predict. I had to work on real projects with real people to actually know what I liked. I'm not sure if that will be the same experience for you or not or how common that is with others.I do get that there's jobs that will have requirements like ""Minimum years experience with "" and I can get why one would want to pick the ""right"" language as a result. I don't really agree with these requirements as a good C++ programmer should be able to be productive in Java in a week and rather proficient in a month and (mostly) vice-versa. I don't feel like you're ever really more than a couple months behind if you pick the ""wrong"" stuff to learn with.So, those are my thoughts. If you are enjoying C++, I really can't make an argument for you to not learn C++. Or just learn both at the same time. Personally, I feel like I got more out of learning Java than C++. This is because I already knew C and so learning low-level stuff wasn't as crucial for me, and I felt like the types of software-engineering challenges I personally like revolve more around managing domain complexity in which case a higher-level language lets me be a bit more focused on the stuff I like. But you could be the opposite. Only you can really know.I will also say... and maybe I'm wrong about this expectation... but I feel like university students, at least by the 2nd year, should probably be able to learn any language necessary on their own quickly without it being the main focus of a course (maybe I'm wrong about this, though.) Meaning, at that point, the language is irrelevant and not what the teacher is actually trying to teach. It's just a vessel for teaching the real lessons. I think one has to get past the language-learning part and into the deeper software-engineering challenges and other concepts at play. Not the syntax/mechanics of a specific programming language. I think learning programming languages themselves is something you should just be able to do rather quickly as-needed/desired. Along those lines, if the question is... I can take a CS course taught by teacher A using language X, or the same exact course but by teacher B using language Y, I really don't think it matters that much to be honest. If X and Y are Java and C++ then just pick C++ if you predict it will make the class more enjoyable. Whether teacher A is better at teaching than teacher B is probably more important, actually. But, I think there's a good chance you might learn the actual lessons of the course better using Java than C++ so if you really can't make up your mind I suppose I would recommend Java for that reason but my suspicion is that I don't think it will matter much in the grand scheme of things and that it's not as crucial of a decision as it seems to be at the moment.Not sure if good advice but that's my experience with this stuff.",azimux,2025-11-01 21:45:03,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ojx0op,False,

Your job prospects would be very different.Generally it isn’t super recommended to do a bachelors in data science because you’ll be better served with a data science minor and say a stats degree. A lot of institutions only offer a minor in data science for this reason.Computer science is a very general degree that acts as a framework for you to go into anything in tech. The elective classes you take, projects you do, and internships all determine what you do as a career. That could be cyber security, software engineering, or even data analysis. Yes there is overlap between the two fields but data science is super stats focused while computer science is math focused. Since it’s so general a CS grad can totally become a data analyst or do a masters in data science if they take the right electives. A data science grad could not do the work of a CS grad just because there’s so much fundamental knowledge that is not covered. In DSCI you’ll barely touch programming outside of maybe a first year intro class let alone any computer theory.To go into anything machine learning you’ll need either a masters in data science or an extensive resume. So this Data Science and AI degree would really set you up poorly unless you plan on going right into grad school. The CS degree will be harder but it will set you up better. I just have to make it super clear that a company hiring for a CS position would 100% reject someone with a Data Science degree, they’re just different things.

So to take your factorial number, what is 7! ? It’s 7 * 6!. n! = n * (n-1)! So when writing that, (the following is pseudocode)def factorial(int n):return n * factorial(n-1)Now, factorials only work for positive numbers, so put an if statement in there at the beginning to make sure n > 0. And also, we want to stop the recursion once n = 1 (or 0). Essentially, we don’t want to multiply 0 to our return stack. So either if n=1: return 1, or you could also do if n=0: return 1, cause it doesn’t matter how many 1s you multiply to it. That’s the base case. It’s the case that you don’t call the function, thus ending the recursion and letting the whole stack catch up. You usually put the base case above the rest of it, because most of the time, you hit a return statement, it auto exits the function, put you could have the recursive part in an else block.

nmbvkfo,"A lot of the time, I find refactoring a solution really valuable. By either eliminating distractions or drilling down into the details, I can often cross the intuition gap.Using recursion as an example, let's say that I've seen the code```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```So, let's analyze: I can see exactly what happens when `$n == 1` and `$n == 2`. The default case, however, recurses, and it's not clear what that means. I can do a refactoring, making the code worse in order to look at it in more detail. For example, I can add the `$n == 3` case explicitly:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```Since I've already determined what `fib(1)` and `fib(2)` are, I now know exactly what happens with `fib(3)`.And I can keep doing this, substituting the value of subexpressions into cases to see how the expansion would work. By the time I'm at `fib(6)`, that expansion looks like this:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } when 4 { return (fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2) } # fib(3) + fib(2) when 5 { return ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1)) } # fib(4) + fib(3) when 6 { return (((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))) + ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) } # fib(5) + fib(4) default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```By making what each recursive call does explicit, I can see the relationship between the last line and the lines before it.

nmkrlra,"I am not a REST evangelist, but the STANDARD approach to REST is that an endpoint set should refer to a RESOURCE, and a good litmus test for that is ""can I assign an ID to it without it getting weird"". And then you spread CRUD operations (create read update delete) across the verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for that resource. If you're more familiar with SQL, thinking about how you'd normalize the tables and what gets a primary key can kind of give you an idea what a ""resource"" or ""entity"", etc. would be.In your case, I'd probably have something more like1. POST /api/cart - CREATE a new CART2. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId} - Update metadata about the CART {cartId} (not necessarily its sub objects)3. POST /api/cart/{cartId}/item - CREATE a new item in cart {cartId}4. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId}/item/{itemId} - UPDATE an existing item in cart {cartId} with the id {itemId}. Your quantity update would go here.For the item model I'd probably have something like (BASIC) itemId // the id of the CART item productId // the id of the product in your catalog quantityNote I dont put things like PRICE, etc. in there: the PRODUCT linkage should let you get the price of the product in your catalog and do the math to present price information. You don't want to put things like that in your cart model, because it gives attackers a target to EDIT something they shouldn't, and suddenly they can update something in the cart to give it a price of $0. There are like a half dozen different suggestions about proper security design that go along with that, and I know you didn't ask about that, so I'm not going deeper.Also note that endpoint split is a little obvious for REST stuff, but there's others that aren't as obvious: like do you have an endpoint for SHIPPING information, OR is shipping information just part of a CART update call? ie:1. POST api/cart/{cartId}/shipping - ""create"" a shipping record for cart {cartId}?2. PUT api/cart/{cartId} - or just update the shipping information on the cart record itself?These judgement calls can be driven by LOTS of things. I might want to split shipping info updates to its own endpoint because the UI segregation of that operation vs other cart update operations kinda suggests it. Or because my DB design says that ""ShippingInfo"" is a 1:1 record with a Cart, and I want to adhere a bit to my data structure case, or dozens of other reasons.Another fun one, what type of endpoint would you use for a SEARCH endpoint? By REST standards its conceptually a GET, but robust search often becomes a POST out of necessity of supporting larger POST bodies. Plenty of GETs in a larger ecosystem migrate to POSTs to support request bodies too, because REST doesn't really deal with that, and you absolutely will hit a point where you have to send a body on a GET at some point because URLs can't support the size. Be pragmatic when its called for.Hell you don't HAVE to use PUT for updates.

Without the link step, every little bit of code must be compiled each time a change is made to any part of the program. This can be a time consuming process even today, but back in the day they could measure this in hours and days, rather than seconds or minutes.To reduce the time needed for recompiling library code that hasn't actually changed, they invented the concept of relocatable code, that is code that only requires minor alterations before it can be placed anywhere in memory (and therefore anywhere in the output file). Those minor alterations are the *entry points*, typically functions and other things that the library exposes in order to be useful. All you need as a caller is to know their names/signatures, which is why these are placed in a header file that you #include in your program. The compiler then knows the names and can verify you are using them correctly, but doesn't have to care about how they are defined.The linker then takes your compiled code and figures out (by size) exactly where each piece fits, then changes all the necessary addresses so whenever you call a specific funtion, you actually call the correct address. In order to do this, the linker needs to know what object file(s) each of those header files were for.

Maybe version 10 either completely removes theOldWay. You could go through your code and replace all calls to theOldWay with theNewWay, while still in version 9, before introducing any other changesOr, maybe you have some other dependencies that you know won't be compatible with React 18, so first you update those dependencies to the latest version one at a time, before updating React itself",help-me-vibe-code,2025-10-30 12:48:54,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ojukgn,False,

nm8w5ca,"You start by having a very good test suite at all levels (unit, functional, integration, e2e).Then you decide where you want to land with the refactor, and you plot out step by step how you're going to get there. The bigger the steps, the more likely it is to fail, so ideally you have a CI/CD approach where you can just make small commits and daily pushes and slowly things switch over.Then you execute.Sometimes this approach doesn't work because you're building a whole new stack with different tech. In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over. For example, you might start by implementing one use case on the new stack, then divert calls for some test users to it. If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved. Then you add another use case, rinse, repeat until done.You also want to have a good experiment / feature framework for this. This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack: if (ENABLE_X_THING) { return // result from new stack } return // result from existing codeTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.So now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.After you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",severoon,2025-10-30 19:32:09,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ojukgn,False,

nnbsejv,"Here is a recent comment I made on Assembly, with some book suggestions. Tldr: ""Programming From The Ground Up"" is a good starter assembly book imo.Assembly is very useful if you have a need to craft custom executables without trying to wrangle a compiler. Having control to the byte level of an executable can be handy.For example, I have written x86 assembly in recent years to solve 2 problems.1: I wanted to make a hobby OS that can run on BIOS based computers, and to get that going, I needed a MBR (master boot record). So I wrote a 512 byte MBR in x86 assembly, since an MBR needs to be exactly 512 bytes, with a signature at byte 512. No idea how I could have done that in C or any other language.2: I wanted my Python program to export executables for vintage computing platforms. Think MS-DOS, C64, etc. I did not want my program to rely on cross-compiler packages or any of that crap. So, I used assembly to craft some executable code that would look for video data at the end of the file. I assembled that into a machine code blob, and have my program encode video data and append it to the blob when I want to export an executable. Now my program can spit out custom DOS and C64 programs, with 0 dependencies for the user.I found the book ""Programming From The Ground Up"" quite useful for getting my feet wet with assembly. After that, the books ""Advanced MS-DOS,"" ""EGA/VGA: A Programmer's Reference"" and ""Zen of Assembly Language"" became useful.Other obvious modern uses for assembly language are writing compilers, language virtual machines, reverse engineering, writing exploits.If you are writing for a microcontroller and need to use as few bytes as possible, assembly is the best way to optimize for space.As far as I know, hardware IO ports (x86 only?) are only accessible through assembly. C functions that do this wrap assembly code. This is necessary for writing some hardware drivers where memory-mapped I/O is not an option.If you want to try 6502 Commodore 64 assembly, this site has some great resources: https://codebase64.c64.org/",Tall-Introduction414,2025-11-05 23:20:51,1,learnprogramming,t3_1opiagu,False,

Don't do encryption at first; just get it working.- Can you open a server and talk to it from a client on the same computer?- Can you talk to the server from multiple clients on the same computer?- Can you open a server and talk to it from another client on the same LAN? (Maybe ask a friend / family member to loan you their laptop for testing if you only own one PC, or get a cheap old PC / Raspberry Pi / whatever for a second system)The next big jump is talking to a client in another location. I recommend trying the ""traditional"" process first:- Set the host machine to have a fixed LAN IP address- Set your router to forward connections to that port from the Internet to that machine- Figure out your public IP address (e.g. whatismyip.com )- Connect from outside (e.g. rent a VPS for testing, or take your laptop to a coffee shop)The point of this exercise is that you, personally, understand how to open a port on your PC.Now you have to make a choice:- If your target users are fairly technical, you can just tell them ""You have to open port 5123 (or change it in the config file if you want a different port)"". That's perfectly fine; technically knowledgeable people expect any server software to listen on a port, and understand how to expose ports to the world.- If you want to target non-technical users, you have to look into firewall hole-punching using technologies like UPnP or STUN. I'm not super familiar with the details; you'll have to do some research.Honestly, if you're targeting non-technical users, it's probably easier to simply rent a VPS and have users connect to it.If you rent a VPS and register a domain name, you can set up a standard HTTPS cert with Let's Encrypt, then use an nginx reverse proxy to do the actual encryption. There are plenty of tutorials of how to do this on the Internet, and LLM's understand how it works, so you can ask them questions about the details.If you don't have a domain, or for self-hosted servers, [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77510803/how-to-make-a-simple-https-server-in-p) is how to get started doing HTTPS in Python (as opposed to using nginx).

He was the person who solved the big problems and helped everyone on a daily basis. Nice guy who would gladly explain anything and wasn't stuck up about being an expert.Why the ""layoff""? - to improve the Q3 numbers. The work load didn't drop, not only was there more work, but less of us to do it. And it was no longer fun. Everyone expected to be terminated. Why? We have bloated middle management who only care about the bottom line.It got so bad that another senior engineer just quit. He HAD to be backfilled asap as the work is quite skilled. You can't put just anyone in these jobs and expect them to cope. So they brought back the Senior Guru canned in Q2 - at a reduced pay.The whole place just sucks.

It doesn't help there is no OT, just comp time IF you make enough each week and its approved after your do it. You have to work at least 2 extra hours per day to qualify for comp time. 90 minutes? Nope, you lose.Senior nice guy has horror stories about the job market. He no longer does anything extra. He'll let you watch him work but won't comment and just puts his head down and outdoes most everyone else. Making it worse on the junior staff as they take longer and their numbers are dropping.

A lot of companies downsized their recruiting teams or replaced experienced engineers with random “panel volunteers” who have no idea how to evaluate people. It leads to these weird, tone-deaf, or even offensive interviews that test nothing about actual engineering.I’ve had interviewers throw trivia-style questions or ask me to debug something they themselves didn’t understand. The frustrating part is that it feels like they just want to flex rather than collaborate. Good companies use interviews to measure how you think and communicate, not how well you memorize obscure stuff.At this point I treat interviews like noise, one bad experience doesn’t mean you’re not good enough, it just means you hit a broken process. I practiced and interviewed using StealthCoder to focus on explaining my reasoning clearly instead of chasing random trivia. It gives hidden hints and structured solutions so you can focus on communication and problem solving, which is actually what real interviews should value.You’re right, these companies need to fix their process.

nmce2b4,"I think I can speak to this. Basically the path isn’t a clear career plan. When I was fresh out of college with a CS degree (sort of many moons ago) it’s been a decade for me. I came across similar feelings. At first I just applied to tech jobs, but I soon figured out that that was just small thinking on my part. There were layoffs (not as bad now), but super competitive considering much of the roles that a new grad would take was not only outsourced, but also those positions in the U.S. wanted decades of experience to work with the offshore teams. So I started looking at big corporations not known for IT with an IT department. Randomly applied for a project manager position where they needed someone with a working knowledge of computer languages and know how to speak to people. Took the job at a publishing company where I did more data analysis and project management. I got laid off after two years post graduation. At the time I was just looking for a job and landed at a revenue cycle company. They didn’t have an IT department they contracted with IBM at the time. While I was working in medical records, I continued to keep up with cs trends and followed my current employer on LinkedIn to keep up with what they were doing. It’s funny how many people do not keep up with what going on with their employer. (This is relevant) Believe me I tried applying at other well known IT companies like IBM, Apple, Google etc  and interviewed but never panned out during my tenure as a medical records specialist. Then my current employer announced internally that they were creating an IT department. Which led to subset departments like software engineering and data analytics. I also had read in Wall Street journal they had just landed a 10 year contract with one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and part of the partnership employer acquired a few of their subsidies, one of which was analytics. Knowing things were coming up so really watched for the job posts and applied to nearly of them. I landed in data analysis and I think it’s because I had a background in healthcare ops and computer languages. I could speak to people non technical and understood how to speak to engineers. So while I never thought I’d be in data analytics, I just went with the flow and kept applying for jobs I got my degree in. Oh and due to the fact that I follow my current employer on LinkedIn, I was able to stay ahead on their partnership with an AI company. Learning about AI company because I had a feeling one of the products I oversee is now part of companies KPI - they would want to use part of our data. Now I’m on the project that integrates data that flows through the product I built into AI companies platform. Sorry it was a novel, but I wanted to share my experience because it’s so unconventional and yet familiar to others as well on their career path.",Moussechocolate4051,2025-10-31 09:55:20,69,cscareerquestions,t3_1okoxjk,False,

There's a chance that you can apply to go remote if you get your manager on board. It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.You should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.WLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week. Being a good communicator is critical here (as in many big techs).PIPs do happen but you should give yourself some credit - passing the interviews and getting an offer is not trivial and it means that you have a good shot at succeeding.It opens doors for you career-wise in tangible ways (learning new skills) and intangible ways (brand recogniziton, relocation opportunities to the US, that kind of thing).

Our on-call can be brutal and all of the things we own are critical so it can be stressful. It’s not friendly to early career, especially if it’s not the type of work you are interested in, and it has been a struggle. I was told that this experience with systems would be great for my future career opportunity so I went along with it. What I’ve found is that I’m missing out on a lot of traditional early career exposure. I don’t have much OOP experience and I don’t know much about writing or owning the destination services themselves. This has made it tough to change teams (I’ve gotten direct feedback that they want more code experience) and it means that to land another job I will have to be “creative” on my resume and when interviewing. In the current market, people want specific tech stack experience, not generalists. So yes I very much feel pigeon holed as a result of the bait and switch and it has impacted my career trajectory and my overall happiness in the industry. I don’t write code or build things: I put out fires, stare at dashboards, and debug kubernetes logs. I’ll spend an hour figuring out an esoteric 1 line yaml configuration change which could literally take down the entire business if it’s done wrong, and then a teammate will ask why it took me so long. I am expected to understand the entirety of our system as opposed to just my one vertical. It is not at all what I expected when I chose this career. I do not recommend taking an SRE job out of school.

There’s a chance by the time you graduate, the market will be better, but there are no guarantees in life. There is a general shift away from remote work. Hybrid is more popular these days, although there are some places going 5 days on-site. It won’t be impossible for you, just hard. There’s value being in-person, especially earlier in your career or time at a new company/team. You don’t need to necessarily love programming, but you need some combination of competence and caring. When I say “caring,” I mean wanting to do a good job rather than half-ass it. You don’t need to work a million hours. There are a lot of really lazy devs out there. And a lot of people want to gatekeep the industry to those “who truly care.” I’m not trying to contradict myself. In latter scenario, caring means people who eat, live, and breathe tech. You can still be quite successful without that. There are some online universities, if you really cannot stand your current state. There are about 3-4 that are regularly recommended, but their names escape me at the moment. Definitely a step above University of Phoenix. You will be getting a real degree. One other thing to consider is some women don’t like tech working environments. Men in tech can be weird for several different reasons. You have the original nerd types, and now there are tech bros. There have been initiatives to increase the number of women in STEM, but YMMV how each company has done. I saw this post in another sub and thought it was interesting. It’s open to some interpretation. https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1n5xc3s/im_told_that_our_engineeringfocused_culture_is/There are also tech roles that are don’t require coding.

nmym1g2,"You don’t have to love it. You have to tolerate it. HOWEVER, your chances of success go down drastically if you don’t at least enjoy it in the early stages. Building things with words and watching the computer spring to life to do your bidding is magical, in a sense. Not enjoying that basic part early on says your tolerance for it might be too low for an industry that prides itself on burnout.However! There are a lot of cushy, well paying jobs in literally every field. And, in most of these jobs, you will find that having a working knowledge of scripting, data manipulation, and basic structures can give you a MASSIVE advantage.My advice: find something you want to do. You’re 26. I’m sure you at least have interests that could point you toward something career wise.Love travel? Become a photographer or something that lets you utilize it. Use scripting to manage your catalogs more efficiently, making your website and portfolio presence stand out more with some web development, etc.I started out loving coding.Then, over the years, I started loving it less.Then it went to apathy.Now I actively dislike it.This was only after ten years. I wish I had gotten my creative writing degree and done what I wanted with my life instead of chasing money.TL;DR: the industry sucks right now. It’s not the slam dunk it was five years ago. If you already don’t like it, maybe give it another six months to a year, but just bail. Do something else. Get a degree in something you want to do, or even a business degree and start your own company doing what you want to do. So many options.

nmylfg4,I went back to school at 29 for CS. Graduated at 30. Did WGU so basically no name but only spent $3500 to check the HR checkbox and self taught for the most part. Cold applied to 70 jobs or so over the course of six months. Got an offer for an internship but turned it down because I didn't want to move. Made it to a second round for a great remote role but ended up not getting it. Eventually found a hybrid (two day in office) role about six months ago. Extremely chill. Probably work 30 hours a week. 4 Weeks PTO and after four months they let me go fully remote anyway! Do I make $175k a year at some FAANG company? Nope. Do I care? Also nope.

Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass.

Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more ""efficient"", which actually means ""overwork the shit out of people""3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fineAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.A company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.A company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.And lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.I think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market.

In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. I’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.I’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet.

It just sort of happened because those teams took me in early career and it just... sort of kept going on like that since then.I am purposely rerouting to full stack side from purely BE as I am noticing more and more job postings want full stack (so doing best to adapt to the job market for future job searches).>what factors helped you choose your pathtbh, I don't know. I think for most of my career, I didn't know much so I just adapted given the work I was given. And I never really gave much of a thought. It's really difficult to know anything early career and all I knew during college was I absolutely wanted to avoid networking, C++, OCaml, machine learning. Looking back now, I feel thinking in absolutes is not good and I should have given those fields a try.I did do data engineering side (more niche) early on but quickly pivoted away because I noticed data side was going to get paid less than general engineering (the trend was dying and the number of job postings were too slim so I escaped while I could early career).>How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?Job Security - Feels nonexistent. I think this is the worry with generalists. I am way too easily replaceable by offshoring as offshore infra matures more and more. I wish I would have specialized and am doing my own sort of specialization in some ways (explained later on).Compensation Growth - Leaves to be desired. If I could redo I would have run immediately to Machine Learning. The pay premium is so much greater. It's noticeably more. Basically about $80\~200k more a year when you are senior/staff. And career growth (promos) seem much faster for more niche fields. For instance for those in security or ML, they can get external Google Senior offer at 5 YOE. A generalist might need 10 YOE in comparison and get paid worse.Day to day satisfaction - I find working with motivated coworkers with a decent manager is what sets the day to day satisfaction. Not the type of work I do.>specializing in a niche vs being a generalist?While my skills are generalist, I am 'specializing' in business domain. That's how I plan on 'buffing' (?) my resume. So while my coding skills are generalist, the domain I am working on is becoming more specialized.I definitely noticed how helpful that was when doing a job search recently.[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025\_job\_search\_2\_month\_long\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025_job_search_2_month_long_results/)Applied 18 companies and 15 gave interviews. All 3 that didn't respond were for generalist roles that were far off from my business domain. And the 1 recruiter who ghosted me after recruiter call was also for a role far outside the business domain I worked on.If anything, I noticed throughout the interview process the jobs that were closely in lined to business domains basically just gave me offers (freebies). It's a huge advantage to have experience in closely related niche fields.I say specialize early on in potential in-demand fields if you can because the ones with high barriers of entry like GPUs, AI inference, etc are extremely difficult to offshore. And basically have no competition once you have sufficient experience (best for job security). And can command huge premiums in the market as you become senior+ (+ promos are easier and quicker).If you cannot specialize like that and you are a generalist, at least specialize on the business domain. Why wouldn't a hiring manager pick someone who is exposed to similar business domains over some random candidate who worked on something completely different? That said do keep in mind generalists are the most replaceable so offshore worries will be a bigger threat over time. :/**I honestly feel generalist just sucks. Most easily replaceable/offshore-able.** **Specialize in what companies need but cannot find. It's all supply demand and promos/compenstions do reflect such as well.** **Have knowledge in many stuff but be deep in 1 topic.**In a bad economy, also keep in mind while generalists can apply everywhere, specialists (in domain or busines knowledge) will be first in line for those jobs. So you do get screwed in job searches as a pure generalist.Keep in mind specialist in some outdated garbage is the worst of all worlds.",Fwellimort,2025-11-03 09:18:55,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1on6sqo,False,

nmvr66b,"Love the question. makes me think more carefully about my path.First off, I have intentionally never hired full stack engineers, so I vote for specializing in front or backend. That's an interesting topic to get into, too.Myself, I've serially specialized in both my roles and what industries/segments I've been focused on. In both cases I've tried to get as deep in the speciality as practical. Roles: backend dev, product manager, project manager, software & systems architect, no-hands-on people manager. Bouncing from one to another hasn't held me back. I honestly couldn't say which I enjoyed more and the world needs all of them. With industries, I specialized in systems (primarily app servers and orch platforms), dev tools, data agg/monetization, and vertical search engines. That might not seem like a huge range, but each of them are pretty specialized and their first choice is to hire people from their own space, so the segments are a factor.I don't think specialization necessarily holds you back from making changes. As a hiring manager, for a mid-/senior dev I want to see people have been in 3-6 companies in at least 2 industries over 4 to 12 years digging as deep into whatever they were doing at the time to be great at it.

Like, it's just a data center, and programmers don't exist anymore. Does it sound plausible or ridiculous? Zero programmers in the world.I personally don't see how that's remotely possible. For example, who's building the hardware? Hardware is building and designing new hardware? How would one even do that?",abandoned_idol,2025-10-31 04:39:27,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1okj2jz,False,
nmhouro,"Boy where to start, long story short it's probably gonna be a rough couple of years economically. Every economic crash siren is blaring at full volume from tech companies trying to hide how much they're spending on AI with creative accounting, vendor financing where Nvidia invests in Open AI who invests in Oracle who buys chips from Nvidia, increasing bankruptcies across all businesses, growing sub-prime auto loans this time, a whole bunch of private credit happening outside of the regulated bank environment... The future looks really bleak for the economy generally. 30+ years of basically ""endless"" growth propped up by a government printing money any time the market tried to correct itself. AI is scary sure, but I'm more scared of the AI bubble popping taking down the rest of the economy with it.Best thing you can do in your position is do the best with the information you have. If you truly love software, stay in it. That will show through. It'll be tough to get seen, but once you do your passion will stand out. First step is be employed, and from there just do your best to minimize debt and build an emergency fund.

nm5ptgn,">but how? Simply put, pay attention and ask questions.Observe what is going on around you, what other people are doing, what are pain points in the workflows and workspace, what can be improved or more efficient. I'd definitely suggest framing these as questions to understand why it is how it is, rather than statements about how this or that could be better. (Stating your opinion that things could be better is a form of criticism, and is unlikely to be well-received coming from a newcomer who isn't informed on the history or reasoning behind the thing they're judging.)It's kind of part of being a responsible person in general... Taking care of things that need to be taken care of without being asked to.In the professional setting you would need to use your judgement about what kind of things would be ok to do without first asking for approval and what kind of things you should clear with your manager before taking action on. Important to keep in mind that those lines will vary from job to job and boss to boss.
