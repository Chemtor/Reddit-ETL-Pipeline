noq1ox1,"Let me focus on data products. I have a data engineering background, and yes, these terms often get thrown into the buzzword bucket.But I actually like thinking in data products. A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess :man_facepalming:). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.Up until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, ""What are your data products?"", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.While software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.Technically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.From a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.From a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.However, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).Look at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.**Basically: When they work, they're invisible.

Depending on how familiar you are with the data sources, prioritize that list and have a discussion with management about why/what needs to get implemented. If they deny it, every time something wrong gets caught in production, make a note on that list of which data sources had problems because a feature in your checklist wasn’t implemented.

To make this work, you need to insert suitable info into the column, so you'd need to do something a bit hacky:1. create a column in an upstream layer indicating whether a row's ID is present in your list of those-to-be-masked2. prepend some identifier to the column of interest if it's in a row that needs masking```SELECT CONCAT( IF(to_be_masked, 'MASKME::', ''), valuable_col ) AS valuable_col,...```3.

I suggest you spend some time looking at real colleges, reviewing their requirements for computer science (classes) and look through some syllabus’s. The outcome of this exercise is to gain visibility in what you are missing - essentially benchmark. Then you can look at this and see what you think is relevant to you. For example a class in TCP/IP may not be so important for data engineering. This should all your anxiety by helping you to understand how you fit. Once you find some classes you think you are missing, just look at the syllabus, find the book, and buy the previous version of the book on Amazon for $10. Read it, study it, master it - move on.

nofen96,"From my experience:1. Try to separate i/o (reading/writing) and transformation logic. One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton ""context"" class or an abstract class for the ""job"" and re-use it everywhere. When I say ""configuration"" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.Overall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices.

The Backend and Tasks seem to be the main expansion of your transactional data, so your processing bottleneck will hit there first.

np79ard,"For transparency, I am a co-founder of Bruin, an open-source platform for ingestion, transformation, and data cataloging. I will keep the advice general and vendor-neutral.You are on the right track. What you are feeling now is the natural boundary of relying on complex views in OLTP Postgres for BI and cross-system logic. The good news is that your data volume is still small, so you have a lot of cheap, simple options before needing a heavy architecture.A very important point: you do not need to move out of Postgres yet. One of the biggest cost-effective wins is to stop running 20-join views and instead materialize those transformations into tables on a schedule. Postgres can easily serve modeled fact and dimension tables for years at your size. And even in a warehouse or a data lake, you end up materializing tables anyway, so this work is never wasted.If you eventually add a warehouse, S3 + Athena or Snowflake are both very cost-conscious. You are already on AWS, your data volumes are small, and both fit the medallion pattern cleanly. Athena is extremely cheap (5$ / TB processed). Snowflake gives more predictable performance on small workloads. If you are comfortable running your own infra, ClickHouse on a single VM is one of the strongest low-cost OLAP choices and works well for real-time dashboards.Whatever platform you choose, keep your transformations in SQL. At your scale, you do not need Spark or distributed compute. Most transformations and even ML feature engineering can be done in SQL. Use Python only where absolutely necessary.A big structural improvement is to model your Backend and Camunda data properly once. Instead of repeating joins or routing everything through a massive consolidated view, create clean fact and dimension tables in Postgres or the warehouse. This will eliminate most of your current performance limitations.For ML and RAG, storing curated datasets as Parquet in S3 is ideal. Cheap, flexible, and compatible with all downstream tools.For ingestion, modeling, scheduling, and lineage, you can keep things simple by using a single unified tool. Bruin can pull from&to Postgres and APIs, run SQL transformations, and give you lineage and a catalog without stitching together multiple systems.If you prefer a more modular setup, dbt plus a scheduler (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) is the standard alternative.At your stage, a simple setup is enough: keep everything in Postgres with materialized tables, or store raw data in S3 and model it in Athena or Snowflake before sending it to Metabase and saving ML datasets in Parquet.

noedh4m,"If you want this to run in near real time, the classic route is CDC out of Postgres with Debezium or logical replication, pipe those events into something like Kafka or Redpanda, and do the denormalization in a stream processor like Flink before writing to ClickHouse or BigQuery. That setup gives you second-level latency, but it’s a lot of infra to maintain and debug.If you’re okay with a few minutes delay, it’s usually easier to land raw CDC tables in a warehouse using a managed connector and build an incremental dbt model that joins them together. You can re-materialize the wide table on a schedule, and it’s much simpler to manage than a full stream topology. For 500M rows, ClickHouse will handle this fine if you pick a good sort key; BigQuery works too, but watch out for costs on frequent MERGE operations. I wouldn’t rely on triggers in Postgres unless you have a very low write rate. they’re painful to debug and can slow your OLTP side.What kind of latency do you actually need, and are those 7 tables small dimension tables or all large fact-like tables?

Create a denormalized representation of this, and then describe it using something like jsonschema for the data contract. * Whenever any one of these attributes changes, generate the domain object and publish to something like kafka/kinesis/etc. * The consumer can subscribe to the feed, redirect it into a file or table, etc. And from there are in a better position to perform additional transformations on the data.",kenfar,2025-11-13 16:56:01,1,dataengineering,t3_1oub1i5,False,

Said in another way, you could (in fact, I do) have jobs that are processing records in batches (everything from the past 24 hrs), BUT the way those jobs are triggered is thru a pub/sub architecture. Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the ""choosing batch"" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...** Batch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern. The use case we up against still does **not require streaming**, It's more about cramming a growning amount of ETL into the off business hours.

nogcy1t,"I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering.Computer Engineering is a sub-discipline of Electrical Engineering that branched off in the 1960s and 1970s. It focuses heavily on electrical theory and its application to digital systems. Main focuses are electronic components, signalling systems, control systems, circuitry, embedded and integrated systems, logic design, and system programming. Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering students will typically have a high degree of common courseload.Computer Engineering students at most universities will do a lot of VHDL/Verilog programming, as well as a lot of C programming. CE programs often include a number of compulsory Software Engineering courses focuses on operating systems and data structures; at some institutions these courses may fall under Computer Science.Computer Engineering is not for the faint of heart. It is brutal, but if you enjoy the guts of computers, you will love it.Software Engineering is a fairly new Engineering discipline and is still not as widely accredited as Computer Engineering. Software Engineering is an endeavour to apply the principles of engineering (ethics, public interest, safety, principled design, etc...) to what has historically been a tradecraft.Purist arguments aside, Software Engineering focuses almost exclusively on the practical aspects of programming and software development with a light dusting of multi-discipline studies.A spate of high-profile and high-casualty structural failures (bridges, buildings, viaducts, waterworks, etc...) during the early 1900s taught us that traditional engineering disciplines needed to be carefully regulated to ensure that members of the public weren't put into danger by people who had no idea what they were doing.A spate of high-profile and sometimes high-casualty software and/or control system failures (Therac-25, Cherynobyl, Three-Mile Island, the entire company of Boeing, Mars Climate Orbiter, etc...) during the 1970s through 2000s taught us the same thing about software development. Everyone involved in critical design and decision making needs to have their eye on the ball at all times; failing to do so can result in death.Computer Science is a field of applied mathematics and is more concerned with theory and abstract concepts than practical application of those concepts. I once worked with an individual with a PhD in Computer Science who hadn't done *any* actual programming; his interests were largely data driven business analytics.Whereas Computer Engineering and Software Engineering are accredited Engineering programs with a fairly standardized level of instruction across institutions, Computer Science is not. A Computer Science program at one institution may be radically different than a Computer Science program at a different institution.In Summary,If you think you might enjoy Computer Engineering, buy yourself an inexpensive FPGA development board such as the [Terasic DE10-Nano](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=1046) or ask for one for christmas.

Just bond with your team not grow distanced of everybody.But coming back to your work then it is absolutely normal that you won't be on the same level as everybody else after being a junior just for 5 months. Forget comparing yourself with mid-level or senior-level developers. They are mid and senior because they have a whole lot of more experience, knowledge and skills. And they gained it with time. They also were juniors once. They also were slow, once. And even there is no point to compare yourself with other juniors. Every junior has a different past. Some juniors got a degree. Do you have a degree or you have a diploma or neither? Some juniors participated in computer clubs and such, during their studies. Some have been coding since a kid/teenager because their parents were in the IT field.Compare yourself only with the past you. Did you learn anything new during the sprint (or, if your team is not using sprints then during last week/month)? If you did, then well done. You are only competing with yourself. Not with others.Ask your boss if the time estimate in these tasks is taking you into consideration or the time estimate is how majority of the team members should be able to finish it in time. Let's say the time estimate is 3 days. Is this 3 days what your team mates should be able to do it in given time or is this 3 days also what a fresh junior should handle? Ask him what will happen when you deliver your task one or two days later. Depending on a project it can be that nothing happens. Some projects are quite agile. Client is fine with waiting some days more. Other are public sector projects where the government and ministries are setting fixed deadlines that can't be changed. Perhaps you delivering your stuff one or two days later, as a new junior, is totally fine. YOU must talk with your boss over this.You are not expected to work off the clock. This can give wrong idea to the boss. Perhaps they should put more days or story points to the estimate when going over the tasks in the backlog. But when you are working at the night or something then they will not see this (unless you push your stuff, then pipelines will leave a mark behind). Work 8 hours a day. For the better or for the worse. You doing overhours WILL start affecting the quality of your tasks. Right now you are freaking out over a bug. The next time you might blow up their test environment or something. Because of being too tired, from working more than 8 hours. Stop working more. Get rest.Bugs happen. This is why QA and/or developers testing the product exist. Even mids and sometimes senior developers have a bug in their code, a missed business case. Or a client asks something to be changed. You have to write tests to your functionality. Then test locally. Then test in your team's testing environment (if it exists). And after that pass it on to your team mates (QA or just other developers). They will do a code review and will do the testing. It is a normal process flow. Especially as it was a small bug. That is fine.Your boss is right. You must communicate more. If you are stuck then ask for help. Tell what you tried, what did not work out, where do you think the issue is (or where it is not). And people will help you out then. If you feel that you are running out of hours then talk with your boss. It is his job to ask more hours from the client or re-prioritize tasks. But when you are not communicating with your team and with your boss, then nobody can help you.",mandzeete,2025-11-15 22:29:16,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oxzm5c,False,

np6uqtv,"A team from our company and teams from two other companies are working together on one large project. We do reviews in a rotation: team A, team B, team C, team A... We have noticed how one team had started producing visibly worse PRs recently. With stuff that clearly comes from an AI: needless comments, helper methods that make no sense, deleted parts of unit tests / integration tests, unnecessary visibility modifications (making a method public when it has absolutely no reason to be public), using full-path dependencies in a code (instead of using ""import this.is.some.package.dependency"" they use it as ""var this.is.some.package.dependency = some value or initialization"", etc. Stuff that serves no purpose or is even dangerous (deleting functionality to ""fix"" tests).We have just rejected such PRs when the PR makes no sense. If it is a small code smell or such, we let them change it. If it is a nonsense, then we reject it and tell to rewrite the code. ""IDK"" is not acceptable answer to comments that we add.There have been also some complaints that we do not accept such PRs and the task stays unfinished because of taking too much time in the code review phase. But then we just escalated our concerns to our managers. It is their responsibility to talk with the managers of other teams for them to deal with their developers. Inside our team we do use AI tools but we also share both pros and cons with each other to teach the whole team to not fully rely on an AI and to not permit AI-generated code that does not first pass the review/criticism of the developer himself. We also are using SonarQube tool for checking some of the more common mistakes in coding style and such. The person who is pushing his PR has to fix these findings before even forwarding the PR to somebody for a review. We will not consider a PR that has unfixed findings from SonarQube and from one vulnerability check scanner.Also, the PR has to have a good test coverage (measured by another tool). Adding a feature without tests that verify its functionality, that also is not an option. The coverage % will drop and is visible from the PR.I'd say that first talk with these bad actors.

np9a3kq,"By ""small indie studio,"" are you referring to an actual company that hired people and pay them, or just a team of volunteers that someone with an idea recruited on Reddit and Discord? I've worked with plenty of indie teams of the latter, and the skill/experience level of the programmers that you find in those are very low. It's usually someone who just started learning game dev after watching a tutorial video on YouTube. Sometimes, you find someone who already knows how to code because they're a CS major in college or something. It's almost never an actual experienced programmer, because they're usually not out and about looking for unpaid or rev-share work. It's one of the main reasons why I stopped working with other programmers on projects. I can code the game by myself, and I team up with artists, composers, etc., to cover the skills I'm not good at. Finding a good programmer out in the wild is like finding a needle in a haystack, and the bad ones just slow down the team. Even when someone says they have several years of experience, you have to take it with a grain of salt. I worked for a studio with a dev whose LinkedIn showed 3 years of game dev experience, but he didn't understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. He wrote a path finding algorithm that took 3-7 seconds instead of the 40 milliseconds it should have taken after I fixed the bug. The bug? The GetNeighbors function was iterating over every tile in the game board (several thousand of them) to find the neighboring tiles each time it was called, instead of simply retrieving a stored list of neighbors or using a constant time method like adding/subtracting 1 to the X, Y, Z coordinates. If your studio is actually paying people, your studio needs to re-evaluate what they're paying for. If it's a team of volunteers, just let go of the unskilled programmers.I also hope that your studio isn't trying to build a MMORPG that's supposed to have thousands of players all in the same server interacting with each other in real-time or something along that line. If the project is over scoped to a degree that's challenging even for AAA studios, it's very unlikely that your studio will succeed with a team of volunteers who have no obligation to stay on the project.

Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.Self-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google ""X roadmap"" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.With self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. Also, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.And then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. Now, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. Also, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money. I will put it so: how will you stand out as a self-learner from the crowd of university graduates, vocational school graduates, and junior developers changing their company? Why a company should hire a self-learner over a guy who has a degree? If you can figure it out for yourself, then sure, go with a self-study.

Most of the times i’m proud of what i learned and feel the energy to go on. Use what you learned, automate something, build a useful little app that makes your life easier. In this moment i’m learning python, but i really hated the dependencies and setting up the venvs and the testers and testing. So i went a little deeper to really understand that part and automated it. So now if i start a new project i run a makefile and it sets up the venv, main dependencies, linters, and a basic unit test. So i can start a new project or tutorial without worrying. While i learned a lot about dose parts. Next up ( i’m a devops engineer ) is setup the same thing for a basic CI/CD to eventually get my python code up into docker on my local homelab. These things i spend about 20/25% of my time on, i learn something for my job, i learn more about python and in the meanwhile i make my own life easier.Main get away is, enjoy the process! Have fun!

Like when you play tic-tac-toe, you both see the actual board with Xs and Os, and you imagine how the board will look once you place your next mark.That is also how software works, there is some sort of output, if not explicitly graphical or visual, at least observable in some way, and there is an invisible internal representation, that you can't experience, but that the program ""knows"" and uses to decide its next move, or determine who won. And in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.And of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.And most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations. So often you work a lot more with a game than any other program you are creating, you actually enjoy playing your own game, and try to beat it - whereas with a CRUD system for Student administration or a Car Rental, you'll just build one feature and get quickly on with the next one as soon as it seems to work sufficiently.So there are a lot of similarities between playing games, creating games, and building programs.And they are often fun to create and use!",peterlinddk,2025-11-12 20:43:16,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ovf9q2,False,

Start with the basics: encapsulation to hide internals, inheritance for reusing code, polymorphism so methods adapt per class, and abstraction to keep things simple. Go with Python for its clean syntax—check Codecademy's free module or Python docs to build easy classes, say a Car with drive and honk methods. Java's good too if you want stricter rules; Oracle's tutorials are free and solid.Once that's down, build projects to make it real,a text RPG with inheriting character classes or a bank app with transaction types. Use Replit for quick setups and GitHub to track and learn from others. Do a couple projects monthly; that's where OOP clicks, not just reading.For deeper stuff, grab ""Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design"" for its visual take or ""Clean Code"" for practical tips. freeCodeCamp has interactive sections, Coursera's Java OOP course from Duke is structured well, and YouTube spots like Corey Schafer show examples clearly.

I very much recommend that for a -very- deep dive! If you are more into data structures than user interfaces, taking a deep dive into the **Collections framework** in Java is another interesting example of using OOP! And of course, there's always the option of building your own game - like e.g. **a simple text adventure**, with objects representing items, rooms and characters, using inheritance and polymorphism to give different items either similar or different attributes, and letting objects communicate, like hitting an enemy with a weapon could happen as the player-object calling a hit-method on the enemy-object with a weapon-object, and the enemy-object then asks the weapon-object how much damage it would inflict, and subtract from its own health. That is another good exercise into understanding how to use Objects to represent entities.",peterlinddk,2025-11-15 10:11:02,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oxfxu2,False,

There were always questions I had no idea about, even after all those years, or things I simply hadn’t used in a long time and couldn't remember anymore.So I started creating my own flashcards, for example for JavaScript, and printing them out. After two or three months of learning in my free time, I knew the answers to all the questions I had prepared. I passed nine out of ten interviews (meaning I answered all their questions), and I think about half of the companies ended up offering me a job.Based on that positive experience, over a year ago I built an app with flashcards and quizzes for developers to prepare for technical interviews, and now a few thousand people use it. Most flashcards are free (about 70 percent across 30 categories), and the subscription unlocks quizzes, which also help track progress more effectively. Of course, all of this was before AI appeared.

Simple as heck: SQLite)Then you need some sort of middleware linking database to the UI. That's what you program the ""webapp"" in. And you need to learn THAT. The combination of database and middleware and UI is sometimes called a ""web stack"". For example, the MERN stack is MongoDB as database, Express.js and Node.js as Middleware, and React for UI. No, not suggesting that. It's too complicated for your needs. Figure out the right stack for your project is YOUR responsibility. How would an app send you message? Well... WHAT TYPE of message? Text Message cost money, notifications don't, but routing it to yourself requires going through some sort of OS API. Again, your own research. Yes, I've kept things vague for a reason. I want YOU to finish the research. I merely gave you some ideas to get started.EDIT: If you still don't quite get it, I want you to NAIL DOWN the requirements first. Right now, your requirement is kinda vague. Write the requirements down, into a requirement document. You need it written down and set in stone (well, mostly) before you start. Else, you'll suffer ""feature creep"". THEN you think about HOW TO MEET the requirements with your design, BEFORE you start coding. Once you have the design and architecture of your app down, THEN you start picking it apart, and code it piece by piece. (and test piece and piece if you can).

Fine, you figure out how to get authenticated. You make a new user. You are using its JWT token. But you are not added to relevant access groups. Maybe you can access your guest / new user related endpoints but nothing else. You might find an admin endpoint but as you lack access rights, you'll get 403 error.4. Rate limiting. You get this funny idea that you start scanning the host or start brute forcing or something. Your requests per second will be used up and you'll be either banned or timed out for time being.5.

There’s effectively no real way to guarantee that and anyone dedicated enough would be able to defeat it.What you should likely do is create a user auth system, where users create/log in to an account and that’s validated by the API before the backend processes it.

I do again want to stress that this doesn’t limit someone to only making requests from the extension, someone could just as easily make HTTP requests and include the auth token and pretend they’re using the extension. The point of the authentication layer is that every request is now tied to a user which prevents bots from just spam requesting and lets you ban abusive accounts. You should also likely have some form of IP blacklisting to ban suspicious IPs, for your case where this is just a chrome extension it makes sense to also preemptively ban the IP blocks used by the major cloud providers, regular users won’t be using those and it’ll ban bots that are running on servers hosted by them.",ThunderChaser,2025-11-11 23:06:39,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oundq4,False,

There's many advantages to this actually, with the biggest one being exams. In the UK for instance, there's many exam boards such as OCR, AQA or Edexcel who ask pupils to handwrite code on paper.

nos20vl,"Languages like Swift and Kotlin were certainly designed to support the needs of GUI development, but they don’t have any particular GUI “built in.” Most languages rely on libraries and frameworks for anything thats platform-specific, including user interfaces, graphical or otherwise.Building a GUI framework into a language would just encumber the compiler with a lot of extra complexity, making it less suitable for other purposes and possibly less useful on other platforms. So in general it’s good to keep them separate.That said, there are tools that integrate a language and GUI framework pretty seamlessly, and languages that are meant only for use within a particular platform. Logo defines its own drawing environment and has a lot of built-in drawing functions. HyperTalk (from the late-80’s) was meant mainly for defining UI within the HyperCard environment. Visual Basic was very Windows-specific and integrated with a GUI editor.If Kotlin was recommended for your project, use it.

noxejs4,"From my experience, yes, GUIs are generally done with libraries. They aren't built into a language because many programming languages are intended to be available to write programs for more than one OS/platform, and including a GUI library would make the language's library quite large. GUIs for the various operating systems can also behave significantly differently, with different philosophies, so making a standard GUI library that works with everything would be fairly complex and not very practical.Some developers write command-line applications (without a GUI), so for those reasons, language designers typically choose not to include GUI capabilities directly in a programming language.",RolandMT32,2025-11-15 04:14:20,2,learnprogramming,t3_1owq8fz,False,

nosxizd,"General-purpose languages like Python, C, C++, C#, Java, etc, are meant to run code - All they really do is move data around and execute instructions. GUIs are something else. Like in the beginning, there was just the console terminal, and people had to write programs that moved the cursor, colored parts of the screen, wrote text on the screen buffer. Then framebuffered graphics cards became a thing, and then all of a sudden there were window managers and bitmaps, but the languages pretty much stayed the same. Libraries of course helped create an interface between the language and how data was represented visually.There will always be a separate layer between the general purpose language and the UI. Also, people have different ideas of how a UI should be represented. For example, the Win32 API lets you call the OS layer to draw windows, buttons and style them according to the OS, but that means you can't use your program code as-is on another platform like Linux.Libraries like GTK and QT attempt to solve this problem by creating their own API, which calls the underlying OS to create some of the OS-layer objects like windows, but does the rest of the display stuff itself, in order to have a consistent cross-platform experience.So most language rely on separate libraries or frameworks, like C#/.NET having WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that is Windows-only, or AvaloniaUI which is cross-platform, and MAUI, which is... well...Then different libraries have different ways of abstracting the layout, so WPF uses XML or rather XAML, Kotlin has it written as code.",rupertavery64,2025-11-14 13:12:42,1,learnprogramming,t3_1owq8fz,False,

There are frameworks for building GUIs with imperative code, but they're not great to work with. Declarative languages, however, are great for building GUIs. For example, HTML.

I don’t care if a backend dev knows the intricacies of flex box or what browsers css-grid works in, they should know that giving the UI a huge garbled mess, and telling them to just sort and filter it all out in the UI, that’s not only a jerk thing to do, it’s MUCH slower to do almost any of that in a browser on a 5 year old phone than to just do it on the server (could also be a vulnerability based on what it is).As another person said however: if you do have to make a change in the UI, you should know what you’re doing, within reason.

User A first removes user B from their friends list, and then makes a private post to their friends about the harassment. Those two separate operations involve separate writes to the database, involving data which is likely to be in separate shards. If the database doesn't guarantee that writes are seen in a consistent order, then it's possible that when user B opens their dashboard, the webapp reads from the database and sees the post but not the friends list change. That means B will see the post that was supposed to be hidden from them.Or as another example, consider a storefront with a webapp that writes orders to a DB, and a fulfillment system that reads orders from the DB. If the DB doesn't guarantee consistency, then it's possible that the fulfillment system might see data in one shard saying that an order is in the ""ready for shipment"" status, but data in the other shards about the items to be shipped might be in an inconsistent state that doesn't match what the user saw when the order was placed.

Once you learn programming in one language it's much easier to understand and learn another language. The concepts of programming stay the same. You just express them a bit differently in different languages.To learn programming you should select an easy language with a not so complicated syntax. That makes it easier to learn and faster to make easy stuff. But it's also important to have fun at the same time.

nos06sp,"I'm a staff engineer at a big tech company and this has been something I've watched, followed and used over the last couple of years.My take on LLMs in coding is that they have some utility, but they tend to make the easy stuff easier and the hard stuff harder. Writing software is easy, once you figure out what you want to make, you can bang it out pretty fast. LLMs make this part even faster, which can be nice, especially when I have writer's block.But.I have to go back and read through everything it wrote, make sure it works properly, make sure it caught all the weird edge cases specific to our codebase, make sure it matches our coding style, make sure it's going to be reliable, make sure it didn't hallucinate. I usually end up having to rewrite a decent amount of the LLM generated code.This sucks because reading software and auditing it is much harder and more intellectually draining than writing it.Figuring out what you need to write is the bulk of your job, understanding the specs, understanding the context of your changes within your codebase. Making sure all the weird edge cases you know are handled. Writing docs. Coordinating with other folks on the team.To get good at that, you need practice, and you need to write stuff yourself, and you need to see it fail yourself. I don't think it's going to actually replace me or you any time soon. I could be wrong, I wouldn't mind retiring early lol. So far, it's been years of threatening to take my job, but no real progress towards that goal.The job market is tough right now and companies are blaming AI for layoffs they would have carried out regardless. Tough hiring market at the same time as AI does not mean one caused the other.

Most are just a promise that someone has touched upon basic data structures, algorithms, database concepts, and programming in one or two languages.It doesn’t guarantee they write good code, maintainable code, performant code, or code that even meets requirements. It doesn’t guarantee they can design a database schema or design a system, or even that they understand what a message broker and event streaming platforms are, much less how they fit into a system.It’s always been like this, though, and AI hasn’t really changed anything about that dynamic. Sure, I can design a spec and pop it in the magic Copilot machine and get code that’s close to correct, but I still have to spend time paying attention to what it’s doing and checking its output, while with most junior engineers I can reasonably expect after the first couple months of their career that they didn’t just hand me a pile of dog shit that appears to do what the requirements are asking, but actually falls apart the second I run or test it.For now, it’s just a shit economy, and hiring is going as you’d expect it to in a shit economy.

novqf74,"I was laid off at the beginning of the year and here's what worked for me to get a job within a month of leaving the company:-Make sure you're resume is awesome. Use chatgpt to help you write a base one and then use it some more to tailor your resume and cover letter to the specific opening. They likely are using AI tools to scan your resume so fight AI with AI.-Apply for hybrid positions. There's too much competition for remote jobs. You are competing with the whole country and possibly the world. -Use your network. Ask literally anyone you know. You never know who has a connection. The guitarist in my band works as an accountant for a financial accounting company who develops all their software in house. He ended up being my referral and I would never have known about this company otherwise. And he obviously isn't a developer or technical at all.-Be confident in your interviews. Let your personality come out. You don't need to know all the answers but you can always draw on past experiences to at least relate to -I didn't do any leetcode (or any coding at all) and was mostly asked about my skills, history, projects, and experience. Idk if I got lucky or because it was a senior position or what. But anyway make sure you can tell your story and sell yourself. -Don't forget the interview goes both ways. Think of some questions to ask about the team or the company and flip the script on them. Make them sell to you. It's an old sales tactic. At the very least you'll have more information on where you are potentially going to work and if it's really the opportunity you want. A good interview should feel more like a conversation than a grilling. I walked away from a couple of companies just because I didn't like how they were conducting things (showing up late, acting kinda adversarial, etc). Anyway it's your interview too.Idk. Your mileage may vary, but I didn't have a problem finding a job. I didn't really see what everyone was saying with the bad market out there and everything.

np593sj,"A few things. At medium to larger size orgs there tends to be a split after senior where you decide to either continue advancing as an IC (with titles like staff, principal, architect) or go into management (with titles like manager, director, senior director, VP, CTO). As a result staff or principal engineer wouldn't be considered management. As these titles are in the IC track. This can be important because if you say you want to be an architect or staff title but are talking about management you may be sending mixed messages to gatekeepers. I was surprised about your post title and then the contents of your post weren't about jobs that are commonly thought of as being management. They may think you don't know what you want. Or worse they may think you aren't experienced enough to know the difference and set your application to the side.\> my manager keeps saying i'm ""operating at the next level"" but when i apply for staff or principal engineer roles, either internally or externally, i hit a wall.You will have to be honest with yourself here as we can't evaluate you. But if you are struggling in the behavioral and system design rounds it doesn't sound like you are there. You shouldn't be struggling at all in a behavioral at any of the titles you've expressed. Those titles have a lot of coordination with other stakeholders and you should be able to breeze through them for those titles. Likewise system design is also a fundamental task for those titles. If you are struggling then that may mean you haven't worked on complex enough tasks for them to feel comfortable hiring you with that title. Yes interviewing is a different skill, but it's just as important for getting the job. Yes sometimes the interview is harder than the actual job.If you have skip level meetings I'd highly encourage you to talk to your manager's manager about getting specific with what ""strategic thinking"", ""broader impact"" and ""working on communication"" means to them. Strategic thinking to me would be forward thinking about the feature not just how it's used right now but how will it be used in the future, should it be architected a little differently so we can get future wins for free. You may already be doing this, and what you really need to work on is how people perceive you. If you aren't explaining your thought process to your boss then he may not realize that you are doing ""strategic thinking"". You should be doing this in 1 on 1s. Sometimes using the phrases they care about can work too. I know it sounds dumb but when they are filling out a review and you've been consistently talking about strategy for a project to make sure it has impact can go a long way. Broader impact tends to mean impacting multiple departments. If you are already doing that it might be code for you getting more visibility within those departments when you work in projects that impact them. That could be scheduling meetings to ensure the technical requirements will fulfill their needs. Yes product is usually involved here, but product isn't technical and may not make optimal choices.It should also be noted in some companies they have to have a business need for the title you want to be promoted into. You simply operating at that level isn't enough justification.Lastly, the market is utter garbage right now. You are competing against a lot of other people.

""Strategic thinking"" and ""broader impact"" mean different things at different companies, so without specifics you're just guessing. i went through this exact thing trying to move from senior to staff at a company in the loop about two years ago.the problem for me was that i was still showing up in interviews like a senior engineer - talking about technical decisions, code quality, architecture patterns. but staff/principal interviews are fundamentally different. they're not testing if you can build systems well (they assume you can), they're testing if you can influence the direction of multiple teams, if you think about technical strategy at an org level, if you can identify and solve problems before they become fires.i worked with close cohen career consulting when i was trying to figure this out. the big shift they helped me with was moving from talking about ""what i built"" to talking about ""what technical problems i identified and how i influenced the organization to solve them."" like instead of ""i designed and implemented a new caching layer that improved performance by 40%,"" it became ""i identified that our scaling issues were rooted in inefficient data access patterns across three teams, proposed a comprehensive caching strategy, and influenced those teams to adopt it, resulting in 40% performance improvement and $200k in infrastructure savings.""same technical work, but the framing shows strategic thinking and org-level impact. the mock interviews helped me practice talking at that higher altitude without losing the technical credibility. i ended up getting promoted to staff internally about 6 months after i started really focusing on this, and now i'm fielding recruiter messages for principal roles.the chicago market is competitive but there's definitely demand for senior ic roles. you just have to communicate at the level they're hiring for, not the level you're currently at.",Main_Lengthiness_606,2025-11-16 15:23:11,39,cscareerquestions,t3_1oyl3ce,False,

novq48i,"Yeah, I usually see them as MLOps Engineer or Data Science Engineer, though they can also be listed under more generic AI/ML Engineer, or even occasionally as Data Scientist, depending on the organization. But there's absolutely a career to be made in the space.Candidly, I find that ML Engineering as we're discussing it isn't really an entry level role, but more something that a software/data engineer or data scientist will lateral into if they have an affinity for it. While as an ops/deployment person you won't need to have the same familiarity with the statistics/math as the data scientists and researchers putting together the initial proofs-of-concept and models, you're going to need enough familiarity to be able to sense check things, collaborate effectively with the research side, and, from time to time, optimize the approach without negatively impacting the model capabilities.Key skills include traditional software dev, including the usual system design, engineering, testing, etc., with a few other things. For embedded, there's additional nuances around programming on custom boards, signal processing/cleaning, and to some extent hardware tinkering, and for cloud/forecasting stuff, parallelization and distributed computing comes up with some frequency. Some of the more relevant challenges I see day-to-day are around model instrumentation/tracking metrics, managing cloud costs, runtime, and wrangling tech debt that inevitably spawns as the model pipelines keep changing.I'd personally want to take a software engineer with a few years of experience working in the cloud, or someone who's done some lightweight embedded stuff, and get them up to speed on the ML-relevant side. I could probably take a data scientist and do it, but I've found that most professionals that grow up on that side have pretty terrible programming skills. It's easier to beat data quality and validation into an engineer's head than to get someone up to speed on formal engineering, I find. Though if our nascent ML Engineer is bad at math and logic, their career in ML will probably be pretty short lived.Edit: For LLMs, I think that there isn't much reason (apart from political organizational reasons) to have ML/DS teams responsible for applied LLM implementations and deployments. You'd think that people who should notionally be familiar with the math would be more clear-eyed on what these models can and can't do, but that doesn't seem to be the case--so in my mind, there isnt't a reason to bother having a data scientist involved in the implementation from a technical standpoint.

If you do not have any real users, what you have is ""homework"", or ""exercise"", not a project.Without users, you have no stake holders, no iteration, no communication. You have no demands and expectations. No nothing. You have none of the things that elevate you from writing code to professional software development.>Should I prioritize coding quality, user adoption, revenue, or project vision?If you had revenue worth to speak of, why would you be looking for a job?Coding quality matters - but without it, you will not have users, or lose the ones that you have quickly. If you write terrible code and still manage to retain users, that's still something. Project vision is almost entirely worthless. I make good money working on a silly little CRUD app. I would love it if my company took it further and developed some sort of vision - but we have users, we are profitable and I can pay my bills. Even if we had a vision, it would still be worthless if we didn't actually manage to build it.>Would getting a certain number of high quality daily users make a difference… I ask because I personally see the value in targeted ads to doctors plus the data I would have from their use( it’s all HIPAA compliant).If all of that works, why would you be looking for a job?

noicr52,"The thing that stands out to me the most about a personal project is when someone solved a problem they wouldn't have necessarily wanted to solve in a way they wouldn't have necessarily wanted to do it.Let me explain.For example, I love fantasy football. If I were to do a personal project, I would build something that I want to build that addresses something I care about - and if other people found it interesting and used it, great, but I would 100% ignore any requests to build stuff that I don't care about, or are too difficult, etc.That's what a lot of personal projects are like, and the problem is that most jobs just do not work that way - you don't get to choose the path of most fun and least resistance. Now, mind you - those personal projects are still good in their own way because they allow you to showcase your more pure technical skill. But from an overall ""how will this person do at this job"", they miss a big chunk of it.When I see someone who built something that was clearly based on a user request with real-world, annoying ass constraints? That's when I'm really interested. I think an app built for doctors kinda fits that, because that's not a group that is going to use something for unimportant stuff. So if you're going to get users, you're going to have to be able to handle annoying shit that most people don't want to deal with (e.g., HIPPA compliance).",dfphd,2025-11-12 19:43:33,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1ovdx71,False,

noktjbh,"Make sure your resume is up to date and shows specific things you have done. Even better if there are real numbers you can display. I would argue something like:""Developed a DAG-based AI inference engine for video analysis using Python, FastAPI, and TensorFlow for deepfake video analysis.""is better than:""Wrote a python backend service for a machine learning workload.""Be specific and provide overwhelming evidence that you have done useful things. The evidence is these hyper-specific bullets. Be ready to talk in detail about everything you say you have done. It is really easy to tell when someone is talking out their ass about a resume bullet point. If the interviewer is doing their job they will ask you to get specific. Specificity, detail, depth of knowledge.The best way to get these bullet points is for every single job sit down for at least thirty minutes and just write every single technology you used and every single thing you did. Be painfully verbose in your listing of things. Once you have that you can go back and create bullets like the first one I showed you.I would focus on LinkedIn (shocker), Dice, and Indeed. Dice and LinkedIn are where most of my 'in bound prospects' come from in terms of job opportunities. Dice has actually been really great for me. Get your profile there up to date and as specific as possible.Now let us talk applications. You need to be doing hundreds per day. Don't waste time creating tailored resumes to job postings. Your resume will likely get lost in the sea of other applicants. I wish it was not this way. When I was looking for a job when I got laid off earlier this year I was doing 200-300 a day or more. You will find out eventually that most recruiters look at the new job postings Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday so Saturday and Sunday are GREAT days to slam job postings but you need to be ass-in-chair submitting till your fingers fall off every single day. Do as many easy applies as you can stomach then start moving toward the regular job applications. APPLY, APPLY, APPLY. It sucks, it is boring, it is a numbers game. I had 10+ interviews a WEEK for almost a month when I was doing this. It works.Have two or three references ready to go that you can submit if recruiters or job applications ask for them. Let them know you are applying to a TON of places. It speeds things up if you don't need to ask every single time.Back to the resume thing. It is a good idea to have 2-3 developer 'archetypes' you want to apply for. I have 'Full Stack Python focus', 'Full Stack TypeScript focus', and 'Full-stack AI infrastructure focus' archetypes ready to go. Then you can go to LinkedIn and type 'TypeScript Software Developer' and crank through applications.Also, I like to have at the top of my resume a little blurb that shows what I am:""Software Engineer with experience building AWS-native Python applications to automate critical workflows in the insurance industry as well as large-scale video analysis for customer POCs, securing $10K+ MRR deals, and developing a Python-based DAG-driven AI inference engine for deepfake video analysis.""The HR person or whoever is looking for X type of developer and if you can put that in front of them your chance of getting a callback goes way up. Do EVERYTHING you can to show them you are what they want.One more thing, on LinkedIn it is a good idea to filter by 'Jobs Posted in the last 24 hours'. I applied to some of those earlier this week and within an hour got a call from a recruiter for one of them. This has happened many times.This is how I hunt for jobs, it works for me. It is alot of work but its pretty straightforward once you have the resume and profiles ready to go. And I don't mean to be an ass by bringing this up but I make $150k a year, graduated late 2024 with my CS degree. I landed this job in a tough job market.

A work environment that you really enjoy in the beginning might change drastically into somewhere you don't want to be more quickly than you might imagine.A vestment schedule like that basically requires you to stay there for at LEAST 3 years (and really more 4) to see any real upside, even in the absolute best case scenario. Which: not to be a downer, but even good startups mostly fail. This startup is being unusually stingy with their equity, to a degree that strikes me as a bit silly. A startup being stealth is also almost always very silly as well, but that's a different conversation. I'm not saying don't take the job.
