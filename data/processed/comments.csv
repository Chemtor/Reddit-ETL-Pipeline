And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.If the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.Super cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",StefanBelgica,2025-09-14 09:18:00,1,dataengineering,t3_1nfxgze,False,

Also, Delta and Iceberg are designed for huge data, in this case it makes sense to not be limited by the scaling of a single machine OLTP database, even for the metadata, by storing it with the data.

Seems like Dremio allows users to build folder structures to align data product collections with the business model (e.g. sales folder, finance folder), so a different way of organizing your catalog. But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts. Something like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics. It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves. They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts. Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a ""semantic layer"".Is Dremio working toward adding that capability as well?

But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. To begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transactionWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. There are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. For example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portalOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshotIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.Performance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.Locking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't.

nf0ibqw,"So, are you doing this locally or on PowerBI service on the cloud?Personally, we started there, and then started working on a data warehouse so we had the data centralised, updated regularly and with a single place to find it, every report gets the same result. But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.If you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing). But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.So, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.Try to source control your dashboards.If you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.Stored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).Creating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",-crucible-,2025-09-19 04:05:29,3,dataengineering,t3_1nksner,False,

neb66p5,"I think this is a perfectly reasonable approach. Performance of those views might suffer with a lot of scalar UDFs?I'm not sure how you're calculating your final combined DQ score: I'd be wary of that as it's easy to end up with something a bit meaningless.I use a different approach where each individual _relevant_ data quality concern gets its own view (one ""rule""). So a validation of website format would be one view, returning 0 rows if everything is correct. Each problem is one row, then. I would probably use SQL UDFs if I needed to abstract one piece of logic for multiple views, but that doesn't happen really with our data. The views all follow a consistent approach with common column names etc, then I have a process that collects and merges records from all views. Because each view is doing just one thing, it's very performant. But the view quantity does rack up. The overall data quality measure is just count of problem rows collected that day, and count of rules with at least one problem.There's also metadata in a special magic comment in each view (written using JSON syntax), describing why the rule is important to the business, who is responsible for keeping it empty, and how to go about clearing it. For me, that stuff is essential to maintain somewhere, because it ensures the results are actionable. This metadata is snapshotted daily to a SCD table, so business users can explore the full ""rulebook"" for data quality independently from current extant problems.

By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core.

Google also offers GCP and AWS has Redshift (not recommended). One other you might want to look at is Motherduck, which is quite a bit cheaper than some of the others. You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.The database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs. Again, there are a multitude of patterns and tools available. A lot of companies with basic installs are using Fivetran or Airbyte to ingest the data and dbt to transform it. Personally I wouldn't pay for those, but it simplifies the setup where teams are small or inexperienced. The real hit though is going to be contracting someone to build it. It's absolutely not something you want to figure out on your own as someone that just writes some SQL and python. Mistakes can cause issues with usability, create rework and even higher costs depending on your stack. And to add to the fun, there are a lot of bad consulting firms out there that don't know WTF they are doing, so taking the lowest bid isn't necessarily going to get you to where you want to be.Good luck!",Gators1992,2025-09-19 22:35:05,1,dataengineering,t3_1nla3bv,False,

If you explore the website above:* Water level information, such as normal, warning, danger, caution.* There are links to some states sensor telemetry website.* State specific infobanjir. With more detailed information, such as camera feed.* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.These are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.You can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.You can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.As for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.I'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. You may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.As for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.So, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. For flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. This is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?Here's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.I do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.Anyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.If you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\_id=1059.Anyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",zemega,2025-09-16 05:23:49,8,learnprogramming,t3_1nhtsu3,False,
neh7p3v,"I’ve done my Masters thesis on low-cost flood and water level detection at uni, and there are ways to implement this with relative ease, even if you have no support or collaboration with local government. One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs.

You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!As you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",peterlinddk,2025-09-14 09:03:10,10,learnprogramming,t3_1ngif2e,False,

I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. The more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for ""applications and tools"", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? If you want to be the most versatile, able to learn ""anything(TM)"" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to ""count""): \- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! You should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. Additionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. I think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production.

You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==""1"" : list.append(input(""What do you want to add?"")) elif input()==""2""...')- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself - level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.For bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called ""designer"" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.The more you do, the more you learn.

ne7wmu9,"Rust is C++ done right, and it actually teaches you proper safety by simply refusing to compile your code if the compiler cannot verify its soundness, unless you explicitly opt-out of safety with unsafe blocks, but application / binary crates should never need to do this. Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion. Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic.

This works for me, because I like odd maths puzzles. The key part is, I write scripts that do something interesting to me, and which I have no expectation will live beyond a few hours. They don't necessarily have to be efficient, they just have to give an answer that I am confident of, or that i can check some other way. When I first started doing this kind of thing I had scripts that would run for hours simulating a problem to give me a probability of something. (If i roll two dice 100 times, how many times will I get a 5 and a sum less than 9, or something silly like that). Over time I just got better at banging out boiler plate code, and I found ways to make (for example) loops quicker and more efficient. It isn't useful, it is entertainment. If you can find something similar, I'd recommend trying this approach. It doesn't need to be useful or for the greater good. Can you script something that is interesting to you?

Installation guides, both for beginners and for ""Python veterans"". They are short enough, so I can skim them both quickly. 2. both tutorials.

From that, we can derive a function like this: printBullseye(int n){ for(int i = 0; i < 2*n-1; i++){ for(int j = 0; j < 2*n-1; j++){ int iDif = abs(n-1-i); int jDif = abs(n-1-j); int distance = iDif > jDif ? iDif : jDif; printf(""%d"", distance+1); } printf(""\n""); } }EDIT: I realized while driving to work that I should've converted the range by changing the for-loop start positions instead of cluttering the function with more math. Revised function here: printBullseye(int n){ for(int i = 1-n; i < n; i++){ for(int j = 1-n; j < n; j++){ int iDif = abs(i); int jDif = abs(j); int distance = iDif > jDif ? iDif : jDif; printf(""%d"", distance+1); } printf(""\n""); } }",DTux5249,2025-09-19 19:26:23,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nkxtaf,False,

nesqmhg,"People have been thinking about ways to do this for like 70 years, so there's lots of prior art you can look at. Nowadays this topic is often called ""serialization"" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.Just as one example, look at how the [""Protocol Buffers""](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe ""messages"" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.It uses the same ""length prefix"" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.Reusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.Or if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip.

There is nothing special about a txt file that makes it different. In fact *all files* are merely a sequence of bytes. Opening a file with a particular header marking it as txt tells whatever is opening it “hey, this data is in such and such format like UTF-8. Read bytes of this length and display this data as characters.  A dat or bin file just *doesnt* say “hey, read me as text”, but is still just an array of binary. You actually usually can simply open these in text editors to view broken gibberish if you’d like.Anyhow; if you’d like to store data in txt, there are countless tutorials; it’s often taught as an intro method when first learning file handling anyhow.

As you are trying to create your own format you'll have to make something up yourself. There are catalogues of already taken magic numbers online.Then goes header. On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.One way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number.

Though i recommend padding out your resume whether via internships or simple certifications cause entry level can be rough to get into. 2) Not really, AI is here and it'll affect things but even if AI is used for coding it'll require actual programmers to fix its problems and implement things. It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. 4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good.

nedm4qm,"Yes, do it.It's a great idea to start learning on your own. While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.It is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.I'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.My advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner. Make a thing that calculates football statistics. Whatever you find interesting.",captainAwesomePants,2025-09-15 17:15:09,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nhrkmw,False,

nedz0s8,"Hey :) I am currently writing my Master Thesis in Cybersecurity at a University in Germany. I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better. I can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. I feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience. If you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.Regarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law.

I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.Understand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.There are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.The important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app ""feels slow"", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request ""fans out"" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.Test automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?Understand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on.

Is there desire to grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. To find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code) products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. Hang in there. If your company is trying to grow, their focus is likely on adding customers through new features and much of what you are worried about will be pushed to the back as ""technical debt"" until your platform actually crashes, or gets hacked out of operating and held for ransom.",dswpro,2025-09-14 23:19:24,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ngt349,False,

ne6pj5v,"You're welcome, hopefully it was at least a little bit helpful.Unfortunately, I don't know of any *comprehensive* resources covering what you need to know as a senior dev. I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.But there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.The good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.Just as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [""Simple Made Easy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [""The Mess We're In""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.Also, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.EDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either.

Instead, pick a project that’s useful to you personally. That way, even if you don’t gain anything beyond the learning experience, you’ll at least have built a tool that helps you in your own life, which is already a great benefit.So, I asked myself: is there anything in my life that I could automate? The answer to that question will be the project idea I’ll work on.Of course, I know there are countless other directions you can take with programming projects, not just automation.

ne9ibvk,"> What’s the best way to approach learning so that I can really understand Python and reduce my dependence on AI? Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?This question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.This especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.If you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?If you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.If you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.Finally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries.

For one, in an actual dev environment that's approximately how pedantic the tests are (although usually you'll have access to the tests which helps with matching strings). For another, most of their projects are reimplementing other projects that are in use and define a communication protocol. So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.As to your point about whether to recommend it, sure I agree it's not right for everyone, but I personally feel the tests are quite reasonable.

The overzealous vibe coder trope.What that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.We all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.But it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.Nowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot ""Why am I getting \[pasted error\]?"". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.I also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.AI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.I'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",SouredRamen,2025-09-16 18:25:07,102,cscareerquestions,t3_1niov8g,False,

So a lot is on the individual if they know they need to grow that area and practice it themselvesAnd then with technical skills there’s a lot of room to make mistakes and failsafes to catch you. With QA/canary/code review/rollbacks etc and even if a mistake makes it to prod typically it’s fine and a learning experience. Whereas in a social setting first impressions are very important.

nf0pch8,"I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.Anyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.This is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.Like OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just ""smooth talkers"" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?There's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having ""good english"" and ""talking shit"".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. 3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",whathaveicontinued,2025-09-19 04:58:06,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1nkttp4,False,

You don’t have to have a maxed out charisma stat, you need to not be miserable for your coworkers to interact with. I have ADHD for example and I interrupt my coworkers all the time but they live with me.ADHD is a poor proxy for understanding what it’s like to live with autism, so please do not take this as me attempting to be reductionist toward legitimate struggles, but one thing I have found helpful is to stop assuming my condition is the barrier I’m facing. It might CONTRIBUTE to the barrier, but plenty of people before and after me have had ADHD undiagnosed their entire lives and they never even knew. I’m glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded. Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.I had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I’m getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I’m extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.Don’t panic, you’ll be fine.edit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven’t.

nerk8w7,"The pattern you usually see is this: if someone comes from very humble beginnings with no networks, no capital, and no guidance, and still becomes wildly successful, there’s usually an incredible amount of luck involved. Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.Take Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.If you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.Finance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.So if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper.

neoyknp,"Its social media. Humans within a social circle (that now encompasses the world) likes to show-off and brag. However, based on what you wrote, you and many others have been both mislead and duped by these influencers. Many influencers show off a lavish life style funded by millions of dollars in debt. They aren't rich by any means. Only faking it.>I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.Tech encompasses a wide range of compensation, benefits and perks. What you see on social media is the top 10% of all tech. It would look completely different - perhaps even bleak, if someone actually showed the day in the life of a median (50th percentile) or worst (100th percentile) job.They certainly don't have free lunches, nap pods, and may be even lucky if they get free coffee. They might be filling out time-sheets and staring down some of the worst-maintained technology with very strict deadlines and constraints for changes. Depending on the country, the median can range anywhere from $40K-80K. Does that sound super cushy to you?>Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.Do you really get why this happens?Based off of your perspective you don't. The phenomenon is more broadly categorized as ""keeping up with the jones"" within the last century. Only with the internet it has allowed people to share their accomplishments across a larger audience that would not have been possible before.Previously such people would only be able to reach as far as people similarly within their economic circle. People irrespectively have been comparing themselves to others within their social circle for millennia. The rich compared themselves with other rich. The poor compared themselves to other poor. The middle class compared themselves to other middle class. Its competition, its standard human nature that we haven't grown out of.The internet and more specifically Social Media has given everyone a microphone to broadcast themselves.>There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:Any job can be cushy if you're in the right positions. But your perspective is off-keel and your barking up the wrong trees. Within ALL professions, there is the top, middle, and bottom. What you see on social media being ""cushy"" jobs is nothing more than a facade - including in the industries you mentioned. They are designed to spark envy.Many of these high paying jobs are not ""cushy"" in the slightest - at least if people are actually performing their job.

Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids. As a result they are easier to manipulate when the industry is in a boom.You should index your total compensation against the percentiles for your country. 73K euro could put you in the top 5%, 10% (many european countries), 15% (e.g. Canada), or 30% (e.g. US) of earners depending on the country you reside in.

For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.).

And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.Alternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking.

Will you be a 1099 contractor?If yes to the above questions then you'll have an opportunity to open a solo 401k. Why a solo 401k? Say you leave your main employer. You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.Why do this?With a solo 401k you get two advantages:* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.There is also a third advantage.A 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.The employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.So with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.You just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k.

How would you do that if you aren’t even in the office to keep tabs on the said office politics? Your reports, especially the junior ones who don’t know how to manager up, may suffer alone and not know whom to turn to or how to deal with it.Another thing to keep in mind…it’s fine to stay an IC and prioritize family. Not every stage of your career has to be growth oriented. Please don’t become a manager for the sake of the next promotion - those usually end up the worst managers. Become a manager when you are ready to mentor and grow people. When you are thinking about starting a family, it’s ok to take a backseat and coast/autopilot a bit in your current job. You can always become a manager later. But your kid(s) only grow up once.",lanmoiling,2025-09-16 05:00:51,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1ni6my1,False,

ne5sthx,"TL;DR: I wrote a goddamn novel so here's the brief. A lot of fresh graduates go through what you're going through. You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.I never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. The issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. Because of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.That's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.You should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. A lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during ""ramp up"" which usually takes about 6 months. You got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you.

Her only “crime” was that she often frequently disagreed with his opinions on how to manage the projects (which were years behind schedule now thanks to him). And the group manager had a meeting with everyone else the same day to say “I had no part in this.” Meanwhile, he had quickly become the laughing stock of the team. He would get off department calls, and the second he hung up, one of our managers would say, “oh good, he’s gone, now we can get some real work done.” So…Fortunately for me, the business saw how little value he was bringing within 6 months after, and suddenly he was forced out in a matter of months once his old boss (and best friend) left him high and dry to pursue a higher position.I hate to admit it, but someone once told me, “50% of your career is what you know, and 50% is who you know.” I’d hate to think they are right, but I’llbe damned if there isn’t a pole of evidence to support it.",AwkwardPersimmon6041,2025-09-19 18:41:37,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlb2qu,False,

If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. Your other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. Both of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses.

new0fsz,"People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.Some background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.Our original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.Towards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. So in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.My wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.TLDR;My situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.My advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.DM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",natey_mac,2025-09-18 13:59:13,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1nk5eig,False,

It's totally normal if the parts ""far"" away from where you normally work you don't know so well. Nobody will care whether or not you can describe how CAN signaling works. You should probably at least be able to describe what it looks like when the CAN messages are delivered to you though.This in particular is a red flag, so hopefully it's a joke:>“Tell me something about RTOS”>“Uhhhh…you have tasks and the scheduler schedules them….”You've worked on this thing for 2 years and haven't put in the work to understand *any* part of it?

nexjnc5,"I came from defense company where i worked on a radar for 4 years. I then went into one of the companies you listed and worked in their cloud services for aobut 3 years. Your concerns are valid. I dont know how closely related my first job is to your job but here was my experience. At defense, work life balance was a lot better. I didnt have to think about work after 5 pm. The tasks were good enough to keep me engaged but i didnt need to know anything crazy or expand my knowledge really. You could get by and not understand everything. So when you said the quote about not really understanding RTOS, i get that because i worked on things that at the time if you asked me to explain it, tbh i only knew the basic overview of it, not the ins and outs. One of my tasks was actually coding a lot of the receiver and transceiver code too lol. But i was a big overperformer even if i only did like 20 hours a week and chilled the rest. In defense, nobody really disagreed as everybody was just there to give their hours and go. We never really dealt with customers as our project wasnt fully completed. After 4 years i wanted to go for bigger and better and i got in the big tech company (again it's one of the ones you lsited). They wont give you an embedded engineer to ask you things but they may ask you a system design question and the question could be related to what you have experienced at your current job. So youd have to explain how the receive and transceiver work for example. When it comes to coding questions, i think praciticng leetcode and really understanding Data structures is good enough. I think the problem in the interview iwll come when they ask questions like ""tell me a time you disagreed with an older engineer/customer?"" or ""tell me a time you had to deal with an angry customer?"". Unfortunately in embedded stuff, that doesnt come up as much, especially in defense industry. I cant speak for you job but can you answer those questions?"" The vibe i get from your post is that you just do you and there isnt much pushback from either side. Also, be careful chasing these big companies. Like i said i got into one of the cloud systems and for 3 years the work was hectic. I was doing 5x the work and it still wasnt enough for them. I got PIPd after two years and then fired half a year later. Personally the project was just a lot and they expected 60+ hour weeks but it was more like ""only do 40 \*wink-wink\*"". Seniors and principals were too stressed and overworked to helpout and get on calls to help jrs. Everything was a meeting. Standups would take 2 hours because they wanted to discuss something. As a mid-level i was expected to lead meetings and projects. The culture was just toxic and the thing is they can be like this because they know there's a million other people gunning for your job. During reviews you were compared to what your coworkers were doing not what was expected of you. so if you exceeded your own expectations, but all your coworkers are working 60+ hours and have 60+ hours of work to show while you only have 40 hours of work ot show, your manager will go ""why are you so behind?"" and telling them you stick to 40 hours isnt enough. Again this isnt all projects in big tech. Like i knew a guy who worked at AWS which is supposed to be the worse of all of them, but his project was very chill where he doesnt think aobut it after 5 pm. It's very project dependent. All im saying is dont just do it for the money and fame, really consider it. There's plenty of big companiees that dotn fall in that faang bucket that pay just as well. Remember our career pays very well regardless of industry. Even if you make 120k, you are making more than most careers. So dont sell your life for that 200k. Apply to these companies, but make sure it is a right fit for you. Also dont fall in love with the bonus/RSUs they will throw everything at the bonus/RSUs to get you in the door, those are not guaranteed.

Understand what race conditions were before I could try to avoid them. Know what different kinds of caches there are before I could choose a good one. Know what cloud services do before I could choose which one to use in a system.  This last one can seem like a lot. And no one really wants to study after work.

nf3ndn3,"This one is tougher than it looks tbh. Ill give you my story a bit, I worked at a defense contract company for 4 years. Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. Defense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. Big tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. Im not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call. You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. Im just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be.

neqvwfm,"Azure deployments, scripting with Python and Bash, FastAPI, and Databricks is good mix of cloud engineering, automation, and backend development all valuable and marketable skills. Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. Your role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.Before you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for.

I've worked with multiple data scientists in industry with degrees in physics.Most all hiring managers and any decent recruiter will not find anything amiss with the credentials and background.**To answer your questions directly**: (1) you don't need to express the value of your experience in a particularly special way, (2) most certifications won't help much but could help to convince people you're more ready to go in certain aspects (see below), and (3) most people aren't really looking for portfolios. Internship and job experience trump other factors.Anyway, through your resume and in interviews you will need to convince people that1. You have extensive practical and theoretical knowledge of very basic DS concepts like gradient descent, regularization, data cleaning, A/B testing, etc.2. You have some practical and theoretical knowledge of whatever technique or domain area their team specializes in. Maybe it's computer vision or recommendation systems or something else like that. This used to generally not be as much expected for entry level but with today's market the expectations are higher.3. You have foundational technical/business skills, depending on the kinds of work the team delivers.

That's pure data science experience, just in a different domain.Skip the certifications and focus your energy on translating your existing projects into a portfolio that speaks the business language. Take that neural network simulation and present it as a machine learning project - discuss the algorithms you implemented, the performance metrics you used, and the insights you generated. Create a GitHub repository with clean, well-documented code and write up your projects with clear explanations of your methodology and results.
