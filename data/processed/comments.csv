If any vendor is serious about helping, they need to stop obsessing over workflows and buzzwords, and solve for things that actually are fragile and never talked about. The hard stuff isn't writing ETL, it is visibility into how data changes across systems, understanding why it broke, making reruns sfae, and keeping people aligned on what ""good data"" even means.

My initial reaction to it was how well thought out it was and how well documented. It felt like a db platform built to address the pain points of battle weary DW practitioners.Throughout my career I've seen ""Tech X is better than Tech Y, why can't people see that"". It depends on whether those advantages are relevant to your business. There are always pain points. What impact, if any, do these have on your business and do they negate the advantages.I worked for a consultancy that was a Snowflake partner. We worked out how to run Snowflake, and other SaaS tech at very low cost. As a Snowflake partner, this made us as popular with them as hemorrhoids in a spacehopper race.What people forget in Tech X vs Tech Y arguments, particularly in the SaaS world, is that both are watching each other, evolving, copying/stealing features. Yesterday, Tech X was ahead, today Tech Y is ahead, tomorrow, who knows?Remember too, it isn't the size of the wand, its the magic of the magician. Lets suppose you can query infinite data infinitely fast. Management take one look at the results, don't like them and send your team off on weeks worth of wild goose chases to determine why the figures don't match their perceptions if what ought to be.

A *data engineer* manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.Data engineering as a fundamental concept is always going to be the same, but how this is accomplished has evolved and changed over time. The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. The decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. More recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse.

Prefect is nice if you want something lighter with better DX.Honestly, even GitHub Actions or cron works fine for simpler setups if you’re disciplined with retries/alerts. Hosting wise, containers on ECS/Kubernetes give flexibility, but I’ve also seen folks run Python EL pipelines on Azure Functions or AWS Lambda when workloads are small enough.The headache is always secure on-prem access.

I'm all for firing non performers but it requires the ability to identify who is performing. I've been in performance management meetings where I was the only other person who could open GitHub.

nhidt3r,"I've found the best way to understand your data requirements (and therefore table requirements) is to understand what your reporting requirements are. Once you understand what you need for your reports, you can then build the data to fit those needs. Typically if youre designing data models for Power BI or a lot of other tools, you need to have a model built on Kimball best practices for ingestion into your reporting dataset (i.e. a star schema as much as possible - this sometimes isnt possible due to data or reporting restrictions and you'll need to snowflake).You also need to understand what fact and dimensional attributes you need in your report, and appropriately build facts with the appropriate columns and dimensions with the appropriate columns where attributes directly pertain to one another.The three layers of ETL can vary from this, but this is what I would do:- Staging data - as is from source (or structured into parquet files in a data lake)- Enterprise/silver data - this can depend on what youre planning to have. You could do a inmon style data model, data vault or directly into a kimball structure. Inmon and Eata vault give more flexibility but require a lot more work in building them. While straight to Kimball is the simplest and quickest way of building data. It depends on your businesses skill sets and time constraints. - gold layer - kimball data models with surrogate keysIn terms of pipelines youre main aim is to have the easiest estate to maintain and manage. This to me means having minimal pipelines. This can be done by building a metadata driven ETL making your pipelines parametised and driven by configuration tables. In my experience its best to have configuration tables stored in an Azure SQL DB to allow easy transactional data changes, and ease of inserts and updates. With Azure pipelines you can typically do one extract pipeline (or a couple of parent child pipelines) per source system type and authentication type (e.g. Oracle and Windows auth).Enterprise/Silver pipelines you can have one pipeline.Presentations a pair of parent and child pipelines.",Quiet-Range-4843,2025-10-03 08:05:04,18,dataengineering,t3_1nwp1wp,False,

In cloud stacks you trade that GUI clarity for scalability, and sometimes the trade doesn’t feel worth it.If you want something closest to that old-school feel, Coalesce is probably the best “modern PowerCenter” I’ve seen. You still end up with SQL under the hood, but the GUI gives you traceability that’s hard to replicate in pure PySpark. Matillion works too but the lock-in stories are real, and Informatica Cloud is… still Informatica, so you know what comes with that. Apache Hop is worth a look if you want open source with a GUI—less polished, but flexible.The reason folks keep pushing dbt is because it hits the sweet spot of modularization + lineage + testing in SQL. Add dbt’s semantic layer or a canvas-style GUI (dbt Cloud if you’ve got budget) and you get part of that PowerCenter experience without losing code discipline.If your gold models are the bottleneck, I’d maybe pilot Coalesce on a hairy one and compare cycle time + auditability against your current PySpark/dbt flows. Sometimes just seeing the impact analysis in a GUI saves hours of detective work.Curious, are you leaning toward vendor-backed tools (Coalesce, Matillion, Informatica) or would you consider open source like Hop or even something hybrid?

nhbo7r7,"CDC is just another way of getting changes from a database. It is especially useful for scenarios where the database does not have timestamps, and you don't have other application-level events.Databases store every change that happen to them in some form of a changelog, roughly a file that has the changes applied to a row, sth like this:* table: `users`* operation: \`UPDATE\`* id: 42* email: [`old@example.com`](mailto:old@example.com) → [`alice@example.com`](mailto:alice@example.com)CDC is the idea of using this change dataset and replicate the same events for analytical purposes in other places, e.g. your BigQuery or Snowflake.There are various ways CDC can be implemented, the most common open-source software for that being Debezium, which reads these events from the database changelog and publishes them to other destinations such as Kafka. This allows people to start consuming the changes even if there's no domain events being published from the application.This way of retrieving the data is especially useful when you do not have reliable timestamp columns, which is very common in enterprise settings.

At the simplest level, it just means capturing row-level changes (inserts/updates/deletes) from a source system and pushing them somewhere else.How it’s done depends on the tech.

So you’ll see CDC as both a *concept* (keep downstream systems in sync with source changes) and a set of *implementations* (Debezium, Oracle GoldenGate, Fivetran, Estuary, etc.).Compared to microbatches: microbatching polls the DB every X minutes and compares timestamps, which is simpler but usually heavier load and not real-time. Event streaming is closer in spirit, but those events are usually app-generated, not DB-level changes.

I like to control the fields, so if there is a need for unnesting, I like to do it myself. If a column will never be used, it doesn't make sense to unnest it at all.Another reason I dislike it is that, in modern DWHs, you can store JSON, as well as arrays/structs.

The Dev environment needs to have prod data. My team uses dbt for our sql models, and we configure our dev environment to pull in prod dataOkay, so now you have a dev and a prod SSIS environment. You need to configure your environment variables in the SSIS project. This will allow GitHub later to switch between environments based on the git branch.You can use Github actions to build the ci/cd. The action is just a yaml file that gives github a list of instructions to perform. Here is the workflow. You push code for your local repo, les call it ticket SSIS-001. The ticket changed the column name in a table. When you push the local changes to the remote branch, aka SSIS-001, on the remote server. The Github actions will kick off the instructions. The goal of the instructions is to confirm of the deployment is worked as expected. You will probably want to run some test that check if any of your transformations fail. If any transformation fails, the entire pipeline will fail. When this happens, the ci/cd will stop. This means you can't merge SSIS-001 into prod.So, now you go back on your local branch and fix the issue and push the changed back to the remote SSIS-001 branch. The pipeline passed, and now you merge into master branch. The master branch will run a pipeline that is the same and then push the dtsx package to ssis server and done.Checkout Azure DevOps that might where you want to handle the ci/cd.

In other words, a majority of this complexity is just the result of compensating for platform gaps, which ends up destroying maintainability and predictability.My $0.02 - go with a platform that provides a declarative (as opposed to imperative) approach, where you focus on the data flow/transformation, and the platform handles the failures in a predictable manner. * If you are already on databricks, delta live tables are it. * If you are exploring alternatives and want something lighter weight, tabsdata is a good alternative that you can run on your laptop and expand on later.

At deploy time, read the registry and build assets with consistent keys like source.table; new tables mean a small config change, not new code.

Sensors: file sensors for landing zones, plus a “schema drift” sensor that diffs metadata and opens a PR to update the registry so assets get generated on the next deploy.

The second is more of a comprehensive data quality check (summary statistics and drift), which is usually performed further downstream and is business-logic dependent.

nhrck4t,"Off the bat there really aren’t universal “best practices” - Data Engineering has historically been a very “dirty” area in IT. You will need to be able to adapt to kind of whatever your company throws at you/wants from you. It’s definitely getting better, tools like Dagster, dlt, dbt (R.I.P. this open source project…) together with [PEP 318](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) (and associated RFP) have really helped to push DE closer towards SE in design and implementation. As such you are best looking at best practices around software engineering principles and adapting to your work.To answer your questions, please see below:1. This VERY much up to you as the DE to decide. The OLTP -> HDFS/S3(-like) storage is a very common use case and as such has a lot of choice for you as the DE. In saying that it’s easiest to usually use what you have on hand/in production already. Have SSIS - you can start with that, only have Python - use that. What you are really asking here is how do I ETL - just google ETL OLTP to storage etc.2. For you (or your architects/plats guys if you have them) to decide, but I personally would want separation of services since I’m not trying to deal with noisy neighbours etc. You really don’t want to add more ways for your Production OLTP server to crash/underperform IMO. So I would recommend a seperate VM/dedicated file server/service with proper subnetting etc.3. Will once again depend on use case, but almost always will be read-replica if they exist in your corp. (You can take this as - Yes, use your read replica(e).4. You will need a VPN gateway (unless you are running some ExpressRoute etc). Also you will need to give the cloud storage a Private IP address (and check subnetting/peering etc) Your network guy(s) will know what to do/should really be doing this for you.5. Just more ETL - this time file system to cloud storage. Once again you decide.6. :person_shrugging: Up to you. I personally don’t use them as they quite expensive and don’t seem worth it to me and my practice, but if your company is on board and you feel more comfortable using them go for it.Edit: I want to point out that it entirely possible to this all on-premise (and open sourced :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:) if you need/the cloud aspect is the most frustrating portion.",Surge_attack,2025-10-04 18:22:44,6,dataengineering,t3_1ny091v,False,

Try not to have your own managed staging area as that creates complications and management overhead.> Would the file system be on the same server as the database or on a separate server?If you still do that, don't put data on the system where the db is, use a spearate system.> Is it better to extract the data from a replica or would it also be acceptable to access the production database?Depends upon on the db load profile.

If half of those 2000 don't have a B.Sc. in Comp Sci on their resume, it is easy to toss them in a bin and cut your search space in half. Will you throw away some applications from great candidates? Absolutely. But their priority will be whittling down the pile of resumes to a more manageable number as fast as possible so anything they can filter on is great.Next to that hurdle, there's just that university comes with lots of networking skills. You'll make contacts - especially if you do an internship, but even if you don't if you have a good reputation in your program the other good students are going to remember you. And might give you a recommendation if you try to get in where they work. The whole ""it isn't what you know, it is who you know"" is at least partially true in every field.Okay, social/employment considerations aside, what actual learning advantages does University have? There's a few.First is time. Between classes and studying and assignments, you'll probably spend 5000 hours over 4 years on comp sci as you go through the degree, which I think is probably the bare minimum you need to get competent. A lot of self-taught people are trying to cram in all their learning into just a couple hundred hours and that's super unrealistic.In addition, when your work is being evaluated by others it helps you figure out if you're actually learning anything. Good professors (and they aren't all good) will design assessments that are really testing if you understand the material deeply. Whereas I see so many people ""self-teach"" themselves and learn *nothing* because their knowledge is never put to the test and they never realize they've just been copying tutorials and never actually internalized anything.In terms of actual subject matter, yeah, fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, that type of thing self-taught people tend to miss out on. But there's like a *million* books you can pick up that'll teach you those. The employment angle and the ""actually forcing you to spend the time and effort instead of just convincing yourself you're learning"" parts are the far more important aspects for most people.",PoMoAnachro,2025-10-02 15:35:45,12,learnprogramming,t3_1nw3zzv,False,

CS grads may have more theoretical knowledge but they may not have ""industry-ready"" knowledge such as knowing Git, knowing PostgreSQL, building a rest apt, etc. Autodidacts will have a lot of holes in what they know and without proper fundamental knowledge, they may get stuck.However, this is just a generalization: * Not every CS degree holder are the same.

nhwq5r2,"Yes.This isn't really a programming problem, however. It gets into an ""operations"" problem.The short answer: just make a file on a Local Area Network (LAN), (usually just on your home network somewhere), and then access it by that local network's IP address.Long answer: By _default_, nothing has a domain name on the internet. You have to apply to get one of those if you want it to be public, and it's a whole process.By _default_, everything on the internet has an IP address. This address allows the computer to figure out what other computer to talk to.Most (home network) LANs have an NAT (network address translator), which takes all the requests sent to it that are destined for the WWW, and translates them so the data gets sent back to said NAT, and translates it back to the LAN address. This NAT is usually in a Router (a connection between two different networks.)Without this router, you cannot connect to the LAN from the internet, so it is not public.With this router, the stuff on your network is only public if you change the router settings to allow incoming connections (usually with Port Forwarding/Triggering)Thus, routers have two different IP addresses. One for ""the internet"" to communicate with it, and one for the LAN, to communicate with the LAN.Any computer connected to the LAN can talk to any other device on the LAN with its IP address. This LAN address usually starts with 10., or 192.168., depending on how the router is set up.So if you save the website on a local computer, then use the computers LAN IP as the URL on any other computer in that LAN, you get what you want.",Nerketur,2025-10-05 15:47:28,7,learnprogramming,t3_1nyr14w,False,

Nobody's going to accidentally discover that, but copying IPv6 addresses around is kind of a pain and the people you're sharing it with may not even have IPv6 access.The easiest thing to do is just to not worry about any of that.

The measurement unit and restriction physicists and astronomers need and grapple with isn't really identical to the social construct involved in your alarm clock.

There are a few different strategies to dealing with this on computers, like making the seconds slightly longer throughout the day, or adding a 61st second to a relevant minute, which may be enumerated as either `59, 60, 00` or `59, 59, 00`. All of the options fuck with software that has no clue what a leap second is.Another example: [Sidereal years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year) aren't the same thing as the thing you're used to thinking of as a year (here's a nice [veritasium video on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg)).And those are just physics problems.

Godot is easier to start with (simpler, no setup), Unity has more jobs/resources. Both are great choices.Either way, I'd take one of many online programming courses in Python or C\# before jumping into an engine, or perhaps dig into the CS50 course for more structured learning. A game engine adds a bunch of concepts on top of programming that are specific to the engine. If you want to jump in with both feet, that's fine, but you may struggle with information overload.

With some focused training in modern syntax, version control, cloud basics, and the latest frameworks, you can quite easily return as a senior or backend-focused developer.Good Luck!",Mental-Climate5798,2025-10-04 19:23:55,11,learnprogramming,t3_1ny0eqi,False,

The current LTS are Java 21 and Java 25.And similar version changes have happened also to Spring Boot and other things.But as we know, the real life shows that companies are still using old versions because most of the development funds go to adding new features and fixing bugs. Infrastructure upgrades are of lower priority for the management level.Maybe somehow big thing was Log4Shell vulnerability that affects Log4J versions between 2.0 and 2.15. If you have any projects using Log4J from these versions then update your stuff. That Log4Shell was a catastrophe level vulnerability. Or, just learn to use vulnerability checking tools like OWASP Dependencycheck or Trivy scanner if you are not doing it already.Other than that, the world is quite same in 2025 as it was in 2017.When it comes to an AI then that is what you need to learn to use. Everything else is just version upgrades.There is free ChatGPT tier you can use. Also Google AI Studio is free to use (better than free ChatGPT tier). Just try it out. See what it can do and what it can't do. I would say that the current AI is on a Bachelor student's level. So, imagine working with a Junior developer. Sure, it is a helpful tool when it comes to debugging stuff, brainstorming, etc. Also when it comes to automating simple things. But do not fully trust its output. Be critical about its answers. Imagine doing a code review to a Junior developer. Like that.More often than not, then current AI that is available to us, is lazy, forgets things (due to a context window and due to an unoptimized focus), sometimes ignores your instructions. Many of the AI tools can access the Internet. BUT it does not mean it will do it. It is lazy. Unless you demand from it to look up information from the Internet it will not do it. It tries to rely mainly on its training data (which can be outdated). It also hallucinates when it does not have an exact answer to something. It starts generalizing stuff and making up answers.So, be critical with what the AI is telling you. It is a useful tool but do not fully trust it. The same way how you do not fully trust Google Search results. Verify over, when possible.You can also use Claude Code that can work with your projects in your own machine. But all the pros and cons of AI apply also to Claude Code. You will tell it to do things and it will then display code changes with a git diff.

nhbe01a,"A switch is a smart version of a hub. A hub is just a box where all the Ethernet cables are connected together. Physically. No chips, just wires. Like they’re twisted together (8 sets, one for each color wire). Every outgoing packet goes to every other host’s Ethernet card, and everyone just ignores packets that aren’t addressed to them. Only one packet can be sent by one host at any given time, since there’s only one wire to talk on.Rather than send EVERY packet on your local lan to EVERY host on your local lan, a switch pays attention to the traffic (including some special packets) and figures out who’s on which physical outgoing cable, and sends packets only to their recipients. But that’s just an optimization. It does the same *job* as twisting 8 sets of wires together, like the hub was doing. Purely a local-network thing.You can see how this is totally different than inspecting packet headers, consulting routing tables, and forwarding a packet along on its way to who knows where.[I guess that’s a long way of saying that a router routes IP packets on the global network , and a switch “routes” Ethernet packets on the local network.

nhc1jo1,"I think you may have a bad assumption.A router is said to be at layer 3, because layer 3 is the routing layer. This isn't talking about some real physical router, **this is talking about the abstract concept of a router's core function**. The network layer is where packets are moved around between separate 'local' network segments.A 'switch' is a layer 2 device, because that core functionality of a 'switch' belongs on the OSI model. Layer 2 is about connecting the physical devices together on the local network.Real, physical devices that you actually use, almost always operates at ALL layers. A router will have a physical connection to other devices, it will will have to be using something like Ethernet to connect, it will have a networking protocol like IP, IPX or something obscure for its primary functionality. But it will also have a management interface, and often it will have some support for network services like ntp, dhcp, dns, etc, meaning it will operate in layer 4-7.Many of the devices called 'switches' you will have access these days also can operate as routers, have packet filtering and so on. Many devices that are called 'routers' and used for home networks include a switch. I could take a random computer and put in a few network interfaces in it, and with Linux turn it into a router, or switch. What something is called is more about what you believe the primary function of the device is.> even though switch comes after router. When looking at the OSI model, you must evaluate it individual for every single device between the source and destination. A computer L1-7 will be often be connected to something acting as a switch L1-2, which will be connected to a router L1-3, which which may be connected to another switch L1-2, which may be connected to another computer L1-7.On a typical wired network you will have some kind of physical connection, your Ethernet frames between nodes are happening at layer 2, the Ethernet frames contain Internet Packets, Internet packets will often be TCP or UDP, Your TCP or UDP packet will often contain some kind of application playload.> Im confused on why the architecture was designed in a way so router have to look into higher layer just for it to encapsulate it again and pass it to lower level device.Though it is mostly used everywhere these days, it is very important to remember, that the world isn't just Ethernet. A router can connect different types of networks. A 'switch' is basically an Ethernet only thing.It used to be very common to have a T1 (serial), or frame-relay, or some other type layer 2 network connect to the router, and maybe a token ring network on the 'local' segment.For people with a cable internet connection (DOCSIS) they will have a router with a cable interface and an ethernet interfaces. Or maybe you'll could have a DSL connection so you'll have a router with a DSL interface.DSL, DOCSIS, frame relay, fddi, token ring and many more are not Ethernet.

That is closer to the hardware than a router, which operates at an IP (logical addressing) level. These lines can blur a bit with smart switches, and routers also interacting with ethernet.But the OSI model is mostly conceptual, anyway, and has been retro-fitted into modern TCP/IP networks.IP level is what lets you coordinate on a larger WAN (ie, the internet), across multiple physical networks. Trying to operate at an ethernet (layer 2) level across billions of computers around the world sounds like a bad time. > it feels weird how router is on layer 3 but switch is in layer 2 even though switch comes after router.

Mainly, I think the main issue is that layer 2 can mean a number of different protocols, because there are many different types of networks. Ethernet is what most of us think about and is extremely common in home and business networks. But there are many more. High capacity fiber links, satellite networks, cellular networks, even USB and Bluetooth, all have their own implementations and their own particular way of sending data between devices on those networks. The Internet Protocol accepts the fact that network operators won’t always agree on what devices and protocols to use, and that new network innovations might occur in the future. The Ethernet protocol is actually younger than the IP protocol. There were other types of networks in use when IP was developed, some still in use and others not. With IP, as long as devices are able to send an ordered sequence of bytes over a network they can handle IP traffic, and a lot of details necessary for how those bytes are moved in the network are left to the lower layers.",archa347,2025-10-02 08:31:09,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nvubbk,False,

Take 2 equations: f(x) = 100x + 10, g(x) = x (the simplest function we can represent with the same degree as f(x)).The largest exponent for both of these equations is 1, so we can apply the above rule. Let's choose a constant of 105 for c.For some values of x, f(x) > c * g(x). Take x == 1 for example. F would be 110 and g would be 1. 110 > 105 (1 * C). However, at larger values of x, this doesn't stay true. At x == 10 we get f is 1,010 and g is 10. So, for these values, f(x) 1,010.Basically, this just sums down to the idea that a functions growth is capped to its largest exponent, which is why Big O notation always ignores constants (except for O(1)). So, even something like f(x) = 1,000,000,000x, the Big O notation would be O(x), because there exists a constant C and a value of x X0 that f(x) < c * g(x).",Alarming_Chip_5729,2025-10-05 04:46:36,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nyeko4,False,

Java will run on desktop and natively on any Android device. Python has frameworks and tools that will also allow you to do it. If it’s a web app like browser base JavaScript can get it going. My advice pick something you’d like to do with plenty of tutorials and find a language that matches it. Stick to it until you have a good grip and you’re able to build a fairly robust app. After you can look into other languages and specify into what you want. It’s not crazy hard to change later once you know what you want to do with the new language. Personal recommendation:If you want to build mobile apps go with Java and Android Studio. It’ll do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and it has a drag and drop GUI builder. If you want to go the longer route and get the basics down start with C. Try CS50x (Harvard’s free course), that’ll bringing you through C fairly well (to start) and cover a bit of html and Python, I think it uses flask towards the end but I can’t remember. I like Python alright but I wouldn’t recommend starting there, you don’t need to define types and it’s an interpreted language so you don’t compile to find errors which is a big lesson in learning early on. Also it is a bit different from how key features work (tuples, indentation, for loops). I’d stick with a more traditional one to start. JavaScript unless you want to go full web-dev I wouldn’t go there either (not really a fan). Again like Python it’s interpreted. It will run on any browser but I’ve only done the bare minimum when I’ve had to use it. Most importantly check back in 2 years when I’ll be advising you that JS is the only way to go, after getting out of bed on the other side or something.

Don't spend months on tutorials without building. Instead, use a ""just-in-time"" learning strategy:1. **Build** until you hit a wall or a concept you don't understand (e.g., ""How do I save form data?"").2. **Pause** and do a focused ""deep dive"" on that one concept. Watch a quick video or read the official docs about it (e.g., learn about React's `useState` hook or how to make API calls in Next.js).3. **Apply** what you just learned to your project and continue building.This way, the theory has immediate context and sticks much better.**A Simple Roadmap for Your Gym Tracker:**The ""where to start"" feeling is totally normal. Break it down into smaller, manageable chunks:1. **Static UI First:** Use Next.js to build the visual parts of your app with dummy data. Make a page for logging a workout and a page for viewing past workouts. This gets you familiar with Next.js routing and components without backend complexity.2. **Make it Interactive:** Use React's `useState` hook to manage the form inputs for logging a new workout. Don't worry about saving it yet, just make the form work on the page.3. **Connect to Supabase:** This is a huge step! Set up a simple table in Supabase (e.g., a `workouts` table). Focus on just *reading* data from it and displaying your dummy workouts from the database.4. **Implement the ""Create"":** Now, make your form actually save a new workout to your Supabase table.

niiuk8n,"This is an entire field called GIS. The short of it is that you have two basic types of GeoSpatial data, vector and raster. Vector data is basically a table of attributes, but one of the fields has a geometry. Think Latitude and Longitude for points, and then just an array of those for Lines / Polygons. Raster Data is an image that you drape over your canvas, but it has embeded or an extra file with information saying where and how to place the image, like a tiff world ‘.tfw’ file.Any geospatial data will have a spatial reference for the coordinates, like WGS84 for your typical lat longs in decimal degrees or degree, minutes, seconds. Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.Anyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.Now you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map. You could make static maps (pdfs or images) using desktop software like QGIS or ArcGIS, or you could make the data available through a Map Server or WMS/WFS service and then have a web map the requests the data from those servers. The web server is usually something like QGIS Server or ArcGIS server, and then you consume it using a map library like leaflet, open layers, or ArcGIS JavaScript API. Of course, over the internet, this can be slow depending on the size of the data, so then you start getting into tiling your data. So for rasters, you’ve pre-tiled your data (vector and raster can do this) at different zoom levels, so as a user pans around a map, they’re only calling the specific tiles they need to display on the map instead of asking for the server to constantly clip and send the data they need for their extent.

ni6s1kb,"The first thing to learn, especially for someone with ADHD, isn't actually a programming thing, but rather an organisational problem-solving thing; it's ""divide and conquer"": you need to learn how to split big tasks into small enough sub tasks that they're trivial. You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.Focusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.This is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.The second thing to learn is ""make skeletons"" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.For your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.At any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (""Agile"" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).There are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",GetContented,2025-10-07 03:26:54,4,learnprogramming,t3_1o038m7,False,
ni6p6q9,"I can share some advice from a self-taught dev with 14 years of professional experience, who also looks fondly back at starting out by dabbling in html and css in the 90s on geocities and angelfire.First piece of advice: ""I don't want handouts. I like the struggle (masochist >,>)"" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.Second piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think ""Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break"" I write that down in this list. 2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like ""Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week"".3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.By keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. Also, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project. For that reason, I try to keep a list #1 and #2 for each project I have, and I store them in the project itself, so they're always nearby.Hope that's useful!",allium-dev,2025-10-07 03:08:34,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o038m7,False,

I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.So in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.If your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.A really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the ""top"" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.As an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They ""lose"" money on the free users but gain community.On the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you.

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.Most open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.Quick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",EliSka93,2025-10-08 19:28:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o1jwxj,False,

I got my first internship in game development right after my final year. At that time, my skillset in game dev wasn’t very strong , even though I had been learning it on my own for almost a year and had even taken a course at university.Anyway, once I was surrounded by senior developers during my internship (which later turned into a job), my skills started improving rapidly. I’m a passionate person, and having great seniors around me helped a lot. I took their mentorship seriously, never hesitated to ask questions, and treated projects personally. I often worked after hours on related stuff to improve myself.After just a few months, I cleared interview for another good job, not only better in terms of pay, but also because of the senior developers I got to work with. Being around skilled people and working on the same projects as they do gives you a huge jump. I even managed to handle the responsibilities of a senior with 5 years of experience who had resigned.So in your case, I can see that you’re passionate but you just need the right environment. I realized that about myself too: I’m passionate, and I need a place that helps me grow. Even though I received another higher-paying offer, I didn’t leave, because I want to focus on building my skillset in these early years.When you work with brilliant people, you grow much faster , no tutorial or course can give you that.

I also have terminal ADHD.I firmly believe that almost anyone, including those of us with ADHD, can learn almost anything with the right resources and learning strategies. Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.Random notes in no particular order from what you've said:* You're ""supposed"" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often ""get"" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to ""just keep trying"". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax!

ni37at5,"This sounds like a situation where a bit of profiling and measurement will help with your system design.My guess is that the time taken to scan a file's header and figure out what codecs it uses is a tiny fraction of the time taken to actually re-encode it. And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)And as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.For *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.If the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be ""good"" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data.

If it is a relatively simple CRUD application then it does not need microservices. If it has distinct independent parts that function separately from each other and serve a specific purpose, then you can consider building microservices. You can go first with multimodal monolith and see how it works out. If one of the modules becomes too big and starts having way too many that-module-specific-only functionalities, then you can take that module out from the monolith into a separate microservice.You can have your monolith running from inside a Docker container and be maintained by Kubernetes. You do not need multiple microservices for that. MQs or Kafka are needed when you are having separate microservices/monoliths. Although, by an idea, you can set up these also between your modules within one monolith.gRPC is not always needed. It is much less needed than the other things you mentioned. You are more likely to use REST and then SOAP (with older systems).In terms of what you should learn, then pick all but gRPC. And use MQ only when you need it. You can have your senior project running as a monolith inside a Docker container and be managed by Kubernetes and you'll do fine.There is a good likelihood that you will be using Docker. It is a must to have. Kubernetes is also a good pick because even with older systems these can be migrated over to Kubernetes when the client is willing to put money in it.

But as I said, use it in your project when it makes sense to use it. Do not just drop any and all kinds of technologies into your project. It will be an unnecessary technical bloat.

nhkbp7b,"The `inline` keyword has very little to do with 'inlining' as an optimisation nowadays. (It used to, before C++98)Compilers have very good heuristics of what to inline and where, and functions may or may not be inlined, independently of if they are marked inline or not. Now, `inline` specifies the function linkage. The exact meaning is complicated, but you can think of it as ""multiple definitions are permitted as long as they are in separate translation units"". [See the documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/inline.html)",CptCap,2025-10-03 15:46:03,4,learnprogramming,t3_1nwzef5,False,
nhkqbt2,"The One Definition Rule says there can only be one definition of a function or method. `inline` grants you an ODR exception. C++ also recognizes ""normal"" functions and ""inline"" functions.Beyond that - `inline` doesn't actually mean much. It's SUPPOSED TO hint the compiler that call elision is preferred (don't generate a function call, just instead integrate the inline function body directly into the point of the call), but the compiler absolutely does not have to honor that. Hell, even non-standard compiler extensions like `__forceinline` STILL won't guarantee call elision, simply because it's not always possible.In practice, the compiler internally maintains a list of the two different function types, and when using heuristics to determine if a call should be elided, it will pick either a more conservative or more ambitious value. These values are always adjustable as a compiler parameter, so you could just set both of them the same, so that EVERYTHING is elided just as aggressively as everything else.Yes, this implies that even normal functions ARE candidates for call elision, `inline` doesn't grant that like a special power.I should also point out that a shitload of function types are all implicitly inlined, so an `inline` decorator is strictly redundant. Template functions and methods, for example.So why do you want an ODR exception? Because C and thus C++ do not have whole-program compilation. Every Translation Unit is an island, wholly isolated from all others. If you want the COMPILER to elide a function, then the COMPILER needs the function definition visible IN THAT TU, in order to decide whether to elide it or not, and also just to HAVE the statements that it is eliding there and then at compile time.In order to get the function definition into every TU, you need an ODR exception.And suddenly templates make a hell of a lot of sense, because when you `std::vector`, or whatever, you implicitly instantiate that template in every TU as a concrete type - it's compiled into object code into every object file - how else could you do that without an ODR exception? (Hint: there are ways - advanced programming techniques that also cut down compile times.)---So normal functions are considered for call elision, too, and you can fuck with the heuristics without fucking with the source code.Also - since C++ doesn't have whole-program compilation, that means we don't get TYPICAL Whole Program Optimization. But we DO get A version of WPO, and it's called Link-Time Optimization. It's strictly inferior. What the compiler does is it decides to bundle the compiler flags and source code in the object file. When the linker comes across these bundles, it invokes the compiler. With the linker's perspective, the compiler can decide whether to elide a call or not.So now you don't even NEED an ODR exception to get the benefit of call elision, even across TUs.But I can do you one better: unity builds. Basically, you configure your build system so that ALL your source files are included into ONE source file, thus making a SINGLE TU. This has the effect of putting all the source code in the same scope at once. The compiler can do a much better job at compilation, heuristics, dead code elimination, and reduction than you can get with a link step. The machine code and object code is superior to an incremental build with LTO, and less error prone. Unity builds are preferred for smaller projects ~20k LOC or less, and that number grows with faster hardware, and they're preferred for release builds, since you're always going to build a release from scratch - no cached object files. Incremental builds are ONLY useful for dev cycles on large code bases.So this basically renders `inline` useless. For every reason you would want it, there are always better ways to leverage first. Always configure a unity build - and in 30 years I've never seen a reason not to. Do prefer to fine-tune the compiler from the configuration, not the source code - what is good for one compiler is bad for another. Let the optimizer do its job and don't assume you're smarter. If the optimizer can't figure it out, your code is more likely bad than the optimizer is dumb. Don't be hinting the compiler from the source code. YOU don't know WHAT compiler I'm using, so get outta here with that shit.Oh, and we have profiler driven builds, where performance is measured from a test build and the heuristics is catered per function. At that point `inline` heuristics are irrelevant.So the only thing we can guarantee about `inline`, the only thing we know it's good for, is an ODR exception, and so you have to ask yourself why do you want that? What technical problem are you solving for by turning off safety, that's better than being protected? So far, I've never seen a use case.If you see `inline` in source code, you've got some developers with some dogmatic beliefs, because indeed, there was a time - in the 80s and 90s from which I hail from, that compilers and optimizers were indeed FUCKING TERRIBLE, and YOU WERE smarter than the algorithms. But that's just not the case anymore. Even new developers come up incorporating what they're being told without EVER critically thinking about it or reading about it or looking into it whatsoever.And yet people are attracted to C++ because they ""really care about performance"" but cannot accept that this belief in particular is dated and wrong.

nhoz8ia,"Hello :waving_hand:Programming is more about breaking big problems into smaller ones than it is about memorizing code syntax. Syntax is just the tool we use to bring our solutions to life.So, you want to build a workout routine app? Perfect. What’s the big problem here? It’s something like, “Creating a program that allows you to track your workouts and even generates workouts for you.”But that sounds pretty overwhelming. Where do you even start?That’s where breaking things down comes in!!!!1. Creating the ProgramAlright, now we’re getting somewhere. Fire up your IDE and create a new project folder. Maybe call it WorkoutSmart, or whatever the heck makes you happy.2. Tracking WorkoutsOkay, so how do we track workouts? Are we taking user input? Sure thing! Let’s build a simple flow.User flow example:1. The user types a workout into the input field (for example, “Push-ups”) and clicks Submit.:down_arrow:2. The workout is added to the program, either in the background for now or visually on the user interface.:down_arrow:3. Add buttons for Sets and Reps, each with an increment counter.Nice! Step two is coming together well. Push your progress to GitHub and call it a night. :ZZZ:3. Keeping Workouts on RefreshThe next day, you might notice something. When you refresh the page, all the workouts disappear. :frowning_face:Bingo. That’s your next problem to solve.Now it’s time to make the data persistent.You might start Googling something like “how to keep data after page refresh JavaScript” and build from there.As you gain more experience, things start to click. You’ll begin to recognize patterns and might even plan out an entire project in Notion or on paper before writing any code. The plan will change as you go, but it gives you a solid blueprint to follow.I hope that all made sense.Honestly, I think this approach is a beautiful metaphor for life itself. When things feel overwhelming or anxiety creeps in, break your problems into small, manageable pieces, and calmly tackle each one.Happy coding!",BeKindLovePizza,2025-10-04 09:56:05,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nxnmtj,False,

nhedc2q,"> why do we have to create an object in main to reach classes?A class definition only defines a type. Let's look at an example: class weight: std::tuple { static bool valid(const int &value) { return value >= 0; } static int validate(const int &value) { if(!valid(value)) { throw std::invalid_argument{""value cannot be negative""}; } return value; } friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &os, const weight &w) { return os (w); } friend class weight_extractor; public: weight() = delete; explicit weight(const int &i): std::tuple{validate(i)} {} weight(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight(weight &&) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(weight &&) noexcept = default; auto operator (const weight &) const noexcept = default; weight &operator +=(const weight &w) noexcept { std::get(*this) += std::get(w); return *this; } weight &operator *=(const int &i) { std::get(*this) *= validate(i); return *this; } explicit operator int() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } explicit operator const int &() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight) == sizeof(int)); static_assert(alignof(weight) == alignof(int));This only tells us what a `weight` IS. It gives us the semantics of a `weight`. The definition of a `weight` is not itself an instance of any one particular `weight`. class weight_extractor: std::variant { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &is, weight_extractor &we) { if(is.tie()) { *is.tie() << ""Enter a weight: ""; } if(int v; is >> v) { try { we = weight{v}; } catch(const std::invalid_argument &e) { is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit); if(is.exceptions() | std::ios_base::failbit) { throw; } } } return is; } friend std::istream_iterator; weight_extractor() noexcept = default; public: weight_extractor(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor(weight &&) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(weight &&) = delete; operator weight() const { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight_extractor) == sizeof(weight)); static_assert(alignof(weight_extractor) == alignof(weight));The semantics of a `weight` describes all that it can do - you can add weights, you can multiply scalars, you can insert weights into a stream. But extracting weights directly from a stream is problematic; if extraction fails, you can have an invalid weight. This extractor helper class cannot be instantiated by you directly - only the `std::istream_iterator` has access to the only valid - default, ctor.The `weight_extractor` is an example of ""encapsulation"", aka ""complexity hiding"" - we hide the complexity of extracting and validating a `weight` behind a simple type. ""Data hiding"" is a different idiom not demonstrated here - that the class members are `private` is NOT data hiding. weight operator +(weight l, const weight &r) noexcept { return l += r; } int main() { weight my_fat_ass(190);See? Now we're talking about a specific `weight`, `my_fat_ass`, as opposed to anyone else's... Let's get your fat ass into the picture here, too. if(std::input_iterator iter{std::cin}, end{}; iter != end) { weight your_fat_ass = *iter;You will likely never have to use a raw stream iterator in your life. Instead, the standard library has views, like `std::views::istream`, which itself is implemented in terms of stream iterators. You can `std::views::take` 1 or you can use `std::views::single` to get just one value. auto a_whole_lotta_ass = my_fat_ass + your_fat_ass; std::cout << a_whole_lotta_ass << ""lbs.\n""; } return std::cin && std::cout << std::flush ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE; }In C++, we don't use primitive types directly - they are there so we can describe our own types and their semantics. We make types and behaviors and implement algorithms to create a lexicon that describes our problem domain, and then we describe our solution in terms of that. An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`.So to address your question directly - you need to distinguish between your phone book vs. my phone book vs. any other phone book. If the whole program is to have just one phone book, you'd make it `static`, but often that is a very poor design decision.",mredding,2025-10-02 17:26:05,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nw7t19,False,

nidj889,"This is a fantastic post! You're asking all the right questions and thinking about scaling issues exactly the way a senior engineer would. Your thought process is spot on. Let's break down your ideas and offer some simple, effective patterns.### 1. Handling Click Events (Analytics)Your idea of using Redis as a buffer for bulk updates to Postgres is an excellent and very common pattern. You absolutely do not need Kafka for this. That's like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame.Your proposed solution is the way to go:* **Request Flow:** User hits the short URL.* **FastAPI:** In your redirect endpoint, perform a single, super-fast Redis command. An `INCR` on a key like `clicks:` is a great way to just count, or you could push a small JSON object with metadata into a Redis List (`LPUSH`). This operation takes microseconds.* **Redirect:** Immediately send the 302 redirect response to the user. The user experiences zero delay.* **Background Worker (Celery Beat or similar):** Have a scheduled task that runs every minute (or 5, or 10, depending on your needs). * This task scans for the relevant keys in Redis (e.g., `SCAN 0 MATCH clicks:*`). * It grabs all the data, processes it, and performs a **bulk insert** into your Postgres `clicks` table. * It then deletes the processed keys from Redis.This pattern is great because you get the speed of Redis for the user-facing request and the durability/querying power of Postgres for your analytics, all while keeping your database load low. You've correctly identified the ""fast-ingest, slow-drain"" problem and found the right solution for it.### 2. Handling Sequentially Related Operations (Deactivation)You've dived deep into background tasks, versioning, and reconciliation jobs. These are all valid strategies for complex systems! However, for this specific problem, there's a much simpler and more powerful solution that avoids eventual consistency issues entirely.**Instead of changing the data, change the query.**When a user deactivates their account, you only need to update a single row: `UPDATE users SET status = 'inactive' WHERE id = :user_id`.Then, when your application looks up a short URL, just join the `users` table and check the status:```sqlSELECT urls.long_urlFROM urlsJOIN users ON urls.user_id = users.idWHERE urls.short_code = :short_code AND users.status = 'active';```**Why this is better:*** **Instantaneous:** The moment the user's status is 'inactive', all their links stop working. There's no delay or waiting for a background job.* **Atomic and Simple:** You only perform one simple `UPDATE` for the deactivation. No complex transactions or background tasks needed.* **Solves the ""Flapping"" Problem:** If a user deactivates and then immediately reactivates, the state is always correct. Your query will simply start succeeding again. No race conditions with competing background jobs.* **Massive Write Reduction:** You avoid potentially thousands or millions of URL row updates. This is a huge performance win.This pattern of checking related state at ""read time"" instead of propagating state changes at ""write time"" is incredibly useful and can simplify your architecture immensely.### SummaryYou are on an amazing learning path. Your instincts are leading you to real-world architectural patterns.* **For Clicks:** Stick with your Redis buffer + periodic bulk insert plan. It's the perfect middle-ground.* **For Deactivation:** Use the ""check-on-read"" pattern by joining to the user's table. It's simpler, faster, and more robust.Keep up the great work.

nibxlm3,"I mean it sounds like you already have a query language which is capable of expressing the complex queries you want to do, namely SQL. But for some reason, the external system is rejecting the **valid** SQL queries that you want to do, because of unexplained ""security concerns"".I don't think inventing a new domain-specific query language, instead of just using SQL, is going to address your real problem. The real problem is how to **efficiently** extract only the subset of the data that you need from your underlying database, when you're being forced to go through a layer that is trying to prevent you from doing that. If you did come up with a custom query language, then you would just have to translate it to SQL anyway in order to actually execute it, right? (Since Lucene's query language is nowhere near sophisticated enough to express what you want.)So I think the answer is going to depend on the specific details of the restrictions that the system is imposing on your SQL queries.For instance:> Pick this one if its status is ""open"" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.It's fairly straightforward to express this with a SQL query involving nested joins. When you pass a query containing joins to the DB, the DB can optimize based on the details of what you're querying and the available indexes, so that it doesn't fetch more data than necessary. This is crucial for efficiency.What is the specific limitation you're running into when you try to write such a query? When you say the system rejects ""complex queries"", what is the actual definition of ""complex"" that's being used?For instance: Suppose the system doesn't allow joins at all. Then you would have to implement your own query engine which queries tables individually and then joins them together (e.g. using a hash join). This will almost certainly be much slower than letting the DB perform the join itself. In order to mitigate the performance cost as much as possible, your query engine needs to decide what order to perform the joins in, and it needs to ""push down"" the join criteria to become filters on the individual table queries. (Of course, you will be limited in your ability to do this because you don't have access to all the low-level data that the underlying DB engine does, such as index statistics.)If the actual restrictions you're facing are different from ""no joins allowed"", then you would have to design around those other restrictions instead.But the *implementation* of this join engine doesn't really depend much on how you *express* the queries that you want to perform. So for expressing the queries, you might as well stick with SQL, or at least a limited subset of SQL.",teraflop,2025-10-07 23:08:36,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o0syuu,False,

This has happened multiple times, good feedback, good relationships, good work ethic and productivity, it’s just market shifts and the company trying to be strategic. I had to get clear about what I wanted… and that’s stability. I started looking for opportunities in stable, but growing sectors, i stopped taking interviews with small companies or companies known for their leanness or competitive firing practices. I reached out to people at the company to know what type of culture I was signing up for. During the interviews, when they asked me what I was looking for, I told them… a stable place to grow in my skill and to develop a long-term relationship with a company. This may sound sexist, but I looked for companies that had a lot of women and parents on their team and good paternity leave… to me, this is a signal that the company cares about investing in people rather than the bottom line. If they’re willing to hire women (who may be out an extended period after/around pregnancy) or parents (who have stricter schedules and can’t do the 9-9 grind), they believe in investing in people rather than the short term setback of human life being inconvenient. I looked for companies that didn’t do boom/bust hiring waves. How long have jobs been posted? How many jobs are posted? How frequently do they post? Does this company have a history of downsizing?

The reason is bc a company can just decide to pivot or cut a digital product too easily. Therefore I was looking at companies that have a physical product. The other thing to look for is companies that operate in highly regulated industries especially where what you will be doing will help them meet regulations, esp new ones. Businesses that get their revenue from making sure their customers can meet regulations always have work if those regulations change frequently. It's hard bc these types of jobs will not pay as much as tech jobs. They'll be overly boring and frustrating. But think of lost income from being in between jobs.

ni2y3zn,"There’s so much wrong with your theory, man. First of all, you’re treating H1Bs as a monolith, when in reality, there’s two “tiers.”The bottom tier H1Bs don’t work directly for big tech. They work for WITCH companies, insurance companies, oil companies, etc. They are modern-day indentured servants. In this case, if their employer can’t easily replace them by sponsoring someone else, it would stand to reason their wages would rise, not fall. They already couldn’t get sponsored by other companies. Not how it works for this caste. On the other hand, there are H1B recipients who already worked for Big Tech directly overseas. They get sponsored. They insource their job with them. They were never begging for table scraps. They’ll just self deport and outsource their job with them if they get a $100k paycut. Moreover, people like that create other jobs. We’re outsourcing an entire team’s worth of jobs with them. You’re also ignoring the consensus amongst economists as to why SF became the tech capital of the world. Why it outcompeted the hub around MIT in MA. Because non compete agreements are illegal in CA. You presume competition is a bad thing. Maybe it is for entrenched, enshittifying monopolies in isolation. But even those monopolies had been paying a premium to bring the world’s top talent to the place where they weren’t a big fish in a small pond. If they wanted to entrap their higher tier H1Bs, they would’ve done what all the employers of lower tier H1Bs did: moved them out to some godforsaken shithole in TX or NC, refused to sponsor applications for green cards, paid them below market rate, etc. At some level, even the monopolies realize competition is good.We issue under 100k H1Bs per year. That’s it. And they don’t all go to IT/CS jobs either. India and China have nearly 3 billion people between the two of them. Do the math… We’re only getting the top 0.01% of them, for the most part. There are some serial abusers. The WITCH companies in particular ought to be permanently barred from H1B. But really, the problem with H1B is how abusive it is to the recipients. We should be more like Canada and just give them green cards when they arrive. Unironically. Why do we make it so fucking hard for talented people to come here and pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in taxes, while some barely literate economic migrant from Venezuela just says the magic word “asylum” and they can come stay for years in a free hotel, no questions asked?

A couple thoughts that may help from what I’ve seen:Need to look at companies that are solving macro problems such as smart mobility, health insurance, public utilities or even large consulting that operate at a large city/state/country scale. The tasks that you excel at are typically handled by “data scientists” in the research or engineering subteams of the broader product team. Most of the time it’s run through a platform like snowflake with some basic trendy algos applied and then call it a day, with little interpretation or understanding of the results.As strange as this sounds you may want to hunt for UX Researcher roles. If you dig into the requirements a lot of what they are asking for there is a lot of overlap and it at least is adjacent to your skill set. One of the hardest things, as this thread has shown, will be articulating your value. Most hiring managers for these roles will have come up through a more vanilla CS background so having a paragraph ready about what the current state of the industry is, why it’s leading teams and products astray and how your deeper understanding makes a difference will be critical. You are a PhD level data scientist who looks at the world through a sociology lens and that brings inherent value.Lastly, the job market actually is pure ass right now. It’s all of us and not just you. If you have any folks from your cohort that went private sector they probably have some good advice on how to modify message for what folks are looking for now.

The way to crush this interview is to fully understand the ins and outs of a sufficiently complex codebase, or at least, section of codebase, AND the languages, frameworks and tools they'd use. Practicing for my interview would be exactly like practicing for the job. And our conversation is basically the same as I would have with a coworker who wrote XYZ in our codebase, except, ya know, I'd be less interested and ask fewer questions, but it's really really close. I've personally watched people who aced our technical problem _because they had seen it before_ get hired and be mediocre.

I've had this happen where they throw a 'gotcha' and all of a sudden you're in a different vertical than what you thought they were going to test you on. Big fat waste of time for everyone involved because you can't code something you're unprepared for within less than an hour window, even though you could do it within 3 hours and a bunch of Googling. If you're going to build a Wordle game, tell them before. If they're going to fetch data, manipulate data, filter data, and display a list, tell them beforehand. These are two very different things and you could be super sharp at one and not the other.\- Live technical test with AI. The key here is to check whether or not they are blindly accepting prompts from AI. Take the time to ask questions around what the code they just accepted is doing and why they think that is a good solution.\- Timed test (take home/alone). Give them a quite complicated technical test and 3-4 hours to complete it with a submission deadline. They will have to use AI to solve it in that time. Then you follow up in another meeting to discuss the solution and why they did what they did.\- Take home test. Make it complicated as above. They will use AI but how do they handle state management? How do they fetch data? How do they handle errors? Is it scalable? Etc. You can ask for more if you're permitting AI.You can effectively assess someone's ability even when they use AI. All you need to do is ask a bunch of questions around the solution to see if they know what they're doing.

nhkkm6i,"Sometimes extreme stress. Sometimes it's because father passed away and they need to take care of their mother who is alone in China, etc.Anyways I replied in one of the comments but just so that it's more easily accessible for other high school/college students to see: why do you think people jump off the bridge and all?Some jobs literally kill you. Mental stress is no laughing matter. Just because you never experienced it does not mean it is not real.At the most stressful time, I literally woke up at night and could not even feel my legs let alone move them for a few minutes. And that happened twice. Shits scary as f. Suddenly the world view changes and you care nothing else at all when your legs might stop functioning. Your body actually breaks down from stress itself. You tell me if money is worth losing your legs.People vastly underestimate how scary extreme mental stress is. I know in one of the startup talks one of the founders stated that he had a period of time in which suddenly his eyes stopped working and he had trouble seeing with his left eye from all the stress. And that's when he stopped everything because anymore stress and he would lose his left eye functionality.So yes. People leave stressful jobs all the time. Stressful jobs can legitimately destroy your body. Just because stress is mental does not make it any different. Human body will legit break down after a longer period of extreme stress.When you are a college student and never actually worked these stressful jobs all you see is numbers. You have this delusional belief it's high pay or basically homeless (wtf?). That's not how reality works.You only live your life once. Don't waste your life chasing solely money. Money is important to function in life but once you are in comfortable means of being able to provide yourself, food/healthcare/shelter/etc, then other things take priority. It's great if your job pays a lot and you enjoy it and all but that's not the case for everyone. For others, the high paying jobs are legitimately destroying their happiness. And ask yourself is this the life journey you want to take? Something you would be proud of doing looking back a decade from now?",Fwellimort,2025-10-03 16:29:08,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1nx13mr,False,

The other consideration is that it will probably be easier later on to go from academia to industry if you change your mind, than vice versa, especially if you’re going to a non-research industry role.Context in case it’s helpful or you want to ask questions: I left my phd program a few years in without completing it, for an industry job. I’ve had a good career so far, and it’s been fun and interesting and I’ve learned a lot (mostly interpersonal stuff and management skills), but in retrospect if I’d had a real option to continue the phd and go into academia, I would have.

My burn-out wasn't from research per se, but from the feeling of doing research alone. Working in an industry AI lab has completely changed my relationship with research. I am in a significantly more collaborative environment. The flavor of research is quite different though, but turns out I find math-circlejerk research (theory-heavy) and simple-at-scale research (experiment-heavy) equally fulfilling. There's a certain joy to pulling out a seemingly random idea in literature that, with the right clever modifications, ends up working well in practice at O(10k) GPU scale.\- The main downside to industry, imo, is politics/drama. The AI industry is rife with them at the moment. You'll also sometimes look at what your company is releasing product-wise and question whether you're on the right side of history.\- You definitely lose out on the mentoring/teaching aspect in industry. You will meet the occasional brilliant researcher fresh out of undergrad/masters that you can take under your wing.

nhrshfk,"Not a CS PhD, but I did elect to leave academia for an industry SWE position after a year as a postdoc, much to my old advisor's disappointment. Like you, I was burned out and had gotten tired of the publish-or-perish race, even though I'd been told that if I were to stick it out a while longer, I'd have a really great shot at a TT position. There were some other factors for me that you likely do not have to deal with, but I don't regret pivoting to industry. To directly address some of your concerns:* On flexibility: * Yes, most industry jobs will afford you much less flexibility in how you schedule your daily life. However, industry also pays you a fuck ton more money so that you can actually enjoy your time off. I don't know about your finances, but when I was in academia, I basically didn't take regular vacations; my ""vacations"" were always tacked onto conferences and involved me blowing off one day of talks and/or staying a day longer before flying back. * It is also much easier to change jobs in industry, which affords its own flexibility; I know people keep moaning about the industry job market, but it's still way easier to jump jobs than to jump institutions if you happen to hate where you're forced to live. TT positions are not a dime a dozen, and you may need to take what you can get; if you don't like the location, then you're likely gonna be shit out of luck for at least a few years. (This is assuming you don't have to do the postdoc hazing ritual that involves moving every 1-3 years.) * WLB in industry is much better than in academia, and at the end of the work day, you can disengage from the work. Even if you're on-call, you don't really need to waste brainpower on it. In some ways, I feel that while I have lost some flexibility during the weekdays, my time off is much more my own. Being able to spend time guilt-free on my hobbies has improved both my physical mental well-being tremendously, which itself feels like freedom; I honestly didn't even really know how unhappy I was in academia until I left. * At $400k-500k, a high savings rate, a smart investment strategy, you will have the option to retire in less than a decade, which would afford you the maximum flexibility.* On being able to work on what you're interested in: * I won't lie. Some of the work can be **very dull**. However, as you get promoted, you'll hopefully find yourself in a position where you'll be addressing larger business questions and architecting solutions, which I have found to be relatively engaging. I mean, I don't really *care* about the subject deep-down, but I also can't say it's boring. * With a CS PhD and a specialty in a hot field, you can keep applying to jobs and try to pivot to a research-focused industry position, which may be more up your alley.* On teaching and mentoring: * Not gonna lie. I really miss teaching. Mentoring new hires doesn't scratch the same itch. With your degree, you do have the option to pick up an adjuncting gig, and I've considered it, but I'd feel bad about taking a job away from some poor sucker who actually needs it. I've thought about going back into teaching once I have enough FU money. But another option might be teaching or tutoring folks for free at local libraries if you've a mind to do it and don't mind teaching basics.I have many friends and a sibling who have remained in academia in TT or postdoctoral positions. I chat with them regularly. Academia does have its pros, but having spoken with them, I don't think I would've been happy even at a TT position.

nigjhix,"I didn't have any mentors ""career-wise"", nor is that something I would expect of one of my co-workers. What I do with my career is really on me, and is based on my personal goals and priorities. It'd be odd if my tech lead sat me down and explained what he wants me to do after I quit the company we're at.But technical-wise, I had a great tech lead at my new grad company. His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.Maybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.That's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.That creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often. If you're giving significant mentorship, then a good manager/PM will make sure you have a reduced sprint load, or even give you dedicated consulting tickets with points on them.I'm really thankful for my new grad tech lead, because I was able to take those very healthy practices, and carry them with me throughout my career. I cultivate that kind of a healthy culture wherever I go now.That being said, after I left that new grad job with about 3.5 YOE, I didn't really receive mentorship anymore.

They’ve added a metric called “biz justification” wherein the manager has to justify why your promotion is justified from a business/operational perspective in your org. They use this easily defer/reject your promotion for YEARS.2. The environment at Salesforce isn’t “chill” anymore, in general. Some teams are still chill, but the company pivoted to a high performance culture last year. PIPs are on the rise. Many engineers are working 10+ hours.3. RSU refreshers have mostly stopped, except for very high performers and PMTS+. The engineering management takes all the RSUs, leaving very little for ICs.4. There’re re orgs every few months. An acquaintance of mine was hired into one team, went through a re-org a month after joining and was put in a completely different time with a completely different tech stack. He’s miserable.5. RTO is 10 days/ quarter for US engineers and 36 days/quarter for India engineers. The Indian tech leadership is fighting to make it uniform for everyone, so who knows what’ll change. Also, it’s possible they start tracking how long you spend in office using WiFi info. The office space is extremely small compared to the number of people coming in. You'll be sitting elbow to elbow, with every person beside you in meetings, distracting you.6. The company is trying to brand itself as the biggest AI enterprise company, but internally, it’s a known embarrassment. They simply take one product, rename it and repackage it. They’ve done this thrice to the same product now. The AI models developed in house are a joke. The good ones are simply wrappers that call OpenAI’s APIs. They’re good, but the company doesn’t disclose it (it doesn’t need to), but it parades itself as some great AI visionary. It isn’t.7. Another pain point is there're too many manager levels - Manager, Senior Manager, Director, Senior Director and VP. The first 4 just talk all day with almost zero understanding of the actual tech and contribute to red tape between teams. The politics is crazy.8. Product management leadership is another problem. The actual PMs are pretty intelligent, who went to innovate and get stuff done. The VP+ in PM are extremely laid back and lack vision. As a result, you'll see our competitors bang out features. A year later, Salesforce PM leadership lists all those features, takes the top 2 or 3, asks engineers to implement it and then pat themselves on back as being innovators in the CRM space. They aren't.9. If you're on the main engineering tech stack (called 'Core'), you'll have a horrible time. It is a huge monolith. Skills won't be transferrable.10.

Kids, a partner, other life responsibilities ***do not*** mean you suddenly can no longer travel and your entire life is put on hold.A couple whose wedding I went to not long ago just had this first child. Wanna know what they did pretty recently? Took a 2 week vacation to Europe. They brought the kid, but *also* arranged for people to take care of their kid so they could galavant around and do ""kidless people things"". And I know people that have children that just leave them in the States and either get a parent to watch them or hire a babysitter.I will never understand the people that just put their entire lives on hold as soon as they have a kid. If that's what having a kid is like, I never fucking want kids. But luckily I have plenty of examples of people I know that have still lived their lives to its fullest even with kids. Hell, that couple I mentioned beforehand? *They travelled more than me that year*. I'm single, with no kids. And yet somehow, with a newly born child, they travelled more than me. They're living life right.I know I didn't answer your question at all, and I introduced even more questions... so apologies for that, but I think your perspective is creating a lot of issues in your mind that don't need to exist. This isn't a ""now or never"" situation. Your career shouldn't be an ultimatum of ""I can only take extended breaks when I'm unemployed"".

ni39dcx,I can give you rough numbers for the legacy big tech company I work for.In the last couple of years when we post a new college grad position these are the numbers I've been seeing:* **Applicants in the first ~24 hours**: 2K - 3K (at which point we close the application* **Automated Filtering**: We automatically filter those down to 100 applicants (by excluding anyone who isn't a US citizen and then filtering based on keywords/degree* **Phone Screens**: 20. Managers will manually review the 100 applicants down to 20 they are interesting in doing phone screens with. The phone screens are ~15 minute conversations where the manager asks some very basic questions.* **Interview Stage**: 4 - 6. Managers will conduct phone screens with the 20 applicants and from that pick around 5 +/- a one or two that they want to interview* **Interview Rounds**: In my group we usually do two rounds of interviews. First one is typically remote unless the applicant lives nearby but the second one is always mandatory in person. Each round is pretty similar but with different groups of engineers. The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.So if we use 2K as the total number of applicants. Then ~5% of resumes are actually looked at by a person. ~1% make it to phone screens. ~0.25% make it to interview stage.

For that reason they are familiar with banking background and more likely to also employ people from the banking space.Also as someone whose been in quant model development at large banks, its very common to exit from mid-tier banks into Big Tech. You just need to brand yourself more in the tech lingo and bank acts. Certain banks wear the tech company cosplay like capital one and its relatively easy to move from those places. I've seen people of all levels move from banking to tech from model validation or quantitative model development, usually in some kind of data science role.I also think some of this is how you sell your self.

But 1 engineer with AI can complete 6 tasks a month. Some companies may just fire half but i think most companies will keep the 10 like the fact that they can get more tasks done, meet deadlines easier, etc. Now that creates better bonuses and profit for everybody and the following year there may be enough money to hire more people.Now if you are struggling in your classes and are stressed out, id recommend going into EE or even CE.

At this point, the company has managed to convince a venture capitalist to part with a small amount of money. Don't take this as a sign of confidence though - to you and me it's the equivalent of lending a friend $5 to play the slots and promise us 20% of whatever they win.If they *are* successful (again - super rare) it can be an awesome pay day for you... but that pay day also can take a *long long* time. I joined one startup back in 2015 that *still* hasn't had an exit event - the $880 worth of stock I got back then is now worth about $110k (back of the envelope) but I can't (reasonably) actually do anything with it because it's still private equity.I joined another startup \~2 years ago though, which had a more typical liquidation exit - I got a fat offer from the next company that hired me and more career advancement in the year of working there than in the 5 preceding years in FAANG combined, but my $160k of equity earned me a total of $0 because there wasn't anything left over after the debts and preferred stock was paid out. Even *that* was a pretty lucky case - I was working for *way* less than I was worth and really stretching myself to do so, if my next (current) employer hadn't taken notice of me I would have just found myself sitting around putting my heart and soul into something with nothing to show for it.**Startups are FANTASTIC for learning a lot of things ""in the trenches"" though**. **This is NOT appropriate for everybody.** If you're really ambitious and love being part of the rat race (especially early career where this is especially helpful!) it can be an awesome thing. It means late days, doing things *way* outside your comfort zone, learning skills that you should never have to deal with as an engineer... but that also means getting a broad skill set and great experience in a short time.In my experience, judge the founders *very critically*. I like to ask founders hard questions to see how they react. It takes experience in business and industry to get a feel for what's good / not good, what you like / don't, I can't really give great advice here - but if you're interested in young companies and startups, the best way to get that experience is the hard way!If you're happy with the base pay and want to hustle for a bit, it could be a good opportunity.

nhng5op,"The portal application black hole is real for these traditional companies because they're often using ancient ATS systems that filter out anyone without exact keyword matches.Your best bet is bypassing those portals entirely and going direct. For banks and insurance companies, look up their local branches or regional offices and find the IT managers on LinkedIn - they're usually more responsive than corporate recruiters. Credit unions are actually goldmines for this stuff, way less bureaucratic than big banks and they're always looking for people who can modernize their systems. Manufacturing companies are another sleeper hit, especially if you can stomach learning some legacy systems - places like John Deere, Caterpillar, even local manufacturing firms need people who can bridge the gap between old school operations and modern tech. The key is positioning yourself as someone who can work with existing infrastructure rather than someone who wants to tear it all down and rebuild it. Also don't sleep on government contractors - they move slow but once you're in the ecosystem it's pretty stable. For getting past the portals, try reaching out to people with titles like ""IT Manager"" or ""Systems Administrator"" at these companies, they're usually buried in work and would love to have someone competent join their team.
