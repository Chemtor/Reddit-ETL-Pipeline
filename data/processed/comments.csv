However, the issues you’re citing don’t have much to do with Pandas itself. It seems to be either an issue of your understanding or you’re using it in the wrong place. Others have mentioned this but why are you using Pandas to sanitize dict data? There are other tools (like Pydantic mentioned upthread) that help you to sanitize input before it’s converted into a tabular format like a data frame. There are also tools that do the reverse (letting you query, cleanse and normalize JSON input). I’m not even sure why you’d use Pandas to output JSON data. Why can’t you cleanse your dict using other tools and then use the Python json library to output the JSON?

DuckDB is far more advanced than just an implementation - handling data types, optimize query plan, and it needs to consider other things like scalability and generalization for other cases.

And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.If the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.Super cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",StefanBelgica,2025-09-14 09:18:00,1,dataengineering,t3_1nfxgze,False,

A very simple, yet very error-prone, stack could be: direct DB writes + Postgres + pg\_cron/cron + dashboard.>What could you scale to with a far simpler stack?That simple stack can handle tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of events per minute. The real problem is not just the raw throughput, but the architectural fragility.

The problem is that they always have worse working conditions and pay. I don't think a masters is going to help you get a better IT job as opposed to more years of experience, at your level of experience diplomas don't matter that much for recruiters I think. If you do it, do it for your own desire to learn without expecting too much from the career perspective, and try to do it while keeping a job, maybe some company will support it.

So not so much of a circle, but building on top, it kept the data catalog and added a snapshot catalog.

In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. Airflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",rtalpade,2025-09-10 16:59:32,10,dataengineering,t1_ndh4vmk,False,

Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won’t line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it’s a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn’t create too many tasks. I’ve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute.

Performance of those views might suffer with a lot of scalar UDFs?I'm not sure how you're calculating your final combined DQ score: I'd be wary of that as it's easy to end up with something a bit meaningless.I use a different approach where each individual _relevant_ data quality concern gets its own view (one ""rule""). So a validation of website format would be one view, returning 0 rows if everything is correct. Each problem is one row, then. I would probably use SQL UDFs if I needed to abstract one piece of logic for multiple views, but that doesn't happen really with our data. The views all follow a consistent approach with common column names etc, then I have a process that collects and merges records from all views. Because each view is doing just one thing, it's very performant. But the view quantity does rack up. The overall data quality measure is just count of problem rows collected that day, and count of rules with at least one problem.There's also metadata in a special magic comment in each view (written using JSON syntax), describing why the rule is important to the business, who is responsible for keeping it empty, and how to go about clearing it. For me, that stuff is essential to maintain somewhere, because it ensures the results are actionable. This metadata is snapshotted daily to a SCD table, so business users can explore the full ""rulebook"" for data quality independently from current extant problems.

Way too many people in a similar position to yourself spend so much time trying to min-max, find the ""best"" or ""most efficient"" approach that they have already wasted a week just thinking about it. That week becomes a month.Most efficient method is to start with something and build from there.> Honestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insightsBy all means, take an introductory course into DE. I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful. That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.A lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say ""I started with a course and 6 months later I got my first DE job"". Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job. For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.The process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy. It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a £20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure. It's not to say that you can't do it. In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can. Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead. >Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?I will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head. Just go for mid. The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago. The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market. Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated. One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.Forget junior level positions. Aim for mid level positions. Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced. Be good at communicating.

With more detailed information, such as camera feed.* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.These are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.You can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.You can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.As for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.I'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. You may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.As for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.So, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. For flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. This is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?Here's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.I do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.Anyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.If you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\_id=1059.Anyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",zemega,2025-09-16 05:23:49,7,learnprogramming,t3_1nhtsu3,False,
neh7p3v,"I’ve done my Masters thesis on low-cost flood and water level detection at uni, and there are ways to implement this with relative ease, even if you have no support or collaboration with local government. One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs. If you want, you can also place some reference point on the bank and measure its visible portion’s length on every image.If you’d like to chat about the data collection and processing aspect of things, drop me a DM.",ilsandore,2025-09-16 05:40:39,5,learnprogramming,t3_1nhtsu3,False,

I didn’t even know what a terminal was, and I thought typing commands was the same as coding.You’re *supposed* to feel overwhelmed, that’s the point. The piscine is a selection month. The school is checking if you’re a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.The main things they look at are:* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They’re measuring growth, not starting ability.* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.It’s also important to remember that the piscine isn’t just the school testing you, it’s also **you testing their system**. The curriculum projects later on will feel very similar: vague, ambiguous, and challenging by design.One last tip: **don’t measure yourself against your peers.** Some people will have math degrees, CS backgrounds, or years of coding experience. That doesn’t mean you’re behind. You’re on your own track.And yes, you’ll encounter some snarky people, both in school and in these threads, who lack awareness of how different everyone’s starting point is.

It will help you alot and it will also give you better ctrl R results for these pesky specific cmds that you might need in a hurry later onAsk people around you general questions but always try to decompose your context, ask questions about the problem itself and its sub problems, as for the solution make sure to always ask for the approach more than the raw solution itself, what did they google ? What was their initial self asked questions? What resources or algorithms were used to find an answer ? Once you have some clues STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND START DOING RESEARCH YOURSELF !!!!! Its very important that you have a good grasp on the “context” of each subject, you should always consider a tech theme like some sort of information space, you might know some parts to some degree, however the biggest issue will be the things you aren’t aware that youre supposed to know, afterall it can always be an infinite amount of information thats missing in order for you to get the bigger picture, THATS WHY WE READ THE MANUAL/DOCS, it allows us to estimate what the information space is made up of, thus giving you a much clearer picture of what you already know, how much you need to know, but most importantly everything that you dont know yet.Last couple advices, STOP PANICKING! Start small, what is vim ? How do i save ? How do i edit ? How do i exit ? Is there any meaning behind the letters used each time ? What are the useful shortscuts, can you focus on that efficiently without having your brain stress you about the next thing you’re supposed to do or are you going to just do everything but master nothing ?How comfortable are you getting with your current “ignorance” ? Can you detail the things you need to improve on and read/code more about so that you can tackle the theme of the subject? And make sure to REST ! Do not try to race with everyone like i did, ull just end up collapsing on the 4th week and thats very dangerous because exams are the entry criteria and your last exam is the most important oneMake sure to understand that you need to pass the exam with just vim and a terminal, so all these people who are flexing their speed might suddenly get doomed since they would basically be coding in the dark, while if you keep struggling and working on a serious coding approach, you are actually more likely to get even better results on your exams, do not fall for the peer pressure, your peers are only there as a source of knowledge for you to absorb And have fun dude, the piscine is actually fun, the real hell starts when you have to recode your own C and C++ libraries so you can make bigger programs later on, these are the actual manifestations of hell, even chatgpt cant help much with the maths heavy subjects later on, the whole point of 42 is that coding is about approach more than anything else",zeus_is_op,2025-09-11 20:17:40,3,learnprogramming,t3_1nef7i8,False,

If things change down the road, worry about it then.As far as advice:1. If you want to do **web design**, you'll want to start with the basics: **HTML and CSS**. Then get into **JavaScript**. Later on you might be interested in something like **TypeScript** or **React**.2. Alternatively, if you are doing a Masters degree in **data analytics**, I would encourage you to take a good look at **Python**, specifically **Pandas**. Other languages can work well too, but I know that Python is a common choice for data science type stuff; most programming languages *can* do what others do, but some are *designed* for certain tasks in mind.

ndft1u4,"Professional programmer with 20y of experience here. So it really depends where you live and do you want to become a corporate dog or you're more of a loose cannon.Thing is in North America the most popular set of technologies are few things, in Europe are other things. No idea what they use in Asia and South America.Either case, first of all it's great to know more than one operating system. Knowing iOS or Windows is fine, but learning linux is a must. And you must be able to install your OS from scratch and do basic maintenance.Second - learn git. In the modern world nothing goes without git. The entire planet nowadays can't live without git. In rare cases they use other things, like TFS (Microsoft), but git is a must.Third - you said you know SQL - this is great. SQL is a must too. Choose a relational database and learn it. I would say choose MySQL (or MariaDB) or Postgres. You must be able to do basic queries, you must know in theory what are the normalization forms and you must be able to design a simple database.Next - you must know HTML, basic CSS and basic javascript. Which means to design some html form, being able to validate it with javascript before form submit.And here we come to a very sensitive point - you must know how to properly write a Word document and basic knowledge of Excel. Because if your'e a master programmer but your resume or CV looks like crap - it speaks bad of you.Finally - programming. It really really depends. There are several ways you could go.FRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).DATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.BACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).BACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.BACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.Coding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).Side project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.So geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.Last word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder.

Which at the time I had no idea what I was doing. Completely messed this handrail all up. Then my boss came back and said ""HA...You messed that up.....fix it...."" ao I did. And I did...and I didn't until I finally started figuring out what needed to happen. 4 years later I had my own welding business and was contracting out my old boss because I was too busy and needed an extra hand on jobs.This isnt welding but same concept applies. I'm still very green so definitely not a ""senior dev"" response. But learning without a conventional school before, I'll say this. You can only learn so much in a sandbox (meaning guided help and projects, not your own). You won't have motivation brcause they arent your own problems or things your solving. Now, if you code your own app and run into a problem, when YOU fix the problem YOU will remember how you did. And if you dont, you'll remember enough about it to know where to look. You will force yourself to start approaching things differently. You'll feel more accomplished, you'll learn more in the sense of ""real world skills"" vs book skills. Something I noticed learning to code and currently being self taught is you will run into a roadblock everyday. Some of them are big, some are small. I'm currently in one regarding github and git that I messed up so bad I cant even code right now until it gets sorted out (thank God for reddit help and kond people). Download vscode, get on here, ask questions, check youtubes, start doing it! Make a portfolio about your skills and experiences for future employers, make one solely for shortcuts with code (things you use a lot of need to have on hand but cant remember). Start building that base now so later when you're deeper and have a dev job you can look back and not only see how far you've come but also you have a huge set of cheats to look up. Better yet, create an app for said cheat sheet that categorizes your cheat codes! There are 3 projects right there that solve 3 problems for you that you can show employers. Biggest thing is focusing on what's important. Is learning react important? Yes. But dont force yourself to not ask for help on that. The more you work it the better and easier it'll get. Code? Force yourself to not throw in the towel when your stuck, thats important. Work it for 20 min or even more before you say ""alright, I'm gassed"". Make it a point to code every day and have atleast 1 meaningful push to github so your activity level stays up on there and dont miss a day. Focus on 1-2 languages and dont switch from them until you are comfortable enough to tell an employer ""I dont know all the answers but I know where to look and I can articulate what I need to happen."" In essence, I know I want my background to be red, purple and black and I want it to fade into eachother in a circular pattern. I may not remember it's specifically conicle-gradient (or whatever it is). But I know its a gradient and I know to look up gradients for colors and backgrounds.This is longer than I thought it would be. But keep going! Get react, vscode, node.js, get a github, and start coding. Its daunting at first but once you start it'll flow. Oh, and when you do get a win, whether it's fixing a problem, finishing a project etc. Dont stay there long. Accept the win, give yourself 5 minutes to freak out and jump around, but get back to the next win asap.

ndxv2to,Misconception: When doing I/O the CPU wastes instructions waiting for slower devices to perform requested read/writesTruth:In modern computers every I/O is asynchronous at the low level. The CPU just sends the signal to the chipset which handles the actual I/O data transfer. The data read/written are handled in RAM. When the operation is done then the CPU is notified by an interrupt.This was truly enlightening to learn and helped me understand asynchronous programming in C#. If you do an I/O operation synchronously then you're just blocking the thread and at most waste the CPU with instructions that wait for the interrupt (this is handled by the OS).But if you use await/async with Tasks then you're really sending a fire and forget signal. Once the I/O operation is done the interrupt is handled and continuation of your code might run in a different thread (based on the task scheduler).,0x0000000ff,2025-09-13 04:17:57,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nf3tju,False,

ne7wmu9,"Rust is C++ done right, and it actually teaches you proper safety by simply refusing to compile your code if the compiler cannot verify its soundness, unless you explicitly opt-out of safety with unsafe blocks, but application / binary crates should never need to do this. Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion. Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic.

You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==""1"" : list.append(input(""What do you want to add?"")) elif input()==""2""...')- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself - level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.For bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called ""designer"" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.The more you do, the more you learn.

This means minimal commenting, and certainly, not to the level of a beginner.Imagine you want to learn how to cook like a professional chef, but you're a total beginner. A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.Similarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.This is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know? At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop works, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.They have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.To be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.In effect you're saying> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.Most experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained.

They don't necessarily have to be efficient, they just have to give an answer that I am confident of, or that i can check some other way. When I first started doing this kind of thing I had scripts that would run for hours simulating a problem to give me a probability of something. (If i roll two dice 100 times, how many times will I get a 5 and a sum less than 9, or something silly like that). Over time I just got better at banging out boiler plate code, and I found ways to make (for example) loops quicker and more efficient. It isn't useful, it is entertainment. If you can find something similar, I'd recommend trying this approach. It doesn't need to be useful or for the greater good. Can you script something that is interesting to you?

As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in "".c"", such as hello.c, then compile it ...And then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).""Create the program text somewhere"" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. ""Compile it"" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. ""Load it and run it"" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a ""press any key to continue . . ."" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.Nowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.If you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal ""hello, world"" boilerplate for you when you create a new project.

For example, there is a game called ""Hangman"". Someone gives you a word. All you know is how many characters it has. Let's say the word is `pineapple`. You would only see ""---------"". that is, 9 dashes.The goal is for someone to guess letters until the entire word is solved. A person is allowed to make 6 incorrect guesses before they lose. They aren't allowed to repeat a letter they've already used before. If they guess a letter correctly, you reveal its position. For example, suppose they guess `e`. Then, you show ---e----eThis reveals the ""e"" at the end of ""pine"" and at the end of ""apple"". The other characters are hidden until the guesser guesses it correctly.That's a program you might be able to code up with some basic knowledge of programming.Currently, you are likely copying some existing code and getting it to work.

Learning one lanuage and transitioning to another is all about language specific rules, syntax, methods etc but the mental model remains the same. Its something i realised not too long ago (only started learning to code in jan so still fresh), early on i was trying to remember everything and then relised i need to remember less and understand more. Unfortunately the concept of thinking like a programmer and real problem solving skills doesnt get effectively communicated in courses. I think the issue of learning syntax 'too early' stems from general impatience and not understanding what programming entails. People want to see themseleves code, probably dont want to spend the first few lessons building those mental models even though it is a crucial aspect.As i was reading the article, i realised this is equally applicable in learning a new codebase or framework. Read through and focus on the logic, the data flow, the why behind the what.

If you're delivering an enterprise level event driven hybrid on-prem/cloud architecture in which your applications are composed of containerized microservices with k8 orchestrated auto scaling then you're probably not going to have any one guy on the team who both understands the full topology of your infrastructure and the nitty gritty of the code itself across all the different applications.

ndokgkw,"You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.For instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.The reason `wait()` interacts with the same ""monitor"" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like: while (internalQueue.size() == 0) { wait(); }If you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.On the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.The solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the ""waiting"" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.----If you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of: while (true) { synchronized (obj) { if (internalQueue.size() > 0) { // do stuff return; } } Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue }But no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",teraflop,2025-09-11 18:44:56,14,learnprogramming,t3_1negha9,False,

Though i recommend padding out your resume whether via internships or simple certifications cause entry level can be rough to get into. 2) Not really, AI is here and it'll affect things but even if AI is used for coding it'll require actual programmers to fix its problems and implement things. It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. 4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good.

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.It is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.I'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.My advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language.

I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better. I can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. I feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience. If you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.Regarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet.

The fact that an event happened at 8am for one user but was simultaneous with an event that happened at 9pm the previous day for a different user is NOT important to your app.There's no single best answer. For your case, I think storing the local date in one column, local start time in another column, local end time in a third column, and timezone offset in a fourth might be one easy solution.That would make finding all events on a particular day trivial.

ne6foc9,"The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a ""senior developer"" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.If it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.So it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.Understand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.There are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.The important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app ""feels slow"", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request ""fans out"" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.Test automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?Understand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?Impossible to answer in the abstract. A system is ""overengineered"" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?There are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [""The Grug Brained Developer""](https://grugbrain.dev/):""grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too""""seem very confusing to grug""",teraflop,2025-09-14 15:12:58,4,learnprogramming,t3_1ngt349,False,

The questions you may want to ask yourself are what is the market potential of the application and what are the goals of the founders and investors. Is there desire to grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. To find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code) products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. Hang in there.

ne6pj5v,"You're welcome, hopefully it was at least a little bit helpful.Unfortunately, I don't know of any *comprehensive* resources covering what you need to know as a senior dev. I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.But there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.The good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.Just as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [""Simple Made Easy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [""The Mess We're In""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.Also, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.EDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either.

ne9ibvk,"> What’s the best way to approach learning so that I can really understand Python and reduce my dependence on AI? Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?This question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.This especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.If you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?If you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design.

For web or backend development, focus on [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core (if you stick with C#), APIs, databases, and service communication; unless you have a very specific need, you can mostly ignore advanced algorithms. For games, Unity will teach you a lot, though some types of games rely heavily on algorithms (pathfinding, procedural generation, optimization). If you aim to design new or improved algorithms for AI, security, compression, or simulation, deeper math plays a bigger role than coding.

(If there is no next key frame, draw it at the previous one.)If the user manually moves the box, insert a new key frame at the current time with that position.Playing the animation would essentially be to automatically move the slider 0.1 seconds every 0.1 seconds.You should now be able to e.g. go to time 0, set the box at the left, go to time 10, set the box at the right, then go to time 20 and set the box to the left again, and when you play it you should see the box animate left to right to left again.",high_throughput,2025-09-16 18:39:31,1,learnprogramming,t3_1niiu6r,False,

Any *actual* animation that a user makes will have some finite length, even though there's no predefined upper limit on how big that can be.Any standard data structure such as a list, dictionary, etc. will allow you to put as many entries in it as you want. The only practical limit is the amount of available memory.

The overzealous vibe coder trope.What that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.We all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.But it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.Nowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot ""Why am I getting \[pasted error\]?"". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.I also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.AI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.I'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",SouredRamen,2025-09-16 18:25:07,71,cscareerquestions,t3_1niov8g,False,

ndt8xwe,"Corporate Tech Recruiter here. There are a couple of differences I want to call out in response to some of these comments and to address OP’s question First, there are different types of recruiters: agency and corporate. Agency recruiters work for a staffing company that services lots of clients. Corporate recruiters are internal staff at one company and onlywork on openings for that companyAn agency recruiter indeed does have high metrics they need to meet and will tend to send LOTS of invites/messages. They are usually working on multiple jobs and building pipelines for the various clients and skill sets they know their clients need. LinkedIn typically produces a less than 10% response rate for recruiter pings so you need to send a very high volume to get tractionCorporate recruiters do also send a decent number of invites/messages via LinkedIn but are typically more selective. We do have metrics as well but they are typically focused on actual candidates moving forward versus connects. Corporate recruiters also pipeline and fight the low response rate but because we are measured more on speed of filling a job, our approach is more targeted.So why are you getting tons of pings when you haven’t engaged with your LI profile? Likely bc of the skills you selected in your profile, your job titles, the companies you’ve worked for, etc. These pings are likely agency recruiters or sourcers ( those that literally feed recruiters profiles to reach out to).Personally as a corporate recruiter, I’m only reaching out to those that have a well built profile so I can validate if they could be a match. But it is true, we are using linkedin to source even though we are we are drowning resumes. For example, I have a SDE 2 role open that hit 2k apps in 3 days of posting with only 10% meeting the location requirements. From there only 5% meeting the bare minimum experience. Add to this the number of AI generated fake resumes, the folks that lie about being in the location or other qualifications and that pool of 2k apps is maybe 50-60 decent matches.I understand how tough this market is and how hard it is to be a job seeker ( I HATE the BS so many companies put candidates through) but it also makes it hard is as recruiters to find you through all the noise.",j1knra,2025-09-12 13:19:52,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1newb86,False,

You don’t have to have a maxed out charisma stat, you need to not be miserable for your coworkers to interact with. I have ADHD for example and I interrupt my coworkers all the time but they live with me.ADHD is a poor proxy for understanding what it’s like to live with autism, so please do not take this as me attempting to be reductionist toward legitimate struggles, but one thing I have found helpful is to stop assuming my condition is the barrier I’m facing. It might CONTRIBUTE to the barrier, but plenty of people before and after me have had ADHD undiagnosed their entire lives and they never even knew. I’m glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded. Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.I had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I’m getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I’m extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.Don’t panic, you’ll be fine.edit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven’t.

We, of course, hear the stories of stocked up people who got good exits from companies. But it’s far from the majority - and not enough to make a dent in this area. And the final issue is that the reality is that a lot people still enjoy the work enough in return for that $300k a year… it give purpose and something to do. So even if they could take early retirement financially, a lot will choose not to. I once worked with a person who was a technical founder, who exited.

I was having a beer with him on day and asked him why he was still working at the age of 40 and did not need to. His answer was pretty simple:- he had been a hobby coder before starting college and liked it. - he retired for a while, but drove his wife crazy. - this money he could spend on whatever he wanted, without concern. - it gave him a sense of purpose.

About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. I learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It’s up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don’t value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. Now, I don’t even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me.

Remote is now tied to the local market rate for talent, and even takes a haircut for the ""convenience"" of being remote.Before you do something irrational in an otherwise crappy job market, evaluate the ""total value"" of your setup which includes:1. Your total compensation (base, bonus, equity)2. Your company provided benefits.3. The convenience of being able to WFH (reduced transportation costs, time savings, reallocated travel time to fitness/health/wellbeing)4. The social benefits provided by your country (health care, pharmacare, etc)5. The purchasing power you have per euro/dollar spentIts very important that you actually measure the value of (#3-5) in order to compare the ""real compensation"" you earn. Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids. As a result they are easier to manipulate when the industry is in a boom.You should index your total compensation against the percentiles for your country. 73K euro could put you in the top 5%, 10% (many european countries), 15% (e.g. Canada), or 30% (e.g. US) of earners depending on the country you reside in.

However, you want to weigh your situation before engaging in a confrontation with your company/CEO. If you already have a better offer lined up, then the risk versus reward of engaging in the confrontation is tipped in your favor. If you're in a low percentile earner in your country/region (e.g. 80-100%), then you may not have much to lose and more to gain.There is a good time to engage in this kind of dialogue, and a bad time to do so. Good times are when there is lots of hiring, easy-to-find opportunities, and very few people available to replace you.

For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.).

And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.Alternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking.

Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.As for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it?

Will you be a 1099 contractor?If yes to the above questions then you'll have an opportunity to open a solo 401k. Why a solo 401k? Say you leave your main employer. You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.Why do this?With a solo 401k you get two advantages:* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.There is also a third advantage.A 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.The employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.So with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.You just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k.

There's a reason why Asian cultures around the world, rank the highest in mathematics and science and absolutely dominate every single other country in the world over these two subjects.Unfortunately, what this produces are candidates that are so fucking good at math and science.

At my university there was no real campus life, more like a regular job where you go and then take the train back home (last time I was at UCI the huge area for parking freaked me out again lol, the universities around Boston were much more similar to what I've been used to).Then I first had to Google all those ""dean's list"" things etc. ;)But that's been even worse for Asian CVs.

I don't think it's in your best interest to sit around and tell you that you're doing fine and that you're not struggling when you clearly are, so I won't. Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.This is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely ""I don't know how to do this"" then you and management both have issues. No one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.This speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something?

You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be.

Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them? Or do they just want you to shit out a feature as quickly as possible before the Sprint ends? I went through something similar because I don't have a degree and every few months the imposter syndrome would hit me hard.

Hang in there.EDIT: Also, I would like to add, no developer should be working on one feature for 10 months.

He usually asks why I did things a certain way, and why I didn’t go down a different route. This either ends up with him agreeing it was a sensible decision, or suggesting looking into alternatives. When you reach out for feedback on a regular basis, acting upon it becomes far more manageable and feels much less like your work is getting crapped on.You can’t expect every line of code you’ve wrote and decision you’ve made over the span of 9 months to be the best option available. That’s an insane standard. Recognize that all developers are prone to making mistakes or suboptimal decisions, and take the initiative to reach out to your senior developers and get feedback more frequently.Personally I ask my architect to be brutal when critiquing my code so I can avoid repeating the same mistakes even when they’re small.When you go 9 months without reaching out for feedback you’re pretty much asking for every subpar decision you’ve made to be pointed out to you all at once. It can be hard to take that without it feeling like 9 months of effort is being crapped on.Ask for feedback more regularly, act upon it quickly, and take everything you learn from it with you moving forward. It also has the bonus of making the work feel more collaborative, and helps build a good reputation with your seniors in my experience.Edit: just to clarify, when I mention getting feedback, I will literally hop on a call with my architect and walk him through all the code changes since the last time he’s seen it, explain what it does, and give him a minute to glance over it. It usually ends up with him either saying “looks good” or asking more questions and then suggesting changes or accepting the reasoning.

I couldn't code out of uni.However, I genuinely believe, and learnt, that anyone with an average IQ can become a software engineer - my IQ is average. Sure, you may need to spend a bit longer practicing and going over things, but if I can do it - so can you.You need to find out what works for you with regards to learning. I found out (after buying lots of them) that books dont work for me. What worked for me was practical problem solving and project building.I basically put an entire year (literally, I barely went out) into learning computing science theory and practical coding through projects and challenges. I built so many projects I lost count. I also constantly applied for jobs and was rejected in that year - at one point being told software engineering wasn't for me but I should consider Business Analytics.A year later, I landed my first coding job (in 2017) and since then have worked up to over 6 figure salary in my area (Europe).

ne5sthx,"TL;DR: I wrote a goddamn novel so here's the brief. A lot of fresh graduates go through what you're going through. You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.I never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. The issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. Because of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.That's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.You should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. A lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during ""ramp up"" which usually takes about 6 months. You got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you.

But there's a really deadly spiral that a fair amount of people get stuck in.They land at a shit job where the things you're talking about are the norm, then they get burned out and desperate for a new job, and because of that desperation they fail to do their due diligence in the reverse interview and/or aren't picky enough with the new job, so they end up somewhere just as bad. Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.It's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.Layoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry. What is fairly unique to this industry is our painful interviews, which only makes it harder to get out of the deadly spiral once you're in it because you're both burnt out from your shit job, *and* the shit interview process. Double burnout.>How do I just find some peace in this field?So the things you're talking about re: stress, unrealistic deadlines, mismanagement, shit culture, etc aren't *inherent* of this field. They're inherent of toxic companies. The trick is finding a company that isn't toxic. Just because a company has lower pay doesn't mean they'll be lower stress/not toxic. Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.This requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said ""No thanks"" to plenty of companies.I've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career.

""greenfield modernization with the only requirements being to figure out how the legacy app works"" which just sounds like step one of the project: learn the old app so you can create actual requirements for the replacement. So does your team actually need to produce a replacement? You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.Those inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild. Say ""The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project."" or something like that.If your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.The key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.Get your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team.

Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level. For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can’t have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).Also L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something.

ndxqau3,"This was me when I started working as a SWE 5 years ago. I had been working at a sort of low grade data engineering job for a few years out of school, bc I had moved to a smaller town with my ex, but those didn’t amount to anything in my new job. I spent probably the first year there feeling like I didn’t know what I was doing. Because I truthfully didn’t.But they hired me knowing what I knew, they liked me personally and believed I would figure it out. After a year or so I felt comfortable with HOW to ask questions, which is a HUGE thing. And to do that, I had to work on things to understand why I was doing them. That’s very much how I learn, and I think many engineers find a level of enjoyment from the field, and that’s what a lot of teams look for. It’s worth it for a company to invest in someone who will learn to do things the right way.Related: The code base was a mess, as it turns out, and direction was directionless as this newly minted unicorn startup ramped up hiring. So a few months after I felt confident they fired half the engineers and the other half 6 months later. This was a week before moving to New York. I spent 3 months applying to jobs and interviewing and practicing questions from my new apartment for no joke, 12 hours a day. I went out after that and enjoyed my new home. I got hired at my current company 3 years ago and found they had the same approach to letting us learn and tinker with things. Now I should be on track for senior this year and I know I’m a good developer in my own eyes and get the sort of work that reflects it. Just get in and get your hands dirty and learn to enjoy it, they spent a lot to hire you and if you’re asking questions and showing your thoughts to them, they will do their best to get you there. But really think about the content of your questions. Identify exactly the last thing you did before you got stuck, recall the steps. Reboot your computer and try again, clear the local cache (check your policies for this first lol), present it like it’s a problem/hypothesis/method like a science doc and let them fill in the conclusions.

I barely understood what was happening with our components and applications I was working with every day, there was no way I could understand how to make a new one. Things that helped me were:* Seeing more codeI would read carefully through other teammates PRs and ask they why they wrote their code the way that they did. What would I have done differently? What can I ""steal"" for my future coding problems?* Understanding the codebase betterWhen I get stuck on a programming task, the first question I ask is ""why is it broken"". The second question used to be ""how do I make it work"". But now I look more at ""what does it do"", ""how does it do that"" and ""why does it do that"" before I ask ""how do I make it work""*  Generally understanding technologies, services and concepts betterI had to learn what a nosql database was before I could understand why I would choose to use one.

Know what cloud services do before I could choose which one to use in a system.  This last one can seem like a lot. And no one really wants to study after work.

ndlfzg9,"I've been in the Dynamics space for almost 20 years and I also came from a .NET background. Your friend is absolutely correct:>it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communicationI go back and forth whether it's ""real programming"" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.As for your questions:1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on ""under the hood."" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. If you're kind of over the grind of traditional ""programming"" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. One really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. I will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on. Because of that, I'm looking to make the opposite move and go into a more traditional developer role. I hope that covers all of your questions!

ndkm8vs,"Cracking the coding interview is overrated imo. I wouldn’t really buy any of the DSA textbooks (not sure why you would want three). I have the book and I think paying for leetcode’s DSA crash course is a lot better. You don’t really need to spend money though as you can just do neetcode 150 list, but if your DSA is really bad I would do the leetcode course. System design interview is a good book, but I don’t think you’ll really get asked system design questions for a new grad role. I would do the lc course + read up on current tech trends (not just LLM stuff) as I think showing a genuine interest when interviewing is really important.",honey1337,2025-09-11 03:18:53,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1ndktck,False,
