Analytics focused pipelines and business logic (more advanced dbt models such as mrr models). Technical overlap with the data engineers and business logic overlap with the analysts. Not so much focused on optimal usage of compute and so on but more focused on business.Data analyst -> data modelling in dbt to the specifications of the analytics engineers and data engineers and most importantly of course: analytics. The analysts in our company also write similar models to the analytics engineers but usually with less of a focus on complex models and more of a focus on analyses. Though that can vary on a need by need basis.The data engineer never does analytics or visualisations and neither does the analytics engineer. However, all are required to work with git and dbt. We also require knowledge in these technologies for analysts but most analysts would no know how to set up a dbt project or how to structure it. That's not their focus. But they still need to understand dbt well enough to create models and run tests, for example.Data engineering is definitely still viable. Basically, they are the people that keep the data sphere clean from a technical point of view and most knowledgable when it comes to setting up infrastructure (the analysts will never set up a dockerized dagster ec2 instance to orchestrate pipelines, neither will the analytics engineers, at least no in our company). And everything downstream hinges on that technical ability. For example: I, as a data engineer, run around the dwh and pick up queries to optimise. I can often reduce runtime from something like 1 hour to 2 minutes by configuring materialisation and implementing proper requirements for partition pruning (snowflake).

This allows for much more flexibility in the schema definition.Second, dataframely provides a bunch of features that patito does not currently implement:* Support for composite primary keys* Validation across groups of rows (i.e. grouping by one or more columns, ensure that the _group_ satisfies a condition)* Validation of interdependent data frames with a common primary key (dataframely introduces the concept of a ""Collection"" here: invalid data in one data frame can then also remove rows from another data frame)* ""Soft-validation"" via `filter` which allows to partition data frames into rows that satisfy the schema and rows that don't* Structured info about failures that can be used e.g. for more debugging or advanced logging* Integration of the schema with external tools (e.g. export to SQL schemas)* Automatic data generation for unit testing, both for individual data frames and collections (in this case, dataframely takes care of generating rows with common primary keys to allow rows to be joined)",borchero,2025-04-18 09:54:33,6,dataengineering,t1_mnqcsrw,True,

mnwrr71,"Personally, as someone having used the tools, i would say its down to the overhead and use case of design for each. Sure, spark sql can work as a general query engine, but it wasnt really designed for that.There’s some differences under the hood, particularly around how spark executes in stages, and uses more I/O steps than Trino.Essentially, for ad-hoc queries that change frequently, or you rerun things to change and shape results, Trino will nearly always be more performant. You can make some tweaks with a spark application (and then run it interactively to try and do the same), but tbh, Trino’s entire design, really, is for extremely fast reads on object storage datalakes.Spark is better places for wide ranging transformations, that are potentially more complex in nature. A good example here is the fault tolerance nature of spark, which matters way more in big batch pipelines, than analytical ad hoc queries. Sure, data loss and the task fails, just re fire the query. In a pipeline, you cant manually do that if its all running automated. Again, different horses for different courses in my opinion.I see it a bit like:Spark was a natural successor to Hive, for better big data transformation.Trino was a successor for something like Impala, as a faster query engine over datalakes",Some_Grapefruit_2120,2025-04-19 11:17:44,21,dataengineering,t3_1k2tgbe,False,

In my opinion, the key differentiating feature between Trino and Spark is not the speed, but support for fault tolerance, which is required for batch workloads. As such, many organizations deploy two separate systems, despite the increase in complexity, added infrastructure costs, and the overhead.I think Starburst is well aware of this trend, and they are promoting Trino with fault tolerance suport. You can find some report that Trino with fault tolerance enabled works well in production and even saves the compute cost. From our own testing, however, Trino with fault tolerance does not work well for large queries (which it is designed for) because Trino coordinator crashes repeatedly. In any case, even Starburst recommends two separate deployments of Trino, one for interactive and another for batch. So, I think it is (and will remain) common to deploy separate systems for batch and interactive: Trino + Spark, Trino + Trino with fault tolerance, Trino + Hive-Tez, and so on.That said, we offer a solution that simplifies operations and reduces costs by eliminating the overhead of maintaining two separate systems, with a single unified system.

Our primary offerings of Starburst Enterprise (you install wherever) and Starburst Galaxy (SaaS) do NOT have Apache Spark in the stack.

mo8d5t4,"If you can’t touch the source (no log access?), your best bet is the full extract + diff approach you mentioned.You can try primary key diffing: Compare today’s extract to yesterday’s and consider anything missing likely a delete. This works fine for daily batch and is reliable if PKs don’t change.To make it a bit more robust, consider soft-deletes downstream. In your warehouse, mark missing records as deleted rather than removing them. This way you keep history and avoid accidental data loss.To “optimize”a bit, you can do a hash-based comparison. If tables are huge, and full PK comparison is too slow, you can hash rows or chunks of data to detect changes and only diff those chunks.Also, some teams snapshot the full table daily and treat it like slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2). Storage-heavy, but you get full history without needing to touch the source.Re: tooling, Python with Pandas or even dbt (as an SQL option) can handle the diff logic but it will be kinda complex to maintain.Now, the issues with this are:1. Late-arriving data can look like a delete if yesterday’s extract was missing a row that shows up today.2. Extract gaps (like job failures) can cause false positives.3. High-churn tables can make diffing expensive or slow.So keep these in mind.That said, I definitely recommend pushing for log-based replication though. It will make your life 100x easier.

Another tip, you can take a look at Fivetran's teleport sync and try it out. If your company has a budget to use it, good for you. If not, try to use the Fivetran teleport sync on a test DB where every query is shown in the log. You'll see each query that Fivetran uses to do their CDC. You can try to reverse engineer it.

While abstractions take away some of the more complex aspects of the work, their purpose is to allow for greater breadth and a focus on specialization in other more complex areas of the stack, business, etc. Back when I started my career my team was responsible for supporting a large global messaging platform. This was the mid 2000s with an infrastructure involving distributed across thousands of machines in multiple regions. The entire product was developed in house and I knew it all, individual component features, large scale architecture, how things broke, etc. I could draw the entire 40-50 distinct component infrastructure from memory and describe all of the different flows within the system as I did it.

Append-only + latest view: Just write every change and use views or queries to pick the latest version (row_number() over pk, updated_at). It’s simple and scales ~okay.2. CoW vs. MoR: For update-heavy workloads, merge-on-read is usually more efficient with Iceberg. But frequent small writes still hurt performance (you’ll want to buffer and batch).

It's easy to learn and quick to get started on. Use Databricks if you also want machine learning and a few other neat features like advanced analytics and big data processing. The learning curve is a bit steeper in my opinion, but it's worth it because of better flexibility/control.Tools: look into are dbt, SQLMesh, airflow, kafka, fivetran, terraform, pyspark and the list goes on. I highly recommend dbt because it allows you to easily abstract data modelling and transformations while remaining (nearly) platform agnostic. SQLMesh is also proving itself to be quite good, outperforming dbt in certain things like write operation times and incremental models, but has a much smaller community than dbt. You can use fivetran for integrating a gazillion sources. I won't go through all of them, but I definitely recommend looking into pyspark if you're working with large data sets.

For managing non conterized workloads, Functions and app service can be great, otherwise you'd be better off with ACA.Also, are you sure you want to use streamlit for your frontend? You may not know that with streamlit you run a backend as well. Your client communicates with this backend which then communicates with your FastAPI backend. That's 2 apps that you need to run.

mnxgrw2,"I've done it before but generally I recommend against bidirectional syncs when transitioning from one storage to another because it's so easy to mess up: the system becomes very eventually consistent, one stream can have higher lag than another one, and you might have infinite circular updates if both streams rely on CDC and you sync same table(s) by accident. Tooling in this case is probably irrelevant - you just need careful engineering and separation of groups of tables that are being synced. Typically migrations are handled by modifying writers which temporarily write to both DBs. I'd probably stay away from Kafka/other queues because they will increase your synchronization lag. I can probably say more if you provide more details. What maximum latency are you looking for? I'm looking at a similar setup in production right now (MySQL -> PostgreSQL) and I see that under load P95 latency (time of write in destination minus time of creation of item in source) is about 850 ms.

In ML, you may require asof joins to safeguard against data leakage, particularly useful if you deal with time series data at an organization level. Here is the duckdb blogpost on how they optimized it We currently support a handful of engines but Ibis (the expression system xorq is based on) support 20+ engines. It’s really easy for us to add support for another engine (SQL or Python) so let us know if something that may benefit your workflow is missing.

Importantly it is fast and compact, and this data is optimal for your analytical/ML workflows. You can also set up batch reading/writing if your dataset gets bigger than available memory. Then records can be loaded from parquet to your OLTP database. Depending on how your data is stored on disk, duckdb could be a good tool here - especially if you have a larger than memory workload. It supports reading data in many formats, including raw blobs or text data (for images/logs).

For multimodal data, you can most likely get away with storing a URL pointer in Parquet, and the raw data as a file with an appropriate encoding (e.g. JPEG).

If you can steadily get this happening, then next step would be conversion to a file format that's readable by most systems, like parquet or JSON. Then capturing this to a data warehouse for centralised analytics workflows. For example, snowflake can read S3 data using the 'external tables' quite well - this is good where files are just added over time and records don't change.I used to be a mass spectrometry researcher so I understand what you mean about the closed source export methods. Be careful about vendors like Thermo trying to sell their cloud solutions, unless you like paying for a suite of contractors and a funky proprietary cloud solution.The interpretation can be left to the scientists. If it's clean and in one place, it shouldn't be an issue for them. Though it's worth testing at least one pipeline with them to ensure it's fit for purpose. And honestly even just getting data into S3 might work for some, as many researchers I knew (myself included) were comfortable using python to analyse cloud data - otherwise probably R.",PossibilityRegular21,2025-04-16 01:48:08,3,dataengineering,t3_1k08v9b,False,

Do you want to produce a weekly calibration report and dashboard to show the machines are in spec? Do you have a particular kind of analysis that is repeated multiple times a day that you'd like to automate?For the use case of calibration reports, we collaborated with lab management to have a technican use the machine's proprietary software to export the raw data and a standard analysis to a csv report, and we stored these csv's in a specific network folder. Periodically, a scraper searched the networked folder for new data and loaded it to the warehouse. An ETL cleaned the data and formatted it so that it could be displayed on the calibration status dashboard. The cleaned data were also available on the self service abalytics platform. Lab data is challenging because it's ofte less structured than data from an API or service backend. At all times you need to make sure the extraction and transformation process is representative of something physical that really happened.

I'd recommend having a folder structure by instrument name, date, and split it either by user, by the test, or by both e.g:`FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/User/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/User/file.csv`(I label dates like this because for my sins I have spent time working in QC where I sent samples around the world and we needed a universal date format everybody understood)This will be on your local network so all computers connected to instruments can dump the data there and then you have a single location to point your data processing tools to.> The output files are typically in a binary format. Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.This is a huge ballache. You'll want to put all unprocessed binary files into their own folder and convert them into a digestible format if absolutely required. Bear in mind each file might need it's own process, hence, the ballache.> In most cases, the instruments come with dedicated software for data analysis, and the results can be exported as XLSX or CSV files. However, since each user may perform the analysis differently and customize how the reports are exported, the output formats can vary significantly—even for the same instrument.One potential way is to have a standardised output. I get this massively depends on the instrument and testing although if that's possible, it would make everybody's lives easier.> Even if we can parse the raw or exported files, interpreting the data often requires domain knowledge from the lab scientists.Which makes complete sense.

This is the same no matter the location.I have secured data in cloud providers where not even the CSP can get to them and they remain very performant. It just takes a bit of creativity on your part.From an architectural standpoint, splitting your analytic workload across a wide area network is a bad idea. The physics just work against you. The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus. It just doesn't fly. Like I said, the physics doesn't lie and can't be bargained with.The term ""Lakehouse"" is a Databricks marketing term and not a technical one.

(FYI this is what 'historian' applications historically do, pandas and the cheapening of digital storage just kind of made them dinosaurs).This would usually take the shape of defining integers as indices to correspond to each sensor reading, then storing the human-readable name of that sensor in a different table. Maria will have no trouble keeping up with that. I think my most taxed maria instance handles 8k inserts a second, and handles just fine performantly on query.All depends on how you want to look at it on the front end.

The operational and data worlds are getting closer and closer, and what I'm seeing happen rapidly is that a lot of data engineering work is increasingly being done by software engineers. What this means is that data engineers who are only skilled in ETL are going to be left behind rapidly. And it's not just because ETL is ""different"", it's also because traditional ETL workflows usually don't adhere to the same standards of CI/CD, testing, etc. as services written by software engineers.What I've witnessed was that a huge part of a financial platform that used to be owned by DEs, was completely replaced by services owned by SEs. The DE's had a bunch of messy scripts in all sorts of places, typically Spark jobs, that were orchestrated by airflow and run once a day. About half of all of that was replaced with near realtime Flink jobs, that were adhering to the highest CI/CD standards. The costs more than halved, and no-one was woken up in the middle of the night anymore.So this doesn't mean everything will (or can) be replaced. But it did mean that there was a hiring freeze for DEs, while more SE positions were made. The story I'm telling is from a company a friend works at.

mnx51jd,"*This is long, feel free to TLDR and move on.*Here's the problem with interviewing programmers. Most of us work with a large codebase that can take quite sometime to learn and work with, partly due to its size, partly due to its organization, and partly due to knowing what the program does. Consider a tax program. How long would it take for you to learn the various tax codes used to determine how much taxes you owe? OK, maybe if the software was well-designed, that part would be isolated to areas where tax experts could work on that logic.But in many other situations, as part of building the software (or, more likely, maintaining it), the programmer becomes the de facto expert.If I'm interviewing you, I can't have you look at our production software. Let's skip past the fact that it might be proprietary. Simply put, in an hour interview, you can't learn enough to absorb even a fraction of the details (which is often why people feel completely insecure when they're hired and have to deal with software that they don't understand).In the past, sometimes the key was graduating from a top university. If you went to Stanford and could answer basic questions, then that degree could get you hired. The reputation of the university was enough. It was also common to ask people brainteasers (I'll give you one in a moment). It was thought if someone was intelligent enough to solve brainteasers, they would be good coders. Turns out, not so true. Some people love and are good at brainteasers (for example, I liked brainteasers) and this can make such people feel perfectly qualified. After a while, the so-called FAANG companies realized brainteasers didn't really help.The technical questions that were often asked in interviews were often confined to intro courses up to data structures and algorithms. That's because the typical CS major takes a bunch of optional electives in their 3rd and 4th years (in the US). You can't assume a person knows SQL or neural networks or undecidability or even NP completeness (at least, proofs of such problems).They'd ask basic coding questions, instead.But with leetcode, they can ask similar kinds of questions that rely on data structures and algorithms. These problems are self-contained, and more importantly, can be programmed without learning much and done in around 100 lines or less.This is clearly not the kind of programming most people do which is why you're not so good at it. This skill is kind of important, but it's like learning knife skills and being able to chop something quickly. Maybe a working chef needs this skill. Maybe it's nice if a home chef has this skill. But you can make a great dish without this skill. It's a nice to have that may come in useful in certain situations.You can do a simple search `how to solve leetcode problems`. There's even a leetcode subreddit /r/leetcode. There's a YouTube channel called neetcode where the guy tells you strategies to solve leetcode style questions. It's popular enough that there are lots of resources out there.These questions have become today's brainteasers. They share similar qualities, but they are also unrelated to most typical programming.Finally, I mentioned a brainteaser, so here is a common one.> You have eight seemingly identical balls. One ball out of the eight is heavier than the other seven identical balls. Your goal: find the heavier ball. Your tool: you have a scale that tells you three pieces of information: the left side is heavier than the right side; the right side is heavier than the left; the two sides have equal weight.> Next piece of information: If I put an uneven number of balls on either side, say, 2 balls on one scale and 1 ball on the other scale, then the side that has more balls is *always* heavier.> One restriction. Each time you use the scale, I will charge you money. You want to save as much money as possible. What's the fewest number of weighings you need to find the heavier ball? And, tell me how to find it?The other kind has to do with estimation or weird mental puzzles. * How many gas stations exist in the US?* If a commercial plane had its wheels on super treadmills that could go very fast, but the plane stood still (just as a runner on a treadmill doesn't go anywhere), does the plane lift off? Explain your answer.Sorry for the long reply. It was meant to show why leetcode questions are being asked and to explain that it has little to do with your ability to program, but has become this necessary evil (it's not evil, to be honest, as it's useful but not essential to know this) in programming interviews.",CodeTinkerer,2025-04-19 12:59:13,33,learnprogramming,t3_1k2v36s,False,

For me, this kind of approach meant I never really could work out what to do on my own when faced with a problem, nor could I creatively think of how to apply concepts.I know this isn't just ""programming"" but I went the other way and bought some electronic components, then worked backwards trying to understand how to get my devices to work together. That made me encounter issues with memory (as an example) and led me down the rabbit hole of all kinds of concepts - some of which would never have been a part of any of these tutorials. So now, I find myself more engaged, more ready to even experiment in my programming and with a list of things I want to try/make.I'd also note that I'm a hobbyist, so I'm not looking (at least for now) at learning programming as a way to carve out a career, which allows me to take it easy and not feel too down when things aren't working.

Make it known to the seniors around you that you're really invested in learning, ask to take on harder tasks, be willing to say ""I don't know how to do that but if you give me a chance I'll figure it out"" and sincerely mean it.I think the big thing that stops juniors from becoming seniors is a lack of ambition - some people, a lot of people even, are content to just do their job and not stretch themselves to learn or do anything new. But if you show you've got intelligence and motivation and are eager to step up, the opportunities to do so are usually there - they just usually aren't handed to you.A lot of this depends on the specific work environment you're in, of course. Big tech focused companies tend to put more thought into how to develop talent, but if you were employed there you'd probably already be asking whoever you report to during a performance evaluation instead of asking us. But at smaller companies or non-tech focused ones, you might have to be more forward in hunting down opportunities to grow.I am writing this assuming you're already professionally employed as a software developer.

Inform yourself about their daily tasks, their interests or hobbys and figure out where there could be need to have an application or automatization process to make their daily routine easier.Or, at last resource _pretend_ that you have a hypothetical customer, take up on different and role-play with yourself (for example, pretend that you're Person ABC, a developer, DEF, a customer, GHI, a project manager, etc, and even send emails to yourself).Now that you have a _reason_ / a project to code, research about all the steps that a project usualy requires from start to finish (GPT can help you if you don't undergo a specific training) and go through all of the steps.Yes, this will triple or quadruple the actual effort rather than just coding, but this is essential for your experience, professionalism, and ensuring you've concepted and properly planned the actual development phases and don't end up stuck in a loop of overcorrecting your implementations, because you also must set yourself time and hypothetical budget deadlines.There is only so much information I can provide here in a few sentences but I hope this helps you understand how a ""programmer"" works. Being ""just"" a programmer doesn't realy exist. You will in most cases be at least a team member, preferably also a Consultant, potentionaly even a project manager or even a freelancer. Grasping all the involved roles and being able to understand their minimum requirements will help you understand what's actualy important.Also, last tip, start very small, with little apps and ""customer expectations"". Stuff that seems easy done and implemented can add a lot of effort and grow the project exponentionaly because each part of the project needs some extra time for that specific aspect to consider. Keep it small, keep it simple. You can always add more to it when the basics are established",FlareGER,2025-04-21 15:08:41,9,learnprogramming,t3_1k4etau,False,

What language, and libraries do you have to or want to use? Systems development? What tools do you want to build and what hardware will you be supporting? One reason people get hung up on where to start is they don't know what road they are on or even where they want to go. Answering these question will narrow things down considerably. Once you know what road you're on, pick a destination that interests you, something that you would enjoy building and may even use yourself when you're done. If you want to get even more spicy then build something for someone else to their specs. Once you've determined your environment and what you're building then start small and keep building. Most big projects are a series of smaller projects that are fit together to form a whole. List what you need in the order that you will need it. For example, a website to provide a public bulletin board would need:1 ) A landing page that explains the purpose of the website2 ) A login page that consists of a page to create a login, a page to actually login once a login is created and a page to recover a forgotten password. 3 ) An admin page that allows a user create, modify and cancel their postings4 ) A postings page that shows the postings from the various users.That's a simple example, and far from complete, but you get the idea.

Having a cheat sheet is helpful.So, work with git is done locally in your local folder where you store your source code. When ready, you explicitly send your changes to the master copy on the remote git server. To open a code project (and any of its branches) locally, you need to copy it down to a folder on your local machine. That’s what git clone does. It makes a local copy of a remote repository that you will then work in. You generally use it once when you join a team working on a codebase or if you get a new laptop or something.Once you clone, you get to the second command: checkout. In every other source control system I’ve ever used, checkout means you want to edit something and want to prevent or inform other users of that. In git it means either you want to switch to a certain branch or you want to make a new branch from the current branch. Just remember that. Checkout is for local branch switching and changes nothing in the remote repository.Here are the basic commands for doing local work and explicitly communicating it to the remote master copy:Fetch - I want to update my local list of branches and their history so I can view what my coworkers did and maybe checkout someone else’s branch if needed.Pull - I want to update my current branch with the latest changes from the repo. This may prompt a merge if there are conflicts. You often do this to update your local copy of a main develop branch and rarely the one you’re actually working in.Push - I want to send my committed changes to the repo for other people to use. This may trigger build automation.Stash - I want to preserve select changes in a local side store while rolling back the files for tracking purposes. You do this to preserve a draft for future use.Merge - I want to move changes from my current branch into another (e.g. I’m done with my feature and want to merge it into the main dev branch). This is done locally. You pull dev first. Then commit and push the merge into it.

It doesn't matter how simple, or whether it has been used before. The first games I wrote were: A top down racing game similar to Rally-X. A top down shooter similar to 1942. A pong game with powerups. A pong game played on an elliptical playing field where both players could move around the entire ellipse and the ball changed colour when you hit it (so you lost points if the ball went out of the ellipse when it was your colour).These were all simple games, and some of them never got finished, but it taught me a lot about how to build things, and projects like these helped me land my first job as a graphics dev.For school, make sure you pass. Go to office hours. Find other students you can study with. There were times during my university days when I locked myself in my room for 2-3 days. No computer. Just a textbook and some paper. I read the textbook and took notes by hand. Then I read the textbook again and took more notes. Then I copied my notes and cleaned them up. Then I copied them and cleaned them up again, until I was at the point where I could probably write them out again without looking at the textbook. I did whatever it took to learn the material.It will take time. Find time every day to put some effort into it, even if it is only ten minutes. After I had three kids, I wondered how I would ever be able to learn something new again. Then I realized that even ten minutes a day adds up to \~60 hours per year. The first year I realized that, I taught myself how to play the guitar just by spending 10 minutes a day practicing. Then piano the next year, then flute the year after that.The point I'm trying to make is that it will take effort and time, but you can do it, and it will be worth it in the end.

Honestly, the act of explaining things to someone often shows me what I'm missing, but it also helps me when my brain is mush and I can't even begin to explain my lack of understanding. I'll do my best to explain what I can, even if it's between curses and insults and self-admonishment, and it's usually able to parse through the mess and pull out a bit of self confidence. It reminds me I AM absorbing something, but it also forces me to look at what I'm missing. Don't rely on it to spoon feed you the information because it's been proven that this negatively effects your ability to find the information alone, but having it rephrase your knowledge can help with your thinking of it, and, importantly, give you keywords to help your real searching, which you should always be doing outside of AI.",mellow_cellow,2025-04-17 19:46:21,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k1fr54,False,

You usually don't use classes in Python, but you will need to structure the classes. Think of the Service Class as the class that defines the functions you use in the Application Class. The Application Class is supposed to be the one that is run and will provide the UI and functions that are built on the Service Class. 2. Learn How to Use UML Diagrams. UML Diagrams will be very useful in the long run as they tell you all the functions you need to program with. Here's an example structure: \------------------------------------------------ | Class Name | \------------------------------------------------ | Variables in the Constructor | \------------------------------------------------ | Functions in the Class | \------------------------------------------------3. Think of the Language as Python, but instead of tabs, you use curly braces {}. You also must not forget to add the include for the scanner. The scanner is like the iostream C++ library. It provides functions used to take in input. Make sure to reference the scanner by using Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in); So those are my tips.

mo73clx,"Hello, I am a little late to the party but will chime in here... From a hiring perspective, especially for junior / entry level, \*what\* your project does is almost irrelevant. I do quite enjoy asking candidates \*why\* they worked on this particular problem because hearing about how people have scratched and itch that they have found is usually quite interesting and clue to how they think about the world. However... it's 98% about how they have structured a project and how their code looks. I'm afraid, as an apparently satanic friendly Russian has already pointed out, there is quite a lot of issue with the code itself and this, I feel, probably would work against you. When I am reviewing code I am expecting to see some consideration of 4 groups of people... 1) Your usersI don't mind that there is not a UI, there are plenty of technical, command line utility projects out there, but why are you telling me what I need to call my files? You have a CLI tool, where are my flags and options? Why do I have to accept all your hard coded values like 'chat.txt' and all the thresholds and things? Why can't I configure these on the CLI and experiment with the results? This is a CLI tool for technical users right? Who are they? What are their skills and what might they need? 2) Future developers looking to understand your codeThere are plenty of improvements to be found here. Separating the files, and not doing things like calling regular expression variables 'pattern', which can be clearly seen by the fact that you assign it a.. well... pattern. What pattern? What is it for? You had an opportunity to provide a descriptive name here, and you went for the most 'technically correct, but useless' option. This is a microcosm and applies all over your code. Go through it, and refactor giving consideration to other people who will want to understand what you are doing. 3) Future developers looking to \*extend\* your codeWhere are your hooks? You don't have to have a network accessible API but where are the places in your code that future developers might hook into to provide additional or improved functionality? I'd like to see that you have thought about where things might go next and left the code in such a way that somebody other than you might pick that up and run with it. 4) The reviewer This, in some sense is an extension of number 2, but if you are submitting your code for review for job applications you want to be applying number 2 here to a more elevated degree than you even might in other projects. I don't see a single comment in your codebase. Comments are a bit out of a fashion on some professional codebases right now because people have the (correct and noble) goal of writing 'self-documenting code'. Few who attempt this can do it effectively honestly and you definitely can't right now (not a dig, this might be the hardest coding skill to actually learn and takes many years). Without self-documenting code, you need to be documenting with comments. As a reviewer I don't have a huge amount of time to spend on each application (especially at junior where there are, these days, potentially hundreds), so if I don't 'get' your code within a few minutes, I will probably put your application into the 'maybe' pile to come back to if other applications are not better. I need to return to the 'maybe' pile for an applicant perhaps 5% of the time... because there is usually something better. Your energy and drive is great, and you have picked a problem and solved it. Really good for you and don't be disheartened. Many, most, juniors have \*nothing\* to submit, you just now need to take what you have done and think about the 4 groups I mention and consider their needs and interests and you will have something very valuable to put on your resume.

mo836k8,"This would absolutely contribute to proof it's worth giving you an interview for junior data analysis type roles. The larger companies will not analyze this, but instead put you through competence tests that they themselves devise, so I disagree with the reasoning behind some of the other comments here. The projects on your CV at your level are to demonstrate domain interest and active learning.For higher level roles, your current project would not count as a large project that holds the same weight as an employment entry on your CV. The closer your project is to a product then the more likely you would be to gain/pass a product-centred interview stage(s). It's perfectly fine to gain product development experience primarily through employment though. So you should really be focusing on being valuable over pretending you are a highly experienced product developer.From here, in my opinion, you've got two options to continue your active learning - develop this project into something closer to a product, or begin a new project that fits a target domain. The point being, don't spend time upgrading this project at the expense of genuine interest, by for example; appending unit tests onto it. If you want to genuinely learn about test-driven development then begin a new project. Adding unit tests onto a project after the development stage would skip some of the development process insights you could gain from doing it properly.",parazoid77,2025-04-21 08:12:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1k3ldpe,False,

mnlx6a0,"Oh dear, that's a rabbit hole, actually that's rabbit holes all the way down. Where do we start and where do we end.Let's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.When you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.You type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.That domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.The browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.After the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.Each HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.That's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. Your next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).We have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.Hope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",dariusbiggs,2025-04-17 16:22:45,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k1bjaf,False,

Most modern browsers will load that successfully too.Client can send requests through JS too, this is useful when you need small amounts of data for use in your JS scripts, not the whole page, this is where JSON format is useful.Server can be setup in a way where certain paths for example /api/get_items will respond with JSON instead, this is useful for whenever you want something in JSON format on client-side.",lukkasz323,2025-04-17 12:39:06,2,learnprogramming,t3_1k1bjaf,False,
mnkswo3,"You might be jumping a bit ahead of yourself here... Here's a brief rundown of how this all works:Your PC has a network card. That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.Any traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.One such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.When your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.A similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.So when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, ""Give me your home page.""Google's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.TL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting.

mogevaw,"POV: I've taught CS for many years, including general programming and APIs.APIs are a specific style of data transfer, which is a variation of input and output. So what you're wanting to learn is a particular style of programming. That's a good goal, but you need to learn general programming concepts before you can comprehend a specific subset of coding. There are two distinct ways of thinking about APIs, and both depend on some knowledge of core programming ideas. First, you can write a program in any language that *consumes* an API. That is, you can write a program that uses an API to find the current weather in Barbados. This is a relatively straightforward process in most languages, but typically you learn this after you've learned more fundamental things, like how to get information from the user or from local files, how to handle looping and branching, and how to write functions.The other way to think about APIs is to *produce* an API. In that sense, you are writing a program that lives on some type of server that produces data in some kind of machine-readable format (usually JSON, but other formats are certainly viable). This is also not a difficult process, but it requires knowledge of essential programming concepts, and typically you'll also want to write a front-end package to test your API. I would say start with any good programming course. There's a good reason Python is taught as a first language in most CS courses. It's reasonably straightforward, and is excellent for a number of use cases, including working with APIs. You can read and create APIs with Python out of the box, but for creating an API, you'd probably be better off using a library like flask, bottle, or rapidAPI. I would definitely learn standard programming ideas first before digging into libraries. Express.js is fine, but it's a specialized form of JavaScript that doesn't make any sense if you don't already know how to program in vanilla JS. It seems to me that CodeAcademy has a more organized curriculum. It doesn't go straight into using APIs, but that is fine. If you can't drive yet, race cars don't matter. Learn to program in a language, then we can focus on the particular skills you want. FreeCodeCamp is great for looking up a specific skill, but it often makes a lot of assumptions about what you already know.

mnzkhfc,"This is an interesting topic. But usually no they don't, because they're implemented in hardware which only supports a few precisions.Traditionally, those have been 32 bit and 64 bit. With machine learning, we're seeing a lot more interest in really, really low precision because it still works ""pretty dern good"" for big fuzzy matrix multiplies. So you'll see FP16, FP8, BFLOAT16, and other variants. But those are mostly confined to GPU tensor computing, not general purpose processing. For 99.X% of general purpose applications, the hardware is super super fast and you don't care that much about precision. If you do care, you should probably be using fixed point.A good way to think of floating point is as a fraction between powers of 2. So for numbers between 32 and 64, you get 32 \* 1.XXXX. That [1.XXX](http://1.XXX) fraction is the ""mantissa"" and the power of two is the ""exponent"". The number of bits in the mantissa gives you your precision. It's very precise near zero, and it gets a lot less precise for really big numbers. You can simulate any arbitrary precision you want in software though by just storing all the mantissa bits and simulating the floating point operations with fixed point.Another interesting bit is that for machine learning, they do care a lot about the buildup of errors from layers and layers of floating point. They normally fix that by normalizing the output to be between 0 and 1 at each layer rather than messing with the precision of the multiplications.",shifty_lifty_doodah,2025-04-19 20:59:18,2,learnprogramming,t3_1k2yfn4,False,

mofnz3y,"Well, two things! Or actually three ...*(Disclaimer: I've been teaching DSA to CS college students for the past couple of years)*Networking has always been a bit of a badly treated step-child in most computer science educations - the curriculum varies wildly from school to school, sometimes even from teacher to teacher. Some like to dive into using Wireshark to view packet-information, some like to talk in abstract terms about routing protocols, and some focus mostly on the application layer. And I don't really think there is a correct way - I mean, I've seen students being examined in the DHCP and ARP (without understanding which layer they were in), and I've seen students talking in extremely generic terms about DNS, but unable to resolve a hostname to an ip-address, and I've seen students proficient in Wireshark, but unable to use the Network-tab in the browser ... So, it's all kind of bad :)But, I also think that networking, as soon as it goes beyond the simple use of existing application protocols, like for web programming, is much more of a domain specialty, than fundamental knowledge that every programmer should have. I mean, as long as you understand that packets can be lost or damaged, everything else is depending on the specific application you are working with.And unfortunately, I think that students and teachers alike, forget that programming is more about understanding the domain, aquiring new knowledge, and adapting to work in whatever environment you encounter - than it is about storing fundamental basic knowledge of a random selection of systems and algorithms. And then the topic of DSA has had a lot of exposure in later years, especially as companies turned from fizzbuzz to leetcode interview-questions, and at the same time there is a lot of cookie-cutter courses in DSA that a teacher can just take and reuse - make the students buy the book, and verify their solutions with the examples given by the author. Easy work, not like checking if they have managed to understand a domain. So - yes, freshers don't know a lot, if anything about networking, but they shouldn't be expected to. However, they should be ready to learn on the job, and no amount of DSA will help them do that. DSA is a fascinating topic, and gives a lot of good insight into how to understand the challenges of programming - but it has hardly anything to do with the domain outside of the programming language, and it is very easy to fall into the trap of just learning/teaching DSA for DSAs own sake.)**Help your new hire learn the networking topics!

moetjh7,"You should get used to rewriting your project.For me, when I begin a new one, in the beginning I'm constantly rewriting stuff as I'm learning how the program should actually come together. However, I don't consider this a wasted effort, as it all enhances the final product, which will end up becoming far stronger than if I instead made it out of some patched-up frankenstein code base.In the beginning, I think it's important to be willing to start from scratch, or at least completely re-implement large portions of your code. Thing is, if you're afraid of doing that, then it's tough to get started. Chances are, you don't know what your program should look like when you're beginning.Rather than spending hours upon hours on planning something only to later change your mind(or even worse, get attached to your initial idea because you don't want the effort you put into it to go to waste), instead try things out, see what doesn't work, figure out how to make it work better, and so forth, until you arrive as a cohesive whole.Framing the early stages of your project purely as a exploratory learning experience is quite liberating.

mo73cm8,"To most computer science guys, there are 3 language levels. There are more if you get into a big thesis level discussion with theorists and such, but your average coder probably thinks in terms of 3. Those are the machine's actual language: ones and zeros, the computer is wired electrically such that circuits have power or not, if they have power its a 1, if not its a zero, and these 1s and 0s represent actions and data. The next level are low level languages, which humans can work with but are extremely tedious. Most of the low level languages are considered ""assembly"" languages and that looks something like move data from memory to a cpu register, perform an action on it, and move the result back to memory, possibly with other things like jump to a different next instruction if that result was not zero. Its explicit, step by step telling the cpu what to do. High level languages are the third, and those gloss over the tiresome details by providing a way to express a bunch of those tedious actions in a simple, natural way. Instead of moving memory to a register and a result to memory, you can just say x= a+b or something akin to that. In all cases, the code you write is rendered to machine language eventually. Machine language is what you think of as a 'binary' or 'executable' program file -- you can look at those with a hex editor if you know what it means, but its largely gibberish if you are not an expert at dealing with machine language. Assembly is almost, but not quite, one to one conversion to machine language. High level code has two major approaches, compiled (turned into an executable file, a runnable program) and interpreted (turned into an executable program in memory instead of into a file on the disk, which is executed and discarded, but can be modified on the fly to some extent as it is running, and observed as it is running).

So my question was two fold: what is the information that a program is? from another comment, I now know the terms ""source code"", and what that information is in the computer's 1's and 0's distinct from post compilation (machine code). I ask this, because I wanted to see what the actual process it is I am doing is here. Plus, because I don't know what it is I am not knowing, this is an active attempt to organize my information into a conceptual synthesis, which is hearable in how rambly this is (I am self aware). With that, I didn't know what a developer environment is, with CLI, what commands actually are, and how this integrates across the file system of the computer, so when I get told by VS Code that something didn't work, well that's just that, because I didn't know what a command even is in terms of what's happening in the computer when I tell power shell something. So I am trying to learn each part here, and make sense out of a full picture I, in the past, didn't realize I was missing. Now I see it clearly. I am trying to understand my local environment, developing on my own laptop here, and how these different pieces are speaking to one another across my local system. So when I try and get an SDK to be knowable to Powershell and usable in VS Code terminal, now I understand that what it is I am trying to do is, across the local system, how these components get to know each other, that I know what it is Powershell is and what I am doing when I execute a command, so if something with say, Dart, doesn't work, now I can actually troubleshoot, because now I have any semblance of what it is that it is I am trying to do. I am trying to execute a command, getting windows to look for a program and do something with it (based on the command). I am attempting to learn how these pieces, miscellaneous without an understanding to structure them, actually integrate into a system, and that system is my local environment, so now knowing that, I can move fluently throughout my local environment and actually get things going here.

Commit the stable files to the repo by running `git add $FILENAME` follewed by `git commit`.Now you have a snapshot of those files saved in your repo. If you edit them from that point, you can see how they changed from the time they were committed with `git diff`, or you can revert them to how they were with `git checkout $FILENAME`.The point is, you don't need the Testing subfolder any more. You can safely modify the files in situ. More importantly still, you can back-up the repository to a remote host like GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted solution.I don't know if it's game changing, but I really like Fish for its programming language.

I don't actually use it for that because I rely on some old-school features it doesn't support, and I'm too set in my ways to ditch them.However, it also has a scripting language that I find much more intuitive and consistent than Bash or Sh (which is what most people use for shell scripting on UNIX systems).

For example, a RESTful API endpoint is best written as just a standalone procedure rather than being a class method, since the API is inherently stateless and thus there is no state to encapsulate.

""Short of stack"", your stack should be RDBMS, MERN/MEAN, nextjs, and java/spring boot as a backend language, and that stack will get you in 90% of places. If you didn't have that stack, it should have been in you to acquire it in the time you were unemployed. Also, ""wrong cloud"", AWS is all you need really, vast majority of companies are predominately in AWS. Again, if you didn't have the basic dev AWS certs, then that was on you to acquire it. Also, 2 years @ 20 apps/day = 7300 apps. That, combined with a rigerous and well-thought out leetcode, sys design and tech stack knowledge acquisition, mock interviewing and resume refinement via professional reviews should have gotten you over the finish line, so there are some strategy gaps as well. But I don't think that the strategy or the technical gaps are the primary issue here. The fact that you are too ashamed to tell your own parents that you were In the worst emotional and financial state of your entire existence, and the fact that you feel ashamed about getting a job from someone in your network (yes your family counts as your network you butt), tells me that you have some deep cutting emotional well-being and self-esteem issues, and you need to start openly talking about with your significant other, your parents, your best friend and a therapist, all at once and right now. Your emotional well-being underpins everything, how you pursue your goals, what your goals are, whether you succeed at them or not, you're technical ability, quality of work, job performance, etc... it is the bedrock of a human being, and just from reading your post I can tell that there are huge flaws in your foundation which undoubtedly has resulted in your extremely abnormal turmoil. If you need anything from me whether it's technical or emotional, feel free to reach out to me anytime, but regardless, I would very strongly recommend to you that you start to really talk to your parents and your friends and family more about your feelings and your life and start to rebuild your self-esteem, because any emotionally healthy person would have immediately told their parents/inner circle minutes after losing their job, and any person that is emotionally healthy would have immediately reached out to friends and family and past coworkers for support in times of need and wouldn't have generated much anxiety at all about taking a job from a family member in a time of an absolute dire financial and emotional crisis.",twnbay76,2025-04-21 16:27:34,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1k4dbtu,False,

A doctor can talk to NurseGPT all day, but something has to put in an IV and hang a drip line. A lot of robotics actually being used are incredibly simple, flat boxes that lift up 3cm and move pallets around for example. Robotics that can stand in one spot plugged into a wall and do the same thing over and over like on an assembly line, sure, but the power usage and overheating problems need to be worked out for autonomous units. And they need to do something about LLMs confidently giving you the wrong answer before anyone will trust them.But let’s say they iron out all the kinks; I’ve heard upwards of 60-70% of jobs could be replaced. Our systems are not setup to handle such massive unemployment. All these giant tech firms are not going to give up their earnings to contribute to any form of UBI, the line must go up! There are too few politicians that aren’t bought and paid for that will actually stand up and do something. In the long run this is all just another big tech bait-n-switch. They can run at giant losses for years, maybe even decades as they continue to subsidize everything with the parts of the business that make money. They will sell a restaurant a waiter bot with the latest wAIter model installed, but it can only stand at the hostess podium, and tries to seat people at already occupied tables 30% of the time. Human Robotics promises it will replace your entire wait staff in 5 years so a few people lose their jobs. But turns out the wAIter model was just a chatGPT wrapper making API calls the entire time. Human Robotics is running out of seed money, so now before the robot will seat your customers they must watch a 30 second unskipable ad for the McDonalds across the street.It just seems like if everything works out the way the big tech companies want it’s the worst possible outcome for humanity.",squeeemeister,2025-04-17 13:45:54,49,cscareerquestions,t3_1k1by55,False,

Or they think coding is just like excel. Executives? Whole different breed. To them, all work is menial. The only thing they get to see is results. PowerPoint decks. And I think when you do that long enough, you start to very quickly forget that people need to actually do the work.So when the work is not getting done - deadlines are missed, the product isn't good enough, whatever - your first thought isn't ""I need to get in there and figure out what's going on"". Your first thought is ""I need someone to get this department's ass in gear"".A lot of people hate on middle management, but that is literally the role of middle management - to both be close enough to the work to understand what is and isn't getting done and why, while also being above the work enough to be able to tell executives what they need to know (and what they want to hear).",dfphd,2025-04-22 01:12:23,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1k4lzt4,False,

This is just the way of the world.With your YoE, you should be getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn and other platforms that can easily land you interviews.

Stop dick riding FAANG as well. FAANG is what made the market what it is because they over hired and over paid for people and set unrealistic expectations for what SWE careers should actually look like. They set a standard for unrealistic hiring practices that is not reflective of actual work we do on a daily basis. We’re grinding LC for months just to do a job where we do basic system design and basic logic. It’s absolutely ridiculous.Also, FAANG looks good on resumes, sure, but so does experience in any real job where you can back up that experience with technical knowledge.

mo7o0lh,"It's pretty common in all forms of Comp Sci IMO. I think Game Dev has such a bad rep because its seen from the outside as a ""Fun"" coding job. There's a lot of people willing to take a pay cut, or work longer hours to be part of something they are passionate about. So people get into it thinking it's going to be a fun job. Then the reality hits - a lot of the time, you might be on a huge team, just working on a very small part of a game without a lot of say in how the game is put together. It becomes the kind of work you'd do anywhere else, it just gets plugged into a game at the end. Ultimately, I think the gaming industry is kind of past it's prime. There was a time when a team of 1-10 people could build a ground breaking AAA game. Rollercoaster Tycoon was built by one dude, for instance. Now, AAA games are made by teams of 100+ people. But the games don't cost 10-100 times more just because they required an investment of 10-100x what they used to. Game Studios are much less likely to take risks, it's just like games like ""Call of Duty 153, Ultra Future War"" or whatever, there's not as much innovation which I think is why a lot of people are drawn to the work. So people who love gaming get into the industry. They are smart enough to make 50-100% more doing any other corporate job, but the game companies know they can get top talent for a fraction of the price, and in fact, need to, because of how expensive development has gotten. Then they work there for a while, and find that while the work and team structure is similar to any other corporate job, they are being under paid/over worked, while their peers who went to work at some boring fortune 500 company are walking out the doors after 40-50 hour weeks, making more money, enjoying other things in life.

You also need to know when it's time to jump ship.If you want a stable 9-to-5 where you can plan your life, startup life unfortunately isn't it.If you want to stay at the startup, you need to create boundaries and enforce them else that startup will consume your life and your health. If your boundaries clash with the company, it may be time to move on. Your health is going to be important to you long after the company goes out of business or gets bought by another company.Every startup is 6 months from shutting down. You are one heartbeat away from dying every moment of every day. As long as your heart keeps beating, you're alive to wait for the next beat, and life goes on. It's the same way for startups. Instead of heartbeats, it's customers and funding rounds.Don't let the startup drama sink you. In the end, it's just a job. We want it to be a lot more than that, but at its core, it's a way for us to pay our bills and hopefully more our careers forward.",midnitewarrior,2025-04-21 17:48:57,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1k4izk8,False,

It could be that you just didn't hire strong candidates, or it could be that something in the company or team dynamics isn't helping people flourish. It sounds like you are pushing to upskill others, rather than others being the driver of their own growth. This means management needs to get to work. It's their responsibility to create a healthy team dynamic, where everyone is pushing to be better every day, actively trying to upskill themselves. But fixing this situation isn't your job - it's the job of management. So my question for you: what is management doing about this? Do they see the same issues? Do they have a plan? Do you have confidence in their plan? If the answer to the questions above is ""no"" then I'd start looking around for other opportunities, because the situation is likely to persist until some crisis happens that forces management's hand.",apeinalabcoat,2025-04-21 09:17:03,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1k445wa,False,

Especially if you have been at your company a while. And if you trust your manager, you should tell them that you are going to. Here is how you can frame it: ""I have been pushing myself hard and accepting everything that's been thrown my way, and I've been trying to do things as quickly as possible. I think I need to stop doing that, and instead be honest about how much time and availability I have, otherwise I'm risking getting burned out.""I have literally been told by my managers (as in, multiple have said this independently over time) that it's okay to go slower, and in fact, sometimes it's preferable. The only thing it's not okay to do is not communicate.So for example, if you get a Slack ping that's like ""hey, I'm seeing error X in app Y, can you please take a look?"", instead of saying ""I'm on it!"" and then frantically trying to chase down error X, say, ""sure thing, I can look in [a little bit/30 minutes/this afternoon/tomorrow/when I'm back from lunch]"". If that isn't good enough, the person asking is going to explain why. You can also literally just say ""sure thing, when do you need info by?""The same is true about projects. If you are not particularly interested in a project, it is okay to step back and listen and only speak up when you have something important to say. As long as you are aware of what's going on, learning when your input is needed and when to let others speak is a valuable skill. (Personally, I still struggle with it.) People will notice if you are obviously disengaged, ignorant about what's being discussed, or making them repeat themselves. They won't think to themselves after a meeting, ""Boy, YonghaeCho sure was quiet,"" and if they do, it's only for a fleeting moment - and if you spoke once or twice because *you needed to*, they won't think that at all.Overall: It's not just okay to slow down, it's good to slow down.

mnsj8cd,"Never take Glassdoor reviews as truth. The one and only thing you should use them for is to help you formulate questions to ask during the reverse interview process, and so you know what you keep an eye out for. Then based on the reverse interview you need to form *your own* opinion on if the company sounds like it has any of those negative traits you read about.The obvious reason why you shouldn't take those reviews as truth is they're often by disgruntled employees, or employees pressured into leaving good reviews by HR while they're working there. Neither end of that spectrum is reliable. Rarely does a content employee just think unprompted to themselves ""You know what would be fun? Let's go write a fair, unbiased review about my very average employer!""But beyond that, companies change over time. A review that was accurate even last month, might not be accurate today. All it takes is a single change in management, and a team's culture can shift literally overnight. So just because someone said they worked long hours, doesn't mean people are still working long hours. The reverse is also true, just because someone said the WLB is great, doesn't mean it's still great.Teams within companies also vary drastically. Even at small companies. I worked for a startup once that had \~30 engineers, spread across a few teams. The team I worked on was super laid back, modern stack, essentially no red tape so we moved very quickly, etc. Even pre-pandemic, we'd only come into the office once or twice a week, and nobody was watching us so sometimes we'd just WFH all 5 days and it wasn't a big deal because we got results. But another team was the polar opposite of us. Their stack was older, they had a *ton* of red tape, they moved very slowly, produced very little, and they were straight up told by the CTO that they need to be in the office strictly 3 days a week because they needed to get their shit together.So if you read a bad review about Team A, it doesn't mean Team B will share those traits. You need to talk to *your* hiring manager about *your* future-team to figure out what that team is like.The startup I mentioned earlier had a fair amount of negative reviews on Glassdoor talking about nepotism, and it being a boys club, and that if you're not buddy buddy with the CEO you'll never have any career growth. When I interviewed with my hiring manager and the CTO I didn't get those vibes at all. The culture seemed amazing, which is why I decided to ignore those reviews and join them. Lo and behold, the culture was great. I was absolutely *not* buddy buddy with the CEO, or anyone for that matter, and my career skyrocketed at that place. I've gotten the biggest raises I've ever seen there. It was a great place to work. The person complaining about nepotism probably just sucked at their job and got fired, and decided it'd be an easier pill to swallow to blame nepotism instead of themselves. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",SouredRamen,2025-04-18 17:29:57,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1k2a7a2,False,

If you become a SWE, you'll probably end up as a people or project manager later in your career anyway. You are very young and have plenty of time. Here's what I would recommend:1. Get a BS in computer science. Any accredited program is sufficient. You don't need to go to an ivy league. 2. Apply for internships, your sophomore and junior years.

mnzy4ry,"Hard to say, it's always some combination of being extremely competent, having a good track record, and communicating with stakeholders well enough that you can convince them to trust you to do the work.I'm a team lead, and the biggest issue I see in the other team members is when they work on larger projects things don't get correctly delivered, or when they are talking to managers they bring up random stuff that isn't important to what managers care about. On that last point, it really drives me crazy, but when you have managers/stakeholders in the room, you need to speak to them with a language they understand, about concerns they care about, and at a granularity level that matters to them.I have one guy on my team, great developer, who spec'd out an EPIC level feature set, and wanted to present that to a manager. The only problem with his presentation is that it was way to granular, and talked about tickets in progress, focusing on the details of the how, and not the what/why. That's going to confuse the shit out of any manager whose trying to make sure the high level plan of the team is aligned to what they believe should get done.That's one thing, another is example is someone on my team shipping a feature without good product rationale, like the feature was just sort of garbage and we couldn't tell either way, and not backing down or and providing weak evidence that the feature was useful. What they said was basically: ""since we don't have data it's not good, we should keep it released and just observe"". Lol, I don't have data that my Greyhound can't drive a car, you think I'm letting him drive?Finally, the last thing which drives me completely crazy, is when people don't understand the purpose of meetings, and use the time in the meeting for something else.

mnjeo02,"QA careerist here, manager at the moment. The opportunities in the discipline are dropping dramatically. That probably doesn't help you right now at the moment you need a job, but medium/long term, I would definitely look at lateral moves to other functions. I think being early in your career actually helps you here because you'll be on the junior side for whatever you do. Do some dev work in your spare time if that interests you at all. Actually, even if it doesn't interest you, it's probably a good idea.There are two kinds of SDET jobs I see these days:One, what we used to call ""white box"" - someone who has dev-level skills and has written source code or close to it. These people can stand up a test framework from scratch and pipeline infrastructure for tests to run and report. These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.Two, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts. You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.Observability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career. Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly. Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground. There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",NearbyRock,2025-04-17 05:35:27,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1k10smd,False,

I put the accurate dates of when I was employed but kept the reasons why I had a gap to myself unless someone asked me. 2. Prepared a rehearsed answer to why do you have this gap? Something along the lines of:“I had a great experience in my previous role, it allowed me to grow a lot as a developer and accomplish xyz (keep it brief) however I had some personal circumstances that forced me to make the very difficult decision to step away from my job to take care of my personal life. I’ve used the last x amount of time to fully take care of everything and now I’m ready and excited to start my next adventure.” You can just run your own circumstances through ChatGPT and make it better for your specific situation. What I would NOT do? 1. Give any specifics about why you took the break (you should not be sharing medical information with a prospective employer to avoid putting yourself in a position you could be discriminated against due to health reasons). 2. Make it sound like you’re not ready to get back to work (it’s okay if you need accommodations later on, but for the initial conversations you want to give the impression that you’re ready and excited to get back to work). 3. Don’t sabotage yourself by offering any of this information unless explicitly asked. In my recent job search I spoke to almost 20 companies. Out of all of those only 3 actually asked me about the gap. I gave my scripted answer and they seemed satisfied enough with the answer to not bring it up again. Only 1 recruiter was kind of rude about it (Amazon) but he still moved me forward in the process so it didn’t hurt my chances at all. Don’t believe them if they try to neg you for having a gap. It’s not your fault, you’re doing your best and you WILL get back on your feet soon.I was open in my language about my “previous experience” and “in my previous role” but for most interviews nobody even brought it up and they have your resume so they know when you were employed it’s not up to you to over explain and if anything I think that would hurt you because you want to focus on what you bring to the company now, not what’s set you back before. One last thing, if you do have negative experiences with any company due to your break, you want to make sure you take that into consideration before accepting any offer from them. If they’re rude to you based on a gap on your resume, I can only imagine they’ll be worse if you ever have issues in the future and if your problem is something like ibs you want to make sure your next company is fair and understanding about medical accommodations. So take all that into consideration before accepting any offers. Best of luck!

mnt1zac,"They shouldhabe salary bands—if they’re smart.As for the amount, it depends. Some companies apply a flat percentage for promotions; companies I’ve worked at, for example, used a flat 10%.Other companies have set salary ranges and will use comp ratios to determine the increase. They also consider your current compensation. Generally, managers and the comp/HR team aim to bring employees close to a 1.0 comp ratio. For high performers, they may go higher. However, some managers or comp/HR folks might think that bringing someone straight to a 1.0 is too large of a bump, so they might offer a lower comp ratio instead. They may also feel a candidate needs ramp-up time or isn’t fully qualified, which can also justify a lower comp ratio—though there’s usually a floor, such as 0.9.Comp ratio, short for comparative ratio, is a measure used in compensation management to compare an employee’s current salary to the midpoint of a given salary range for their position. It’s calculated by dividing the employee’s salary by the midpoint of the range and is usually expressed as a percentage. A comp ratio of 100% means the employee is paid exactly at the market or target rate. Below 100% may indicate they’re underpaid relative to the range, while above 100% suggests they’re paid more than the midpoint—possibly due to experience, tenure, or performance.

mne66ao,"A few pointers： 1. You probably have done some sort of system design in game coding. Knowing how parts of a system work together is something you’ve already done, you just have to abstract that to other types of systems. 2. What type of system design question you’ll be asked will vary greatly on the scale of the company, the seniority of role, and the type of roll. You should not expect load balancing questions if you’re doing a front end engineering system design interview. If you’re doing backend at an established company, they probably won’t be asking about load balancing (because they’ve already solved that), but will probably ask about problems you’ll be expected to solve. 3. Unless you’re doing system design or architecture or tooling, they probably will just want to know that you can think in terms of systems. The specific database or asynchronous job or whatever other part won’t matter so long as you know how they interact or at a higher level what pieces are interacting. They care most that you’re able to grasp the whole system rather than that you remember the names of specific tools to build the system (unless they specifically list technology they use, then you should totally know about those technologies at a conversational level).4. ChatGPT is a great tool to prep for interviews. You can prompt it to create a series of questions for you for the seniority level and type of roll and company and interview type (systems design) you’re interviewing for. If you have the job description/company, that can help it be more specific.

If you aren't in love with medicine, then you made the right decision. I literally just talked to my friend, 30F with Chinese immigrant parents, who said, and I quote: ""I honestly think I just hate being a doctor."" She feels trapped because after 8 years of schooling and 3 years of training (residency), not to mention all the debt, what else is she plausibly going to do? **Do not consider med school** if you aren't in love with the prospect of becoming a doctor.Second of all, you don't have to particularly like coding. You have to not hate it. I'm blah on coding, I never spent a minute doing it outside of what I had to do and I'm going to keep it that way. But I'm not miserable doing it.Third of all, in terms of being an incompetent coder -- no offense, but you don't have the right to say that. If you spent the last three years using ChatGPT and not really actually applying yourself, then is the problem that everyone started earlier, or that you didn't actually build the skills in the foundational classes? As an analogy, if you didn't pay attention and learn stuff in algebra classes, then are you struggling in calculus because you don't have the aptitude, or because no one is born with an inherent knowledge and you need to build up the foundational pieces?Finally, no I do not think going *back* to school is a good idea. School is expensive. Take any data science electives while you finish up your degree. If you're *actually* interested, you can self-study most of data science. Even 10 years ago there were tons of online resources. A 3.15 GPA is not really the end of the world but you'll need to actually be hireable, and that means building skills.

I sacrificed everything for my parents and it was NEVER ENOUGH, so you do the things you feel that will benefit you and your life the most. You are 22 and still in school, so your parents still view you as a kid and not a young adult. Hearing you say you were having suicidal thoughts, I hear your pain. I’m glad you’re still here. Illness tells us, we are dumb, not enough, not smart enough, I am telling you, you are capable of anything you put your mind to.As for your school dilemma, I have a couple of thoughts. GPA matters way less then people realize in the workplace, how well you did in school has no bearing if you will help businesses make money or not or being effective at your job. The whole ""coding since childhood"" thing is pretty irrelevant too, we're adults now and no longer 8 lol. EVERYONE in the workplace uses ChatGPT and LLM's now. I can see just by the steps you are taking and trying to control things, shows me you are growing as a person, the same cannot be said for others lol. You also did not get a fair shot at pursuing CS properly. Even if you absolutely sucked at everything CS, you are in the 4th semester almost done. Starting over in different schools may not be the best idea tbh, job market as a whole sucks right now, and you could potentially land those jobs you are targeting with a CS degree, as what degree you have does not matter as much as people make it out. If you feel like a restart is what you need, then by all means. As long as it is YOUR decision, explore the other career path, make mistakes, do whatever you think is necessary to take controlReading that last bit about your mom is rough, that gaslighting is crazy.

Most software engineers change languages as frequently as they change jobs.Learning some JS, Ruby, or Python might help, as those are three extremely common languages on the backend.If you specifically want to build custom tools used internally (not client-facing), there are a ton of those jobs.

That said, it's not as if a Masters is *bad.* At worst the employer considers it equal to a bachelors, and at best they view it even more positively than a bachelors. There's nothing inherently wrong with bridge programs so long as they guarantee you entry into their associated masters program. I wouldn't go to one that didn't guarantee entry though. You'll have to put in more personal effort with a bridge + Masters, because you need to learn the entire CS undergrad curriculum in only 2-3 semesters and also Masters are obviously inherently harder than bachelors. I would also imagine it would take longer + cost more. But you do get a better degree.I think either are fine really, would decide based on other factors like which schools you're deciding between, their costs, how much you'd want to attend that school, etc. FWIW some schools (eg [UPenn](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/)) offer a CS Masters aimed at students from non-CS backgrounds (it's also entirely online at UPenn), so you wouldn't even have to do a bridge.
