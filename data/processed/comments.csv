nc76w6m,"Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s. I think there’s three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we’re in today:First and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you’re a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. **Quick edit based on some responses:** I’m definitely not saying there aren’t any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it’s *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor’s recommendation is. Maybe I’m just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn’t exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. Second, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you’re migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There’s a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you’ll have to rebuild it anyway. Third, while the concept of “data” has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that “Can I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?” has become such a ubiquitous question that you can’t really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren’t documented particularly well, if at all. IMO modeling is still important, but it’s largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",No_Introduction1721,2025-09-03 14:31:47,57,dataengineering,t3_1n7fu2f,False,

nc7vx8r,"ooof what a wonderful topic to discuss... shame its not a Friday as I would have more time for a reply. Im being serious this is a ""pub"" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.This industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. When I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.Compute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.With this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.It does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel.

With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff. While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions. This is not as much a concern now. \- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design.

And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason. But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult. So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.But that doesn't mean nobody is.

nc90qmp,"As a DW professional with two decades in the domain, I’ve lived through the transition data modeling and data architecture have gone through during those times. When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it’s already 2 years gone!Nowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it’s an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. I guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they’d need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. I’d say it’s just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).Edit: also wanted to mention how the term “datawarehouse” has now been usurped by the vendors to mean “snowflake, redshift or GCP”. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he’s in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",DJ_Laaal,2025-09-03 19:51:44,6,dataengineering,t3_1n7fu2f,False,

Slowly starts contributing to the data stack, at first with small contributions and incident reporting/response, then with more substantial contributions. They either make the switch in-house or move jobs and suddenly find themselves in a position of autonomy to build.

You take a spadeful of earth from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment. Whatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being the heaviest, it has sought the bottom. Among the sediment you will find half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads. You are delighted. You move off to one side and wash another pan. If you find gold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan. If you find *no* gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you are on the right scent.>You lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the hill—for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich deposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they wandered. And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point—a single foot from that point you cannot find any gold. Your breath comes short and quick, you are feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down, they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interest—and all at once you strike it! Up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold. Sometimes that one spadeful is all—$500. Sometimes the nest contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out.

Given the amount of overhead of running something yourself, I would definitely not rule out Snowflake. It really is a breeze, you data size sounds like you are always in a small warehouse. One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.What I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables. Do the heavy lifting in Snowflake, doe the simple querying with your own computer.

What incurs cost in each platform.

Dashboards that autorefresh frequently when they don't need to must be hunted down and shot.People who use SELECT * need reeducating again....and again. It is possible to block its use with a row policy but that can cause more problems than it is worth .One thing that shocks me with clients is that if they have budgetted X, with a bit of leeway, then they don't care if it costs significantly less.

nbbge6r,"This is the wrong way to think about this.Snowflake is a consumption based pricing model. It's not really about the size of your data at all. It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.They give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.It scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.BUTthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \*and\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.It's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.So the math is simple:DIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (""Free!\*\*\*"") + a lot of opex (""pay people to manage it"") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)PaaS/SaaS is higher capex (""Snowflake is expensive!"") + very little opex (""this thing runs itself"") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.So in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.When my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: ""When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.""PS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price.

The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values. * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows. * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred. For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year? All of this is trivial for a dimensional model and impossible for OBT. * Usability sucks with a OBT with 250+ columns * etc, etc, etc, etcFor this reason I see OBTs as an occasional early version, but dimensional models as the feature-rich mature version of most analytical databases.",kenfar,2025-08-29 00:13:25,20,dataengineering,t3_1n2qrgu,False,

nbsbhcv,"- Understanding their point of view and their background. At my company we have the chance to shadow people in other teams or other groups/departments, like a mini internship. We're encouraged to use these to understand different aspects of the company. When you understand what they do, how they're talking with their counterparts you get a better feel for what they need communicated. Alternatively, having a mentor-type person who can give you direct feedback.- Talking with people directly, asking: ""hey, I just gave you this explanation but I want to improve and want to know which information is useful to you and which one isn't. Knowing what you know now - what would the ideal explanation be for you?""- asking directly how technical the explanation should be, and adjusting on the fly.- slightly different background (R&D) but I learned that explaining the thing that happened in the order that it happened makes for terrible story telling. You need to figure out what the value is for someone, and then cut all the explanations that are not useful in, well, explaining it. That's a tough one for me because it also meant having to let go of my ego - as in: having to drop some information and explanations that I really found good / useful when they don't help in making the messageseven clearer.Maybe ""Storytelling with data"" is helpful for some situations?- I'm not saying that's the case for you but for me one big learning was that I'm probably not the most important person, and that what makes my job interesting to me is not relevant at all. It also doesn't matter whether my solution is picked - not whether it's implemented in the way that I envisioned it. What matters is that the team as a whole benefits from an idea - I had to shift to a broader view of things rather than just of me and my work. This takes self-reflection and it also takes experience. - Also, what I do is a service to others. Have a look at leaders who have a service-mentality to their leadership style and try to emulate them.Generally, what helped was direct feedback and interacting with colleagues. What worked less is trying to figure things out by reading and thinking it through - that useful sometimes but it doesn't cut through my echo chamber. What's still missing for me, some people need an explanation that's not an explanation but a story that they can digest on their level of understanding - I sometimes struggle if I have to simplify it so much that the story stops being meaningful to me.",norfkens2,2025-09-01 04:55:18,3,dataengineering,t3_1n4n346,False,

Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).Then it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer. If you want to get fancy that could be a sql database with a few tables (rankings, sites, players). It could also be a csv. Then another process to aggregate by player across sites and store in the gold layer (if you want you could automate collecting daily snapshots and analyze the change over time). That might be something like another sql table that exists to serve a dashboard.Sports is just one example, there are lots of domains where you could scrape (or otherwise obtain) multiple sources of data then (fuzzy) join and aggregate them. If you don't want to do fuzzy matching and multiple scrapers/interfaces, you could do daily snapshots of something like pokmeon card prices or the weather and aggregate across time.

The Fusion CLI binary (basically the equivalent of dbt Core but in Rust)2. The Fusion Language Server binary (a.k.a LSP)3. The VS Code extensionA language server share a great deal of code with the Fusion CLI but it's intended user is not a human in a terminal, but rather an IDE who can talk to it on behalf of the user. When you download or update the VS Code extension you might notice that in the bottom status bar it will say: ""Downloading file"" that's the extension grabbing the latest version of the Language Server from our CDN.In it there's a pretty diagram (made by yours truly) that shows that the VS Code extension has two buckets of features broken out by the binary that powers them1. **by the CLI**: running commands, previewing models2. **by the LSP**: intellisense, lineage, go to reference In a comment >So can I access the enhanced features in fusion without using the extension in another IDE?Theoretically, the Fusion LSP could be made to work with and distributed such that it could work with other IDEs like you say.

How you ought to use the layers depends on what attributes you’ve assigned to them.You may argue that one pattern is more optimal than another, but what you’re arguing for here is the standards of governance applied to each tier in the hierarchy, not the names of each tier.

Ship fast where the blast radius is small, slow down where correctness matters.* Invest in tooling mastery. Know your editor, shell, OS, browser devtools, and typing. The compounding payback is huge.* If you cannot explain why something is hard, it is probably incidental complexity. Remove that first.* Fix bugs by establishing invariants one layer deeper instead of sprinkling checks in leaf code.* Use history to debug. Read the commits, narrow the regression window, and run git bisect when the shape fits.* Bias toward shipping to get real feedback. Use pragmatic shortcuts like asserts on invariants, deferring DTOs, and skipping trivial tests when risk is low.* Make debugging cheap.

nbawgez,"Both can be hard if you are unfamiliar with them. Frontends can contain incredibly complex logic, as can backends. In my experience, finding client or server side code hard depends mostly on your familiarity with both the technologies being used, and the codebase. Once you become more familiar, they become less hard, whether frontend or backend. The complexity of backends can relate largerly to the distribution of services and their interaction with one another. This requires the ability to store a large, and complex mental model, which can be difficult. Frontends can contain complex physics based animations, or complex state interactions, which also involve having a clear mental model. Either one requires familiarity with the concepts and the codebase. If you are finding backend code harder to understanding, you'll get there.

nbc09e9,"It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:When someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their ""first"" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the ""21st"" century even though the year begins with ""20"" and not ""21"". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').In many buildings throughout the world, the ""1"" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's ""nice"" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is ""0"" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.(Side note: This ""number of floors offset from the ground"" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).Here is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a ""0"" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a ""1"" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.It might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the ""group index"" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.The above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.I'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",Phoenixon777,2025-08-29 15:34:51,31,learnprogramming,t3_1n36naw,False,

I think it just made sense to the people making compilers for various programming languages to start with the first available byte value, which is all zeros, which comes out to a decimal zero. I also suspect this is related to the limitations of early systems. Way back, programmers were trying to make use of every bit they could because so little memory was available. This is the reason for two year dates and the Y2K problem. Back at the time, programmers thought ""Hey, that's two whole bytes I could use somewhere else that could actually be useful.""

Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?The OS is not **written** in binary code. But because it is **compiled** to binary code, which the CPU directly understands, there doesn't need to be any other layer ""underneath"" it.The compiler, too, can be written in a high-level language which is compiled to machine code.> Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer? Yes, this is basically it. You can compile an OS, and you can also compile a compiler, but you have to have an existing compiler to do this. So there's a *historical* question of where these compilers came from. And the basic answer is that if you were starting from absolutely nothing, you would have to work your way up from very simple compilers/assemblers, and use those to compile more complex ones.For instance, you start out with a system that has no assembler at all. It only understands raw binary machine code, fed to it using some input method. This might be a paper tape reader, or a punched card reader, or toggle switches that let you manually enter data one bit/byte at a time.Then you write an assembler in machine code, and feed it to the computer. Now you can write programs in assembly code instead of machine code. Then you can write a C compiler in assembly language. And so on.Once you have a C compiler, you can rewrite that compiler in C instead of assembly, so that it's easier to maintain. And then it can compile new versions of itself. This is called [""self-hosting""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29).But remember, this is a *historical* account of how programming languages were ""bootstrapped"" over the last 70 years or so.

nc3n5ss,"Higher level languages get converted into machine code. Everything gets converted to machine code whether it's an OS or not. It's what the CPU understands, by definition.Generally the process goes something like this:1. You write source code: C, C++, Rust, Java, C#, Python, whatever.2. The frontend translates it into some machine oriented but still cross platform instruction set. It's usually called bytecode or intermediate representation or pcode or something like that.3. The backend eats the intermediate code and gives actual CPU instructions for your hardware.Introductory programming classes love to obsess over whether a language is ""compiled"" or ""interpreted"" but there hasn't been a difference for decades, if there ever was. People just say it's ""interpreted"" if the whole 3 step process normally happens at runtime. It's all going to machine language through some intermediate regardless.A lot of code expects to be executed in the presence of an operating system which is kind of hard to depend on if you're writing the OS in the first place. So we may have to talk about ""free-standing"" versus ""hosted"" environments if we want to make our operating system, and yes, we're more likely to talk about that in the context of a language like C that's widely used both ways and even enshrines the difference in its specification.But the real reason C and C++ (and increasingly Rust) are used for OS development is that they give you tight control over how you use memory, and there's a well established tradition of actually using that control to do things people don't typically expect to lean on other languages for. You can grab at arbitrary bytes of memory through pointers and do things that might be ""undefined"" i.e. specific to your hardware and your compiler. A lot of other languages expect that some kind of runtime environment is running under the hood, maybe including a garbage collector that cleans up memory for you, so it's more like the language tries to bring along all this infrastructure that you might want to implement yourself or do without.Also you've got to keep in mind that there are many different levels of writing an OS. There's the kernel which can be complicated in its own right. Then there can be lots of drivers, utilities, shells, and built-in apps. A lot of the ""OS"" might be more or less just normal application code running in a hosted environment.

Computer hardware and software is largely designed as a big old stack of layers, and understanding roughly what they are will help you understand things tremendously.In this case, the bit you are missing is that a computer program, once compiled, is already machine code. You write a program as a text file, the format of which is the C programming language. A special program, a C compiler, takes in this text file as input and outputs a file that contains the machine code that is equivalent to what you wrote.When you tell the operating system to run the program, it reads the file and puts the machine code section of it somewhere in memory, then points the CPU to that spot in memory and says ""run the machine code at this address."" The computer hardware, which knows how to run machine code, takes it from there.The operating system itself works the same way. You write the operating system as a C program. A C compiler compiles the operating system into machine code. That machine code gets shoved into the spot where the hardware expects the operating system to be (let's ignore how that works for the moment), and so when the computer starts, it finds some machine code and runs it.Even the C compiler works the same way! You write the compiler in C, then you turn it into machine code by running it through an existing C compiler, and now you have a nice new C compiler. You may ask ""well, where did the first C compiler come from, then?"" and that would be a great question.

nc3dog7,"Machine Code (aka binary) is what the computer processes at a hardware level. It’s the 1s and 0s you hear about. But people don’t actually write in it because it’s impossible to read and understand. Assembly is a human readable, near one-to-one translation of binary which gives programmers direct control over every bit of data and where it goes. It’s not the same as a programming language, because you’re not programming instructions, but manipulating data. Compiled programming languages like C, C++, and Java take a different approach, where instead of directly manipulating the data programmers are given access to more abstracted tools, like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and nodes. Complied languages like C still give you more control over the hardware then interpreted languages like Python, but there’s still more abstraction then you’d find in Assembly. But in the end, it’s all complied down into machine code. For clarity, compiled languages are not a step above Assembly in the sense that complied languages are complied into Assembly which is then complied into Machine Code. They’re two different branches of programming with different levels of abstraction, but both lead back to the same root. Now compilers are generally written through a technique known as bootstrapping, where the first version of a compiler is written in one language, and then the second version is rewritten in the language it’s meant to compile.For example, the first C compiler was written in Assembly, but all subsequent versions were written in C.

The C code will get complied down into machine code and run fine.That's broadly correct.One of the nice parts about C is that the language grammar is completely divorced from the standard library. This is not true for C++, but it's not that difficult to replace the portions of the language grammar that are linked to to the standard library (eg, the *new* keyword).It is entirely possible to implement some of the C standard library functions in format that is suitable for use in kernel space. For example, most kernels will have memory allocators similar to malloc (Linux has kmalloc()) and print to a kernel console.>But if OSes don't need to be written in Assembly or even binary, what does?

Unix Version 7 was the first version of Unix that was easily portable. It was ported from PDP-11 to Motorola 68K, x86, VAX, and more. Approximately 98% of the operating system kernel was written in C, the remaining 2% was platform specific assembly. One of the nice parts about C is that it easily integrates with assembly.>Are compilers written in machine code?Sometimes, but not always.C is an evolution of B. B is a stripped down and modified version of BCPL.The first C compiler was written in B. Eventually, it became self hosting such that a C compiler written in B could produce a C compiler which could compile itself, producing a C compiler written in C.The first B compiler was written in TMG, and the first TMG compiler was hand assembled using the TMG compiler specification. In other words, that compiler was written in assembly, but it was written in such a way as if it had compiled itself.>Is there something beneath that? The BIOS? Some fundamental code on the processor itself?Processor microcode. That's a different beast all to itself that programmers rarely ever need to worry about.BIOS is just a name for the startup routine and machine interface used by IBM PCs.

nc4f1oc,"A couple notes about system calls and machine code since self hosting compilers were already explained.OSes don’t use system calls because they are the subject of system calls. They exist to manage hardware and memory resources and provide them to running programs that they organize into processes and threads. A system call is when a hosted program asks the OS for something the OS has sole control over like access to the file system, a network peripheral, or the display. If you want to write an OS, part of what you’re doing is creating that management layer and providing entry points to ask for access.On machine code. If you want to know what that really is, it’s a combination of an operation code and operands. The operation code is a number representing an operation like add or and or left shift or in complex instruction sets like x86 things like moving memory around. The operands can be the numbers of temp storage registers, a memory address, or a literal number. These enter a circular buffer of registers in the cpu and feed physical mux (input selector) components that route the operation to the appropriate physical hardware and open the correct operand supplier gates so it processes the right data. It’s more complicated than that. Look up stuff like branch predictors and the Tomasulo algorithm for examples of doing multiple things at the same time and simulating in order execution. But, machine code contains the literal control switch positions to run the cpu hardware for a given clock cycle or two. It’s the only thing the cpu actually understands.Also, if you would like to viscerally experience self hosting compilers without much effort, there’s a Linux distribution called Gentoo which is irrationally interested in building everything from source. Setting it up takes days though a lot of that is waiting. You take a bootstrap configuration, build a customizable OS kernel for your exact hardware, and then experience using the supplied copy of the GCC c compiler to compile well everything in all its open source source file glory. Often you end up using the out of date copy of GCC to compile an updated version of GCC and GCLIB (and holy hell that takes all night sometimes). Now any rational person will tell you that there is absolutely no reason to build all this stuff from source yourself when the build command you’re using is the standard “gcc -o2 [whatever]” that built the compiled binary distributions, but if you’d like to see it, you can.

Say you've got a project in mind, something simple like making a little calculator app with HTML and JavaScript. Maybe you don't know how to do this at all. Well, how do you break that down? You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of. The trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up ""JS how to add 3 + 5"", look up ""JS how to add two numbers."" Then apply it to your situation. You get a little thinking involved, and you get a little better. Keep at it and it won't be too long before that kind of stuff is easy and you're struggling with harder things. And APIs?

They are really not that helpful at the stage I am at. Normally I go through the following, roughly in order: 1. Libraries. Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. 2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and ""first steps"", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. 3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow. At this stage I will probably have some questions, so I look for people who have either had the same questions and found answers, or I will look for blog posts trying to explain it. This is the only stage where I sometimes use AI, but very very rarely. I have gotten pretty good at getting to the answers with classical search engines, and getting the answers that way is normally better, since I stumble upon a lot of other information that might prove useful later. Another important skill is to find good blog posts. I blocked [medium.com](http://medium.com) completely in my browser, since it's just 95% time wasting blogs that copy and paste directly from the documentation in order to farm clicks. Self hosted blogs, especially those with a long history of similar topics, are the best. Reddit ranks somewhere in the middle. And the most interesting links get bookmarked and downloaded for offline viewing, especially all documentation I need.

nc0823b,"Some thoughts on what you have so far:I'd say 1 isn't too important, to be honest. Sometimes it's nicer to have hairy code inlined for developer sanity. Code that tries too hard to separate every little thing into a function is often much more taxing to read. It depends what you're writing. Long functions aren't intrinsically bad. Minor idealism.In 7, avoiding unnecessary assignment is fine and can be very beneficial, but this is getting into the functional realm a bit. In other styles/paradigms, and in practice, assignments are often done for readability where there wouldn't otherwise be a need to create a local to hold temporary state for the computation. Again, depends how general you're looking to be with these rules. Same with 8. Lots of useful functions will never be deterministic. E.g. a function that timestamps something couldn't be considered good here. This works fine for canned computation but can break down in real software.9 also has lots of exceptions. There are many reasons you may want an infinite loop and you rely on them often without realising. Yes, you probably don't want to write one very often in general application dev. It's more important that infinite loops don't block event loops, UI threads, don't spin-lock (unless you intend) a core, and that when errors occur in code that runs as part of the loop, they're handled properly (e.g. recovery if possible/desired) or the process exits, or device is reset etc. Sometimes there is no useful work to do outside of a loop, the whole program is a big loop, etc.I'd add:\- Function is necessary and worth the extra code. Compilers are pretty good at inlining but that doesn't help me reading the code. E.g. You rarely need to pull a single operation into a function (e.g. n << 1) or something. Just write it in place.\- Function interface is fully documented. This includes types of inputs/outputs, and full details of any possible exceptions (and their types), behaviour on error, error codes etc., what behaviour is defined/undefined for given states. Reentrancy (if it isn't, e.g. stores state elsewhere!), thread safety (if it isn't). Locks it will take on resources etc...\- Function output params are reasonably obvious too (not just input params).\- Function code is all roughly the same level of abstraction. E.g. a syscall (or C library call for a syscall) in the middle of some UI object method that handles a button click would likely be unexpected...",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-09-02 12:50:32,3,learnprogramming,t3_1n6hfng,False,
nc0c8qq,"I would question ""Avoid Unnecessary side effects"". Yes, controlling your side effects are important, but unless you're working in a functional language, things like printing and logging can be ignored 99% of the time, and the better visibility you gain into how your code functions is well worth it. If you're working in object oriented, sometimes you need a void method that operates via side effects, and that's okay. Not everything makes sense to have an output.

Although the main way to control for maintainability and correctness should actually be the testsuite.Sure we can observe various attributes that functions tend to have in a maintainable and largely correct codebase. And I think you hit some good points, but for many of these points I would actually say there is a 80%/20% or 90%/10% rule, etc. For example, X% of functions should be deterministic and Y% should be non-deterministic. And X% of functions should always terminate and Y% should loop forever.For example, when using the actor model, it is expected and useful to have exactly one forever-looping function (with exception of its shutdown mechanism) per actor. It would make sense to have all the other functions guaranteed to terminate. For other paradigms, the rules should be different. In async based projects for example, it makes sense to have rules when a function is allowed to be async. Many projects make all (or most) of their functions async by default, but that actually tends to introduce unneeded complexity.

nc0c0a7,"Idk about not looping forever. Depending on what you’re trying to do, the loop may be necessary. Also, half the point of OOP is that systems are dynamic, so having all inputs passed as parameters might be shooting oneself in the foot. I would slightly amend that to say “minimal global parameters.” Otherwise I agree, though. I like being able to match what goes in with what goes out, not having to guess which method or global parameter caused an exception because, idk, wrong type or something. I used to get so frustrated as a beginner with divide by zero exceptions and be like HOW??? WHERE? It would often be something external, and cleaning up doesn’t hurt anything. But you also sacrifice functionality. I just don’t like documentation/commenting, but you can solve a lot of problems like nan exceptions when comments draw your attention to the workflow. I honestly (besides commenting) don’t understand why I don’t have more exceptions than I do other than just building some good habits over time.Absolutely agree on unnecessary side effects. I do keep a lot of stdout printing at first so I can focus attention on the flow, but if it works, it works, and I delete all that stuff. You need it for debugging. IDE’s catch exceptions. But just because something doesn’t return an error doesn’t mean it does what you want it to do.

You want logging, don't you? This approach to writing functions is more from a functional programming language view where functions should be side-effect free, but honestly, it's a pain to accomplish that.You can strive for it, but many don't seem to care about side effects.

nbhwjmp,"It can be hard to put these into practice. You end up picking a few things and trying those out first, then slowly add other ideas. Your priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.Also, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.So, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.My advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.You can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.There's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.For example, I encountered something similar to the following: code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30Let's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.It would read better as boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) { return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 || taxCode == 30; }Even if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.The other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.If you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.There are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-30 14:31:26,10,learnprogramming,t3_1n412gy,False,

It might take a few reps before it becomes muscle memory.You can't magically obtain all the knowledge without searching for it. Even during the days of Assembly there were instruction books. Similarly for C there is the C Programming book. A valuable part of SWE is being able to go forward with what you know until you reach a point of unknown, do research, and then return.Use Google, use LLMs (avoid copy paste and over reliance here), use the official docs, use books, use everything at your disposal to fill in these gaps.If it helps you, how I program is to write down comments before I write code.

You’ve already proven you’re capable.Now, onto your concerns, what you’re describing is completely normal for someone early in their career, knowing OOP and syntax is one thing, but applying it in real-world scenarios (like writing a web scraper) is a totally different skill, and one that comes with experience.Here’s the thing:Nobody is born knowing how to use requests.get() or BeautifulSoup.find\_all(). We all looked it up the first time. In fact, most devs (even seniors) still Google syntax or check Stack Overflow or use ChatGPT. That’s not a sign of weakness, it’s a sign you’re working smart.So what are you lacking?You’re not lacking intelligence or ability, you're just missing exposure and practice with real-world problems, that’s it.Before, you didn't know what to google, now you do, and that’s growth.How to get better:Build small projects from scratch, even if you use AI or Google to help.A web scraperA to-do appA CLI tool that renames filesAfter you finish a project, try re-building it without the tutorial or chatGPT, just from your understanding. That’s where the real learning kicks in.Read code, look at open-source projects on GitHub and try to understand how other people structure and write their code.Write code every day, even if it’s 30 minutes as Momentum beats motivation.Accept that discomfort is normal, feeling lost is part of the process, every dev has gone through this.And no, you’re not useless because you used GPT, you’re resourceful! The goal isn’t to memorize everything, it’s to solve problems, and you did that... that’s being a developer!Stick with it, you’ve already come this far, this is just the next step in the journey.You can absolutely improve with effort, just keep showing up, you’ve definitely got this!",ChemicalWear6153,2025-09-03 19:42:55,10,learnprogramming,t3_1n7n7vd,False,

Your code looks like Python. So go ahead and read through the whole Python reference. You don't need to memorize it, and you can skip through stuff, but make sure you read all the function names and at least a little bit of what they do, and it will help you a lot to get some confidence and a starting point if you're looking for something. After that, pick some ""most used libraries"" (feel free to google it) and read a few examples for each, or the reference docs if you can afford to.There's no easy way, you have to go ahead and invest the time and brain cells. Again, it's not about memorizing everything, but having read stuff at least once will give you a better feeling for a language, what to find where, where to start, and some confidence.Good luck, I think the thing you're most lacking right now is confidence, and there ain't no better way to establish that than knowing that you worked hard.",griffin1987,2025-09-03 22:03:21,3,learnprogramming,t3_1n7n7vd,False,

nc4ktcz,"Nearly every modern programming language/framework still relies on text files as their input, and that will not be changing any time soon.So, the number secret when learning to code, is learning how to write these text files.That means, the student needs to type in every line of code by hand, and then try to understand what it is they just typed in. That one skill, the ability to read and write code is a big chunk of what makes a good programmer.Now why students tend to struggle with this is because, firstly this is actually hard to do, so they tend to cheat and just do lots copy and paste, telling themselves they are learning.But there are no shortcuts. To get good at programming requires being good at reading and writing code and that can only be learned by typing in all the code by hand and then trying to understand what was typed. And this requires weeks if not months of repetition (i.e. write lots and lots of code).And you don't need to go looking for some magic project to code. Stick to the basics and learn to write for loops, if statements, control statements, functions and procedures, read user input, echo their input, read for file, write to a file, access a database, read from a socket, write to a socket, spawn a process, capture its output etc. etc.And even using AI should not be an issue, but if all you are doing is using the AI code directly you will not be learning anything. If you use AI take the code it writes and type all of that code in by hand, then study the code to understand what it is doing.

nbx12s4,"Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one). The best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project. The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit. Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound. We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else. The key is the input. What a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground). This is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code). The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***. A library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox. It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks. A good example of this in JS is JQuery. They are typically very specific uses and very tiny. You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine. SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer. A game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic. Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware. In general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them. They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic. Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer. You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",kcl97,2025-09-01 22:31:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1n5x6l2,False,

You might only use a subset of it's functionality, and you might change libraries if one isn't working for you etc. (provided you've achieved loose coupling)Frameworks are more fundamental to your app. You won't change framework, you'll rewrite the app if you do. Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this. When your problem is the problem they're built to solve everything is great, and when you need to do something bespoke, it can be very difficult unless the framework provides some escape hatch. E.g. When Angular 1 was popular it had two-way binding, and you very much had to write your front end ""the angular way"" to keep everything in it's digest cycle (or whatever, it's been 10 years) or it wouldn't know state had changed etc. Digging into the same page with jquery often backfired.",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-09-01 19:16:00,2,learnprogramming,t1_nbvx5oh,False,

Take time to read documentation. Like literally block a few hours and do the reading. It's work just like typing code is work. Close your AI tabs. Writing code, especially code that you know the structure of, is a restful activity that lets your mind go through the project. letting something generate your code makes it harder to know what is going on in the project and it pushes you into constant ""debug someone elses mess"" territory. ownership of code starts with having written it. And since it takes time, this time you can spend on thinking how you would like to fit this into the project.Also don't feel bad about starting code over after having tried something out. I keep separate browser windows open, each with their own tabs. one window has all my testing work (pages where I try out the application, pages where I have data I need to enter like test creditcards and the like, or the jira issue I am currently working on.

I **highly recommend** [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) course(free/asynchronous) to get familiar with all these tools(Git, Git Hub, Java Script, node.js, HTML, CSS, not docker though). It is centered on web dev but since you want to get familiar with those tools and programing languages it is a great place to start. They break it down into sections with step by step on how to set up, what it is for, how to use with personal project based learning, you can ask for help on their Discord, and they provide links to additional readings. 1. I was also confused about Git and Git Hub less than a year ago but using The Odin Project made me understand it a lot better and why it is so useful. BTW heres an extra resource to practice Git commands after you get familiar with using it: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en\_US](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)2. You can also look into [CS50 on edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) to practice general programming skills. It is also free and asynchronous but it has less focus on tools and more on thinking and problem solving which will only help you.

That was ok for me though, because I liked the challenge and learn how things worked under the hood, like how computers manage memory with pointers and all that.Today I program mostly C# and it's a fantastic language that's quite easy to pick up and very powerful. You can also use it for Unity or Godot game engine.You can pick Java too which is very similar to C#, but I like it slightly less for some reason.Python I usually advise against as a first language, because of its dynamic typing and you might learn some things you may have to unlearn later on. On the plus side, Python is very good to know for prototyping and automation and it's very popular and you should definitely learn it at some point. I think it will be the most similar one to Lua, so if you want to try something a little more challenging and new, maybe pick something else.Definitely dm me if you would like to chat or would like a code review or something.",Backson,2025-08-28 18:16:58,10,learnprogramming,t3_1n2euhf,False,

The youtube channel ""Sebastian Lague"" has a small series about chess programming that is way more approachable than the wiki (but way less explanatory) that is also a great introduction, his code is in C# using the Unity game engine, unity has a lot of resources and is another great option, Godot is also an option. Python and javascript are the two most common ""starting languages"", i personally don't recommend starting from higher level languages as it's much easier to understand additional abstractions learning from low level languages than to unlearn them moving from high level languages, but there's plenty of resources for both, for python the best option would be probably pygame and js can just run directly in the browser.

Playing video games is being around a compute a lot, but just loving video games doesn't mean you'll be good at programming.

To a lot of us, the ""everyone else knows more and are better than me, how can I hope to keep up"" is just something our brain does that feels real but isn't, just like visual illusions and lots of other mistakes brains make. The feeling might even be mutual!1. My impression is that there seems to be something for programming that's similar to dyslexia or dyscalculia, as in, there seems to be some people who just don't get it, for reasons that appear incomprehensible to people who don't have the dysfunction. Having been an assistant in some courses, my impression is that it's very rare, but that there are some people who seem to get an experience that's a combination of [it goes in the square hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbIkNUFs-4) (as the piece-tosser, and don't understand why the girl is upset) and [computer says no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0YGZPycMEU). I think it's unlikely that you'd last several years if that applied to you.1. There are several different types of programming environments, and what clicks for someone might not for another. As in, I have small experience with [LabView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) and don't want any more, but I have a friend who loves that and detests ""ordinary"" programming.

nc8oapx,"The logic is determined by how you choose to decompose problems whose solutions can be composed into the larger solution.Keep breaking the problem down into smaller and smaller steps until you have simple conditions. Think about what you can do to move you closer to the solution. Doing this for complex problems requires experience, so start with simple problems that you can solve with your experience. Do it for years and it becomes a natural way to approach problems.This is what you do every morning when you plan out your day. If you have a meeting at 10:00, and it takes you 20 minutes to get there, you need to leave at 9:40. But if you have to stop by the post office on the way, and it will take 5 minutes you need to include that in your time. But, it also changes the time calculation since you need to go to post office, spend five minutes there, then go to meeting.So, IF you go to the post office THEN add time for travel to it, time at it, and travel from post office to meeting. ELSE you don’t go to post office and simply add the travel time to meeting.Have other errands to run in addition to, or instead of, the post office? Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it. Get to the point where you would need to have left half an hour ago? Some errand needs to be removed…then you need an algorithm to decide which one to do later, or to reschedule the meeting. That can similarly be broken down.It may seem very tedious, but this is how complex decisions are made. You take all the variables and conditions into account, at whatever level of detail is required to give an adequate solution. Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it’s ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.It is tedious.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.At the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.I examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing, select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base.

In the second one you ask what a ""beginner"" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.If you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a ""scripting"" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.If you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a ""scripting"" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.If you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.If you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java.

nc23gvs,"I take the opposite opinion. TBH I think many big tech companies were over hiring engineers for years. Even without AI, the job was getting easier due to better tooling and specialization of SaaSes. Ie a newer architecture takes significantly less manpower to maintain even at high scale compared to old architectures. I was a VP at a startup founded around 2013. Their first product took a team of 60 engineers to maintain. Our second product, built on a more modern stack, took 6 engineers and made as much revenue and processed more scale. This led to a limited refactor of the first product which removed the hardest to maintain parts, freeing up engineers to work on new things. I'm talking simple stuff - like using SQS, lambda functions, etc. Anyways I think companies are dialling in a new cost -> revenue ratio wrt to engineering resourcing. Twitter is one extreme (but not recommended) example of this, ie everything thought it would crash and burn and yeah, there were a few pains, but overall the service stayed up with a third of the engineers. Google/Meta have also done a ton of reorgs, and while some of those are layoffs, a lot of them is reshuffling people to new team and new bets because less people needed to work on each products. Anyways it's all first hand thoughts and super anecdotal. I just don't see why people would go back to hiring as much as they did with the salaries as they were.

Go onto LinkedIn, filter by recently added, apply to pretty much anything relevant with under 100 applicants. The lower the better. Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. 2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. 3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. ""Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%""). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.4.

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.Look at what you wrote:>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.This is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, ""why don't you just talk to him?"" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.You will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.You should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.So many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.The dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy.

There is light at the end of the tunnel, it just takes a while sometimes. I sent out over 1000 resumes and only got 4 responses. Send out as many as you can.

I was completely in panic mode and had a ton of anxiety around it. I’ll tell you what i did that helped me the most. I immediately got my resume updated and reformatted it. I used the pragmatic engineer’s template. Some here may frown on this, but asking ChatGPT for help writing bullet points was helpful for me. Not your entire resume, but just help summarizing things you want on your resume. Apply for unemployment. It’s there for things like this, use it. Reach out to your network. Nothing panned out for me within my network but reconnecting and chatting with colleagues was massively beneficial to my mental health. If you’re anything like me, it’s easy to think “im not a good developer, I’ll never convince another company to hire me”. Meeting with former colleagues and friends and hearing from them what I was good at and that I’m a good developer helped a ton. Start applying. I used LinkedIn (avoid easy apply. I’m convinced those are ghost jobs and scams) and Indeed. I kept a spreadsheet of places i applied. Mostly for my personal use but it does come in handy when filing your weekly UE certification. In my state, they require 5 weekly job search activities. Having this info handy makes it easier to file. While applying, spend time learning or working on interview prep. Have your story prepared and ready. Recruiter screens will usually be a general history of you and a high level overview of your experience. Be prepared to explain anything that might raise questions in your resume, good and bad. I used ChatGPT for technical prep. It was a massive help. Once you land technical interviews (and you will soon with your experience), use ChatGPT to help you prep. I pasted the job description into chatGPT and asked it to give me technical interview questions based on it. You’ll also want to read Glassdoor reviews for the company you’re interviewing with. I wouldn’t have gotten the job i have now if i hadn’t done that. I learned they place a very high value on your “why join (company)” and going back to the prep, having that answer practiced and ready was massively helpful. I was laid off early May and started my new job, that is better in every way, at the end of June. While it’s true the job market is tough right now, it’s still pretty good for mid+ level devs. I got a decent amount of interest and actually landed a job I never thought I could get. You also might look into contracting with your local/state government. There were a bunch of those in my area that would be perfect as an in between while you find something more permanent. Lastly, just know that your worth as a person isn’t based on your job or title. I learned that I placed way too high of value on my job and being a provider for my family financially. Being able to step back and be that parent who’s there for the family and provides value in other ways helped me be a better dad and husband.

But it is a legit point that anybody in his position should be considering. He himself said he changes jobs every couple of years and doesn't have ""expert level"" (which might just be mid that he thinks is ""expert"") in any one language. The odds seem high he's fallen into the classic trap of 6x 1YOE rather than having 6YOE? If so, then no wonder he's struggling badly in mid level interviews in this current job market. Thus this is an aspect he needs to urgently address, but we can't even get to the point of discussing how to do this, if he won't even discuss it as a possibility.Edit 2, to reply to u/Azureflames20:> I feel like if you’re someone who takes this much offense to a valid possible criticism, there’s some bigger ego issues to work on and squish.Yeah I'd bet money on the fact he doesn't just have technical skills he needs to work on, but is lacking in soft skills areas as well, that are likely coming through during the interviews.Edit 3, a reply to u/mariogario123:> So why is someone who stuck around for 6 years going to be knowing more than someone who jumped every, let’s say, 1.5 years. Am certainly not saying 6yrs is the optimal time to stay at a company! (from the employee perspective... )But if you're jumping every year or two, then do you truly get to see the full entire SDLC? And thus truly feel the ramifications of the decisions that are made way back at the start. Or are you jumping too early every time to learn the lessons? Don't think we can say there is one magic ""optimal number"", depends so much on: the person, the company, market conditions, and more.Edit 4, a reply to u/evanescent-despair:> So what should someone who’s jobless even do if they have a 6x 1YOE situation?Well, first of all they need to recognize it, as then it is easier to come up with a plan to fix it. They might even find this realization freeing. As if you're 6YOE deep into a career, you might feel yourself ""stuck"" in it with ""golden handcuffs"" (or at least silver plated handcuffs). And you can't just give this up and take a big drop / step back into a new career instead. However, if you're just at 1YOE into it reality, then it's much easier to decide upon a career pivot?While if they *do* decide to stick with it, they need to figure out their strengths and weaknesses, so they can play to their strengths and patch up their weaknesses to at least competent mid level. Because they need to quickly be able to ""fake"" being mid/senior level and even better in the long run *actually become* mid/senior level ability.

nb8uda9,">and expect not to google anything at allThis hasn't been my experience at all.... Sure, few interviews let me *literally* Google (some have, I just have to let them know I'm doing it), but every other interview has always made it very clear that I'm welcome and encouraged to ask syntax questions to the interviewer.No interviewer I've worked with has ever been caught up on if I remember `.length` vs `.length()` (which I still get caught up on because of my heavy Java experience and my kinda recent transition to Node/Typescript). Nobody cares if I've memorized any of the syntax of the language I'm programming in. They care that I can program. That's why they're willing to answer syntax questions, which I've asked many times, and gotten offers from.I also don't recall a company that *forced* me to use a specific language. Hell, back in the pre-covid days we all whiteboarded in pseudocode anyways. But since I've been doing remote interviews, companies have always made it clear I was allowed to program in the language I was most comfortable in. Again, nobody's paying attention to syntax memorization, they want to see me solve a problem via logic. Not rattle off something memorized that the worst programmer in the world could memorize.Same for BE vs FE.... My current company is an example. I knocked the BE interview portion out of the park. I killed it. Then I got to the FE portion in React.... and I didn't do too well. I had to ask *a lot* of syntax questions, needed some nudging, some hand holding, and I didn't even finish the whole interview before time ran out.And yet, they gave me an offer. My resume made it very clear I'm mostly a BE developer, I made that very clear in the HR interview, I made that very clear in the HM interview. They knew what to expect, they just asked the FE questions as a formality. It may very well be the case that you're not doing as well as you think you are in the Java interview. That, or you're not making it clear that your strength is BE/Java, and not FE/React.I'm just surprised your experiences interviewing are literally polar opposites of mine.

I think we are in the early stages of a recession, combined with us having high interest rates and over hiring in pandemic has made the job market really tough for entry level talent. I don't think tis going to get better in 1 to 2 years. However, what I do think is that tech and CS is not going way. My personal educated guess is that there will be new types of roles emerging that will be more like product person + roles. Essentially where you would be expected to do project managing plus software development with AI tools. I don't think software engineering that requires extensive OOP experience are going anywhere. I think AI is going to make certain areas of tech explode that people aren't thinking about enough today. The biggest one is I think cyber security, fraud detection etc. The thing is the tools that tech has pushed the last ten years (AI, Crypto, Payment servies like cash apps) are eco systems that have encouraged sophisticated criminal activity and thats only going to grow. That also means the opposite is true jobs meaning to minimize fraud risks, protect data are probably going to grow.People talk about AI automating jobs, but most of the people doing the talking have never even sat in a labor economics or macroeconomics course. AI is the type of technical innovtion that compliments the skills of some workers and replaces the skills of others. USually what these type of technologies replace are repetitive tasks. So the more your job is doing the same repetive task (i.e. generating the same reports/analyitcs over and over again) the more likely that job is replaced by AI. This is why I think the future is being more in the product type roles (which are the ones getting laid off the most). However, these jobs will evolve into something like product + software, instead of just product,I also think the industries in general are going to reward people who think outside fo the box and push creative boundaries. AI is very good at creating simple designs.

I've directly been told by middle management to ""accelerate"" certain projects because other initiatives got approved, and that meant ripping our existing juniors off and re-staffing them on other work.That means as an engineering manager, that you no longer want to hire juniors. There is really nothing you can do - because the roles don't exist in certain companies now.

nc4k7jg,"Work life balance is subjective. That's why asking directly about it doesn't work.A company that demands everyone work for *only* 60 hours a week instead of 80 hours week could truthfully claim that they have a good work life balance. And they do, relative to that other company.That, and if you're asking questions that have an objectively right answer, of course they can just lie. They know the answer you're looking for. ""Do you have a good WLB?"" --> ""Yep!"". Easy peezy.Instead, you have to ask questions about the things that in your opinion make up a good work life balance. Questions that don't have objectively correct answers.For example, a favorite one of mine is to ask them to tell me about a time when the team was missing a deadline, and what was done in reaction. There is no ""right"" answer to that question. It's also asking about a *specific anecdote*, so people are much less likely to lie about that, and if they try it's much harder to come up with a good story-lie on the spot.If an interviewer said something like ""The team really came together and rallied to hit the deadline despite all odds"" for example would be a good answer to some people. To me? Red flag. That means when the team gets bad deadlines, they do crunch time to make up for it. The answer *I'm* looking for is something about dialing back scope, extending the deadline, or allocating more resources. Those are green flags. That indicates management knows how to do project management 101, and developers aren't asked to work long hours to make up for unrealistic deadlines.Another example, I like to ask about how frequent after-hours production support calls are. This gives me insight into product stability, and in turn what the on call rotation will look like.Again, there isn't really an objectively correct answer to this question. Everyone might be looking for different answers. I remember one time I asked this question to the hiring manager, and he got this big grin on his face and said they only get called after hours 1-2 times a month. He genuinely thought that was a good thing. Maybe it is compared to a place like AWS, but what *I* was looking for was a stable product that only gets after hour calls 1-2 times ***a year***.

Doesn’t need to be huge, what matters is having some results and something public to point to, or offer your skills to NGOs you care about, there's a platform called catchafire, that's skillbased volunteer matching, nonpaid of course, but if matched, you get to work on a real project, tbh, if you have a cause that you want to help out, just reach out to the local ngos, they would mostly likely love to have you and didn't even have the HR capacity to run and recruit proper internships prograns or you can look into job simulations experiences from forage or springpod, they're pretty much the same, 2-3 hours long program in different fieldds for you to test out and list on resume, not work experience, but as ECA or project experience, low impact but very low investment so still pretty good ROI, or the longer externships, they're mostly 8-12 weeks, proper professional experience that supports backgorund checks, but you need to actually do 50-80 hours work on the platform to list this on your resume as work, you might learn something while donig it, and they’re short, flexible, and give you real-world bullet points fast. and don’t limit yourself into SWE only. Apply to product analyst, technical program manager, ops/automation roles or data, they overlap a ton with software and can get your foot in the door, pay and outlook probably less than top SWEs, but at this point, I would say anything in tech would be a win, later, pivoting back to SWE is much easier once you’re “inside.”one last probably bad idea but good if you have the money, if you’re strong academically and open to it, a master’s can reset your “new grad” status, that puts you back in campus recruiting pipelines with way better odds, think if you can get into CMU for machine learning, that's a totally difference picture now",Dangerous_Squash6841,2025-09-02 08:44:35,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1n3j4il,False,

nb5tbs6,"Context: Currently a mid level SDE working in big tech inCanada, have been for my entire career (6 years).First, idk if UBC is definitively 2nd in Canada lol but its definitely one of the universities competing for 2nd with McGill and UofT. I can't speak much for ML, but I work in a team with over 50% of the engineers being MLEs. Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. There are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. Downside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. That being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29.

Do what you can to stand out from the competition. Don't wait until you get your bachelors degree, don't wait until you get your master's, start *now*. Everyone applying for the same job as you has a degree (mostly). Build something and put it somewhere hirers can see, prove that you can do the job that you want. UBC is a good school, but honestly most company's don't care where you graduated from. Having a strong resume is 100x more valuable than the school you graduated from.**Apply for CO-OP's/Internships**. Realistically this is the best way to get a job when you graduate. Get an internship and do a good job. Not only does this gain you real world experience that can go on your resume, but you pretty much get a 4-8 month interview where you can prove to the company that you would be useful as a permanent employee and hopefully you have a job when or before you grad. **Finding a job is a numbers game**. Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense). Maybe take a job at a small unknown company for a few years and view it as an opportunity to learn.

Everyone I graduated with ended up fine. This includes people who did stuff like polisci.Recessions and slow job markets come and go, the entry level job market sucks right now everywhere and its not good in any field.The last thing is I would have a healthy degree of skepticism towards what people say in tech about their own job market. The field is very prone to coming up with stories and drinking their own koolaid. You will read everywhere about AI, but reality is you have several compounding factors that makes the job market suck right now. This includes high interest rates, which effects tech more than other industries as that means there is less startup money and financign out there, over hiring during the pandemic, general economic uncertainty due to tariffs and current immigration system in the u.s.

You are going to one of the best universities in the world and its academic brand is extremely strong. As long as you can keep your grades up, pretty much every graduate school is fair game for masters and paths to any university exist for Ph.D. (this is not always true).

Coding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it).

That all goes towards how affordable and scalable a codebase may be. And ""stability"" strictly from a codebase perspective (ignoring infra) is again mostly a human concept. How bug free is it, how easy is it to catch *human mistakes* that create bugs before they get released. And it ties back to extensibility, how easily can features be added without accidentally introducing regressions that slip into prod.Unit, integration, and regression testing are *all* concepts built to catch *human mistakes*.

However, if you’re working alongside other Seniors and they’re not doing the level of team management you’re doing, then it might be beyond what a Senior does at your org. Similarly, are there other Leads around that you can compare with? If your org doesn’t have Leads, that’s a very different situation.There are a lot of different implementations of this. At some places, a Lead is a line manager. Other places, you have a Tech Lead, who is essentially a particular archetype of Staff, but people stuff is handled by someone else. At some places, there’s what’s called a “Tech Lead Manager”, which is sort of in between the two – usually they have project-level accountability and input into performance discussions, but maybe they don’t do salary review, etc.One useful way to frame this is, “I’m enjoying the work I’m doing to lead (or ‘help lead’) the team, and I’d like to talk about my growth path. How close would you say I am to being a Lead Software Engineer, and what are the areas I need to put in work to get there? Can we plan out that journey so that I’m doing the highest impact things?”Basically, it gets you a lot more information while looking really good and not coming off as a squeaky wheel. A lot of the other ways to approach this can come off as whiny / demanding, which can be totally fine, but is sometimes not fine… and is often not fine for reasons that you don’t have visibility on. Framing it as about your growth gets your leadership thinking about ways to grow you lest they lose you, but in a non-confrontational way. Also, if there’s something fundamental that you’re missing, you’re better off knowing before you spend a year wondering why you’re not being promoted.Depending on your relationship with your boss / skip-level boss, that might be a good conversation to have with both of them.",flamingxmonkey,2025-09-01 17:16:36,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1n5u2iw,False,

nc7xv3g,"Building confidence in this market requires focusing on what you can control rather than external factors. Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.For quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.The harsh reality is that ""quickly"" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.Focus on financial preparation over trying to become ""layoff-proof"" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.Consider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.The confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring. The market has normalized into something more similar to other professional fields, which means standard job search strategies and realistic timelines matter more than they used to.",g2i_support,2025-09-03 16:44:16,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1n79rai,False,

Find research that interests you and that you actually want to explore - then do good work and have something to show for it. Having an interest in the field you are researching will aid in that ""do good work"" part.
