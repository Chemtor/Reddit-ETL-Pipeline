Yet, none of them really solve the core data issues like nulls, duplicates, redundancy and many more. The simple and old school style of sql, bash scripts and crontab jobs can do much more than fancy tools. It makes feel like we all should go back to roots using pure sql for most part for pipelines processing and maybe little bit of Python here and there.

Some DEs are also good at devops and web development, which opens them more opportunities.Another point is that I feel that those titles are overlapping and that a well-rounded DE can apply to multiple of those. I do understand it is impossible to find perfectly independent categories for this kind of studies. Namely, in the same order as the diagram: - big data specialist- DWH specialist- data analyst- data engineer- database professional- BI analystThe fact that big data specialist comes before DE, although a DE is in general considered a big data specialist, may just show how the DE title still lacks recognition.

It should, should, execute in the time, a full table scan completes, so on 500mm rows, maybe 5-10minutes, dont know the hardware setup.Reasoning behind that statement : Variable length string, that is just in the table meta data. Actual data is written to data pages. So EXPANING the length, should not cause a full page rewrite of a given page, since nothing needs to get rewritten. Already existing page splits, are not effected either, its already a pointer to another page.So, it should be rather harmless, to change the variable length, as long as it gets increased. Decreasing the length, I'd be a bit more careful, but should functionally behave the same. Not having a clustered index... it should not affect that change, since if I know how mssql works internally, it will check every row, if it complies with ""new column meta data"", so a full read trough of the entire table. It doesn't matter in reality, if that table is a heap or a clustered index for a full scan.I'd say, plan for a couple of minutes of outage, and go for it. Take a full backup to a testing stage, run the change, to get a good idea of how long you got an outage. You will have a short outage, since you will have a full table lock, and any application trying to write to the table, will wait for that lock to be released.

I agree with the comments about consulting mostly, but I doubt they would put you on client work or at least throw you to the wolves like they would with an employee. Having worked both for telcos and consulting, I will give you some thoughts:Consulting: you will probably work on one or a few projects. They are looking for prospects to hire when you graduate so it's like an extended evaluation. Consulting is good because you get exposure to different industries and projects, so you learn skills and approaches you might not pick up working elsewhere. One other thing that's maybe overlooked is that you learn how to sell and explain your work, which is valuable in companies later when you need to justify a project or hype it up beyond just explaining the technical side. Working there as an employee though can be grueling not just because of the hours, but because you need to build your career often with little help. They assign you to some client and expect you to pick up the skills you need. They usually do give you some support with a mentor role, but they might be good or just suck since they are assigned. So it can be a stressful experience depending on your personality and resiliency.Telcos: this is a good option because you will get exposure to a lot of processes with a lot of data flowing. It's mostly structured though, but really teaches you how to deal with high volumes. If we are talking a bigger telco like AT&T or whatever then they tend to have all the tools and applications so you aren't looking at a kludged together mess like in some other companies. There is data stored around all the different processes that go on in a telco, so while the product isn't the data platform, it's probably as close as you are going to get.

n6jpuu1,I think the majority of the criticism in these articles is saying iceberg is bad for transactional workflows which it is. Additionally it offers no alternatives,ReporterNervous6822,2025-08-02 16:16:14,24,dataengineering,t3_1mfrvpt,False,
n6lqpxm,"Holy shit this is such a misleading and confused take. Not least right off the top the idea that transactions are meant to be row inserts. You’re doing it wrong. A transaction is intended to be a single large block of rows. To wit contention is intended to be low.Taken together, that you think iceberg is a transactional database is your main problem. The design desire of iceberg is to be able to have atomic writes to disk from ephemeral stateless writers for the purpose of retaining and accessing large amounts of data for long periods of time. Any alternative not involving optimistic concurrency necessarily involves a single stateful system that needs to be on for as long as the data needs to be accessible which is absurdly dumb and massively expensive. The only reason databases and database servers exist is to literally provide a lock. To the degree you can avoid locks you can cut massive cost by making the computer independent of the retention process. Don’t get me wrong iceberg is very rough around the edges and leaves a lot to be desired but that you neither understand why it exists or what it’s good for wouldn’t be something I’d publish this widely on the internet.",TheRealStepBot,2025-08-02 22:57:37,21,dataengineering,t3_1mfrvpt,False,
n6m1my6,"The author continues their absolutely-detached-from-reality rant against Iceberg. They've essentially looked at a sledgehammer and decided that it is 'not a serious tool' because it requires more effort, is more unwieldy, and lacks a claw compared to a regular hammer.The article indicates it is a 21 minute read, so I'm going to be somewhat brief here, but essentially other than various truisms the entire thing can be broken down. The article is also quite sarcastic and derogatory, which gives me the impression that the author is more interested in puffing themselves up than earnestly engaging with the problem space.I'll pick a few things that are emblematic of the disconnect between the author's basis for criticism and what iceberg is actually for.---> It also means that the overhead of each file is large (in the order of 1KB).Iceberg (and DeltaLake/Hudi, I'll not mention again) is intended for storing many gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes of data in a given 'table' -- a few KB of overhead is going to be less than 0.001% of the data you're actually reading or writing. You'll likely have more overhead within the parquet files themselves if they've been split relatively small, and your choice of compression algorithm is going to have orders of magnitude more impact.> Putting the burden on the clientThe entire point of the base layer of 'lakehouse' implementations is to decouple storage from the compute. That is: *there is no server* to even consider to be 'putting the burden on the client'. You may as well complain that trains have to run on rails.> If clients need to write manifest lists that point at all Manifest Files - we have already leaked the location of every single S3 file worth stealingThe path to an S3 file is not sensitive data, it is protected through access control to the bucket. You may as well complain that clients connecting to databases leaks the IP of the database.Iceberg is not intended to solve row-level security for you in the same way that parquet does not solve row level security. It simply isn't in the scope of what it is trying to solve, because it isn't seeking to replace a database.> Did we not learn in CS 101 that if you need O(n) operations to append to a list, you are probably doing something wrong?This section completely ignores something that the author *should* know quite well, that sometimes you exchange processing time for space consumption. For metadata files the repeated data is utterly insignificant compared to all the other reads and writes that are happening, but because we're dealing with remote storage accessed over a network then when reading it is much more efficient to retrieve a single larger block of data than make many individual requests.In fact the author later whinges that a query has to do sequential 2 metadata reads to locate the parquet files it needs - so they *do* understand the benefit of compacting data together, but they just choose to ignore that in this instance so that they can heap more derision on Iceberg.> Optimistic Concurrency - Why it does not work! ... is there ever a point to optimistic concurrency control? ... In Iceberg, two concurrent writes to a table will ALWAYS be in conflict A section in which the author almost realises they may be lacking some perspective, but plows on ahead anyway.First of all, Iceberg is considered about the overall efficiency for readers and writers that are operating in completely isolated processing environments, and when writing data they are going to be writing a *lot* of data and it may take a relatively long time (seconds to minutes). A complete pessimistic lock would prevent concurrent non-conflicting writes, which means you could only ever effectively have one writer to a table, which would be an unnecessary restricting if you have pure-append ingestion processes, and pure-append ingestion processes are very common in lake/lakehouse implementations.And yes, you can have non-conflicting *data* writes even if the metadata writes are conflicting, but as I've mentioned in here the metadata is insignificant compared to the data in intended use cases. Getting a writer to rewrite even a 1MB metadata file is a significantly better tradeoff than having them sit idle for many seconds to minutes, when their compute runtime is costing you money. And that's if they even get a conflict - subsecond timings on completion of concurrent writes is pretty rare for the intended use cases.> ""Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently"".Complete bullshit. My largest tables are either full snapshots taken periodically from sources, or they use streaming ingestion with buffered writes. In fact streaming ingestion is directly a use-case for optimistic concurrency - each partition can have a separate writer and they can all write data concurrently and commit periodically.> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?Absolutely unhinged criticism. The target format is parquet and the default row group size for writers is on the order of 100k to 1M rows. To hit a required 1k commits/sec you'd be looking at ingesting >100M rows/sec and 100GB/sec of *compressed* data while having each individual parquet file be committed one-by-one with a thousand independent writing processes.What you would *actually* do is have a partitioned writer that has 1000 concurrent parquet writes, and it commits once per second. The author is just *inventing* problems.> Intermezzo: Iceberg REALLY does not want to be a databaseThen why are you critiquing it like it is one?This is ridiculous.

n7ib8sb,"I really fall into the camp that DE isn't really an entry level position. Not everyone sees it this way. You are doing a Masters in CS - honestly you can pick up a lot of good skills towards DE by working first as a software engineer and working around data systems. People tend to get into DE either down a software engineering route and specialising in software or as a data analyst/scientist transitioning into more pipeline and modelling work.The main obstacle I see to a new entrant into DE is just the breadth of technologies and tools out there, for mid level roles we can find candidates who have worked on our tech stack and junior jobs are incredibly competitive as its a hot job title right now. We are in the middle of hiring a DE and we had over 250 applications for one open position. I've been doing DE for just over 3 years, after 5 years as a software eng after doing a PhD in Engineering. To answer your questions:How early to start applying? If you are doing something super data based then maybe a year or two after starting your first position. This would allow you to get in and really get to know a specific database and understand how to operate in a development environment. If you're also doing personal development and learning on what you're interested in then it could work.Are certs worth it? I believe they can be useful for getting your baseline but they aren't something I have chased. I would very much do it on a case by case basis. If you start at an employer they might require you to get certain certifications and they would pay for them.What helped the most? I joined a team which was pretty small, mostly focused around data science. My programming skills were really solid but my database skills were not great. I was able to learn enough database work to get through the door and focused my effort on using software experience to really push standards in the team and improve confidence.What would I not waste time on? I don't know. I don't think doing the PhD was the best use of my time but I can't go back and change that so I'm happy enough with the result. DE wise, as I've specialised into data I already had a solid foundation. There are technologies and prototypes which were a waste of time but there isn't really anything I would regret.I appreciate this might not be the sort of feedback you were wanting to get, I am only one person and there are different thoughts around how easy it is to break into DE.

That just means with ELT get the data loaded into the database before transforming it. Vs the somewhat older method of manipulating (transforming ) the data before loading it.The advantage of ELT is you can quickly compare data between the source and your table (row counts, data types, etc) and not have to figure out if you transformed it wrong before loading it.Once loaded, you typically only need SQL but could also use Python to read the data from your “raw” tables and write it back to an “intermediate” or “analytics” table.

n6xog97,"ETL vs ELT is a form of shorthand.Rather than neatly dividing data processing into two types; it encourages you to think about the steps.Extraction, is typically ""given"". You're generally bound by the transfer rates of the source and they provide the data in whatever format they choose. It's always going to come first.Loading, is a more variable step. You're still bound by the properties of the target storage. But since you choose what you're writing you have some more control of the process.Transformation is extremely variable. You usually have a lot of freedom in deciding how you transform the source data into target data. That includes breaking up the transformation into multiple steps.Moving from ETL to ELT is more about breaking up the T than it is about actually saving it to the end. The actual process is typically more like ET1L1T2L2T3L3...T1 is often limited to very simple transformations; de-duping and some light error checking is common. Then it gets written to disk in ""raw form"". We keep this work light so it can be fast and reliable. Since real systems have errors, we want to keep this simple so we minimize the chance of dropping data.T2 typically cleans the data. That typically takes more work since we're looking at the data more carefully and changing it more. We then write that to disk too since there are many different things we might do next.T3+ are typically curation steps that answer specific business questions. They can be very expensive to calculate (there are often dozens of JOINS going many layers deep) and they often drop data (often for speed or security) so we want to keep those older versions too. These final versions also get stored so the business users can access them quickly.None of this makes much sense in small systems. They're techniques that are used in ""big data"". I would practice the basic tools (SQL, Spark, Python, etc) and supplement that by reading case studies on data deployments.

n6lxih5,"A REST API is a pull-based request/response interface (kinda like using HTTP to query a database). My understanding is that Pulsar is a push-based publish-subscribe model (like if you subscribed to someone’s Substack email newsletter). You therefore need a translation interface to perform the pull from the API and then publish it in the appropriate stream or message queue format to Pulsar. You may need something similar between Pulsar and Ceph as well; I’m not familiar enough with Pulsar to say. Unless your API fetcher has the ability to also write to object storage, your first point of storage appears to be the post-Pulsar Ceph so would be there. Ideally you want to create that archive copy as close to the source as possible, so it’s determining where the storage opportunities are in your flow.

If you're very strong in all aspects of SQL (Joins, CTE's, order of execution, etc), then you're solid for a DE role. Now focus on data modeling which is very hard skill to get good at even after years of experience and many fail interviews even at senior levels, it's unfortunate truth but it is what it is. Take some Udemy courses, watch YT videos on dimensional modeling. There are plenty of free project YT videos on building pipelines. Since you're good with Oracle, start there for a valid certificate that you think can relate to DE role, even a data or solution architect certificate would be good on resume but experience always precedes certificates. Learn distributed compute and storage (Snowflake, Databricks), one is fine. Databricks has uphill learning curve compare to snowflake. Pickup little bit of cloud (AWS or Azure), one is fine since the concepts can be applied across. Google cloud isn't very popular compare to the other two. You can also pickup cloud related skills on the job, doesn't have a steep learning curve. If you're aiming for FAANG, then you'll need to learn DSA (Python works). I hate this part cuz even though much of what is asked in interviews is not used in the job, it's still required to learn coz big companies use this technique to eliminate bad or not so good candidates. DE sometimes feels like a multi-skill role, but even today, lot of heavy lifting is done using SQL.

n7g9nd3,"A ""data perspective"" btw - another guy wrote about the messaging part, also valid.SCD is slowly changing dimension, and there are type 1, 2 & 3 - then hybrid variations depending on how old the design was.In modern times, we simply use SCD2 or SCD Type 2, which is row-based tracking of the business key - what makes a row unique and never changes, and tracking changes to the data portion, what does change over time.A good example is a credit score, ship to address, customer address.Some ERP systems have SCD2 tables labeled as \_HIST or \_History, but for DW purposes, we break down information from top-down, then bottom-up, then build what is missing in the middle as layers of transformations.So if you tie sales to geography and your customers are the general public, they move a lot, so you need to track at-that-point-in-time where they lived. A transformation would be calculating longitude & latitude for that address, that the X & Y coordinates don't exist in the source system.So the world of DW is easily a year full-time university course, of course lots of courses online too.So... At least once... A relationship between to tables, inner join or left join. In DW world you avoid left joins like the plague, unknown data will actually have a pre-defined value.This is domain / entity specific, like when you specify 1-to-1, 1-to-many, 1-to-0. So at least once would be 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.If you load a product table and a sub-table is color, another is category and sub-category, depending on the (various) sources you can have a product with no color, no category or sub-categ, you must assign a value for the missing data, so that INNER JOIN always works.So you'd have a DIM\_PRODUCT\_CATEGORY with a surrogate key and business value 'UNKNOWN' or 'NOT DEFINED' even though in the source system that category doesn't exist.You have to remember that DWs are report orientated and tools like PowerBI and the analysts using them will not appreciate having to render NULLs and won't be happy with missing sales numbers.",SirGreybush,2025-08-07 17:18:14,3,dataengineering,t1_n7g2iif,False,

This website doesn't deal with finding a job, but is great for knowing \_what\_ to learn in many technologies and career paths: [https://roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python) . If you don't have direction, that gives you it. Also join smaller online communities where daily discussions happen, so you can see not only what's in the tutorials and curated content, but how things work day-to-day.Skill itself is not enough to find a job. Yes, the market is much tougher than it was 5 years ago, but programming is still the right choice if you have the brains for it. It's going to take hard work to get a job, but the value/effort ratio is much higher than that for other jobs. The best case scenario is to know someone that can introduce you to the right company: trust and a feeling of community are valuable to companies that know what's good for them. So see if you, your family, or your friends know someone like that. Even if they don't have an opening, they may introduce you to further connections of theirs. Listen to their advice and don't take anything for granted.If you can't find that person, it's time to polish your CV and hit the job boards. If you're not at all comfortable with your skill level, aim for \*\*PAID\*\* internships. You might need to apply to hundreds of jobs. It's going to feel like a slog, but it's worth it. Be respectful, definitely don't let AI write your application or emails, the lack of effort is noticed. Many companies won't notice a presence of effort either, but you're better off without them. When you see a company you really like, try to prototype an open source project in the same domain as their product, and put it in the application. Best case scenario they see the effort and dedication, and they'll know you can be valuable to them, worst case scenario you have one more small project in your portfolio for the next company you apply to. There was a period where being disruptive and extra casual gave you a leg up, we're no longer in that period: be respectful (don't confuse this with submissive) and professional. Remember the people on the other side are people too, and if you can make their life easier by being honest and not making the interview/email tough for them, they're more likely to want you as a team mate.Best of luck, and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.",towc,2025-08-03 14:05:58,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mgdw2w,False,

Hoping to skirt by with one language or framework is pretty naive IMO in 2025. You're constantly juggling these things for the best outcome in my experience. Like, a project might use python libraries with C under the hood, that gets served to users via javascript frontend. 3) Technical barriers are not lowering, they're rising if anything.

n7eu5jf,"Fundamentals for DSA and languages are important probably moreso than ever.For example, if you prompt copilot in javascript with something like `function quicksort(nums) {` it will almost always output the wrong answer. It looks like quicksort but its a very inefficient implementation of it. Usually it will create new partition arrays and concatenate at the end which is very slow and not ""quick"" like it implies in the name. The proper implementation is done in-place. If you are solid in DSA and coding fundamentals, even if you don't know the quicksort algorithm, you will probably be able to look at it and realize that allocating a bunch of new memory each recursive iteration is very inefficient. Almost all sorting algorithms implementations are done in place since speed is very important.That said I think AI has huge potential value in acting as a teacher and mentor if prompted the right way. My recommendation would be to turn off copilot, don't use cursor or any codegen, and prompt it to not give any code examples. A prompt like 'I want to study binary search as if I'm reading a textbook, from first principles and with theory, without many real code samples, in order to learn it through and through. Be as verbose and long form as possible' . The output of that prompt is actually pretty good stuff, it was trained on textbooks so get that level of information from it like you're taking a class on it.A soft skill I would add to that is to learn how to learn. Ask probing questions. Seek to understand at a deep and innate level. Ask for explanations in different ways and analogies that help you understand better.

No one here can tell you if your approach is good FOR YOU.In principle, your approach seems not bad. You should keep in mind as you go through these exercises that no matter how many repositories you comb through, you will only ever be touching the tip of the iceberg. The world of software development has more ways of doing absolutely everything than you can shake your fist at, and you will never become an expert by just looking at other people's work.I suggest as you go through these exercises, instead of trying to rebuild the same thing you just observed from scratch, establish a cadence of identifying problems that can be solved or improvements that can be made with code. While reviewing repositories, take notes. Then, when using the concepts you discovered in these repositories in your own solutions, do not allow yourself to look at the repositories at all. Instead, look at your notes.And remember as you go through this that it is not recreating other people's solutions that makes a great developer. I understand you're just trying to get started, and that's fine. But be aware that at some point you will want to detach completely from the example repositories and make an effort to implement a novel idea without any example to guide you.

n72ludf,"Guided projects or starting simple makes far more sense. You want to learn the skill of WHY you're coding something, not HOW to code. How to code comes out of having a need that prevents you from attaining or achieving something that you want. Figure out the why, and the how will come with experience. With your approach, you don't know why code is written in a certain way, or why code is written at all in a project to some extent. It's a lot easier to learn when you know what the end objective is, and what success looks like. It's a measurable, achievable milestone, rather than aiming at some amorphous end point that isn't anchored to the amount of experience and know-how you have.An analogy; if you play chess for the first time, you may think that a good approach to play is to just capture as many pieces as possible. Unfortunately, chess isn't so simple. An 1800 ELO player is going to make moves that a 400 ELO player simply cannot even begin to understand the justification for, even if they understand the how, which was simply to move a piece legally. So you might be able to go into a mature code base that people acknowledge as being well-written. But you have no idea why it was written in that way, the intentions, the problems faced, the historical context. And if you can't figure out the why, then I might as well hire an LLM over you, because they at least know the HOW even better than a human, even if they have no idea WHY they're writing code in a certain way for a certain purpose.",HotDribblingDewDew,2025-08-05 15:50:19,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mia1yc,False,

How do I invoke build tools?).**Python is very good at simplifying some of this**. The ""learning a specific programming language"" part of it is pretty simple, and the development context is easily simplifiable (it can get complicated in real-life deployment situations, needing to navigate pyenv etc - but that's not anything a beginner needs to worry about in order to get started).**The tension is this:** Because Python has an active community of senior developers, who have coalesced on specific ways of working (canonized and blessed particular by the BDFL), there are some corners of Python that don't feel right if you've been exposed to other kinds of programming - some of which might actually be ""harder"" than the level of abstraction that Python works at!For a long time, this manifested for me as: *every time I try to learn Python, I pick a simple project and implement it - but feel like I haven't gained any knowledge about the language*. It was like it was too easy - like there was so little friction that nothing stuck in my brain.What made it click for me was to fully synthesize the idea that ""programming Pythonically"" is a distinct skill, and that ""knowing how to program"" *in general* was helpful for it but by no means sufficient for it. Similar to learning piano after learning guitar - there are definitely some conceptual overlaps and transferable skills, but some things that ""should be"" easy are suddenly hard, and other things that ""should be"" hard feel weirdly easy.",autophage,2025-08-06 15:04:40,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mismzw,False,

n761ae2,"So when you move from C-like languages to Python you have to avoid ""thinking in C."" It is kinda hard to explain but every language has a ""mental model"" you have to adhere to. If you use a ""mental model"" that is incompatible with your current language, it creates a sort of mental fog and you will get stuck. I can tell you have a C model because you used words like ""iterate"" and ""insert."" I know Python programmers use them too but these words don't mean quite the same thing as what you have in mind. The mental model for C is ""memory"" like little pieces of boxes of data that you manipulate. This data has an address and a type. Variables in C are really pointers (of specific type) pointing at memory boxes. The mental model for Python is more complicated because it has multiple fundamental types. I will just use colloquial naem since a lot of higher languages all share these types. They are scalar, array/vector, hash-table/named-array, and pair/dict. Note they are not interchangeable. When you program them you have to keep track of which type you are dealing with. This may seem trivial but it is a big difference especially with the issue you have. You see, an array in Python is not the same as an array in C. An array in Python is ***a type of object*** while in C it is just ***an array (a continuous line) of memory boxes.***This means you cannot think of insert as ***iterating*** to the right spot of the memory and ***insert a box*** and move the rest of the box over to the right (assuming going from left to right). In object oriented languages like Python, you just simply use the object's method to insert. Doing it any other way is just creating trouble for yourself. In some sense this gives Python its ease of use but it also creates a strange weakness. Python programmers often have trouble adjusting to lower level languages like C. It is your problem in reverse, except it is a lot harder to overcome. I do not understand it completely but I feel it is like learning a manual clutch car versus automatic. It is easy to learn automatics because you do not need to understand much to start much. On the other hand, you need to understand the gear boxes to have that mental picture of the gear switching process when you drive to feel the gears switching into the right positions to get it. If you are already accustomed to something easy why would you ever bother and want to struggle with something hard. You will just quit. So, congrats for learning a C based language first.e: a big weakness of higher level languages, most but not all, is that you cannot create new fundamental types. You might be asking what other types could there be? A lot actually, pretty much everything you find in the standard C/C++ library.",kcl97,2025-08-06 03:12:25,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mismzw,False,

n6u5cis,"> I've tried multiple times but it never actually made any sense, what is a bool, what is a float, what is a class,These are all things that are explained, along with their use, in a proper *fundamentals* course.I'd say to get started doing a proper course, like the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki or the CS50 series from Harvard (not the videos, the real course on EdX, Coursera, etc.). This will give you a solid baseline to work from. I suggested Python, because you mentioned *Godot* for Game Dev and Python is closest to GDScript (which is basically a specialized Python).The fundamental data types are easily explained:+ *boolean* - a ""yes/no"", ""true/false"", ""on/off"" value+ *int* - a whole number+ *float* - a decimal number---*Class* is a bit more difficult: it is a scheme, a blueprint for data (fields) together with behavior (methods) - it is a generic description of what can be stored and done with something. Think of e.g. a *Poker Card*+ it has a *suit*+ it has a *rank*+ it may have a *numeric value* (mostly for sorting, or similar, or for a point value)+ it has a *face* (image)+ it has a *backside* (image)+ it can be *face up* or *face down* (which decides what the card will report when asked) all the above are *data* - they are *fields*, *attributes*. Then, there is *behavior*, the *methods* - for a Poker Card these are fairly simple: + It can report its rank (provided that it is face up) + It can report its suit (provided that it is face up) + it can be *flipped* (toggled between face up and face down) + it can *draw* itself Now, you have a *concept* of a *Poker Card* - a full description of the data and behavior - this is a *class*.As such, this doesn't say anything about a *specific* card yet. That's where *objects* come into play - they are the *concrete* implementations, like the ""Queen of Hearts"", the ""Ace of Spades"", etc. Each card in a Poker Deck is a concrete *object*, an *instance* of our *Card* class, of our *blueprint*.----When to use what is a different story. This comes with practical experience. The more programs you write, the better you will understand what to use when.Note that in my description I did not (apart from ""class"" and ""object"", ""boolean"", ""int"", ""float"") use *any* programming language specific terminology as these *concepts* are common to most programming languages.Exactly here is where good *courses* (like the aforementioned course), not just *tutorials*, shine.

But to be of any use to anyone, you'll need to break both of those down into separate smaller problems - how to make bolognaise sauce and how to cook spaghetti. The spaghetti is fairly easy (assuming you're using dried) - boil some water, add salt, add the spaghetti and cook for 10 mins. That's a reusable little skill on its own that can be used with loads of dishes, and at some point could be switched out for a version where you make the spaghetti from scratch, without affecting the other part of the recipe - the sauce.For the bolognaise itself , it's a bit more complicated - fry the onion, brown the meat, add the herbs and tomato sauce etc. Again, each of those steps can be broken down into smaller ones. E.g. the onion - how to dice it and how to correctly cook it is a stand alone set of skills that, like cooking pasta, will be something you'll do in loads of recipes.What's any of this got to do with coding, you may ask.

n6fg6bw,"Well, to play pong you need1) A window2) 2 vertical lines ('paddles') at either side of the screen3) A circle ('ball')4) The dot needs to bounce between the two lines.5) Both the player, and the computer need to move a paddle each.Making a window is pretty easy if you know how to set up a viewport. You can draw rectangles & circles simply as well. If you're coding in OOP you can even make those classes. Since there's movement, and things are updating, you'll likely need a core game loop - easy enough to track. We can then break things down further: To make collisions, you need to know when a ball collides with a paddle. To know that, you need to know1) The Ball's position 2) The Ball's direction (it shouldn't collide if it's not travelling toward the paddle)3) The Paddle's position (should be mostly static horizontally speaking)4) The Paddle's direction (either left or right)So when the ball's at a point where it could collide with a paddle, check if that paddle overlaps with the ball, and if the ball is travelling toward it. If so, calculate the reflection angle of the ball, apply that to the ball - maybe keep track of the paddle's travel speed and factor that in somehow. If the ball isn't colliding with anything, just let it travel on - adding the sine & cos of its direction to its position values (scaled by speed). Then we gotta add the player in. Let them control the left paddle with their W & S keys, or Up & Down, or their mouse, either way. If they move them (i.e. keep track of the last position of the mouse, and check whether it moves between updates), apply the movement to the paddle vertically (not horizontally) and scale that by how fast you want the paddle to move.For the computer, either create some decision tree (like, if the current ball direction would cause you to miss, move toward it.

For example, if you've never worked with interactive graphics, then you'll be stuck at that point, having to learn what to do.Another challenge is how pong deals with the angles that the ""ball"" bounces. Is this something realistic or is there some pseudo-physics going on? It does seem to roughly obey angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. In other words, figuring out the dynamic behavior is hard.I'd probably try something like Snake where you don't have to deal with those kinds of physics.I think, as people break some of these problems down, they still wouldn't be able to code it up.

For example, football, cooking, wrestling, gaming, etc. Take gaming for example, I’ve been playing runescape lately and enjoying that. I thought of an idea where you can select the items you want to upgrade to and it will tell you exactly the costs and items to upgrade it with and give a plan on that.With any project break the idea / problem down to smaller objectives you can easily do. For the above I would do something like:* Hard code the upgrade data and item list for now* Create a function that can calculate the upgrade route of selected items* Display the items that you can select * Display the upgrade route once items are selectedNow always keep your project simple and hard coded, then you can start adding improvements. For example I can connect it to a database, maybe supabase or MySQL or mongodb, etc. I can also connect it to authentication so users can save their ideal upgrade builds, presets, etc.You want to always start small, then incrementally add to it. By adding overtime, that’s when a project gets complex.

In current projects, you will never have deal with algorithms directly (you will not reinvent Redis cashe or quick sort, etc), all algorithms are already implemented and optimized in various libs, your task is to learn how to use it, not implement.I have many years in development and I can barely implement few simple algorithms from top of my head. If you ask me to implement traverse for binary tree (simple task), I will not do it for sure from top of my head, since I don't recall anything how to do it (last time I use that 10+ years ago). But, give me 10 min to google all info, and I will do it, since I understand the concept, not implementation details. If you really want learn programming, start doing some pet projects. Learn what is DI and how it's important (part of SOLID), what value it's bring, etc. Next, big challenge for you will be multithreading, and so on, and so on.

Apply your own thought process. You don't need to understand a programming language or concept to understand the logic behind the topics you are thinking about. Lock yourself in a room and think about the problem from the base case.For example, why do you need a temp variable to store values when swapping in an array? Well, imagine you are organizing a stack of books. You want to move the one in the 5th position to the 3rd position in the stack. So aks yourself, what do you do? You have some options! First, you could pick them up in your hands and move them to where you want them. Or second, you could pick one up, lets say the 2nd one, and shove it in after the 5th book, shoving every other book after it down, then take the 5th book and put it back where the 2nd book was. Or visa versa.So which option is better? It's a lot harder to move a bunch of books after the 5th book just to shove that 2nd book in there. So lets pick them up and swap instead.You pick up book 2, pick up book 5, and swap them. Ok, so if you wanted to do that on a computer, what's different? Well, you used your hand to store the books temporarily, so it's clear you have to put them somewhere when you swap. But actually, we can do better! Because in a computer things don't physically exist and it's all information, we can just pick one of them up, and copy the other into it's place. Now you can ask yourself, what would happen if I didn't pick up that book before copying over it? Well you'd no longer know what the book was, right? You'd lose all the content, all the pages, the title, everything about that book would have been replaced by the book you just copied into its place. This is the thought process you have to apply to *any problem* you don't understand. Stand with the fundamentals. This actually has a name; ""principles first approach"". This is what I employ to most problems. As you gain more experience, you will start to see parallels and abstractions, and shortcuts you can take with the ""base case"".For example, now that you know you need to store a variable temporarily, and you are asked how to swap elements in a binary tree, or rotate it, you can start your base case at the fact that you'll need at least one temporary variable.Best of luck \~",yodog5,2025-08-01 16:37:05,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mf0jc4,False,

n7ebxgi,"There's a common misconception among those new to the software industry that all code is brand new. Most code is legacy code, that is, code that's been around a while, maybe years and years, and you're fixing bugs or adding features. It's rare for a company to ditch their code, find the next new language, and rewrite the entire codebase. One big reason is lack of documentation.I worked on software where the customer would want various features added. It had grown over the nearly two decades it existed until no one really knew the full extent of what the code did because, surprise, surprise, it was never documented. But even if it was, rewriting is only nice for the programmer. The end user generally doesn't see much. Rewrites often introduce bugs and leaves out key features because the developers never knew what all the features were.This is why certain languages hang around. Many newcomers think the industry is quick to jump on languages like Rust and abandon Java, but it's not just the language, it's the massive amount of code that runs and works. More than that, it's the data. If you switch platforms, is your legacy data compatible with the kind of data the new platform expects? In electrical engineering terms, this is called an *impedance mismatch* (which causes inefficiencies in power flow).For PHP, what I heard was it was easy to write, but hard to maintain. That is, people wrote bad code. It was blamed on PHP, more than the coders. It also came when the web was young, so there were still chances for other web frameworks. I'd say the 2010s were the era of these web frameworks. React, for whatever reason, won out over Angular. Vue and Svelte came later, but when a community heads to one framework/library, it creates a critical mass which forces others to join.For example, most web devs need to know Javascript. They could use Dart, but Javascript seems more essential, and so Dart (other than through Flutter) didn't come to replace Javascript.Often, there aren't exactly technical advantages. For example, most people agree Python is a pretty slow language. Despite that, it's become the language used in numerical methods, data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and AI. How did it do that? The main attraction was its simplicity (ish). But also, it allowed for code written in C to look like Python functions. If it were written in native Python, it would be very slow, but because it was optimized in C, a compiled language, these libraries run fast.Python has a huge set of libraries that do all sorts of things. After Java, Python may be the second most popular language taught in US colleges. It's become the language to use for AI coding, so everyone jumps on that bandwagon.But, it could have been Ruby. It could have been Clojure. It could have been a brand new language (unlikely).

But the perceived safety for React came from the Facebook was using it so heavily so they were unlikely to abandon it in the future. 5 or 6 years ago react almost died when Facebook tried to change the license (Java also did this around the same time).

Companies are expecting a lot more experience now than before. The self learning path is still possible, but doing it while having a child and needing to work another job while learning?

Now, if you are really really interested in it and not just doing it for the money then I would still say without a doubt go for it.

I learned through codecademy for basics then in my sales role out of college I built a tool for myself to automate some of my role. That became surprisingly successful despite being simple as hell (literally my first project ever). It was just a webscraper with beautiful soup 4. My point is more so that the problem here is about hiring and understanding the market data. If you study it in depth (this is actually my educational background ie HR) yes there are less jobs and that has directly led to waaaaaaaay more applicants per posting which means a waaaaay smaller chance of your resume ever being seen by a human and its ultimately just making it clear how awful the entire hiring process always has been ... imo the worst process in the world by far and so companies are often relying on referrals from employees as they tend to work better given that the employees can typically be more trustworthy than a resume and team cohesion and ability to get along with the team is one of the most important things any typical hiring manager is gonna care about (not saying that this should be the case). So why i bring up my case is that getting a job is just sales and referrals are a great way to do sales. If they know you and like you they will hire you. Especially at places that aren't truly NASA or OpenAI or FAANG. I personally feel that most job advice in this subreddit feels like its skewed towards those companies because they did truly use to hire 1000s of juniors but there's still millions of 20-50 person companies in non tech intensive industries that cant tell good from bad skill level to begin with and are hiring.I'll also add that no one told me about the functional programming job route and how surprisingly little competition there is for some of these companies. While some typical job postings will have over 1000 applicants these functional jobs will have less than 50 and even then its not hard to beat out the other 50 Lastly the other nuance to share here is that alllll industries right now to the best of my knowledge are crap for hiring.

That means breaking problems into smaller steps, organizing your logic, and gradually building up solutions. It’s a muscle, not a gift, and it takes time and the right kind of practice.Instead of rushing through LeetCode, start small and deliberately:Pick simple problems (like on Exercism, Codewars, Edabit, or even structured platforms like Dataquest) and write out your thought process before coding anything.Read “*How to Solve It”* by Polya, it’s not about code, but about how to approach problems methodically.Watch CS50 lectures (especially the problem-solving parts), and go through hands-on projects like “*Build Your Own X* “ when you're ready.Also, don’t panic when you get stuck. Practice tracing code with pen and paper, talking through your logic, and working with a study group or mentor if possible. Avoid relying on AI tools until you've tried solving it on your own first.

You don't need to know everything as Google and AI exists (no programmer knows everything) but you need to build projects to learn how a project is constructed from start to finish and what is also important is that you don't use AI to solve problems. Struggling is part of the learning process and you only can learn debugging for example if your code, that you wrote yourself doesn't work and you go through it line by line trying to understand why the output is not what you want it to be. Like mentioned above theory is important too as you need to know that certain syntax even exists but then using this syntax so your brain gets used to it you can only learn by doing projects. Once you think you learned Javascript or Typescript for example (like you said you did), start a project and see if you know what to do. If the answer is you don't know then you need to spend more time with it until you can build a project yourself before moving on.

n7acxlr,"Let's start by noting that not everyone understands the language of a problem description. Sometimes, things written in English still require translation into their native language. This is the first thing you can try.Then you can try solving the problem from two perspectives. Let's call them top-down and bottom-up.When solving from the top, you try to understand the highest layer of the problem, the business layer, from the solution's perspective, and then break it down into smaller problems, abstraction layer by abstraction layer.When solving from the bottom, you usually find some lowest problem to solve that you know you'll have to solve, and you build on it with successive steps upward. Sometimes you can create more such starting points and combine them into a single whole.I think solving from the top is easier and clearer, but I've also met people who solve from the bottom-up and were able to write code effectively.It's also worth trying to find solutions by analogy to already known solutions and the source code written for them. Here, you can use two sources, provided you can describe and connect the dots to the problem. One is the internet and its resources, and the trick is finding similar solutions. The second is looking at the code and finding similar implementations. For example, if you need to create a button with a message, and you already have another one somewhere in your application, you can see how it can be done, and that's a starting point for your own solutions.A final, but quite helpful, step is to write the documentation for the problem or function yourself. Not necessarily for the sake of maintaining it, but to understand the essence, clear your mind, and describe the problem. If you can't describe the problem, it's possible that what you're trying to do is intertwined with something else, insufficiently thought out, known, or documented. An example would be writing the documentation for a function before implementing it. If you can't write it, it's likely that you don't fully understand what you want to do. You might not be trying to implement one function, but two (or more) at once, and the problem isn't broken down into manageable components. Writing documentation, if successful, will force you to clarify what needs to be done, and implementation is then more of a detail.Some solutions also involve trial and error, retrospection, and retry. This happens, and don't be discouraged. Not everything can be built in one go.Summing up all the above, you'll definitely be trying to break the problem down into smaller components in some way, iteratively, step by step, until you reach a solution.

n72gyzw,"It sounds like you are in front of a fork in the road for your career. Ultimately, you gotta decide what is it that you want to do. I recommend that you don’t prioritize what you love or are passionate about. Obviously it is amazing if you love/are passionate about your career, but that does not give you much flexibility. It’s fine if you don’t stay in CS/SWE, but I think the answer for leaving should be more nuanced than “it’s not my passion”.So to dig into that a bit deeper, why did you get into software development 6 years ago? Have the reasons back then changed? You mentioned that sometimes you wish you never had to look at code again, is there a specific reason why? Are those reasons innate to coding itself or the conditions of your workplace? One way you can test that question is by trying to learn some fundamental computer science theory. TBF this is an assumption, but I strongly suspect your bootcamp set you up to learn programming languages and frameworks and it didn’t teach you the fundamentals and theory of computer science. I think that’s important to learn in order to develop some passion since it makes the field an actual study, not a traded skill.I’ll use history as an example since that was your major. A lot of people don’t like history because they see it as just the practice of accounting of the events that happened in the past. To them, it feels like there’s “history” and there’s “current events” and the two aren’t connected much in their view. But a historian will understand how history is both a representation of the past and current events. They understand how history gives us a critical basis for evaluating human sociology, economics, politics, etc.There’s an analogous experience that a SWE can have with coding and computer science. It’s obviously not going to get nearly into humanities studies like history, but its conceptualizations extend in their own ways in surprising ways.If you read this and think “I really don’t care about any of that and I have no will to invest my time in that”, that’s totally fair and it would give you important feedback for your dilemma. At the end of the day, whether you are passionate about it or not, you gotta have a mind that is curious to explore your professional field. If your mindset is similar to that as a cashier who doesn’t wish to expand their skillset in retail, then you’ll remain stagnant just as a cashier will. It may feel like you shouldn’t be stagnant since you obviously work in a field that requires more skills than being a cashier. But stagnation isn’t about where you are currently. It’s about how you are growing. TL;DR: Try to invest more time in learning CS fundamentals and theory to see if it will give you a new perspective for finding interests in this field. If it doesn’t or you do not want to do that, then you’ll remain stagnant should consider what would you be willing to do that for and how can you make a career with that.",Doub1eVision,2025-08-05 15:27:36,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1mibizp,False,

It's a <100 person company, maybe 30 engineers.It's by far the shortest / least intense interview I've gone through, and I pretty much only interview for companies around that size or smaller. Most everywhere does 4+ rounds if you're including the intro call, but more than 5 is pretty unusual, and I am including ""take home exercise"" as a round.Most typical interview loops are:* Recruiter screen* Hiring manager screen* Technical round (often a take home)* Deeper technical round (common if last was a take home)* Final call with someone important (CTO, director, etc)Step 3 is *super* common when compared to 2020-2022, but sometimes rounds 2-3-4 there are combined in some way. Occasionally there will be no final round and it goes right to offer stage after the big technical round. It's also pretty common for the deep round to just be a discussion of the take home.Shortest I've ever had was screen, conversational with HM, then a technical.

If you're interviewing for a medium-sized company (100-500 employees, I don't go smaller as the pay will be much lower), you will have 2 interviews: a technical one with a one to three engineers and a behavioural on-site one with an HR and probably someone ranking between your future team lead to the head of development. The technical interview REALLY depends on the company. I'm interviewing for C++ positions, so the company will ask you questions about the non-trivial part of the language most relevant to them (examples are virtual methods, exceptions, thread synchronization, templates, stuff like that). They will also ask you general language and data structure questions(examples: the differences between map and unordered_map and between list and vector), and they might throw a leetcode-like problem in to see whether you understand concepts like big-O notation. Some companies can also ask you a bunch of really low-level questions where you'll need to know about alignment, big-endian vs little-endian, and the C standard library.The behavioural interview is the basic HR questions(like ""what was your biggest fuckup?"" and ""why are you switching jobs?""). One company I worked at gave me a personality test, but it was a legit one developed by scientists for professional orientation purposes, not something like MBTI(and the company itself was really nice and chill). The entire process takes 2-3 weeks. They can even come with the positive feedback on the day of the interview. Then they give you a couple of weeks to think about their offer.

I’ll warn that to someone with my level of experience it’s obvious that this sub is full of people who are barely into their career, and people who have done very little research into other careers.I can get another job easily even in this economy. It would be hard to get a job that pays as much as my current job does, but I’d still be making at least $180k. There’s very, very few other careers that can say something similar short of becoming a doctor. The reality is that becoming a software engineer is still one of your best options.Breaking into this career is hard. But so is breaking into most careers worth pursuing, and at the end other options will generally offer lower rewards than this one. If you network well, apply seriously and broadly, and do proper interview prep, eventually you’ll land something. I started out in a QA role that paid me less then my pizza delivery job, now I make nearly $300k.Far too many people in this sub preach about how you have to be passionate about software. That’s bull. The majority of the highly successful engineers I know, I’m talking people making over $300k, are very transparent they are only in it for the money. Passion isn’t a requirement. Being willing to work hard is. If anything the passionate people were the ones who tend to get suckered into longer hours and lower pay.The only career people can even try to compare with the perks of software engineering is the trades, and that’s largely coming from people who don’t know much about the trades and are parroting what they’ve heard. The trades, on average, don’t pay nearly as much as software engineering. There are some exceptions, but even those tend to only pay the level of highly skilled senior software engineers, if we compare them to the exceptions for software engineers then engineering pay still generally blows the trades out of the water.Trade jobs that pay well are also highly competitive, trade jobs are limited to in person job opportunities, they’re incredibly hard on your body, they often require long hours, and they are rampant with sexism such that it’s hardly even a real option for women. Depending on where you live your race might also be a problem for the trades. If it were as easy to make a ton of money in the trades as some people pretend it is then everyone would do it.

n72rfde,"I’m a software engineer with 19 years work experience. There will always be a need for software engineers as technology progresses. Here are the things you need to know, not immediately but keep them in mind:1. New tech is always coming out, so you have to be comfortable constantly learning. For example, you should absolutely be taking classes about AI, ML, and LLMs in college. 10 years from now, there will be something else. You can’t just sit on knowledge in this field like in other fields, you have to keep learning or you get left behind. 2. Microsoft tech stack isn’t used many places outside of government. Focus on Python and/or Java, as they are the two most popular in the real world. Learn fullstack eventually so you understand how the systems interact. 3. Learn system design. You will learn more about the components in college, the earlier you learn this the better. Hellointerview is really good for this. 4. Obviously DSA is critical. You need to be very comfortable with this. You will learn it in college, but getting started early can’t hurt. Lots of resources online. 5. Learn cloud. Again, Microsoft tech isn’t used much. AWS is king, followed by google cloud. I would recommend learning AWS. You don’t have to be an expert but learn how to use it and what the different parts do. 6. Make a GitHub account and work on projects. Especially anything cloud related and/or AI related. 7. Don’t buy CS books (except school books). Everything you need can be found online, for free. 8. I would recommend taking computer engineering instead of computer science, if you can. It’s half CS and half electrical engineering. You will learn how both the software and hardware work together, and if you decide you like hardware better, you can easily pivot to EE.9. Learn CI/CD fundamentals. Again, you don’t have to be an expert, but understanding how real releases to production work will help you be a more mature software engineer. Be comfortable setting up a build in something like Jenkins or Azure DevOps, for example. 10. Learn version control. Git is by far the most popular. ——Maybe I’ll add more if I think of anything else.

So when my last job went south, and I started looking for my current one.... I kept thinking ""what if I just... went back to fast food"". I made a spreadsheet to forecast my runway.Ultimately I'm glad I stuck with it and landed my current job.... but I am at the point where if I get laid off, or this job goes south, ""soft-retiring"" is a very realistic option for me.My passion in CS and computers is still as strong as ever.

n79t33f,"Most people on this sub are young, so they won't have any real understanding of careers beyond traditional college -> entry level job pipelines.But what I would do from your position is extremely different than that. Instead of trying to cram yourself into that box, I would lean into the advantages of your position and away from the disadvantages you have in the traditional entry level pipeline.I would think about your plant very deeply, and find problems within the plant that are technology problems. I would then prioritize them by a combination of how valuable they are to the business (like how much they move earnings), how much delivery of that thing would prove your ability as a technology leader, and how personally interested I was in the project.For example, if you are having problems with missing inventory, you could implement a better system for tracking the most critical inventory, perhaps integrated with internet connected scales/computer vision/whatever other systems you have for estimating counts and visualizing internal logistics. I would propose this fundamentally be a data warehouse, dbt sql transforms, and metabase, with a cloud function for collecting input data from sensors, but do whatever works.I would then just build it, prove it works, and get the company to use it. Don't try to get paid for it first. Just build it and make it work really well. Do that a couple times, and start leaning on leverage from the company depending on you for more things, only after they are indeed dependent on you, to change at least your title, if not your entire role. Ideally, hire an experienced software engineer or two, empower them with the leverage you built up, while you humbly learn from them, as a kind of servant leader.Now, you have the leverage of the labor market at the \*leadership\* level, which is a way better place to be, not the junior level which is a shit show. Maybe that leverage leads you to running technology teams at that company, or maybe you actually exercise it to join somewhere else. Regardless, that is \*exactly\* the kind of story that sells people into tech leadership roles, not a CS degree.This is more or less what everyone I know who is outlier successful in tech did. Ignore the concept of job titles and norms around career pathways, focus on creating value, use that value to create leverage, use that leverage to both empower yourself to create more value and capture value, after there is a lot of value.Almost no one on this sub will understand this because most are like 23, have no established leverage in a business with which they could do this, nor time to have done it, nor connections with leadership to have understood how things get done at that level.The other pro is that it's no longer either/or. You are hedged the whole time by keeping your current job.The core insight is that hiring managers are just looking for evidence that you can deliver requirements in their business. There is no stronger evidence than having already done that at a business. A 22 year old can't convince an established business to work with them to make that evidence with them.

You'll find that most people are fuzzy on large parts of it and you'll be able to solve and prevent many problems simply by not being fuzzy.\- Find out where all the documentation is and start reading it. It will be of varying quality and often out of date but get comfortable with the org's business, architecture, network infrastructure, personnel structure, etc.\- Talk to as many people as you can, in all roles and departments. Learn what they do. You will eventually save someone from a million dollar mistake because you will have awareness of things that no one else does. Make people like you and see you as useful. You will get many more opportunities that way.\- Learn your tools and technology stack deeply. In the AI era it's more important than ever. It just takes a few books.

For that, it was extremely effective and I got into big tech pretty soon after graduating. I did find this: [https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities](https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities) I'd check that out. All that said, the way I got into a PhD program was by working for a professor as a lab tech, doing good work, and getting into the program hosted by the school.
