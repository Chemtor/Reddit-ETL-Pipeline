mz4227g,"Writing actually useful tests in data engineering tends to be much more difficult.While there is some value in writing unit tests, the reality of most pipelines is that if you're using any sort of framework like Apache airflow or dagster you're just testing the framework itself which, while of some value, given the need to keep these frameworks up to date and the need to ensure breaking changes don't affect your code, don't really help you validate the day to day running of your pipeline.Instead, integration tests and stress tests are much more important. You often need to ensure your pipelines will work (or at least fail gracefully) with bad data and not hang with huge amounts of data.You also have to deal with external APIs or flat file transfers where your assumptions will be based on the documentation the external party provides. You quickly come to realise this documentation is often old or just plain incorrect so building a test suite on it is a lesson on futility.This is obviously much harder to do than writing unit tests of your own code and when the pressures mount of delivering integrations and new data products to the business mount, testing can often fall by the wayside with data engineers falling back on ""we'll test it in live!"".This, compounded by the fact that setting up a testing environment that truly represents your production database/data warehouse can be expensive and time consuming all combine to mean tests are a much less rigourously followed discipline in data engineering.Does that mean you should skip them altogether? Absolutely not, but ensuring you have 100% unit test code coverage is not nearly as valuable as ensuring a complex pipeline has a decent set of integration and stress tests for, say, 75% of its functionality.The reality is that most data engineers will be lucky to get anywhere near that, which is almost certainly why they were impressed you wrote tests at all.

Ideally you also have tests that can be run before you deploy into a test/integration environment, and more tests that you can run before you merge your code to the main branch.Tests should be done as early as is reasonably possible, to detect errors and issues as soon as possible, so that people waste as little time as possible creating and then hunting down and fixing defects.These tests are built on certain assumptions, positive or negative, then 'Given [x] When [y] Then [z]'. DQ checks are there to catch when your assumptions on 'given' and 'when' don't hold -- something gave you nulls when it shouldn't, or some new code value came in for a column that didn't exist before, or some formatted number had a format change. You can't check the output for various features to detect if something went horribly wrong, and you can halt the process or quarantine some data so that it doesn't corrupt everything.But those DQ processes should themselves be tested. Do they correctly identify certain scenarios and actually halt the process (or do whatever other mitigating action you specify).

mzo0jin,"I feel like I’m being called to respond here. I remember you commenting something similar under one of my posts. I was planning to write a separate post to address it, but since you brought it up here first, here I am :)We really should make a clear distinction between testing **imperative code** (like Python, Java, etc.) and **declarative code** (like SQL). There are some similarities, sure, but the overall intuition is quite different.Procedural code is much more detailed — it’s built to operate on small units of data or small transactions. You can stop execution at any point, inspect variables, and debug step by step. You have full control over dependencies, can inject mocks, and create true unit tests (It is all very well described by many books and authors).That’s basically impossible in SQL-driven projects (which is what I’m talking about in my posts). Here tests are essentially black-box tests you're testing the outcome of a whole query or pipeline as it runs through the SQL engine. There’s no pausing mid-query or stepping through line by line.Here’s how I see the distinction in SQL-driven projects:* **Data tests** — I treat these as part of the models itself. Like you said, they run at runtime. I think of them as *assertions* that validate whether the model can handle certain inputs.In imperative code, it would look something like this: def foo(request): if request is None: raise Exception(""Request cannot be null"") if not is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request): raise Exception(""Request is not valid in this context because of X, Y, Z"") do_actual_processing(request)The actual processing code is only meant to work with data that’s already been validated. If the data doesn’t meet the criteria, we terminate early and skip that specific request.In SQL-based projects, I see data tests playing the same role. The simple, built-in tests are kind of like basic assertions like `request is None`. More specific, custom tests are closer to the business logic checks, like `is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request)`.The difference is that we place the test on a previous model in relation to the one we're currently building, and we run it against the entire dataset — not just a single piece of data. Unfortunately, if it fails, it can bring down the whole build, unlike in transactional systems where only one transaction would fail.* **Unit tests** \- These focus on verifying logic rather than the data itself. The goal is to ensure that a specific block of logic behaves as expected. Support for writing this kind of test is limited (it’s available in dbt, but I don’t find it particularly easy to use). Still, it can be useful for checking that complex conditional logic works correctly or that your regex patterns aren’t doing anything weird.* **Diff tests** – These run the whole pipeline with your new changes and compare how the exposures or main models differ between the old and new versions of the code. It’s kind of like an integration test. It’s especially useful for explaining to data consumers what changed and why those changes happened.These are all the automated tests I use in analytical projects, and so far, this testing setup has been sufficient for all my needs.So, in summary, I agree with the distinction you made. I think about data test in specific way, I am aware that this is a run time concept and use it there.",PotokDes,2025-06-25 09:09:44,8,dataengineering,t3_1ljq8r4,False,

It could be directly from a source system, from a curated lake are, data model, or a cleansed area. The idea is to drive a feedback loop to upstream and downstream systems by engaging data stewards to enact process, behaviour or policy change to drive long term improvements in quality. Sometimes it may be possible to directly integrate with these systems to automatically enact change/fixes, but this should always be done with a person to approve. The point is, what you describe are two different concepts entirely, and are not comparable in any way.

Data Models are the foundations for any OLTP and OLAP systems, they are systems, tools and applications agnostics. Few tweaks here and there but for most part, a strong base model can be plugged into any application.

My team tech lead comes from traditional ETL background and has done lot of modeling in his past. I still spend lot of time on the model naming conventions and establishing proper standards.

In my experience (mostly feeding business/analytics reports) having good tests for business logic is more useful than technical testing (like is this column nullable or unique, etc) because I'm trying to minimize scenarios where the data pipelines succeed but the numbers make no sense to business people and then the business complains or stops trusting the numbers. And I find a decent amount of issues with technical data quality will be noticeable immediately, like if you try to upsert with a duplicate PK, the pipeline will fail and you'll get a notification. It seems like you have the perspective of a DE working in a tech minded company where tech/software is the product, so it makes sense to have the highest possible software quality. This is not the case for all non software companies, where having old and shitty software is the norm and asking for budget increases gets you laughed out of the room. This culture filters down into who gets hired and what tools get used, so the business ends up with worse quality engineering talent all else equal.

mzevql4,"I've been working on (and failing at, honestly) getting data engineers to adopt proper testing practices for ten years. Here's what I've observed:1.     **Legacy Systems and Technical Debt** Many organizations are stuck with legacy data architectures - monolithic data warehouses, batch ETL processes built years ago - that are incredibly difficult to modernize. The technical debt from years of ad hoc development makes implementing proper testing and observability feel like trying to retrofit a Formula 1 engine into a horse-drawn carriage. Migrating to modern cloud-native stacks requires significant investment that many companies aren't willing to make.2.     **Lack of Data Engineering Maturity** This is the big one. Most companies still treat data engineering as a back-office function rather than a core engineering discipline. You end up with a mess of one-off scripts, undocumented workflows, and manual interventions everywhere. Very few data teams practice basic software engineering principles like CI/CD, proper testing, or version control for their pipelines.3.     **Resistance to Cultural Change** Data teams have historically worked in silos - engineers, analysts, scientists, and business teams all doing their own thing. DataOps requires breaking down these silos and adopting agile methodologies, which is genuinely disruptive to existing workflows. Leadership has to drive this cultural shift, but most executives don't understand data engineering well enough to know what needs to change.  You need to test at every point on the data joureny4.     **Tooling Complexity & Vendor Overload** The data tooling landscape is overwhelming. Every vendor promises to solve all your problems, but integrating everything into a coherent, testable system is a nightmare.5.     **Lack of Automated Testing & Observability** This is where we really fail compared to software engineering. Data teams still rely on manual SQL checks instead of automated data quality pipelines. We have open source tools now - Great Expectations, , dbt tests, and my company's DataOps Data Quality TestGen - but adoption is still painfully slow.6.     **The Meaning of ""Testing"" is Confusing** This one drives me crazy. When software engineers talk about testing, they mean unit tests, integration tests, etc. that run during development and deployment. But in data engineering, ""testing"" could mean: Testing your code logic during development (like software engineers do), Testing data quality when new data arrives in production, Testing data at various points in the produict process.7.     **Do you test in development when code changes, or in production when data changes? The answer is YES to both**, but most teams don't distinguish between these different types of testing. This confusion leads to either over-engineering development tests or completely ignoring runtime data quality checks. We need both static code testing AND dynamic data testing, but the industry hasn't standardized the terminology or tooling around this distinction.8.     **Regulatory & Compliance Challenges** Compliance requirements often prioritize audit trails over engineering best practices, creating friction around automation.9.     **Lack of Executive Buy-In & ROI Justification** It's hard to quantify the ROI of ""preventing data disasters that haven't happened yet."" Executives see testing as overhead rather than insurance.The frustrating part is that we know how to solve these problems - the tools and methodologies exist. But changing organizational culture and overcoming years of technical debt is incredibly difficult.

mzse1jn,If your data source is a PDF then you have to load into a lake then parse it into tabular data to query. The downside of lakes is the data is immutable because it’s just files. Iceberg makes it mutable by storing copies of the metadata. This is a lakehouse.If you just have tabular data you don’t even need a lake much less a lakehouse. People like the lake houses approach because they want all their data in one place instead of tabular in datamart and PDFs in lake because then it’s easier to combine them.The exception to all this is when you have HUGE tabular data. A datamart will be too slow because it’s not partitioned. Indexing helps but eventually it’s not enough. A lake is partitioned because it’s files so if you have 5 years of data but only need to query one day you can just scan that one partition and get your data.,Trick-Interaction396,2025-06-25 23:19:51,115,dataengineering,t3_1lkkjdf,False,

mzt4ec2,"I think the question is confusing a little unstructured data (image, video, etc.) and unprocessed structured data (raw JSON, raw CSV, etc.). My experience is on structured data, so I will be answering about this.In my understanding, the value proposition of the ""lake house"" as opposed to ""data lake + data warehouse"", is to reduce the amount of tools and data pipelines required to get your data from a raw state to a state that your end user can analyze.1. data lake + data warehouse (from Hadoop ~ 2007 then cloud ~ 2015): 1. ETL 1: Raw data is extracted/transformed/loaded (ETLed, or just dumped) into the data lake. 2. Storage 1: A data lake is optimized for massive low-cost storage (S3, GCS, Azure blob, MinIO). 3. ETL 2: Data lake data is cleaned, joined, aggregated etc. into a query-able state loaded in the data warehouse. 4. Storage 2: A data warehouse is optimized for analytical-oriented queries OLAP. It is generally an expensive independent black-box service with its own internal file storage so it requires additional data transfer (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift etc.).2. lake house (from Delta Lake ~ 2019): 1. ETL 1: Same as above. 2. Storage 1: Same as above. 3. ETL 2: Same as above, but you're not loading into a separate OLAP service, you stay in your object storage and just store in a different format, a lake house format. 4. Storage 2: A lake house (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Duck Lake) is optimized for OLAP queries, but it can be created in the same massive low-cost storage as Storage 1. It relies on additional table metadata that allows replicating some of the features and optimizations that make the previous OLAP services more performant than querying a basic partitioned Parquet table. For example, compared to Parquet only, it allows: 1. transactional changes (either successful or not at all), 1. schema evolution (adding new columns without rewriting the whole table), 1. time travel to previous versions, 1. upsert/delete/merge at the file level instead of the partition level, 1. and related read/write optimizations.> 1 - One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?So the key with Lake House tech is you can keep using your massive low-cost object storage for your OLAP layer as opposed to loading into an expensive OLAP black box. I have not detailed the generation before ""data lake + data warehouse"" (before Hadoop), which is mostly ""OLTP + data warehouse"", as you didn't ask about it.You can find more details in this article from Databricks who makes Delta Lake: https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf> 3 - Will these technologies become the de facto standard in the near future, turning traditional lakes and warehouses obsolete?Given their killer features above, I think so. But it can be a progressive evolution of your existing data lake, you don't have to trash it. Now, ""lake house"" warehouses are still distributed ""big data"" warehouses, which means they shine in processing huge amounts of data in a reasonable time and cost, and they do that better than partitioned Parquet tables. But this is still not as performant as PostgreSQL on average data, highly specialized OLAP databases like Click House or expensive black box OLAP like Snowflake. Although, Duck Lake may be bridging the gap for average data, with its metadata stored in OLTP instead of file, and its highly performant single process C++ engine.",sib_n,2025-06-26 01:47:57,16,dataengineering,t3_1lkkjdf,False,
mzsu7it,"1. Because many, many systems don't know how to create a parquet file or the cost of adding that capability is outrageous. Many of the systems that are older, but still very functional, are also very brittle. You don't change the file format just because you want to use a different format. You have to come up with a business case that makes changing the format worth it. BTW, cost savings are a terrible way to start a discussion to get money. Figure out how to make more money by changing the file format and you may have something.2. We have heard all about the coming of semi-structured or unstructured data for years. Like cold fusion, it is just 20 years away. PDFs are a horrible way to move data. They are designed for how the information looks, not how it is held. You wouldn't believe the number of escape sequences are used to make PDFs look good. Those are very hard to get the data out of. Ask your local data scientist how much they love pulling data out of PDFs. They'll tell you it sucks. The first step to using them is to get the info out of the PDF into text and then try to make it work.3. Not even close. 90% of what you hear about these ""coming technologies"" is marketing BS.

n02k10h,"You need to see every state change.Take a CRM with a customer issue workflow. The issue may bounce between a variety of states through the day, and the CRM doesn't log all of the information related to the state change at the time it was made into a fully comprehensive audit log. This is even a reason why the system might have CDC enabled -- so that this in depth functionality is offloaded from the system.Alternatively, getting account balance and related details in a banking system on each transaction. Transactions may not log the actual remaining balance at the time, that's just on the account table. You might want analyses on lowest/highest value on account even during the day, or the amount of time spent below a balance level or in arrears.All sorts of tables live system back ends may provide better information if all their state changes are logged to a full history table.You might not necessarily *need* this now, but I've seen business want to convert to faster update frequencies and/or finer granularity pretty frequently. It is generally not that much more difficult to set up, and once you have the pattern set once it is just repeated for every other table.Doing it by default makes later development much easier. If it saves the work of just a single person for just one week in an entire year, that could be worth $10k/yr. Is the marginal cost of the full history more than that? Does it save so little development time? What if an ask for finer grained data came in for more tables? What's the lost value of all the data you *didn't* collect?---Speed / latency and flexibilityIf you bring this into a bronze style append-only log table, you have access to all the data essentially immediately. Any use case that could ever use just the latest state information without having to burn down the core database with excessive queries to get it will want to hit this instead. You can be constantly ingesting this data.You don't have to integrate it into SCD2 tables constantly though. You could do that daily, or hourly, or every 15 minutes, or skip it on weekends, or do it monthly, or on demand. Because the incoming data is a full change log it doesn't matter how often you run the process, it works the exact same way. It isn't like snapshots where you have to run each snapshot individually and sequentially in order to get the correct behaviour for building a history, and you run into issues when you have to skip a day due to the source system having a planned outage because your DQ checks throw up errors that you're missing a snapshot.---Efficiency with actual slow changesIf only a small proportion of the data is changing over a given snapshot period, then you don't need to be sending the 10x, 100x, 1000x, or 10_000x data volume of the full snapshot just to make the state change (including deletes) calculable. You can get away with sending significantly less data.If your integration process to SCD2 or other tables is set up properly, you can also get away with significantly less processing. Only the primary keys in the latest CDC slice will be updated, and only for SCD2 records that are currently active (or end after the CDC slice starts). You can filter the target table for the appropriate date range then semi-join on the primary keys to limit what you're working with. I've had this cut down the amount of data being processed when compared to snapshots by ~95%---Automation and concurrent usesCDC is useful for all sorts of ways to use a database, and it is a fairly generic feature. Rather than maintaining lots of manual queries to snapshot data and then having to write more scripts to export it and transfer it, some SaaS come with built-in CDC processes where you can direct the data to be emitted to lake storage, or to an event system like Kafka. It may be significantly easier for the ops team for the original database to just enable CDC and point it to somewhere you can access, rather than managing and tweaking an in-house snapshot setup.If the CDC is being evented out low latency as it occurs, it could also have multiple consumers. There may be other processes around the business that want to follow along on data level changes to trigger alerts or workflows, so that the business doesn't have to dig into the guts of a SaaS or overload the development team. If they're setting this up anyway, there's no need to then set up another redundant process for another team, they can just pull the CDC like anyone else.--- CaveatIf the data is changing extremely rapidly and outpaces the size of a daily snapshot, then you're probably not really looking at something that's typically usable as an SCD2 table, or at least one where it probably isn't helpful. You can often just have an append-only table for the CDC if all the data are essentially inserts, as would be the case for banking transactions for example. Or you might want to initially ingest into an append-only table, then on a daily run grab the last change per primarty key before midnight to generate a daily snapshot delta.In any case, for almost everything you receive, always put it into an append-only table first, then work with it from there. It almost always make later processing easier and more efficient, it really helps with being able to test or scope out changes on real data, and if anything ever goes wrong with the integrated (eg SCD2) data then you've got an essentially immutable copy that you can rerun and restore from.",azirale,2025-06-27 14:27:57,5,dataengineering,t3_1llt6y9,False,

mzgy98o,"KYD - know your data. Just like a db schema is used to constrain your data, you want to apply the same thing as close to the extraction as possible. Fail fast, if you will. This means understanding your source data fields and testing them. This is especially true for json blobs where nested keys are expected to hold json data, only to find that the API actually returns null values or different nested values or keys based on other keys in the blob - yay. But achieving this is not easy. You need to get in contact with the business owner / data owner to understand the fields and the business rules (and what they mean). And you need to ensure you've got signoff prior to deploying the pipeline, so that any failures can be reviewed with them before you make your pipeline constraints more lenient. Trust me. But, the myth of ""we will fix it in post"" is real, and never actually happens once the next pipeline comes your way. Post-fixing methodologies are essentially like adding a second etl to your pipeline - which you will also need to maintain, and it's totally abstracted away from the source data pipeline now. Most analytics is quite removed from production systems, and business/ stakeholders want their data NOW. But part of any data pipeline is the ""people pipeline"", connecting people from the relevant domains into a single conversation so that parties can understand the risks and uncertainties and the business rules. But, if you only build pipelines and you don't care about what happens after you give the data to people, or you don't care about the teams who need to use the data, then just build tests against your destination schema constraints.

Then, half a year later, after adding new logic, it failed right away pointing that something went wrong. **Regression testing** could be the most rewarding.

Unless your datasets are very deterministic or doesn’t change a lot I wouldn’t go there. Unless there’s an action do to on your end if you receive a new value.You can test for data continuity (try to find holes). That help a lot. Most systems aren’t fully sequential because you need that all part of the pipeline support sequential task to deliver you data sequentially which is not the most common.

When we shift to corporate, there will be politics involved or there will be some culture that you have to adopt. In this case, sounds like the culture is not that good. You might not be culture fit. But it doesn’t mean that your bad or you underperform. It’s just that the company’s culture don’t fit your values. Working outside shift hours is bad. There has to be some level of respect there. Not unless the role requires an on-call responsibility. Don’t be too hard on yourself, brother. On the other hand, there are also some factors that might contribute to your situation. It might be possible that your communication style ia different from the the comm style of your boss or your peers. For example, there are some people who don’t respond via email. They respond via chat. You mentioned that you tagged your boss on a doc and he seemed to miss that. So, that might be an issue. Adjust to your boss’ comm style. If he wants a chat, then do so. His email might be swamp with a lot of emails so your email might be burried in his inbox. Another thing is, in start ups autonomy is the usual culture. In corporate, it’s not always the case. There will be a lot of times that you have to have buyins from certain stakeholders. Even your boss. You need to push for approvals and sell the idea to them. Culture is really different.

One possible reason that it looks like passive-agressiveness is that you don’t speak enough with your boss.In startups, speed is usually name of the game. In corporate, you can only do so much until your boss approves it. Lastly, communicate always your work. It’s important that you become visible to your boss and he’s aware about what you do.

A good observability tool can help establish a baseline and notify you if something changes. \- Some data sources have fairly irregular schedules, with frequent ingest during work hours, batch updates during the night, and no updates during weekends and holidays. You often end up with very loose freshness tests because you can't combine freshness with a cron.The setup can be as simple or as difficult as you want. In the simple case, just create a service user for the SaaS and watch the dashboard populate. In the advanced case, you can spend months writing custom yaml tests in MonteCarlo, integrating Airflow webhooks, etc.The crux with the more advanced tools that actually use ML is that they notify you of anomalies over slack, and they then expect you to tell them if this is an actual anomaly. When you set it up it just observes for a week or two, assuming that whatever you see during this period is normal. After this, you will probably start receiving a lot of notifications of possible anomalies. If your team is able to check with some domain expert, you can give the underlying ML model good input and over a few weeks there will be way fewer false positives.If you don't have access to someone who can tell you if an anomaly is an error or not, these tools will be very annoying. If you do, you probably also have a good shot at writing meaningful dbt tests.The more simple tools are more annoying. The anomaly detection is often a simple Z-statistic, so there is little chance of reducing false positives (other than accumulating more history). On the plus side, the simple tools are often open source or open core.Lastly, a few questions to keep in mind: \- What types of failures are you looking for? Is it silent failures in the data ingest pipeline you created? Is it upstream changes to data structures, odd content etc that might stem from an error in a different system? \- What do you want from it? Is it for the DE team to check possible errors in their own system? Is it to notify users of possible issues? \- What is your tolerance level for false positives? \- How much effort is it to check out a possible anomaly?None of these projects ended up seeing the observability tool as an indispensable tool. From what I can remember, there was one or two cases where the tool caught an issue before anyone else.

Additionally, you can enhance the scalability of your Azure Functions by moving them to Azure Kubernetes Service if your function apps face heavy workloads. Incorporating better data validation mechanisms before data transformation can save time troubleshooting downstream inaccuracies. Finally, enhancing your logging and monitoring setup, possibly integrating [Azure Log Analytics](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/building-data-pipelines-with-azure-synapse-analytics?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit), will provide better insights and faster response times to issues that may arise.",Altruistic_Road2021,2025-06-24 16:04:45,2,dataengineering,t3_1likkfo,False,

That last part is where a data team really shows its value.You can extend, or alternatively, start this thinking by considering who your data team's end users or customers are now and, just as important, who they'll be in the future. These are usually:1. Business users: The folks looking at dashboards.2. Analysts: The folks diving into the data to answer novel questions.3. Reverse ELT: Platforms you send enriched data back to, often marketing.4. Data Science: Perhaps to answer questions 2 and 3 above, or to power your application.5. Application: Your application itself. Are you responsible for master data concepts like a single representation of a user that needs to be fed back to your platform?Once you have a sense for these things you can then think about the technical requirements that answering those four questions and serving those five customers might entail. Often, these can be grouped into two big questions (the ones we're always asking first in this sub):1. What is the volume of the data?2. What are the latency requirements for my uses?For example, making a dashboard for business users to see what happened usually doesn't require data more timely than a day. That's why so many organizations start with simple batch ELT jobs. From here, you can begin to build into the other use cases and customer needs. But, on the other hand, maybe you know that you're immediately going to be tasked with some application or data science need. Being aware of that could help you get in front of that problem and start with a more robust, lower-latency solution like streaming or microbatches from the beginning.If, like many data teams, your first responsibility is to get the business users and analysts the data they need to understand what is happening to the business, I find [Metric Trees](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/designing-and-building-metric-trees) to be the most useful way to think about this. You can use this framework to anticipate the data you'll need to surface and to inform your understanding of how to organize it so that all the data relevant to a particular domain or user responsible for that data is co-located for their use.In the end, it all comes down to your unique needs, but those various points are some of the things I consider when building out a vision for what the data team should be building, how they should build it, and when.",bengen343,2025-06-26 13:31:17,1,dataengineering,t3_1lkx40g,False,

Some examples might be the amount you are choosing to invest in training and knowledge transfer with the business. How are you going to model your data, how does that decision align with your self service ambitions. What does data governance look like, if it exists formally at all. What are you hiring? What skillsets are you looking to develop, how are you looking to code all of this? Maybe you're small and advanced so you can tackle python and spark as the workhorse for all of your work, or maybe you want to make things accessible to as many people as possible with a low entry point to contribution, and you choose SQL or a low-cost/graphical workflow.This is really just a few things to consider, and really a lot of it is bumping up against a tactical approach more than strategy, but hopefully it illustrates how a strategy of ""making data easily accessible to the organization"" has many different tendrils into various parts of the organization.",seaefjaye,2025-06-26 11:28:15,1,dataengineering,t3_1lkx40g,False,

Such that for varchar columns, we have setup a column length if a column is varchar or if it’s a number, etc… This made development and data validation easier.

Or… create a macro with 3 levels of lengths like short, medium, long. Each have equivalent lengths.

mz5n9sg,"I have no thoughts on zoom camp but as a fellow mechanical engineer turned data/analytics engineer I would suggest looking for roles that mention manufacturing IoT work. That’s how I made the transition work pretty seamlessly. Obviously I spent lots of time outside of work learning on the side but here was the career path I took:Manufacturing engineer: I had a few roles before this that were more design focused and even though I hated manufacturing it was vital experience to get my foot in the door for the next step.Automation Engineer: worked and learned alongside controls engineers and IT networking experts to bring data from machines to databases for various use cases. Learned some PLC programming (don’t really use it now), a lot about networking and various data transfer protocols, and a lot of data modeling/reporting. I also got the chance to use some of my own data that I collected to mess around and try to build machine learning predictive maintenance models. The models didn’t perform well (for reasons outside my own control), but I learned a lot. I got much better at both SQL and Python and general problem solving.Data/Analytics Engineer: with all the experience I gained from my previous role I was able to make my way into a junior data role by taking a pay cut and just speaking really passionately about data (which I genuinely am). Since then I’ve learned a shit ton about good programming principles/procedures, working in a platform like Databricks, and how to communicate with business partners about data projects.I’ve since been promoted in this role and absolutely love the work that I do.

I would say their program is pretty good for introduction to DE, I respect their contribution to the community. However, there are so many details or problems you need to consider when you are working a real-life project, and some of them are extremely critical for interviews. The lack of depth in their course design (because it's only three months) means you need to take the initiatives to explore way more than they provide to you within the curriculum, which also stands if you enrolled an expensive bootcamp. I was asked a system design question during an interview to design a real-time pipeline, so get prepared for a decent resume, different problems or challenges you might encounter during a project, lots of SQL questions, Python programming questions (maybe not Leetcode style), and system design questions.

mza2v4f,"We had one multiplexed event stream ingestion. It helped because what would otherwise have been an individual topic only had a small trickle of records with occasional bursts -- not enough to justify running a separate streaming ingestion job for each, nor to handle the overhead of parquet+deltalake over individual row writes.So we bundled everything into one big stream with a wrapper around each event to indicate which type it was, which just helped with later processing.The advantage for us is we could run each downstream job on any schedule we wanted, all the data was there in the big ingestion table. Technically there is overhead with reading all the other data, but compared to reading directly off of kafka (or similar) it was still much faster to pull off lake storage.Another advantage was the sharing of overhead on the streaming size. Basically all the topics combined shared the same overhead or cluster oversizing, so while an individual 'topic' might burst to 10x traffic, since it only makes up 10% of the overall bandwidth, it would not shift performance demands too much. It kept usage reasonably predictable.Low latency use cases still ran off the original topics.

Treat your warehouse as a feature store for documents: break sources into small, well-tagged passages, snapshot them, and pump the embeddings plus raw text into something like PGVector or Pinecone so RAG stays deterministic. Build lineage on the chunk level, then wire row-level roles into the retrieval layer; that’s way easier than hoping users classify PII correctly before pasting it into ChatGPT. Automate redaction inside the pipeline-simple regex masks won’t cut it, lean on entity detection like Presidio. Observability matters more now because any silent refresh lag will surface as hallucination, so monitor vector drift the same way you watch table freshness.

Because you're not starting from scratch, you're hooking into a long-living, already existing framework and ecosystem for creating applications, with well-defined and delineated structures to organize your program to ensure it works within the framework.You would see similar levels of triviality if you tried to make a ""bare metal"" web application with native javascript and HTML, as well, the complexity comes in when you pick up a framework, because you're CHOOSING that complexity in exchange for the power the framework offers you. Same with servers, you can write your own bare-bones HTTP server in C++ and simply use that as a REST-API handler, but that's a lot of tedious work... why would you do that when ready-made frameworks exist that, yes, take a bit more work to get started with, but over time drops your workload by a hundred times?Mobile platforms are different because they REQUIRE you to use their platform to be able to run your applications and ensure they don't do ""bad things"", you cannot do ""bare metal"" development. These platforms are hardware limited, run fundamentally different ""operating systems"", and have a much higher level of integration and centralized control than a PC. This requires you to break up your applications into event-driven models, state-based triggers, setting structures and sign up for all the functionality you want to hook into so that the OS can integrate these things, ensure you get your fair share of background time, and run your app in the correct situations. You *can* do close to native app development if you jailbreak Android, and skip all the framework stuff if you really want to, but you won't be able to run on a locked down, consumer platform.You will see that over time as you get more experienced with development and the applications you write get more substantial, you will either gravitate towards the same level of complexity, or you will be stuck doing so much manual work and trying to ensure it all works with each other that you drop it entirely because you get sick of it. Raw SDL is fine if what you're doing is fairly simple, a few UI elements there, a sprite there, but once you get beyond a certain level of complexity you'll either be wrapping it in your own engine, starting to use a framework yourself, or you ""muscle through"" it and create an unholy abomination that's a mess to work with.",irCuBiC,2025-06-21 10:12:41,5,learnprogramming,t3_1lgkpxz,False,

myxhvrv,"I’m seeing weird answer here. The reason why a simple hello world is so difficult to get going dates back to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the old days demonstrated by the console programs that you’ve been playing with you have ASSCII printable characters (the letters you see for instance like a, b, c, etc.) and the non-printable characters like carriage return (CR) that return the cursor to the beginning of the line, new line (NL) that advance the cursor to the next line below, etc. All very easy to control with basic system calls.Enter GUIs where it’s not that simple. With a GUI you have to define what is called a draw or layout surface that allows you to place elements like text boxes, buttons, etc at various positions within that draw surface. That overall draw surface is stored in the form of a series of buffers or layers to present to the user visually and a further layer to track finger touches or mouse cursor movements so the system can track what the user want to interact with. Now, with SDKs they need to handle a lot of the overall setup for you and you utilize objects that represent text or buttons or other widgets that place on that surface.Now as you can see we have gone from simple system calls to print text to screen for your console apps to presenting a presentation layer for GUI elements that cannot only rely on system calls alone to display.This is why a simple hello world program on Android is so difficult because:1. You need to set up a display buffer with the resolution and how it will be displayed to the user2. You need to create a text box element in that buffer to display the text3. You need to set up what text is displayed in that text elementI hope this gives you a good idea in answer to your question.",ButchDeanCA,2025-06-21 03:31:24,3,learnprogramming,t3_1lgkpxz,False,

That’s a recursive algorithm.More generally, recursion helps whenever the problem you want to solve is hierarchical in nature.

myxujx2,"1. If you’re learning recursion as part of a degree, then it’s a good bet that your professors think it’s pretty important. Trust them.2. Recursion comes up all the time. Many important data structures are defined recursively. For example, linked list is either null or a structure that contains some data and a pointer to a linked list. And when you have recursive data structures, recursive functions are often the best way to work with them.3. Recursion isn’t just some academic exercise. Consider a GUI framework. Typically, anything that’s drawn on the screen is drawn in a *view*. Controls, labels, text fields, menus, etc. are all specialized views. If a user clicks the mouse button, the framework figures out which view was clicked by asking the root view which view contained the click location. That view then asks each of its sub views which view contained the click, and so on. Or, if part of the screen needs to be redrawn, the framework goes through a similar process.4. Any problem that can be solved recursively *can* be solved iteratively, but recursion is often the easier, cleaner solution. Recursion uses the stack to keep track of intermediate results; things can get messy fast with iteration because you have to manage that state explicitly.5. There are some languages in which recursion is the only way to loop.6. If you’re working on a computer science degree, you probably have courses in theory of computation, compilers, and operating systems in your future. Recursion looms large in each of those. As a small example, read about the `fork()` function in Unix-like operating systems.7. Your question reminds me of high school math classes when students would ask “why do we need to know trig identities?” or “when are we ever going to factor polynomials in the real world?” It’s easy to understand that feeling, but it’s hard to provide a satisfying answer because someone asking a question like that just hasn’t seen enough to appreciate the importance of the topic.

What about a very ordinary programmer like me, with a couple of decades working in imperative languages where recursion is very much a choice?It's a tool for your mental toolbox. You need to learn and practice it (even if it initially feels awkward and even if some examples feel alien or niche). Then, when you face real world problems, sometimes you'll realise that, hey, it kind of feels like if I split this problem up into pieces the algorithm will be simpler or the code cleaner...and maybe I can do that again in the same way...hey, this is recursion! I'm recursing! And when your problems don't nest that way, go back to ordinary imperative code.Kinds of data where recursion comes up naturally are common. Trees are obviously very likely to involve recursive operations and trees come up all the time in real world data wherever data are organised hierarchically: DOM trees, parse trees, nested spatial info, organisational charts, I'm sure you can think of many more examples where data are naturally nested in a self-similar manner.Most of my code is not recursive, but I wouldn't be a competent programmer if I didn't know how to use recursion when it's the better choice.",AdministrativeLeg14,2025-06-21 04:14:18,5,learnprogramming,t3_1lgngqf,False,

Unless you are specifically using one of these protocols I would use the correct HTTP verbs wherever possible. Conforming to industry standards just makes everything easier. For example, many JS network libs (like Axios) understand that a HTTP status code of 400 is an error response and will throw an error on the client.

mzczq21,"I am of the camp that outside the most common status codes, no, you should not use most of the status codes that exist, because most of them have niche semantics that won't be applicable to you or are used in specific subprotocols that ride on top of HTTP like WebDAV, or HTTP extensions. Perhaps a 200 for an error is not OK, but I would prefer an API with consistent error responses to one that abuses 20 different HTTP statuses all slightly incorrectly. Same thing with HTTP verbs.Most HTTP status codes are designed to describe outcomes related to the transport itself rather than the business logic that is behind it, and as such, HTTP status codes should be used to describe issues that occur prior to any form of processing or side effect and past that you should fall back to a very small subset of statuses to describe the outcome. That is what a body is for.. The problem with this tends to be when people have to shoehorn complex behaviour into a single endpoint due to reasons outside their control, and they start abusing other HTTP status codes (especially WebDAV codes) to try and communicate their intent for things like partial success, or precondition failure, or side effects. They then do not realise half the HTTP status codes have strict and specific semantics about things like headers that should be included with them, and they break the rules of the spec by using them, which is far worse than just not using them at all. HTTP was not originally designed for requesting that Amazon sends you a new bag of cat food, it was designed for asking Amazon to show you a webpage about cat food.There is then confusion on what describes a client versus a server error. Does a 400 purely specify that a request looks okay, or does it imply that the actual data it represents is meaningful in terms of the current system state and data that is stored? Do you expect a server to start processing your request prior to giving a 400 back? Does bad request purely describe the request itself or the implication of that request? Do you consider a 500 to mean something went wrong during processing or just that your server is fucked? Once you get into the rabbithole of trying to work out exactly when each code is valid, you realise the system you are integrating with made a totally different decision on how to organise this and interpret it differently.The other issue is that some HTTP libraries made the somewhat braindead decision to throw exceptions when you get certain status codes, and this then makes integration more difficult. Really what you are often communicating is semantically tied to your own system, and if that is the case, using the body to communicate that rather than the status code can be more sensible.Even from a monitoring perspective, anything significant will be relying on application metrics rather than metrics from load balancers to determine system health. Load balancer metrics for status codes just give a rough idea of how much stuff is working versus not working.TLDR: 400, 401, 403, 404, 2xx, 500, 503 are OK. Use those as you will. Anything more complicated that is related to business logic should just be in a 200 or 500 and detail the issue in the body. Abusing other codes like 422, 423, 507 just because they ""sound like"" what you want is far worse than just using vague codes. If you are giving me a 479 Shits Fucked Yo designed to be used with WebFTP v2.718281828459045 from 1943, or a 486 Its Tuesday that Twitter used once, then I have a problem. Using 200 for errors might be controversial but if it is easier to do that and provide consistent responses in the body across your systems, then go for it. Whether you are checking a status code inside or outside a body, most programming languages use the same constructs to inspect it. If using a 3 digit number at the start of a response is what people think defines usability, then they are just gatekeeping unless there is an actual technical requirement for it.",nekokattt,2025-06-23 17:09:09,8,learnprogramming,t3_1lifxxz,False,

Having docs for a function's dependencies makes it easier to read that function since you can now understand what it does without needing to ctrl+click into another context \- Debuggers are good, learn to use them \- Tests are good, learn to write them -- this is the core thesis of ""working effectively with legacy code"" \- Learn editor navigation shortcuts: be able to quickly navigate to that one class that you know the name of, to jump into and back out of specific functions, etcOverall, I'm fond to say ""productivity is an engineering problem.""

What works best for me is a combination of small targeted problems on different topics and using questions/answers to test my knowledge.I’ve used LLMs for this. I’ve asked them to list out the main things I need to know without going into implementation and to then come up with a series of questions that would help me practice it. I go through the questions and code up the problems it gives me without looking at a solution. I take it as far as I can. I’m not concerned with being right, I’m concerned with training my brain to think. Some of my best learning came from allowing myself to do it my way all the way, even if it turned out to be dead wrong, because that teaches me exactly why things are done the way they are. I then take my solution back to the LLM and ask it to give constructive criticism. You can also get problems from a book or a website, it doesn’t have to be an LLM, but I like the instant feedback.Additionally, in my notes, along with having definitions for things I’m learning, I also have a questions section. The goal isn’t to answer the question immediately, the goal is to track with honesty what I actually know vs. what I need to work on. For example, if I keep asking the same question 5 times across different problems, that’s an area I don’t truly understand.Bonus: LLMs are really good at pattern recognition.

Make decent effort to understand how to use various DSA entities, but do not waste too much time understanding DSA internals, as you always get a standard library that already implements DSA for you. You just need to know what DSA tool to use for what purpose. For the problem domain I would recommend either iOS apps in Swift/SwiftUI (the Apple Xcode development environment is of very decent quality, but unfortunately requires a macOS desktop/laptop M1 CPU system; you can also try [Swift Playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playground/) for a gamified learning experience if you can get your hands on an iPad) or maybe active web page development in JavaScript/React.

Moreover, you're right that nowadays it's very easy to look up things, but it's a matter of proficiency that eventually you should be looking up less things.For example, the first time I ever got a NullPointerException I remember it was a really difficult bug, I didn't know what pointers *or* null were, and I had to frontload learning all that. Once you've seen them enough though, you just know what it is, how it happens, and how to debug it, and usually (for NPEs caught early) it's a ~2 minute ordeal. I see stories online about people spending hours debugging missing semicolons: once you reach a certain level of familiarity with syntax, that just stops being an issue.As you start to get more proficient, people generally expect you to ""just know"" more. Seniors *are* very adept at learning new things in tech, and very good at finding information to fill their gaps. But they also know a lot, and can more or less jump into a moderate-complexity codebase and get to work without much ramp-up. It's not that they ""need"" to memorize the information, but that they need a certain critical mass of experience to be able to do their job effectively. (Try asking foreign language learners about the difference between being able to look up a grammar table vs having the table memorized vs being able to speak correctly.) This is all ignoring the logistics of how one even knows what to google for unclear issues.This especially applies with specialization: I wouldn't expect most programmers to know low-level details of memory layout, paging, CPU caching, etc, but since I write database internals, it's sort of critical to being able to do my job. OTOH I've met other devs at the same company that don't know the difference between RAM and disk, and they're doing fine in their expertise: it's just not a thing that's very relevant if you're working in some areas.So, overall, I think the answer is ""learn *some* things well."" You see people often reference T-shaped skillsets, where there's a large set of shallow skills (the top of the T) and a few deep ones (the vertical line). Syntax / basics are pretty much must-have, as well as some library/framework experience. But beyond that, be willing to dive into the details of tools you work with, practice learning as a skill, and start building that internal library.

You still have to actually learn how to program and you should learn it on SOMETHING, once you understand the concepts and get a flow for making things it becomes easier to pick up another language. I wouldn't leave yourself not understanding async for example, it is used almost everywhere, even if you aren't writing it, it will be built into the libraries you are using. The best way to learn is to do, so pick a language and try to write something with a thread or two just to see how it is done and run the thought exercise for managing the sync and flow of everything. I think the advice is true, when you get your job you will be working in the tech stack the company has and most of the difficulty will be figuring out the companies code base, so while you might be an expert in one language they may be using another. However, this does not mean that it doesn't make your life easier to know one language and just learn the ins and outs of the other language vs trying to figure out say async concepts while figuring out he language, it is much better to pick up a language and read what kind of async stuff is in the language while understanding the concepts and challenges ahead of time. It is much better to help you evaluate the code base as well if you have a good understanding of what 'good' can look like. Another interpretation of it might really be that you can't learn everything a computer can do now a days, it is essentially infinite as it continuously expands day bay day.

You already understand user problems and how systems break, which is half the battle.Between JavaScript and C#, honestly both are solid choices but I'd lean toward JavaScript for someone in your position becuase JavaScript is everywhere. Frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile apps, even desktop apps. More versatility means more job opportunities. The learning curve can be a bit weird at first but once it clicks, you're golden. C# is great too, especially if you're thinking enterprise development or want something more structured. Microsoft ecosystem is huge and pays well.At Metana we see a lot of career changers and the ones who succeed fastest are usually those with some kind of customer facing or problem solving background. They just ""get"" what users need in a way that pure CS grads sometimes dont.My advice? Pick JavaScript, build a few projects that solve real problems you've seen in help desk work, and apply for roles that value that crossover like developer advocate positions, technical support engineering, or even full stack roles at smaller companies.Either way you choose though, you're already ahead of most beginners because you understand the business side of tech.

But if you have a clear goal, like mobile development, or embedded systems or web development, then I think watching crash courses that focus on that alone is a lot more beneficial if you're trying to master your field of interest.

The fact that they're giving you your own features to plan means they see potential.At Metana, I always tell our bootcamp grads that the first 6-12 months are basically extended learning with a paycheck. You're not supposed to know everything yet. The goal is to learn fast and not make the same mistake twice.One thing that really helped me early on was keeping a ""learning log"".

Looking back at it after a few months was eye-opening because I could see how much I'd actually grown.Also, 5 months in and you're already handling complex features and supporting QA? That's actually ahead of the curve.

Just endless pain and headaches and frustration. But until you experience some of that pain, none of the strategies to solve it really make that much sense. And when you're starting out working on smaller projects, often a lot of code organization is kind of optional anyways because you're not dealing with enough complexity for it to really matter.So, like, sure, read about it. Think about it. But understand that what will make it click is getting your hands dirty in the guts of big, complex codebases.This is the kind of thing that, although there are principles that can be applied, really needs experience and developing some *intuition* for the problem in order to be able to do well at it.

mze24k3,"I think the easiest way to think about this is to think about what functions are actually meant to do. A function is a set of code that performs a specific task, and can be reused repeatedly. For example, thinking of a simple calculator application that we want to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. When we think about specific tasks that can be made into functions, it sounds like we will need a function for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as those are all specific tasks that we want to perform repeatedly. Of course, identifying functions gets more complicated for larger projects, but you don't need to know all the functions you could possibly need ahead of time. Modularization isn't something that happens completely up-front before you program anything, it's something that you will do throughout the programming process. For me what works is outlining functions I know I need at the beginning, then starting to write my program and looking out for sections of code that are reused multiple times. When I realize it is something that is going to be reused, I move it to a function. Basically, keep an eye out for things that your program will be doing a lot of. Any time you are seeing the same logic repeated, or have something that performs a specific task, those are good things to consider putting into functions.

mzhl766,"In my real world experience, unless you are maintaining a very large project over a long time period, software architecture techniques like modularization are overrated and sometimes harmful in that they can make it harder to pivot between different overall approaches to the application. In my opinion it’s similar in this way to object oriented design. I use a limited version of both in my personal projects and when I’m working on small teams.For modularizing, you generally start with one file, and then at some point you break it into multiple files just as a basic organizing step. And yes you often make classes to encapsulate natural units, like a matrix class, a networking class, a class for the application overall.But once you start going crazy with lots and lots of classes, and complex class hierarchies, you make it harder to make those fundamental pivots.As a simple concrete example, an oop book might tell you a personnel management app should have an Employee class and from that derive classes for various types of employees, probably using intermediate classes, like a Manager class, from which you derive UnitManager and SeniorExec, all with their own classes. This might work out well in certain cases, if you’re lucky. But in my experience, just make the one Employee class and give it a “type” member. See how far that gets you before making a tree of classes, each probably in their own code file.

mz5fxl0,"There are people who like the unknown and there are people who like the known. Those who like the known are those who prefer to live in a town where they are close to relatives and friends. The idea of going some place new where you have to make new friends is scary. Others will hop on a plane and decide to wander the Earth with no particular plan except to explore. They believe they will manage somehow. One is driven more by fear, and the other is driven by lack of fear.Anyway, it sounds like you want reassurances to make sure you know every step of the way where others would just jump in and do. You're probably concerned ""what if I get stuck and don't know what to do next"". You want someone to help you out. People may help, and that's great, but realizing that, ultimately, you have to look out for yourself is an important life skill. I myself fall into the category of wanting to know how I will do things ahead of time.But, let's just go through some of your questions.**What should be my ideal roadmap or study plan to cover CS50 efficiently in this time frame?**Try not to worry about the time frame. The course is set up for ten weeks, but this is a Harvard course and as a college course, it's pretty aggressive to finish so quickly. I would budget twice the time, maybe twenty weeks which is about 5 months, but take all the time you need. You don't have to race to the answer. You may feel like you have to be efficient, but expect to be slow, and don't pressure yourself to move faster because you'll likely skip information you need by trying to ""keep up"".**How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?**You've only given yourself 5 weeks. You are unlikely to finish unless you are either smart or cheat (you may think using ChatGPT is not cheating, but it is). The class already takes ten weeks for Harvard students, and you want to do it in half the time. Spending lots of hours, esp. on academic topics, is not always productive. There's this joke that goes ""if it takes 9 months for a woman to have a baby, then it should take 9 women 1 month each to have a baby"" which means that you can't speed up certain things. I mean, if you can spend that time and not go brain dead, then good for you. Give it a try. But most people find it hard to focus for more than about 3 hours a day. If you try for more, you'll need a break, and you'll have to be making some progress during that time.You might get through the C coding part if you happen to be quick (so 5 weeks).**How does submission of problem sets and projects work?**I think you need to read this and figure it out. It is a bit elaborate involving using Github and setting that up. Harvard doesn't want to be in business of managing user accounts. There are instructions on how to do this. I would say, outside of the actual programming itself, it's this part that's kind of annoying. You just have to follow the steps carefully, that's all. I would probably suggest using their version of Visual Studio Code (assuming they still use it).**Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?**You'll be instructed how to do this. This is the kind of question that suggest apprehension on your part. Read it, dig in, and figure it out. It's a useful skill to be able to work through problems.**Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!**The problem sets (which are the programming assignments) are challenging. I've taught intro programming and I would likely not give that level of difficulty to a class. In particular, CS50x uses more math than the projects I used to assign. Also, some projects are considered notoriously challenging. One is called Tideman. Usually, they have an easier version of the project and a harder one. You might opt to do the easier one.One reason Tideman is challenging is the length of the description of what to do. Beyond that, it's hard to visualize the arrays to place the data. If C were object-oriented, it might be easier to understand (though still not easy).Expect it to be challenging. Don't worry if you don't complete the course in a month. You're expecting a lot, maybe too much. Any progress would be considered good. Try not to be disappointed if you only get through, say, 3 weeks of the course in the time allotted. You're setting yourself up to be disappointed.Anyway, good luck. Hope you get done as much as you plan, but even if you don't you took some initiative which is a positive attitude.",CodeTinkerer,2025-06-22 13:36:39,4,learnprogramming,t3_1lhl3oj,False,

Focus on making sure that what you cover in x time, you fully understand and can demonstrably use (the problem sets will test this).I would take notes through using comments in your code. When you come back some time later to your code, comments really get you up to speed quickly. I would advise a good ol' fashioned notepad and pencil to help you with the problem sets.

But that was only because they knew how to do Google searches (I'm talking about those who took this approach before ChatGPT was a thing) and learned just enough to make progress.

They like the approach that allows them to work on a problem and get to a solution with the minimum amount of theoretical work. But it doesn't work for everyone.

mz7xybb,"In Python, `super()` and `Class.__init__()` are related to how inheritance works.In the first example where you use `super().__init__(side, side)`, `super()` is a special function that refers to the parent class in the method resolution order (MRO). When you call `super().__init__(side, side)`, it’s essentially telling Python to look up the inheritance chain and call the `__init__` method of the parent class (which in this case is `Rectangle`). This allows the `Square` class to inherit and use the initialization logic of the `Rectangle` class without explicitly referencing `Rectangle` by name. When `super().__init__(side, side)` is called, it sets the `height` and `width` attributes of the `Square` instance (which is `s`), because `super()` is calling `Rectangle.__init__` internally and passing the values to it.Now, in the second example, `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)` does something similar but directly. You’re calling the `__init__` method of the `Rectangle` class explicitly. Here, `Rectangle.__init__` sets the `height` and `width` attributes on the `Square` instance (`s`) in the same way, but this time, you’re directly referencing the parent class.In both cases, the key point is that calling `__init__` on a class (whether via `super()` or directly) will set up the attributes of the instance. When you do `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)`, it sets `self.height` and `self.width` on the `Square` instance, just as if the `Square` class was directly calling `Rectangle`'s `__init__` method.The reason this works, even though `Rectangle` is a class, is because `Rectangle.__init__` is a method that belongs to the class and can be called just like any other method. The instance (`self` in `Square`) is passed along, so it has access to the attributes defined within the method.",CommentFizz,2025-06-22 21:21:57,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lhli4s,False,

mz597cs,"`super` is indeed a class, but not a normal one. All classes in python return objects when instanciated. `super()` returns what the documentation calls a ""proxy object"".https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#superProxy objects are special. They are bound to a type and an instance of a type. When any method is called on them, they search the [method-resolution-order (MRO)](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order) for this combination, and call that instead.The actual call signature of `super`:```super(type, object_or_type)```Takes these 2 arguments. Usually, `type` is a class, `object_or_type` is an instance of that class. When called without argument but directly followed by a method call, these arguments default to the enclosing class and the calling instance.Therefore, let's break down what happens in the case you described:> super is a class therefore super().__init__(side, side) should create instance of the class super1. `super()` returns a proxy object, bound to the type `` and the current instance of that class2. `.__init__` tells the proxy object: ""Search the MRO for this instance of this class 'upwards' for a method called `__init__`""3. The search determines that the method to call is `Rectangle.__init__`4. `(side, side)` now calls `Rectangle.__init__` with `side` as the value for both arguments",Big_Combination9890,2025-06-22 12:54:20,10,learnprogramming,t1_mz50lpb,False,

Some aspects of game programming are much harder than the usual fields of programming.I would say it's only good if they're already interested in programming and it focuses on the hard parts of game programming.If the course focuses on how to make a game, then they'll learn how to make a game, not programming. Almost no game design courses teach any amount of programming.If it's writing their own game engine or something, then it teaches a lot more.Also you can't say ""learn to program"" and ""JavaScript"" with a straight face. It's sad to see the focus entirely on WebDev. What is the goal: do you want them to learn programming or WebDev?

But they basically learn no programming from it because it's using Scratch. I actually think that week could have been replaced with something better. Notice how they go all the way through an intro course and through Data Structures before they even start WebDev.I spent many years making games on Atari XE and graphing calculators. I went to a community college after that and learned basic programming. But a single Data Structures course was more impactful on my ability to program than all those years of experience combined.Also when I tutored math, people always said the same thing.

mz7wfqo,"I have tried making some introductory programming curricula based on making games, as well as an advanced DSA course - not as ""game design courses"", but simply using games as the applications that the students had to build.I still think it is an excellent idea, and it works really well, especially because when writing a game, you naturally run the code over and over, and it is never exactly the same, so you constantly discover new issues, more things to learn. Whereas if you build a program to display a list of items from a database, the moment you got a list, you are done, and leave that part of the code. Also, when you make a game you feel like you've built something - and you are proud to show it to others, and let them play it. Whereas when you've made a form for entry into a database, well ... :)And I believe that you can learn any programming topic from writing games - there's almost no single algorithm, pattern or data structure that doesn't fit into some game or other.However, I've had some issues - mostly with students and especially other teachers not understanding what they actually learned, so I'll give you some of them as ""warnings"" - not warnings against doing it, but warnings about how it might be received.* Students have a really hard time transferring skills between writing different kinds of software - when they learned how to write games, they didn't understand how it could be used in database-applications, when they learned frontend coding, they didnt' understand how it could be used in backend, then they learned terminal-applications they didn't understand how it could be applied to web-applications, and so on. It is important to add other kinds of applications using the same patterns as they learned in the games - so they don't think that it is a ""games course"", but see how learning to code with games, is just learning to code.* Students are extremely scared of math - not just matrix-calculations, or trigonometry, but something as simple as ratios, converting a number between 0 and 1 to a number between 50 and 300 is almost impossible for them to grasp. And in games there's a lot of math. Don't be discouraged by it, just be prepared to spend A LOT of time explaining even the simplest calculations.* Some students actively dislike having to create or even obtain graphics and other assets. But on the other hand they don't like just being given assets and ""forced"" to use them - expect to spend quite a bit of time explaining how to prepare those as well :)* As games get a bit more complex, there is a lot of prep-work in building the level or setting up the code for input. I recommend re-using code throughout the course, and copying in earlier ""blocks"" from some games to re-use later, so the students don't feel like they spend all their time typing in ""platform code"".* A lot of programming students nowadays actually don't know that many ""simple"" games, so it might be necessary with a bit of games history as well, to teach them about top-down, platforms, scrollers, shooters, and so on. I was surprised at how few of my references my students actually recognized - even when it got to board games!But otherwise, I think that it is a really, really good idea - and don't listen to the ""haters"" talking about how games programming and JavaScript isn't ""real"" programming!

Basic polynomial algebra? If I give it an unusual expression like 3 - (-(-2)), does it handle it as expected? If I give it a syntactically illegal expression like ""5 + \* 5"", or a mathematically illegal expression like ""3 / 0"", does it handle it gracefully without crashing?There's a **lot** that goes into building a calculator, and this kind of thing might be an interesting project. If you're not interested in calculators, don't think of it as a calculator: think of it as ""teaching the computer to understand commands"". This is a whole field in its own right - tokenising, lexing, parsing, building syntax trees, Backus-Naur, and all that - and this is a (small but significant) step towards building something like a compiler. (As a side benefit, it will also make you better at understanding and reading certain kinds of documentation.)Also: when you do this, you'll probably want to reuse your old calculator code, but you might find that extending your code to accept these new features is more trouble than it's worth, and you have to rewrite it from scratch. Don't be afraid of doing this, even multiple times if you have to - in fact, I think it's a really good thing in the learning stage. Implementing individual features is one thing, but learning how to structure large projects in a clean and modular way - so that you can swap out features, upgrade them, rewrite them without changing all the rest of your code - is a skill in its own right.>I saw a guy build a snake game that was cool.Why not try building that yourself? Or Pac-Man, or Tetris. It can be in the terminal if you want - just redraw the board as a grid of characters every second - it'll look ugly, but that's fine.That said, if you're feeling up to something a bit more of a challenge, then why not learn to use a library like [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)? That's a simple way of getting graphics onto the screen. Fair warning: once you start using external libraries, the difficulty **does** spike a little, because you're suddenly having to learn a whole new feature set that you know nothing about, with all of the syntactic difficulties that come along with it. In practice, what that means is you will spend a lot of time learning how to read documentation efficiently, which is also a crucial skill for a programmer.>I don't exactly know the full capabilities of c++ so I'm open to suggestions.Literally anything a computer can do, you can do it in C++. Most operating systems are written in C, which you can think of as a very bare-bones version of C++. Most modern programming languages have compilers / interpreters written in C/C++. Most browsers and web servers are written in C/C++. The main barrier here is not the capability of C++: it's the fact that even very ""simple"" software can be tens of thousands of lines of code, and you need to work towards that.

Since you have an EE background, build something that bridges that gap. Maybe a tool that visualizes electrical circuit data, or automates some workflow you know engineers deal with.

The 2008 Financial Crisis caused a 2nd ""bubble burst"".Go into CS because you enjoy it, but don't forget that the reason we get paid well is because not too many of us enrolled in Computer Science because so many people thought the bubble was bursting.Computation isn't going anywhere. The need for programmers will continue to increase for decades. AI will not replace programmers any time soon (in fact, it's becoming clear that it enables more modalities for computation and we'll need more).It's silly to me that we jump right to the notion of AI replacing programmers and don't discuss all of the types of jobs that use a subset of the total skills required to be a good software engineer.Logically, before you see a programmer wholesale replaced you'd have to see Translators/Court Stenographers/Draftsmen/Accountants replaced. They do a subset of work that programmers do with deterministic rules and regulations (which we don't have).There are so many canaries that need to die before we should be concerned.It stands to reason, how can a human hope to control a tool when they can't understand the output? You need LLMs to produce code that works 99%+ of the time, out of the gate, to hope to replace us, and/or have an extremely robust system of feedback loops plumbed back into the LLM with 0% hallucination. We're nowhere near that.I love LLMs in my own workflows, but it takes my experience to get the LLM on the right track even on small workflows. Even with specificity, I'd estimate that the LLM gets it right way less than 30% of the time, and it's my ability to debug and suggest fixes is what gets me to working solution.",MasterLJ,2025-06-21 18:15:21,62,cscareerquestions,t3_1lh2oaf,False,

My company is hiring right now and we’ve interviewed a bunch of people, many have been women. We’re super picky about culture fit, types of experience, and attitudes around programming though because we’re a small team so we have not filled this year’s three positions yet. I have been pleasantly surprised to see so many more women applying to these fields. There didn’t used to be very many of us out there.

I would talk to the manager about refining the screening process though if you’re not getting what you’re looking for. If you do notice any strange behavior or comments from him about women in engineering, keep track and note the date. There are unfortunately people out there that do discriminatory hiring in either direction because they have strong opinions on what their team should look like, and also there are a few creeps in the world that want an employee whose rear-end they can stare at. Not saying your manager is one of those, but if you hear other comments or see other signs then it could be that. As for the ratio, nobody really knows what it is right now.

mzef87b,"Go for it. IMO the toxicity of Meta is overstated on places like Blind, and Google's culture is worse than it used to be. It's true that Meta is overall more ""intense"" but what this really means is that people don't coast. Getting high ratings and raises is very doable, which is why everyone is trying to do it, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing. The E4 -> E5 promotion is probably easier to get at Meta.The biggest differences in my mind are:1. Meta is more customer metrics driven; a good project is a project that made the numbers go up. Whereas Google is more focused on alignment: if the senior engineers agreed your design was good, and your leadership thought it was a good idea, and you executed it well, then it was a good project regardless of what happens after. On the positive side, this means that at Google you can spend more of your time on risky, speculative things; at Meta you have to think about your time more like an investment portfolio, with some things you're pretty sure will pay off to ""fund"" your riskier ideas. On the negative side, as you advance in your career at Google you have to spend more of your time sucking up to leadership, because there is no objective way to determine whether your projects were good so it is more of a popularity contest.2. Google has better engineering practices, infrastructure, and documentation. This follows from Meta being an entertainment company; Instagram users will come back even if the app crashes sometimes, but Google Cloud customers wouldn't tolerate this. Things break pretty often at Meta. The downside of this is that you spend more time firefighting during oncall. The upside is that it's much easier to ship things. Code and design reviews are less nitpicky and there are fewer barriers to just doing things. It does mean that more knowledge at Meta is in people's heads rather than written down, so you have to build out a network of experts. There is more chatter and context switching as a result, although overall there are fewer meetings which is nice.If you were someone who disliked the bureaucracy at Google, Meta will be a good change of pace.

They were just issued a significant fine or regulatory finding because its use was ineffective. (more on this below) Your CEO wants to avoid being tarred with the same brush. \- the CEO thinks too many people were aware of the use of sapience. And therefore the investment wasn't paying off. CEO figures to cut the recurring maintenance cost of the third party product and your boss has said they can build an in-house tool that will be just as effective. On point 1 you should be aware that regulators regularly share findings with each other. So if company A gets a 'noted deficiency' the other auditors look for that in other companies. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_It's also possible that your SVP is being defensive. S/He's wary that if/when something goes wrong they will be the scapegoat. Possibly feels that the political winds are blowing the wrong way. S/He's setting this up so s/he has evidence if the feces hits the oscillating wind generator.

mzcohw4,"Before you entirely abandon this field, here are some things that might help.1,000 applications is intense. But applying online is also a saturated channel and an increasingly inefficient one. In the past 3 years, a bunch of recruiters got laid off, and according to our data, there are about 3X fewer recruiters working now than there were in the first half of 2022.At the same time, the number of (non-spam) applicants for eng jobs has 3X'ed since the first half of 2022. I don't have numbers for how many spam applications companies are getting, but if I had to guess, I'd say that it's probably another 3-5X increase.So, recruiters are maybe 30-50X less productive than they were a couple of years ago. Which, for you, means that applying online isn't the best approach.Before you completely give up and switch to a field that takes over 10 years to start making money, try doing outreach instead. You can give yourself a deadline. Something like, ""If I can't get some responses by January 2026, I'm going to med school."" And until then, I'd focus on trying to get in the door.So, what to do? I'm one of the authors of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We have a whole chapter on how to do outreach that includes some templates, and it's free: [https://bctci.co/free-chapters](https://bctci.co/free-chapters) It's the first document, and just go to Chapter 7: Getting in the Door.When you do your outreach, in the part of the template where you should mention something unique about you, try writing about how you were able to automate your job. I bet it's a good story.Finally, if you post a link to your resume/LinkedIn in a response to this comment, I'd be happy to review and share some notes. That said, you (and others in your shoes) probably don't need to spend lots of time on your resumes because recruiters typically scan them for brands, and either you have them or you don't. Anyone who tells you to spend a lot of time polishing your resume is probably selling snake oil.",alinelerner,2025-06-23 16:16:50,72,cscareerquestions,t3_1lijpsg,False,

This guy was a higher level engineer who basically developed everything and went out of his way to make the code 100x better and refactored. But he also was the AH engineer who cut people off, wanted to get in arguments over any little disagreements and would go on rants for over an hour if someone dared to disagree. People def walked on eggshells for him. The thing was, I think he basically knew there was very little they could do to fire him. This was in FAANG for a product that had many big time customers. Even with his AH behavior, he produced results even in his sleep. In my opinion he was like what teammates say about michael jordan, he wanted it so bad he didnt care if he was an asshole about it. It sounds great in sports but in an office job, it doesnt sound as great. He would tell my manager how to do his job. I could tell my manager hated the guy too but just was complacent with him.One time I worked with him on something major. I could tell he hated my work ethic. Im not saying I was perfect but I felt like I was getting a hand on the work at that point. When I was done, my manager decides to have a 1:1 to discuss my work with him and I basically get a list of what I could've done better. I accepted it and tried to improve on it. But guess what was in my next review session when I got underperforming, all the shit that the higher level engineer had said about me. I accepted some that I felt I could've done better but tried fighting the ones I felt were unfair. One that I remember the most was that there was a merge I did that had too many commits. I admit that it did have more commits but it was because the change we worked on had like 20 different iterations because everytime I wrote one change in, it broke something unexpected so it was a lot of trial and error. That one merge was an outlier from all my other work but it was used against me for the following year. I got Pipd shortly after.I saw the writing on the wall but I gave the company 110% and then I got fired early this year, a year after I worked with that guy.

It sucks that you are getting singled out, but you might be working on particularly sensitive or critical stuff and that might justify a much stricter review process.2. If you think it’s unjustified then you could try and have a 1:1 chat with the person in private and try to figure out what the problem is. You should not assume malice, they might be very busy. If you made an RFC previously, you should be ready to say you solicited feedback early and these concerns never came up, and that you’re finding it difficult to make progress at the moment because this late feedback is asking for major overhauls. You’re hopefully looking for them to back down, or for compromise, and to figure out how to avoid this problem in future. I would also think carefully about what this person is likely to respond positively to if you want a positive outcome, much depends on the individual here.3.

AI is a set of tools that can be used to expedite work and outsourcing is always going to be around in either consultants for specialty work or delegation to remove simple processes to keep costs down. Re- outsourcing Outsourcing or delegation of labor has been around for my entire career. Firms tend to dabble in an effort to think they cs save money and that staff are fungible. What’s not fungible is learning and understanding of vestigial projects. Where outsourcing works is when the team is seen as another dev group and can solve projects entirely on their own without constant supervision from home office because staff have relocated there and the firm is invested for the indefinite future. Otherwise it’s executives dabbling with consulting groups that fail because they need to call in more staff to do what is being asked or write better requirements.

If you do it solely for your own career and everyone/thing comes second, life will suck for others, and as I've seen personally, men will die. If you do that, fuck you.2. There's lots of roles related to this field, particularly in the AF. Look into those.3. If you do it, and serve honorably, you will not regret it. Of all the good, the bad, and the ugly, and there was a lot of ugly, it's the greatest point of pride in my life and I'm thankful every day that I did it. I gained so much, both materially and non-material. 4. Talk to actual vets/actives about it. Do NOT listen to anyone here who did not serve. My DMs are open. I was USMC infantry, but I have a lot of connections across fields and branches.5. It WILL help you in the job market. Good vets that get and into stem out have a great reputation of working hard, thinking critically, and being able to work under pressure. I was asked a lot in interviews about how my prior service related to my think critically and problem solve, as well as leadership roles.

Just ask if there's anything you should be doing while you wait on the onboarding stuff, but I'd try to write the message in such a way that you are not concerned/bothered by it.

This is an important soft skill, and like all skills, it takes practice.In my experience, it's actually really rare to be fired for performance unless you do like, literally nothing for months.

You end up doing 70% of two jobs that require very different skill sets and I think the only way most people manage is to put in extra hours.Once you’re beyond that level, I think your WLB actually starts to get easier because you’re no longer expected to write as much code. The problems you focus on are harder, but you have the ability to make more time to think on and you’re able to step away from the day to day work more.So yeah, I guess my point is that I think to get to any level above senior, you likely have to push through a few years of shit WLB, but beyond the senior level it actually starts to get better and not worse.",Drugba,2025-06-22 23:24:33,40,cscareerquestions,t3_1li0sht,False,

And I did get a lot done. But the key thing is that my day-to-day was flexible, so I could adjust what I was doing and how hard I was working based on circumstances or even just based on how I was feeling. I got a lot done by doing high-leverage work and figuring out more effective ways to achieve my high-level aims rather than working long hours.But that only worked because my manager was willing to trust me to make real decisions not just about how I was working day-to-day but also about what I was doing. I could go out, talk to people, understand their actual constraints and the interaction points between my system and other teams, then scope my work based on that rather than aiming for arbitrary deadlines or roadmaps. When you have the ability to just solve real problems rather than chasing output for the sake of output—and when nobody is trying to optimize your ""capacity""—you can get a lot done without working crazy hours or burning out.On the other hand, there are lots of teams and managers that do not operate like that. I've seen company planning processes that were clearly designed to put lots of artificial pressure on people and in those situations, yeah, a higher level role might be more stressful than a lower-level role. But even at those companies, at some point, you'll only be able to perform at a given level by doing high-leverage work rather than just working harder, so, if you don't burn out along the way, you'll learn how to have a large impact with reasonable(ish) effort.",tikhonjelvis,2025-06-23 05:47:53,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1li0sht,False,

Is working a LITTLE MORE than 40 ""killing yourself?""I'm not software but I am a senior engineer of a different discipline in a different industry (chemical engineer, at EPC), and if someone was only ever ""working"" 9 to 5, we'd be suspicious that they were working sub 40 hours a week, 35-40 ish. Given we ""bill"" every hour because we have to invoice and get paid for our designs by clients who want them, 40 hours on your time sheet means 40 hours of work. Not... 35 + paid lunch. You can and will get fired for that. You're free to report 35 + 5 hours OH, but people would ask why this is the case. I am positive I will be techsplained how software is different (yes I am aware, this isn't the point here).Not to get all Office Space Stan on people, but doing the bare minimum with respect to anything generally does not get you ahead. 9 to 5 and anything more being ""killing myself"" really sounds like 15 pieces of flare and no more. This isn't going to be rewarded, and it can be difficult to make a lasting impact if the bare minimum is all you're willing to do.It might be different in software, but senior around my parts implies a willingness to put in the work / time / hours when it is necessary. Projects succeed or fail on the willingness of the senior leadership corps to do what is necessary. Seniors are the critical force that holds the project together, that is their impact. After that, whether or not you experienced WLB during this time frame will be by how well a project is run, project schedule, how well defined a project is... all of which conspire to define how crazy a project is.For your case, it REALLY sounds like if you want that high TC, senior title, with ability to make impact, you're GOING to need to make peace with high pressure and hectic environments, and then critically, be willing to put in the time when it is necessary. So if your current work DOESN'T require this extra time and extra availability, then you're likely golden. Keep on going on. However, are your coworkers experiencing stress, working early, working late, to get things done while you're over here working 9 to 5? Are you complaining openly any time work requires deviation from this (don't do this if you are)? If you're working 9 to 5 while everyone else is working 7 - 6 and drowning... then you're NOT going to get senior there. You're NOT in the trenches with your team. You'll have to quit and get hired as senior somewhere else (good luck with that in this environment).For reference here... ""Projects"" I work on are 1.5 to 2 year affairs, the larger of which can easily be 1000-1250 FTE for factories/sites that can run 20-25 billion once tools are put in, with base infrastructure being between ~5-8 billion. Error bars on these projects exceed the total cost of other megaprojects. So these are huge... long affairs, involving many people. My point is, that for the longer durations on this, they look and feel a lot more like traditional work. People will remember if you put the bare minimum in or not and if the project suffered because people didn't go above and beyond.For context, I am currently on a mega project, we can't add anymore staff because we don't have any, and the project would benefit GREATLY from 45-50 hour weeks out of our junior engineering core for a month or three to get caught up. A few are doing this, and their scope situation is improving, but several others are not, and they're behind. Whether or not this is recoverable, is an interesting question. I'm not lead here... thankfully. So we have this weird situation where everyone is drowning short term, and the group is splitting into people who make an effort, and people who do the bare minimum. The career consequences of which won't be felt for years. For what it is worth, engineering staff gets straight time OT on billed work, so 60 hours means a 50% increase.

Employers are expecting devs to be fully knowledgeable of their tools and languages, but also to use AI to quadruple their output. Except, when you begin learning this stuff in 2025, it’s very difficult to force yourself not to use AI every time you get stuck, especially when your employer is expecting you to and their deadlines reflect that.Truly understanding programming comes from writing your own code from scratch, running into problems, and spending hours and hours nearly ripping your hair out trying to fix it. You can use AI to help understand small bugs or minor new technologies, but there is no substitute for building that foundation the hard way.**What should you do?** Keep using AI to get your intern work done, you’re already in and you’re doing your job. On the side, start really learning how to program. Since you’re already using JS, and it sounds like you’re going the web dev route so far, I recommend doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). Start with foundations, then do the JS course. No use of AI allowed, at all. When you get stuck, you have to research on good ol’ google. After you complete even just the first project all on your own, you’ll feel so much more knowledgeable. Don’t drop the ball, make a weekly schedule and complete the entire course.

mzh7qx1,"I work in Talent Acquisition for a large tech company and hire for MLE roles. There is a very strong chance that the exact role has not been open for eight months and that the company has simply been hiring engineers with a similar profile for an extended period of time. In recruiting this is often referred to as a ""pipeline"" posting or approach. I've shared some thoughts below regarding the information that you brought up in your post. \----**Timeline & Cooling Off Periods:** Regarding your viability, six months is a relatively short 'cooling off' period and most companies prefer to revisit after 12 months. This is generally a better timeline for a candidate building meaningful skills/experience/knowledge. **Interview Process:** Having an initial 1-2 part technical screening and 4-5 part onsite (six total) is standard, and your seventh interview round being a repeat round indicates that you did show some potential but likely failed in one key element (coding, design, or modeling). Sometimes this can result in a down-level, but that might have been the reason for the follow-up, to confirm if they should reject or down-level. **Recommended Approach:**Rather than trying to frame things as ""this position has been open for very long and you should reconsider me"" I would simply check in and see if they have any new opportunities that you can be considered for, and perhaps share some of the interesting work that you have been doing over the past six months that might make you more qualified. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a periodic check-in, and hiring volume can often change things (more hiring is better for candidates, less hiring often leads to a more challenging 'bar' for talent). I would still expect that it could be another 4-6 months before they reconsider you, though.",TMutaffis,2025-06-24 08:18:18,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1lj1ct7,False,

I went from 3/5 performance ratings down to 2/5 and then 1/5. I’ll admit shortly after bereavement I was still grieving so my performance wasn’t perfect. But even after improving and putting in more hours management would only grill me further. I knew it was a matter of time before a PIP. I had already started looking for a job. In between review cycles my manager pinged me 3 min before a 1:1 that someone would be joining the call. I knew it would be HR. They gave me the most generic of PIP’s in the world. I asked for specific benchmarks so I knew I was making progress and they refused. In the beginning I did put some effort into it because the job market was terrible but whenever I hit all the things listed on the PIP they would say there are other areas I wasn’t hitting and that even if I hit everything on the PIP I still need to hit all job requirements. Essentially I would get fired no matter what. Okay whatever. Halfway (PIP was 5 weeks) they said I wasn’t meeting expectations of the PIP. I stopped trying and instead focused on interviewing elsewhere. By the end of the PIP I still haven’t found a job but was in later stages of interviews with a few places. I got offered a severence package of 2 months salary and took it to “gracefully” leave the company. I also filed for unemployment.

You understand technical constraints, can talk to engineers without sounding clueless, and you've got that project leadership experience.But before you jump ship completely, maybe try focusing on becoming a technically aware PM rather than abandoning code entirely.

That means you're actually doing fine. Companies don't keep people around for a year if they're truly not cutting it.

The breakthrough usually comes when they start building real projects and connecting with other devs who share similar struggles and wins.Your current role is actually perfect for learning fundamentals properly. Enterprise environments teach you things bootcamps and tutorials never do, like working with legacy code, understanding business constraints, collaborating with teams.One year in is still super early.

n04y9ca,"My dude. You have been doing this for a year. Everyone knows you are not good enough and no one is expecting you to be. There is a reason you are a junior dev and not a senior dev.That being said a few words of advice from someone who's been doing this for 11 years. 1. The fact that you can acknowledge this at all and care about it puts you ahead of the game. This was all of us at one point, myself included. I basically lied to get my first job because I was so desperate and then I had to deliver. What did I do? I wasn't the smartest person in the room but I was willing to work more than anyone around me. I worked nights and weekends, not every one but when I had the time, I was working all the time. You don't have to do this forever, but I would recommend this to any dev new on the job. Absolve yourself of the idea of ""work life balance"", cause if you wanna be good and you aren't naturally gifted, its not gunna happen. Don't get me wrong, I still played hard on the weekends when I had time, but most likely, you are young and have very little responsibilities and you need to take advantage of that. Yourself in 10 years will be on your knees thanking you.2. I had a great professor in college that told me something I never forgot. ""A great developer has read for 15 minutes for every line of code he writes"". You need to read. Read everything, read all the docs of all the tools you're using, know them front and back. Read books, clean code, clean architecture (these are terrible books btw but you need to know them), gang of four, anything you can get your hands on about programming, read it and know it.3. You need to be kinder to yourself. Believing that you can do it is 90% of the game. Instill some fight into your spirit and dig in. No one is going to advocate for you like you can advocate for yourself. Positive affirmations, whatever it takes, you have to believe you are capable. If this shit was easy, literally everyone and there mom would do it. There is a reason it demands a premium in pay. I believe in you, you can do this, its gunna take some work, but you have an opportunity here to build a career that people would kill for.
