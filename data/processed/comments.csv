At that point Databricks is just a glorified cluster manager and notebook provider.Spark is just too cumbersome and too awkard to deal with. It isn't suitable for small use-cases, and in very large ones it can be arcane to figure out what is going on. People just can't develop skills with it until they are working at a huge scale, so they get chucked in the deep end with issues.These new tools will let people get experience on their own machine, it will let DS and DA roles grapple with things directly, and let everyone get essentially the same experience when they work at scale.",Anxious-Setting-9186,2025-04-30 08:01:29,93,dataengineering,t3_1kb974e,False,

You can process arbitrarily large datasets using a standard declarative syntax and not have to worry about running out of memory. DuckDB works well for single user / single node otherwise there is a plethora of other databases available if you need distributed processing or to share amongst multiple users.Spark is overkill for most situations and even for the situations it isn't overkill for you still have to question whether you actually want to deal with it.

mpvgbop,"Great post and reflections on your first year! Congrats if I must say so. It's genuinely good to see someone mapping out what they've learned with this much clarity, especially the enthusiasm for the core DE work – debugging, building, improving infrastructure. You've definitely hit on some crucial points that many take years to internalize.Things like focusing on pipeline resilience, code quality, and the importance of documentation are spot on. That’s the stuff that separates okay pipelines from robust, maintainable systems. The emphasis on CI/CD, templates, and understanding SQL fundamentals alongside frameworks like Spark/Pandas shows you're building a really well-rounded technical base. Keep that momentum going – the learning curve is steep, but you're clearly navigating it well.Just a couple of thoughts to add from experience:- You're right that physical presence can boost visibility and make ad-hoc collaboration easier, especially in certain environments or client-facing roles. However, it's worth developing the skills to achieve similar communication effectiveness and relationship building remotely. Mastering clear documentation (which you already value!), proactive updates, and strong asynchronous communication is vital, as many teams are distributed or hybrid. The core skill is effective collaboration, whatever the medium - so don't view remote work as inherently having fewer opportunities; it just requires different strengths.- Regarding DRY and OOP, I have no doubt they are good principles. Just remember the other side: sometimes abstracting too early or creating overly complex OOP structures can hurt readability more than duplicated code, especially for simpler tasks. Finding that balance between avoiding repetition and maintaining simplicity/clarity comes with practice. You're right to question when not to use OOP though!- You've got the right idea with watermarks and parameterization for the pipeline self-healing process. Also think about idempotency – ensuring your tasks can run multiple times with the same input and produce the same outcome. It’s key for reliable reruns and recovery. And as you mature your pipelines, layer in dedicated data quality testing on top of unit/integration tests.- Definitely keep that volunteering spirit intact to improve things. Just learn to balance it strategically cuz it's easy to get pulled into fixing everything legacy, so make sure those efforts align with broader team goals and don't consistently derail your primary project responsibilities.- This is more of a personal ick, but I generally don't emphasize too much on documenting the finer details of a codebase, since things change and us devs can spend more time documenting things instead of focusing on what matters to our stakeholders.Overall, your reflections show a great attitude and a solid understanding of what makes a good DE. You're focusing on the right areas – technical depth, process improvement, and collaboration. Keep learning, stay curious, and continue refining that craft. You're well on your way :)",t2rgus,2025-04-30 17:23:01,2,dataengineering,t3_1kbctlt,False,

And my experience with pre commit and linter has largely been negative. Documention is always extremely valuable. Consistent naming conventions and packages is critical. Our consultants did neither and it is a shit show. OOP can be helpful in some regards, but I'm with you that FP is more than sufficient for the bulk of jobs. OOP overcomplicates, makes debugging more difficult and time consuming, and is rather rigid. It's worth it if it is scalable, but if it takes the same level of effort to cram all the SQL and configs into an OOP approach as just coding it from scratch in FP, you might as well use FP. I'm coming up on my 1 year as well. My biggest lessons have been think in terms of frameworks (how can you organize your code, how can you automate or parameterize development, etc.), that you simply can't learn everything and delegation is critical, knowledge of the business data is extremely important, that InfoSec is a PITA, and think through things before implementing anything (nothing is ever as simple as it first seems).",BoringGuy0108,2025-04-30 17:30:49,1,dataengineering,t3_1kbctlt,False,

You can define columns without reference to dataframes, so you can make a list of column expressions *before* you work with the dataframes.edit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Your slice [] of the map column based on a key means spark is creating a column expressions mapping every key:value in mapping, then throwing it all away to pick a single key from the map.~~All of this requires communication between spark and pyspark, which takes time. When you do it 600 times it takes a while.Every time you chain dataframe defining functions pyspark calls out to spark to build a plan. Time spent on the plan increases exponentially as you have more steps as each step takes longer as it builds on the last. 600 dataframe definitions is a lot.Do the `json.loads` once for each mapping, not for each variable for each model. edit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Don't create a full map column just to select one key out of it, just get the value from the original mappings dict. Don't chain withColumn, generate all the column definitions into a list then do `df.select(""*"",*listofcols)`~~ edit: fixing 2am mistakes...Even though the key you pull from the map is the value in column 'v', you are parsing and defining the same map dtype column multiple times -- 150 times if it is the 10 models and 15 variables looping over the same 4 mappings. Think of the size and complexity of this query as it gets built out, where spark is generating 600 chained 'views' with hundreds of mapping objects, and every mapping gets used so cannot be discarded before processing.In pandas you don't have this because the mapping object is available in the same process directly and doesn't need to be duplicated data per row. It also processes the dataframe in full at each step, so it can discard any previously used map as it goes. Whereas spark can't access your dict directly and has lazy evaluation, so it has to 'remember' every single generation of every map field all at once when it finally runs, and will be duplicating the data into each row in its behind-the-scenes rdd.You want to only parse each model once, and only generate its map once, and reuse that. You also want to make a list of your output columns then use `.select()` on them all at once. To make the reuse explicit you can split it into two selects. df = some_input m = model original_colnames [c for c in df.columns] # parse the mappings once mapping_dicts = [json.loads(mp) for mp in mappings) # generate the mapping cols once mapping_cols = [ F.create_map([F.lit(k_or_v) for kv in mapping_dict.items()]).alias(f""map_{i}"") for i,mapping_dict in enumerate(mapping_dicts) ] # define all variable redirections through the map all together mapped_cols = [ F.col(""map_{i}"")[F.col(f""some_var_{v}"")].alias(f""new_{m}"") # something seems off here for v in variables for i in range(len(mapping_cols)) ] # generate new dataframe new_df = ( # define a dataframe with the mappings in a first step # (so you can easily view this df if you cut the code up) df.select( *original_colnames, *mapping_cols ) # use the defined maps to generate the output columns .select( *original_colnames, *mapped_cols ) ) return dfNote that you don't *have* to do this in two selects if you reuse the actual column objects, but then you can't as easily check the intermediate state with just the mappings available.",azirale,2025-04-28 17:11:34,12,dataengineering,t3_1k9wng3,False,

mp5fv8t,"I was very successful on my project with customer matching, exactly what you are talking about. We wound up buying a tool. Biggest single take away is that it’s not “can you do this” but rather “how accurately can you do this”. There are so many tools/techniques that can do this - but the accuracy levels vary. As you pay more, or get more sophisticated, your match accuracy and speed goes up. For example, on the easy end would be to compare address line 1, city, state, and zip from multiple data sources against each other and make the match. There are so many problems with this, so it’s not very accurate. Examples of higher end algorithms include:- Typo detection with various string compare/character distance algorithms- Phonetic representation (matching on how words are spoken not spelled to account for typos)- Address tokenization (not matching 123 4th ave. To 4 123rd ave, because you parse an address into what it represents (house number and street)- Nickname substitution (Tom matches Thomas)- Abbreviation matching (CIA matches Central Intelligence Agency)- Address validation - comparing an address to the US Postal Service to see if it’s real (don’t try matching fictitious addresses)- Understanding name titles - (Mrs, Miss, Sir, Jr, III, II, etc. John Thomas can match Mr. John Thomas, or John Thomas II is different from John Thomas III)Etc…. You get the point…Ultimately, there are two big things: match accuracy and match speed. Accuracy evaluates two records against each other using all the different rules, scores each one, and then this is where you come in — you set weights on the different rules to “tune” the algorithm. Essentially, you are optimizing either overmatching or undermatching — you will never be perfect. In some cases you want to overmatch (say you are sending direct mail promotions and are fine accidentally grouping father and son as same person). In some cases you prefer to undermatch (say you are grouping medial records/data and don’t want to give a child the medication his father is prescribed because you incorrectly linked the two as the same entity). Second big thing is speed. Ultimately, you are comparing each record against each record - do the math…. It’s too long to actually compute. So, these tools take short cuts - they actually only compare subsets of data against each other (important- this means some rows will never be evaluated for a potential match). For example if record 1 is “123 1st St, NM USA” I don’t actually need to compare this one against any data that isn’t from the state of New Mexico (NM). HOWEVER, what if I’m wrong about the original record being in NM? If I am, then I have no hope of making a match (let’s say it’s actually in MN - typo) so my accuracy is compromised because of my speed algorithm. So, again, this is why you pay more as features go up. Can you have speed and accuracy - sure, but it will cost you.NOTE: As an interesting aside, I was also on a Material Matching project. Materials are very different from customers, it’s actually not a data problem but an image recognition problem. Our first approach was to treat it like customer and look at attributes we stored in data (length, width, etc.) and perform the match. It was terrible. Poor data quality, and you can’t capture enough data - for example, you might have same H,W,D and weight, but you don’t capture “right hand” or “left hand” part (which makes them different). The answer is software that matches visually looking at the CAD drawings in 3d. Very cool, and very expensive. Really isn’t a BI problem at this point, but an Engineering problem since it’s in the CAD world.EDIT: you will need a manual method to override matches, and fix them. In my project our software matched 95% of the data correctly!!!! The business had to use 5 full time head count for 1 year to perform the additional 5% match. So - this should tell you how valuable the software is, and how difficult it is to manually match millions of rows of data. EDIT: I didn’t state this, but the process is to create “groups” of data (entities). So, your target data is [group id or entity id], [record id], [attribute columns: name, address 1, city, state…]. The group id/entity id field is just the master record, record id. This can be set as the first record that forms the group/entity (group id=record id) or you can use logic to ensure this is your “golden record”. You have many matching rules, each rule matches rows using the various match algorithms above (think of it as sub-matching) - we had 3 big ones. Highest weight rule was where all attributes matched between two records (name + address), rule 2: name + zip matched, rule 3 - address only matched. First step of the process was a data quality phase - ensure all records have these fields populated - ie: if zip is blank or wrong, we look up address to populate the zip. EDIT: What exactly is a “entity”? You’ll find really interesting situations in your data. For example, for us an entity was a customer/account. We found situations where a customer has multiple buildings, each on different roads (close to each other on their property) which made the addresses very different, requiring manual matching override. Think of a large corporate campus, university, or government facility (military base). All those buildings are on different roads, with different addresses - but are the same entity. It’s very unlikely the tool will match them, since it matches addresses.. so manual overrides are needed (unless you can work in reference data and additional rules about all the various streets on the campus…)EDIT: you’ll also get matching logical problems where record A matches record B, and record B matches record C, so that means A=C. But it shouldn’t…so you have this huge blob of over matched records you need to manually split up. The incorrect matching is coming from data quality problems. Essentially, you have 1 bad address row causing two entities to be incorrectly linked. This can happen when businesses use central billing locations - like a corporate headquarters, or a state/city office. For example, the city cemetery and the city water treatment, and the city transportation service all get linked because their data comes to you via the cities single administrative building with a single address.EDIT: I really liked this book. Data Matching, by Peter ChristenEDIT: Think about what you are going to do with the data. If it’s data warehousing only, you might want to build a “reference style Master Data Management database”. This essentially is only used for data warehouse/analytics, and consumes data from systems but does not push data to source systems (or claim to own customer). But if you need to create the enterprise definition of the truth, and your job is to “own” the definition of customer for the enterprise — then you need to catch customer data being entered in various source systems, master it quickly, and push it back to those systems. There are different styles of MDM architecture/tools. Same matching principles - but speed and integration becomes a more important requirement.",rotr0102,2025-04-26 14:27:15,21,dataengineering,t3_1k8dmdp,False,

There's a quote about writing in general - ""Perfection is achieved, not when there is *nothing* more to add, but when there is *nothing left to take away*"". Giving someone 6 page CV isn't going to make them think ""this person is seriously experienced"" it's going to make them roll their eyes a bit. That shouldn't discount that candidate (I definitely wouldn't throw a 6-page CV in the bin, for example), but it definitely doesn't help.2. making ""hail mary"" applications as an entry-level dev for a position that is advertised as a senior position may *feel* productive but is kind of a waste of your time and the recruiter's time. There may be exceptions - maybe they were planning on also hiring someone junior and may contact you about that position - but that's kind of rare.Similarly for the ""there's no such thing as entry level in data engineering"" - that's someone trying to appear profound, but instead is frankly coming across as an unhelpful dick.If you're lacking experience try for internships, give Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a shot, try to do some self-study and personal projects or find some open source project you can contribute to.

Coalesce is built for tech and non-tech users that want to quickly build data transformation, machine learning, and/or Cortex pipelines by means of an intuitive point & click interface. Documentation is automatically generated in Coalesce as you create nodes. There are so many other features about Coalesce that I love. But your question is about version control, so I'll stop rambling about my love for Coalesce. Within Coalesce, each project is assigned a Git repo and branch. Every single change can be committed or rolled back. There is also a nifty AI commit message generator that saves several seconds when checking in changes. The change control window in Coalesce is similar to Git - it has two panels that show your modifications vs the last committed version and the changes are highlighted. As for committing all changes or line item, it really depends on how frequently you commit. In my experience, I typically commit every time I make a considerable change to a node (dimension, stage, fact, etc.). I don't commit if I change a single column because that is a bunch of overhead in my opinion.",MacaronSuperb2881,2025-04-26 03:28:48,4,dataengineering,t3_1k7yq0d,False,

Also you may want to consider DuckDB as it could also just be an easier way to accomplish transforming your data.While NoSQL is definitely useful, it isn’t something I’d suggest anyone just getting started to even consider. Stick with CSV or even better, parquet.Also if you do BI, I’d suggest streamlit as it is Python based and they have free hosting to show off your project.Lastly and I know I’m being nit picky, but Scala isn’t dying, it is just the use cases where you need to use it over Python are only at massive scale.

In case 1 (copy on write) all the parquet files containing the deleted rows are rewritten in a new file to omit those rows, and then the metadata json files are updated to point at the new parquet files. In the second case (merge on read), a special metadata file called a deletion vector is written that identifies which rows in which parquet files to ignore on read. For performance, every so often you do the steps of the first method and produce rewritten compacted parquet files.

mp4e1s9,"The short answer is clustering can be beneficial when inserting records if implemented correctly. The long answer:Columnar storage in general (not just BigQuery) is usually stored as read-only files that have built in metadata describing what data is in each column. This allows for more efficient filtering at the file level. It is slightly more complex than this when it comes to a Data Warehouse like BigQuery, but generally when you “merge” a record into columnar storage, you can think about the operation like this:1. Search for the file your data is potentially in based on file metadata2. If the record could be in a file based on the metadata, read the existing data in to memory3. Find the matching rows in each column4. Update them if they exist5. Overwrite the existing file in storage and update the file metadata if a record was insertedClustering improves look up speed in this process by making it more efficient to find the right file to operate on. For instance, let’s say you have a table of product purchases with a reference to the customer who made the purchase. This table has mutable attributes like product delivery date (NULL until it has been delivered) that need to be updated on delivery of the product. An appropriate clustering field for this table might be customer_id, which would logically group all purchases by the associated customer_id when writing to a file.

mpb52bo,"As a fellow self taught that spent 10h daily for a full year, and about to start my first job after successfully switching careers with zero coding background, some tips:- Pick one language you will focus on and get extremely good at, dont spread yourself thin. Languages are tools, concepts translate between them. If you master one, then you'll stand out vs. others who mastered none, and you'll pick up any language required of you on the job in weeks.- DSA classes & Leetcode. Most important part of CS due to how interviews are structured. Do 250 most common LC problems and focus on easy/medium unless targetting FAANG for first job.- Build practical projects. Initially start simple, like that easy react page you created. You learn by doing 10x faster than tutorial hell. You need to learn how to structure your own projects and build something from A to Z, from having an idea to breaking it down in small parts and building it out (without guidance provided in tutorials).- Project structure for bigger applications, everything has its own place and the quicker you start modulating projects the way they do in production the faster you'll grow.- Find a specialization and focus on it. Try simple projects: react frontend page you did, then try building a backend API with CRUD, try building a simple ETL pipeline for data, then try a simple github CI/CD with github actions and dockerize one of the apps. Nothing complex. Cover basics of each, build them in a few days, and then ask yourself: which one seems most interesting to you, which one seems like something you'd like to pursue?Specialization matters heavily. Everyone spreads themselves thin, and if your goal is to achieve what CS grads do in 4 years, you should pick something early on and master one area. Become employable in it asap, enter the field and learn rest on the job.I went for full-stack Python+TypeScript React. Docker & Github Actions.

mpj31lm,"I've won hackathons before. Best tip is to practice with an existing team, as a team, and do mock hackathons. If you know react, and what packages to download, you can build something in less than 12 hours. First 4 hours might be planning and reading the docs, 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours to clean up and submit. 12 hours of productive coding. We can break down the 12 hours even further if you want, but assume also each team member knows what they are doing and we can do it in parallel. Initialize the git repo, frontend, backend and database on local host with a decided framework. Database can be hosted on the cloud. Frontend is probably react, or vue, with tailwind css or bootstrap as the UI framework or use another one with copy and paste components. Backend can be flask or django, or if you want, ignore backend completely and just connect frontend to the database directly. (don't do this with real production code). (takes around 1-2 hours) Your team of four starts splitting up work. One or two guys start working on frontend with the UI framework. One guy working on util libraries and business logic as well as api and webhooks. Another guy working on the database. You may have a floater or a guy that finished early to do merges and resolving merge conflicts. (3-6 hours)Working in parallel will require constantly preplanning what tasks are important that have a lot of other tasks dependent on it and which tasks have a lot of dependencies itself. (but at this point you should be polishing up) (3-6 hours) Cloud hosting is quick and easy nowadays, should only take 1-2 hours. It might take a while to figure out the dockerfile and which cloud hosting platform will help the most.If you know what you are doing, and use existing open source frameworks and solutions, you can cut down the time spent writing boilerplate code and just focus on connecting API calls and endpoints. ----# Just a few tips 1. Already find your team of four and practice with them before the competition. Treat it like a war game if you want. Go into what if scenarios and try and build real projects together. 2. Look into the hackathons previous winners and losers from previous hackathons. Try and figure out how the judges pick the winners. Do the judges really care about ML technologies? or do they just care about fancy UI? Some judges care about how many microservices you used and/or how big your techstack us. Do a lot of preplanning to figure out what the judges like. 3. As the competition gets near, usually company names start appearing, judges names start appearing, as well as the challenge names. Do a lot of research on the companies and judges. If you wanna score points from a company, look into what API libraries they might want you to use. If you want to score points with a judges, and they are industry or professor, do a challenge that they can relate to. 4. Never rebuild the wheel. Use other people's code. Use open source frameworks and code from github.No hackathon winner will ever build their entire stack. The use frameworks and existing solutions. The only thing they will build themselves are the connections between the frontend and the backend as well as the business logic. 5. Add as much techstack and bloat as you can. Host it on a bunch of microservices, use OAuth, host it on the cloud. Add infinite horizontal scaling. Judges for some reason like that, even if it does nothing for your app. 6. The app doesn't even have to work. It only needs to seem like it works. --- Winning hackathons is a specific skill, and only some of it is transferable to actual industry. Over representing your app to judges probably isn't something you will do in industry, and hard coding stuff is probably something you won't do.

Or that the code was incomplete, because I hadn't finished writing it.Also, one time we had a miscommunication and someone pushed that dev code to prod while I was on my lunch break.Once, I was told to push something we were still revising the DB schema on to dev, and then that same manager gave a client a URL to test it on our dev server, and suddenly we had to work around maintaining that clients (easily replaceable) data, and even had to write a conversion for it later.So, to summarize (my personal experience in hell), any code that leaves your computer should be complete and tested before it hits a dev server, because some non-technical stakeholders don't understand what dev servers are for.

Without those skills, you can't get any experience, so it's a necessary part of the puzzle! But the tech boom of the last decade or so has meant a **lot** of people have learnt some coding skills, so jobs increasingly require both skills **and** experience.>how the heck does programming even work? What the hell is happening?Think about a simple circuit, with a battery, a push button and a lightbulb: you press the button, the lightbulb switches on; you unpress the button, it switches off.Now imagine you have a 7-segment LCD display (like the ones on digital clocks that display numbers): that's just 7 versions of the same thing, so in order to display the number ""5"" on your screen, you need to press and unpress the right combinations of 7 buttons. But that's really annoying, so instead, you create a mega-button labelled ""5"", and just wire it so that when you press the ""5"" button, it press and unpresses all the right buttons for you. Congratulations: you have abstracted away the electronics, and now you have a simpler interface.Programming is just that: abstractions upon abstractions. You can't write a ""hello world"" program by interfacing with the monitor directly - mapping each key on your keyboard to the setting and unsetting of individual pixels - primarily because that would be insane. It would be like my 7-button example above, but trillions of buttons. Computers would be utterly unusable without abstractions to handle all that for us.>I know I could probably just import a GUI library and use it, but I don't want to just use a library, I want to understand how this technical stuff (that my school didn't teach) works.Firstly, don't blame your school for not teaching you how to build a computer from scratch out of transistors and diodes. That's like complaining that your school allowed you to buy pens and notebooks, rather than teaching you how to grind your own ink, whittle your own quill, fell your own tree and process it into paper. If you're really, deeply interested in that, then you **can** work towards it: it's not a bad thing to do, it's just a very niche thing to do. For most people, as they transition from school to work, they should really be focusing on what they need to do / learn / practise to make their skills **productive**.

Not overly comprehensive and could be great paired alongside Frontend Mentor for projects.\-Frontend Mentor is great for practice projects.\-The Odin Project is probably the most comprehensive resource for frontend online but its not for everyone. There is tons of reading and it takes much, much longer to complete than other souces. However, its up to date and really enforces the fundamentals. Might be best to choose another resource if your focus is backend though since this goes deeper into frontend than you'd probably need to know.\-FreeCodeCamp launched a new curriculum recently. I haven't tried it but it looks pretty good.Backend:\-Boot.dev is a newer resource that teaches backend fundamentals in a ""gameified"" learning experience where you earn XP from completing problems. Probably one of (if not the) best resource for learning general backend skills, my only gripe is their focus on Go. Go isn't as in demand as some other backend langauges, but they are launching a Typescript path soon for those who don't want to learn Go.\-Hyperskill is a lesser known resource where you get lots of hands-on practice. I used this website to learn Java and I can't recommend it enough. The projects are great and after every lesson you are given plenty of practice problems. The only downside is that its a little unclear when you should start on projects and some of the practice problems pull from content you haven't learned yet but other than that its a great platform that has integration with Jetbrains IDEs.\-The Odin Project also covers Node.js if you're interested in that. They also have a Ruby on Rails path but I wouldn't recommend it.\-Since you mentioned C#, I've heard good things about [https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) although I haven't tried it myslef. Also Microsoft recently launched a full stack developer course on Coursera using C# for backend.Whether you want to learn frontend or backend first is really up to you, just make sure you apply your skills once you learn them with practice projects. The platforms I listed here are all really good about making you practice the skills you've learned. That's why I didn't recommend Udemy courses, because while there are some instructors that do a good job teaching, projects usually involve you just watching them code and copying what they do. I could see using Udemy for frontend paired with Frontend Mentor though, Colt Steele and Jonas Schmedtmann are probably your best bet for that. Also, I would avoid the full stack developer bootcamps on Udemy, since they are often just surface-level knowledge. Lastly, if you ever plan on getting a CS degree I would go with WGU.

Your best bet falls in Webdev and maybe cyber. Cyber you can get in to on your own by doing online courses and certifications but this is less programming and more just security information.

mp6xrvs,"PHP is a fundamentally badly designed language. There are a ton of problems with it. With modern frameworks and development methodologies, and especially the advancements PHP itself has made over the years, it has improved, and it's definitely possible to write perfectly fine programs with it, no doubt about it. But it still remains a mess at its core. I'm saying this as someone who has worked with it for decades, wrote articles defending it, and who's still the top answerer of all time in the Stack Overflow PHP tag.If you compare it to properly designed languages which are internally consistent and not full of pitfalls, everything in PHP just feels like a dirty hack. Again, while you _can_ build perfectly fine stuff with it… why not use a better language?IMO, the only thing PHP does better than any other language is the seamless integration into HTML pages. Which is how it got started anyway, and why it's so easy to pick up, and why it's become so popular. Because the progression from dicking around with HTML to adding some programming to said HTML is seamless and easy and likely a natural gateway drug for many. But even modern PHP frameworks don't use this strength of PHP anymore, they use separate template engines like any other language does too.

My experience with them is that you end up with a lot of test cases, that's a lot of code to maintain. Most if it is repeated and exercising the same part of a function dozens of times. I often find unit tests that aren't testing anything at all, but rather validating assumptions of the language or platform, which is completely inappropriate and a waste of time. I've read plenty of great unit tests too, I've just grown exhausted pruning and curating them.What people don't often account for is that tests aren't just expensive to write, but they can be expensive to maintain too. Because of this, I prefer a smaller curated set of tests that cover larger scenarios than a 'code unit'. Not integration tests, but something that exercises the actual intent of the application as thoroughly as possible while not requiring real dependencies to be set up. Then I use a comprehensive monitoring solution to detect when edge cases occur in our production environment.Everything is a trade off.

When I was writing file parsers as part of an automated test tool (it took in a file describing expected values and various data recording files), I studied parsing techniques. I wrote a variety of one-off programs that parsed the various input file formats and then turned them into libraries that could be used by the actual target program. Each one of these took me 1-5 days (some formats were simple, others were not, by the end I was able to reuse code as well for similar formats), then I integrated them into my main program and glued it all together and had a beta version for my colleagues.What I didn't do was try to implement all the parsers all at once (context switching between each task) or only write them as part of the main program with no way to evaluate my partially working system. By setting them up as these one-offs I was able to stay focused, generate some tests, and figure out if I really was parsing the data correctly (mostly taking the parsed data and regenerating the original files and comparing the two).If you have multiple projects that you want to complete, set deadlines. Decide that ""By 15 May I want project X to have features A, B, and C."" Then do it. If there's no external driver of priority (no work or school objective, all personal) you declare your priorities. Otherwise everything is the same priority and no progress is ever made. Even for work I do this. If I have a 12-month project with no one deciding which features needed to be done by a particular date, I just set them myself.

Unless your goal is to research new algorithms, then those are indeed all of the steps - and yet there's an enormous amount of nuance and complexity hidden there.1. Bring in the data - this part is easy if someone else has already done the hard work of collecting the data, but in many real-world scenarios the data hasn't been collected yet, so this might involve building apps, sites, custom tools, scrapers, whatever is necessary to collect the data for your particular application.2. Clean and prepare - this can be quite subtle and nuanced. If you accidentally bring in any features that are biased or correlated with the class you're trying to predict, your model will overfit and you might not realize it until months later when it fails to work in production.3. Call the class of algorithm and fit - this seems easy when all of your data fits in RAM, but once you start trying to train on hundreds of terabytes worth of data, this is no longer simple. Also, when you have to wait days to train instead of minutes or hours, it becomes far more important to figure out how to validate your approach on smaller subsets first before trying to train on everything.4. Predict - in most real-world scenarios you're not just calling predict once, you're trying to take that model and embed it into an app so that it can do real-time predictions.

I am trying to align your expectations to be more realistic so you have a better chance of success if you're actually serious about this being more than a fun hobby.The level you are at now (know the basics of HTML and CSS, and a little bit of interaction from JS) is where I would expect someone to be after a few weeks. Not a year. You are nowhere near being ready for work. So have a serious think about if you want to do this, and if you do commit and set yourself up for success.For a junior role you will need: \- A solid understanding of TypeScript\- A solid understanding of some front end frameworks / libraries (React & MUI/Mantine/Shad-CN)\- A solid understanding of some backend framework (Express/Hono/etc)\- A solid understanding of testing\- A solid understanding of databases and ORMs\- A solid understanding of surrounding tech such as GitHub & Actions etc. Nobody, in 2025, is building websites with basic HTML and CSS. That is how we did it back in 1999. And commercial work is going to require that you have the skills and understanding necessary to work in a modern way. The bar to entry is high. That's why the pay is also good.You can do this. But understand that you are currently on step one of a one-hundred step journey.",Naetharu,2025-04-29 08:59:52,5,learnprogramming,t3_1ka9uth,False,

Yes, they can slow down your loop if the branch predictor guesses wrong, because the CPU pipeline will have to flush its pending work. But branch predictors are pretty good, so unless the if statement is very unpredictable or 50/50, you'll be fine.edit: As far as optimizing if statements out of loops, sometimes you can split the loop into two loops with separate logic, and that allows you to extract the if statement outside the loop.

mq3zj2i,"So, IF statements most of the times, are two (or one) instructions in your processor, the compare instruction, which will set flags bits in a special register, and a second part after that, that will execute only if the flag bits are set, it could be a call, could be a jump, whatever. In modern ISAs, you typically see cmp and jump instructions bundled in the same one, this would be executed faster than two instructions, but the jump offset addressing is usually smaller.How fast are those instructions? Well that would depend on the architecture, but I assume they are done in a cycle easily.Of course, if you don't need the IF, your program would obviously be faster, because you reduced the need for an extra instruction.But in reality, it shouldn't make it that much slower (remember one instruction only), but since IF is used to cover side cases, it'll obviously make your program bigger, how big you may ask? Depends on what the compiler optimizes the if to, it could be a branch with a link, it could be a skip, etc...If you're strictly testing loop scenarios, just think to yourself ""every time I run this loop, I am doing an additional instruction"" so if the loop is 8 instructions long, and one of them is the IF instruction, then yeah, it would make it somewhat slower.

That being said, low code environs can be massively helpful in niche fields like computational geometry where having visual feedback for geometry manipulation is - I'd say - almost mandatory.From what I've seen so far - no-code or low code tech seems to thrive in cases where (a) the majority of the users aren't programmers, and (b) outputs from these technologies aren't the deliverables in and of themselves.By deliverables I mean the end product being shipped/deployed/put into production.For example, in the construction industry - architects and engineers will frequently use no-code solutions to build quick and dirty prototypes for their projects. But these prototypes aren't the deliverable, the drawings and 3d models are. They'll use the prototypes as seeds/base for building mode complex models sure, but the direct output from a no-code or low code solution is rarely ever passed on as the actual deliverable.To sum it all up - For a typical career in programming, I feel you don't really need it (outside of cases where using them speeds up the feedback loop).

You are stepping into a global market where you will be competing with people who have years of experience, full portfolios, and plenty of client reviews. Platforms like Upwork are crowded, and getting your first job there can take a long time unless you already have something that makes you stand out.In your case, it might be smarter to focus on getting a regular full-time developer job first. That gives you some structure, experience, and something real to put on your resume. And if your long-term goal is to work remotely, you can still work toward that in parallel.That is the path I ended up taking. I spent months applying to ""remote"" jobs that seemed like a perfect fit, only to find out they were limited to one country, or I got automatically rejected because of my location. Eventually, I realized I had to take a different approach and decided to get an on-site job first. Then, I started researching companies that actually hire globally. After over 200 hours of research and trying to apply to hundreds of jobs, I ended up building a list of 300 truly remote-first companies.

We can use optional chaining to access an existing property's value, but we can't use it to assign values to an existing property, nor to create properties w/ assignments (if the property doesn't already exist). Why not? Seems like it'd work.But it doesn't, it isn't that simple, and making it work would short-circuit all sorts of other things JS does. However, I do believe there are some JS proposals to add ""optional chaining for assignment"" to the spec. But assembly is way lower-level; it's nearly raw processor instructions. There's no public, ever-changing spec, where proposals are made like with JS.",AmSoMad,2025-04-28 09:23:11,6,learnprogramming,t3_1k9pbq1,False,
mphrv9m,"I'm not really satisfied with other posters' answers. There are two important facts they seem to be missing:- Not accepting ""MOV AX, var"" is a quirk of your assembler. ""MOV AX, var"" works fine in my preferred assembler, [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/).- ""LEA AX, [var]"" is semantically equivalent [1] to ""MOV AX, var"" but they are actually different instructions! [2]You can prove LEA and MOV are different by looking at their binary representation (for example if you use a disassembler, or check into your assembler's command-line syntax to discover how to make a listing file). The bytes for each instruction are: 8D063412 LEA AX,[0x1234] B83412 MOV AX,0x1234My personal opinion is that your assembler sucks. If you're doing this for a class, you probably have to live with the professor's choice of tooling. For your own projects, I recommend looking into NASM. (I hear the cool people are using [yasm](https://github.com/yasm/yasm) these days, but I've never used it so I have no personal opinion on it.)Out of curiosity, what assembler are you using?[1] By ""semantically equivalent"" I mean they have the same effects on the registers and flags.[2] The reason LEA exists is to let programmers use indexed addressing modes for calculations instead of memory access. `LEA AX,[0x1234]` and `LEA AX,[BX]` are functionally equivalent to MOV instructions, but `LEA AX,[BX+DI+0x1234]` does a calculation that can't be accomplished with any other single instruction.Experimenting with LEA can be maddening if you don't understand it. That's because 16-bit LEA will only let you use certain register combinations, you can only combine one of {BX, BP} with one of {SI, DI}. (This was a hardware decision of the chip designers, and applies to all address arguments.) With 32-bit assembly in the [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386), they added a whole extra byte to the encoding of indexed addressing modes (SIB, scale-index-base). So in 32-bit 386 assembly you can use any registers, and they even added the ability to multiply one of the registers by a constant factor of 2, 4, or 8. So the 32-bit instruction `LEA EAX,[ECX+4*EDX+0x1234]` is legal, but its 16-bit equivalent `LEA AX,[CX+4*DX+0x1234]` is not.",white_nerdy,2025-04-28 15:04:13,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k9pbq1,False,

Look into your docs on how to let it produce such output.If you want to try a 1:1 translation, work with simple single calculation step C commands and look at the assembly output of the compiler for that routine, after completely disabling the optimizations. You might see, that many sequences are really 1:1 translated into assembly building blocks.Also, if you want to work with assembly, you can try to use inline assembly and include single commands, sequences or routines into your C(++) code. Look for tutorials and documentations for ""inline assembly"" of your compiler, and about the proper syntax.Just one word of notice, if you enable the optimizations, the compiler will usually make a much better job at generating fast and efficient code. There may be options, to either optimize for speed or for size, at varying steps. When you look at the assembly generated with full optimizations, it might not be readable or seem like human-generated any longer, even when you coded your C ""like assembly"". This is because the CPUs are so quirky and exploiting a lot of unintuitive tricks can often yield that extra performance that pure efficiency in hand-coding wouldn't provide. Hand optimizing routines is a very advanced task and the more difficult the more modern the CPU is. And the extra work is usually not justified against the option of using C(++) code and getting a similar result with much less work. And then, each processor generation has new commands that can be used to tweak the code even a little faster. Then the reason for using assembly is speed, and so you need one version for each new generation, or make a limit which generations to supports and whether to allow suboptimal legacy performance or to make a system requirement on the CPU for it.Understanding how assembly optimization/coding is done, can make you produce better code in general though, because you then know how the computer works most efficiently and the C(++) code often relates to such structures - but not to all the additional optimization tricks necessary to yield the fastest code and which are counter-intuitive when it comes to comparing them with the previous task of code structuring in developing the software, which usually works best with the most simple representation of the code that could be worked with.When you have assembly code, and coders work with it manually, you also need to keep track of the loops and variables, and coders have their methods to work around having to shuffle them manually and would rather just do that in the core loops.

mq0b475,"If one person works on feature A, and another person works on feature B at the same time, and they both make conflicting changes to the same line of code, then you will get a merge conflict *no matter what you do*. It doesn't matter who works on what branch.Since the merge conflict must be resolved somewhere, it's better to resolve it on the feature branch, as you're doing. After all, a conflict resolution is a kind of code change, and therefore it shouldn't be just blindly committed to master without being tested.----Ideally, your CI system will not just test feature branches on their own, it will try to perform a merge with master and test the result of that merge (without actually committing the new merge). That way, you get an immediate warning if you're doing something that will cause a conflict, instead of finding out unexpectedly at the end of your task. Usually, the longer you wait to resolve a merge conflict, the more conflicts you have and the more work it takes to resolve them.Also, it's useful to perform and test this merge anyway before actually merging to master, even if Git *doesn't* give you conflict errors. This is because you can have *semantic* conflicts that Git doesn't detect. For instance, if you add a feature branch that adds a call to a pre-existing function `foo()`, and somebody on master simultaneously renames it from `foo()` to `bar()` on master, then your function will fail after merging. And Git will not detect this conflict because you didn't both change the same line of code.Testing only your feature branch won't catch this, because your feature branch doesn't have the rename. Testing after merging to master will catch it, but then your master branch is broken until somebody goes and fixes the conflict. So the best option is for your CI system to do a local merge and test it before ""approving"" the branch to be merged to master.",teraflop,2025-05-01 12:33:34,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kc6vr0,False,

Step two was to disable `@channel` and `@here` notifications in channels where people like to abuse that. Even a channel that you need to pay attention to, you can often treat it more like email and check in every hour or two instead of getting instant notifications.> ...unexpected urgent meetings...If it's an actual production emergency, sure. Short of that, most of this urgency is false. Having to constantly push back is exhausting, but you can, for example, start scheduling blocks of no-meeting time, and start actively declining surprise meetings, until people get the message.> ...late-night pings...Go into Slack and set a notification schedule.

mpdhnnd,"Generally speaking, right now it's not much different than any other job market that experiences a drop in demand. Some people will not be able to find work in this field and will transition out. Most will find work and the people at the top won't experience it at all.There are a number of factors that make the the next few years look especially bleak. After three decades of demand exceeding supply in tech, the market is caught with a sudden drop in demand at the absolute peak capacity of producing new engineering talent both domestically and globally. This is worse than fields where supply has generally matched demand and production pipelines weren't greatly increasing.Big tech recently ended their decades long practice of hiring talent to keep it off the market and instead is firing employees (across all functions, not just tech) to boost profits. Downstream, companies are copying this. The trend is to run lean on engineering. Even the most well funded startups are no longer focusing much on users or other growth metrics and are instead looking at ARR/headcount. Today, capital isn't looking for growth without outsized margins. This further reduces forward looking demand.Its unclear how AI, tariffs and economic instability will affect most jobs in 5 years, not just tech. As a consequence companies are dramatically scaling back capital expenditures and focusing on operations. That's further softening the job market overall. This hits tech harder than other roles because tech jobs lean heavy towards capex.People with 5-10 years of experience are mostly fine. It's just taking a lot more time and effort to find roles.

Where, when, and how they work is not necessarily up to you. If you dictate they next come to your office, at x time, to do y work, they are likely going to be classified as an employee.In this case, it sounds like OP is an employee for a company, and his employer has a contract to do work. An employee has to do what the employer requires, or the employer is free to fire them. Writing that a job is remote can trigger some legal protections for how much notice they must give you to change your work location, but any employer can change your work location as long as the proper notice period is given.

We were lucky we had in laws that were helping us daily - would have never worked out otherwise. The commute was tiring. I got less work done in the office given all the social distractions. When I got home, there was only enough time to briefly hang out with my kids, have my dinner, clean up, sleep at around 9-10 pm.We have since moved to the suburbs during Covid. I am fully remote and don't have to commute at all. Waking up at the same time (around 6:30 am), I am able to get through morning chores done - and still have time to catch up on Slack/email all before the kids get up and ready to head to school. While we don't have my in-laws to help as much, I am able to pick my kids up at 5:30, have dinner with them, enjoy some time with them, get everyone ready for bedtime. If I need to catch up with work after bedtime, I am not a dead log yet because I had no exhausting commute - and I am able to power through another 1-2 hours, if necessary.I am indeed more productive from home - and I do feel like I actually work longer - but at the same time, I am less exhausted and less resentful.

mpqfe9q,"I never went to a school as good as Berkeley and I'm not saying this is necessarily your problem since I don't know the full context, but from what I can tell -- there are some signs of my early mistakes so I'll elaborate in case it helps you out.Looking back at my early start -- the one trap that I fell into was having the ""smart kid"" syndrome. I would always compare other people's lows to my highs and was always surprised at the end result. That being, they ended up much further than I did at the end no matter how well they did e.g. GPA/knowledgeable they were about coding etc.In hindsight, my mentality contributed to two major detriments in my first job search:1 -- I unknowingly built a moat around myself and classmates who could've been a resource, ended up becoming competition or inaccessible instead. In your story, it sounds like you have plenty of classmates who got into F500 or FAANG, yet it sounds like you never reached out for help or built enough connections to avoid applying 400/600 times per cycle. Assuming you carry the same mindset of reducing a company to traits like “in the middle of nowhere,"" you might fall into the same trap of I did in evaluating everyone in a new environment as beneath you and not building the correct connections, or at least practicing, to get to where you want to go.One of my early jobs was in a small private company that I've never heard anyone mention in this sub in a random state in the South. From my time there, I knew a few data scientists and engineers who ended up going to great companies 2-3 years after their tenure to places such as LinkedIn, Meta, Paramount, etc. Had I went in with the same energy as I did in college, I would've never made friends and been able to reach out to them for help when it came to career advice or referrals. Instead of coming in with the expectation of getting something out of every interaction, I just became the person people want to work with -- be there for when they need help or talk about the project or life in general. All the ""small talk"" that you think is a waste of time makes you personable and they'll remember you when time comes.2 -- That mentality carries over into how you present yourself as a person and affects you in ways you probably didn't notice before. For me, it caused mismatched expectations and actually set me back from learning to my fullest potential. I always told myself that I should've gotten a better offer or shouldn't have struggled for as long as I did due to my capabilities; my worldview was shattered over and over again, once someone I deemed ""dumber"" got a more coveted position or had breezed through their job search. And this mentality doesn't really stop, there's always someone luckier or someone better than you in some way, that got an opportunity that you wanted and it looms in the back of your mind on every task that you do. I don't have much advice here aside from realization; getting hit with reality and coming to terms with having weaknesses in certain areas or unlucky in others actually helped me become open to learning a ton and that honest acceptance of my capabilities and circumstance got me more opportunities and help from others than I had gotten previously.Inadvertently this also helped in interviews and building connections, at least at the entry level as no interviewer or coworker wants to work with a new grad/mid-level with a pompous or fake persona even if they do mostly know their stuff. At the end of the day, we all want is someone human to work with and one of the most human traits you can exhibit in an interview is that you make mistakes, can learn and are competent/graceful enough to pivot with a team to come to a solution.",terrany,2025-04-29 21:38:22,45,cscareerquestions,t3_1kaya3g,False,

mpqevhk,"I'm at Amazon.There are a few qualifying questions I'd ask before giving a definitive answer:* What org?* Where is your team based? This is a biggie, because it's not uncommon for Amazon to hire people in one location and then tell them to move in 60-90 days or lose their job.* What's the ops load like?* What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?* Where is your office? Is it Seattle or Bellevue? What's the rent situation like, and is Seattle somewhere you want to live for years? Transfers are tricky at Amazon since 2022, so you'd be waiting a while for L5 before you can transfer - and even then you'll be up against hundreds of others.* Do you want to join in what is essentially a new grad role, or would you prefer to wait and join as a new L5 in a few years? Amazon has started downlevelling people lately, and it really fucks with URA as you have some L4's with years of experience making newer engineers look bad (and eventually up for the chop). The ""hire to fire"" culture is also still there in some teams.Most importantly, if you choose to join Amazon you should have a contingency plan in place in case you end up in Focus/Pivot. Speak to your current boss and see what their boomerang policy is. If you can bounce back in a year, great! If two, even better! There's little to lose.At face value, I would say that joining as an ""experienced"" L4 isn't a great idea, unless you're going to drastically improve your income by joining Amazon. Even then, layoffs are still occurring, and PIP is always looming, so you might not even see that salary. If despite all the warnings you're still sold, absolutely go for it.

You may also face issues if your team isn't balanced levels wise (e.g., no L6s or 0-2 L5s -> overworked L4s). EnderMB's comment is golden, esp ""What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?""4. You might hate the work your team is doing (esp if you're randomly placed). You could be a frontend wiz, but get placed on a team working on compilers. Or your team might be a KTLO team where all you're doing is ops and bug fixes (zero feature work).Take PTO or a leave of absence from your F500 job, scope out Amazon, and then make your decision. Best Case: you're a great fit for your role at Amazon and you're happy. Worst Case: you have to leave Amazon and go back to your fully remote job.FWIW: I worked at Amazon as a new grad SDE I and fell into a team of no L6s, only 1 L5, and rest L4s. I had to put in over \~70 hrs per week to keep up with expectations. I burned out in 1 year and quit without having anything lined up. Luckily, the market was fire back then so I was able to take a few months off and get a job elsewhere.Amazon on your resume will open a lot of doors, but tread carefully.",rimscode,2025-04-29 23:44:45,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1kaxnw8,False,

There are the ones who love it with a passion, will spend 50-60 hours working each week and creating new tasks for themselves. These are the overachievers who likely will end up working st faang or will dominate their mid-level company because they are the one employee everybody goes to. There are the types who like it but dont want to spend more than 40 hours unless it’s crunch time to finish their stuff. They do what their asked and sometimes they will look for things to do to show some motivation. They will do what the role entails. Then there are the types who also kind of like it but it’s clear it’s mostly for the money. They wont overacheive but theyll try to not underperform. They wont be front and center.

The other way to deal with the decline of traditional authority is the anarchist way, and anarchism is having a revival today, from Noam Chomsky to David Graeber.

They're the responsibility of management.We're IC's, we're responsible for doing the best work we can during our 40 hour work week. It doesn't matter if we get assigned 20 peoples-worth of responsibility. All that means is we will work to prioritize, and accurately communicate progress and ***timelines*** (independent of ""deadlines"") spread across 1 persons-worth of work weeks. That's how the exchange of labor works. Don't scale your hours.Management has tools in their toolbelt to account for at-risk deadlines. It's literally project management 101, shit interns learn, shit that's like on page 1 of any sort of guide to PM. They can dial back scope, they can hire more resources, or they can push back the deadline.Forcing their resources to work more than 40 hours isn't a (healthy) option. But if the SWE's *let them*, they'd be crazy to not take advantage of it. So don't let them. Work your 40 hours. Communicate everything based on those 40 hours. ""We need it done by X"" doesn't matter, because based on your 40 hour work week your job is to communicate the *realistic* estimate. ""Ok... well if I drop A, B, C, D, E, and F, I can get G done by X"", or ""If we take an MVP approach and get rid of H, I, J, and K requirements we can get the MVP done by X"".Everything you're describing is a failure of management, not of you. Deadlines, staffing, prioritization, scope, etc. It's all in *their* job description. Will your management like you establishing and sticking to your professional boundaries?Probably not. But you know what their options are? Fire you, and set their timeline back by *bare minimum* another 6-12 months across the board (probably more). Does that sound like a smart option?

mp7f0ep,"I've worked at a smaller defense contractor (in comparison to Lockheed Martin, for example) and then moved to big tech. I'd say there are two primary advantages of working in defense. One is that you have better WLB as you can't really work at home with a laptop since most of your work has to be done on a clearance computer, so after your 8 hours you just check out which you can't really do at big tech because your laptop is basically expected to be always with you. The second is your job can't be outsourced and you won't be H1B'd either.The disadvantage is that your pay reflects that. Another disadvantage, although this is team based, is that the work we were doing also reflected that - we were using JavaFX in 2022. Like what. IMO, if you have on call or if your WLB is ever compromised in defense, flat out no, definitely not worth it. If you don't, it depends on what you prioritize - do you prefer better job security, but lower pay, or do you prefer less job security, higher pay? I will say that defense as a stepping stone is very good. Getting a clearance is super helpful because it's possible to leverage that into a high tech job which requires a clearance, so you have the higher pay and higher job security.",So_,2025-04-26 20:42:00,24,cscareerquestions,t3_1k8k1zh,False,

Also, based on your suggestion, would you recommend I start learning JavaScript/TypeScript on the side or go all in on that stack? As for the other tech recs — I’ve worked with MySQL during undergrad, and I have some light exposure to AWS, but I’m planning to go deeper. I tried Docker before but found it a little tricky, so I’ll give it another go. I barely have tried git so ill give it a look andI haven’t heard of Nginx.One thing I’ve been wondering is — will diving into all these tools and backend-focused tech take away from what I’ve been working on recently? From Jan to March this year, I spent time learning front-end development since the volunteer place I was at suggested it might make me more employable.

That's not how the hourly relationship works, because if I work *less* I get paid *less* due to my non-exempt status. I don't want the downsides of being non-exempt without the upsides. So I'd just decline. I wouldn't attempt to negotiate, I would try and start a tiff by talking to a labor board, it's not worth my time or energy. I would politely decline the offer, and move on with my life.But if you're a full time exempt employee, you don't get overtime, that's what ""exempt"" means. They don't even need that clause. If you work an 80 hour week, because you're exempt, you're not obligated to be paid overtime. And if they demand you work 80 hour weeks, and you say no? They just fire you for performance. That's the big downside of being exempt/salary.For things like that, you need to sus out the WLB/culture of the company. Technically every company I've worked at over 12 years could demand I work on Saturdays, and fire me if I refuse. But I did my due diligence ensuring they had a good WLB/culture, so that's never happened despite it being well within their rights. Contracts/laws are strictly CYA, if I get good vibes from my hiring manager and my team, I join them.Regarding the inventions clause, I'd be surprised if you found an offer that *didn't* have something similar to that. Wording/scope might differ between companies, but most companies have something like this.But again.... it's CYA. It's if Mark Zuckerberg invented Facebook while using the company laptop and made a billion dollars off it, so the company could sue and get their bag. It's not for when Joe Shmoe makes an app entirely on their own time/equipment that brings in $50k/year that barely anyone's ever heard of. Speaking from experience. I have an LLC, I've released several mobile apps, one of which makes low 5-figures, and I've signed invention clauses. It's never mattered, nobody's asked, I don't talk about it, nothing happens. Could they *technically* come after me? Sure. But it'd cost them more in legal fees alone than the whole app makes, and the app has nothing to do with them so it's not a competitor.All that said, at the end of the day, if you aren't happy with the core language the company uses in their contracts, you're not likely going to convince them to change it.

And if I'm working at a tomato farm, then how can I use my garden to be a better farmer?Rolling with this, the reason would be that you have significantly more flexibility to experiment and try new things at any pace you like with no requirements to deliver a completed tomato, which means that you are can try out new fertilizers or solar light fixtures that you might not otherwise be able to get buy in for from the industrial tomato company, even if there's a chance that in the long run they might introduce you to new tomato growing concepts that could ultimately increase yield 5 years from now.Another reason might be that taking the time to slowly learn about the internals of the tomato, study its closely, dissect its seeds and see how they work inside, break out the microscope and look at the tomato's DNA -- might teach you something about the tomato's fundamentals you didn't know that you could teach to the industrial tomato team and fuel their long term growth.Another reason is that 1-2 hours on your own personal tomato garden is infinitely more personally enriching and fulfilling than 1-2 hours on some company's tomato garden, even if the latter might technically be the more ""efficient"" path toward maximizing tomatoes.

mptn1uk,"High level. I think my org does a decent job. There's always room for improvement.Phase 1: HR Screen to make sure you're a real person and not totally insane.Phase 2: Management/leadership interview to assess competence and corporate culture fit.Phase 2.5: Technical/skills assessment (if necessary).Phase 3: Peer interview to assess team fit and competence.For us, it's realistic to pack all of that into 2 rounds of ""the candidate has shifted their life around to make time for"" interviews. <4 hours of the candidate's time spent in interviews before a yes/no decision is made.> A take-home that doesn’t feel like “build our MVP for free”?I know lots of people here aren't a fan of take-homes.For our part, we design our take-home assessment to be 30 minutes on the assessment, this role might not be for you. It's 2 trivial ds/alg questions -- the sort of stuff you'd find buried in a block of 50 questions in a textbook chapter. For engineering roles, we do this to make sure the candidate can code their way out of a paper bag before we disrupt management/staff+ people's time with an interview.> A timeline that moves quickly and doesn’t ghost you for 10 days between steps?Our commitment is a definitive yes/no decision within 15 business days of the candidate's very first conversation with a human. We average closer to 10 business days because it's not some altruistic thing; Managers are busy people, and don't have infinite amounts of time to spend on hiring.> Upfront honesty about comp, equity, and actual day-to-day work?We always leave at least 20 minutes of time during each interview for the candidate to ask any questions they may have. Where 20 minutes is not enough (it usually is), I and other managers have skipped scheduled meetings to ensure viable candidates have 100% of their questions answered. You can ask about comp -- I and our HRBPs/recruiters will happily tell you the min/target/max for the req once interviews are happening. We're not going to send you a full spreadsheet of every comp band for every role/level, but can talk about the specific req you've applied for. If the candidate shared their compensation requirements on the application, they're talking to us right now because their comp requirements align with the min/target/max for the req.Sharing comp requirements are optional, but if I have 100 viable applicants, and 50 of them stated their compensation requirements in the application, and we can afford 25 of them based on their stated comp requirements, those are the 25 resumes hitting my desk as the hiring manager. For budgeting purposes I and my CFO need to know if we're buying a Toyota Corolla or a Porsche 911. Again, managers are busy people and can't spend infinite time on hiring. It's ~4 lost hours, plus the opportunity cost of ""things the manager isn't doing"", if the candidate needs $100k/yr and we've only budgeted up to $80k/yr.",healydorf,2025-04-30 11:37:08,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kbb8q4,False,
mpt4uuu,"My two centsImplement a ""Mutual Work Sample + Conversation Day"" as the core of your hiring process. Here’s how it works: Invite top candidates (after an initial screen, which includes a reference check) to a paid half-day session—remote or onsite—where you both get to evaluate fit by working together on a realistic, bounded, non-critical task. Example: ""Here’s a simplified version of a real challenge we’ve faced. Let’s pair for a bit, and then you take the lead while we stay available for questions."" Set a 2–4 hour timebox. Pay candidates for their time. Respect their calendar.Provide transparent, upfront documentation with role expectations, compensation and equity ranges, work style, tech stack, and team values. Make it clear who they will work with, how decisions are made, and what the first 90 days might look like. I recognize this isn't easy in a startup, but do the best you can. Follow this with a candid debrief discussion, not a quiz: \- What did they enjoy? \- What would they do differently? \- What questions do they have about the problem, the product, or the team? Set and honor a clear timeline with a known decision date. Don’t ghost. Why this works: \- Filters for initiative, pragmatism, and curiosity—you see how they think and how they collaborate. \- Respects candidate time—you’re not asking for free labor or arbitrary leetcode. \- Signals honesty and care—you’re willing to invest in them before they work for you. \- Mutual fit—they’re evaluating you, too, and this gives them real data.

mplt72s,"Hey I can somewhat answer this as I went from a STEM bachelors 12 years ago to doing the WGU BSCS program and now I’m currently in the OMSCS program at Georgia tech.There ARE people who do the gtech program without a CS background but it’s painful for them. Gtech lets you in but then it’s sink or swim as you get thrown into the rough seas. You get to decide if you e got the stomach for it. There is A LOT of coding and it happens very quickly and there’s little to no support if you don’t already know how to code proficiently. It’s sort of expected that you either already know how to code or that you’ll pick it up on your own.WGU on the other hand will teach you from the beginning and if it’s too easy for you at first, then the magic of the WGU program that makes it unique is that you can accelerate through the program right up to the point where it gets hard for you. That’s why for some people who are already experienced software engineers, they can blaze through that program in 6 months if they were self taught years ago. On the other hand, people might take 3+ years to finish it similar to a typical bachelors because the WGU program, despite the elitism from a lot of people, is still a legit program that requires you to know your stuff.You seem like a decently smart person having done aerospace engineering, so maybe you’ll connect with my experience. My first bachelors (biology at UCI, moderately prestigious for premed) was tough but I finished with a 3.2 gpa. WGU was a cakewalk for me BUT I did learn a ton and finished in a little over two years. I learned how to code Hello World approximately 3 months before I started at WGU and feel proficient by the end of the program (can code decently sized programs from scratch in three different languages with minimal assistance). WGU tells students to expect 15-20 hours of work per week but realistically I was only doing 5-10 and still accelerating at a fast pace. The first half of the program I blazed through since I’m good at math and still remembered a lot of calculus. Discrete math was very intuitive for me.Now at OMSCS, when course reviews say that a class takes 20 hours per week… it actually takes 20 hours per week for people who have a strong CS background. People without that background are reporting 25-30 hours per week in order to learn all the stuff on the side that they need to learn.The average time per week per course is 15 hours per week and it’s a very accurate estimate for most people. Few people put in less time than that. Without a CS background, you should expect to spend an extra 25%-50% of your time learning all the things you need to code all the projects.Ultimately it’s how you want to break up the time. Doing WGU first means you won’t get to the really cool stuff like ML for another two-ish years and will also spend some time doing typical bachelors stuff that you don’t want to do, but the ramp up in difficulty will be much smoother and you can just passively do this on the side without too much disruption to your life.Or you can jump feet first into OMSCS, get to the end goal faster, but your life might be hell for the next 3 years straight.",vwin90,2025-04-29 04:13:34,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1kadnz6,False,
mpmp7of,Take the free CS50x class from Harvard online to get a high quality intro on basic CS stuff.  Way better than anything I've seen at WGU tbh.,qqqqqx,2025-04-29 09:14:54,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kadnz6,False,
mpn336a,"I’d take (at least) the recommended courses from this link before applying: https://omscs.gatech.edu/preparing-yourself-omscsI’d take them at a community college if possible to save some cash. Professors are generally more accessible at community colleges, too. Good vibes there. I was admitted for the Fall term for OMSCS and I come from a non CS background(English Education BS / English MA). I was originally working towards a second bachelors (only required to take courses within the major), but I applied to OMSCS, got in, and decided to switch. In preparation I took Discrete Math, Discrete Structures, Intro to Programming, Object Oriented Programming in C++, Object Oriented Programming in Java, Computer Organization and Assembly, Computer Architecture, Data Structures and PreCalc/Calc1/Calc2. My experience is likely not the norm and I’ve seen people admitted to the program with fewer classes taken. I think OMSCS would be a more rigorous program with better name recognition, compared to WGU.One note is that if you’re applying for next Spring, classes in-progress aren’t really considered for your acceptance. So if you end up taking these classes in the Fall, with a Spring application deadline of August 15, that could be problematic for a Spring admission. More info on that here: https://omscs.gatech.edu/deadlines-decisions-requirements-and-guidelines and from the link: > Please note that any academic work completed after the application deadline will not be considered for the purposes of evaluating your application. For example, academic coursework which is in progress and not completed before the application deadline will not be considered; an updated transcript showing coursework completed AFTER the deadline will NOT be considered.",tabasco_pizza,2025-04-29 11:22:38,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kadnz6,False,
