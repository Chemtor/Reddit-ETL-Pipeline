He was an MBA who got dumped on the data team because he was the CFO's buddy who had fucked up one too many times on the finance team.Things he did while managing the small data team:1. Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, 4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS.

How do you know that fixed it, other than adding a basic regression test each time you find one that doesn't get caught. I do think it's useful for examples, asking questions about your code and best practices (also it's OK to not align with best practices the real world very rarely has perfect alignment to what Fang companies use). Using SQL is also so important, I'm often in calls where I'm able to prove whether something is true during the call. Or just look at a coworkers query and understand why their results aren't as expected. That takes some time. To me LLMs are like having a junior coworker, I think if you treat it like another junior coworker and double check it's work but assume it can do 70% of it, then it'll be a useful tool.

The second is about making more complex projects without losing quality of the solution.If you can do both, it doesn't matter if you use LLMs or not.

n9200po,"Well, best case scenario this is a ""make lemonade out of lemons"" scenario, where you take a bad environment with very few factors in your favor (in terms of growing your skills or actually making some impactful changes), and see what you can make of it. On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).If you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and ""probably"" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary... You're trying to foment a rebellion here, but for your vision to win, you have to actually demonstrate something meaningfully different and revolutionary that COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED in their legacy stack -- if all you do is say, ""look guys I put our code into git, see this is better now"", then no one will give a shit because that by itself doesn't matter, doesn't change the business. But I don't think you are going to be able to pull it off. So jumping ship seems like it would be better for you, but to be totally honest and blunt, your post gives me a weird vibe of someone trying to ""shortcut"" the career ladder by looking to be opportunistic about what's-best-for-your-brand, instead of someone who's actually sincere about putting in the work, engaging with stakeholders, learning how to dig out of a hole, etc. If you really want to be a director, you're supposed to learn how to overcome adversity, and not just look for the smoothest easiest path to inflate your title as high as you can with as little work or struggle as you can.",strugglingcomic,2025-08-16 19:07:36,26,dataengineering,t3_1ms2j53,False,

Moose as an ""ORM"" is one approach (I know of at least one smallish company using it, they seem happy)We've done something ""similar"" at Tinybird (similar in the sense that it's a CH abstraction designed to make it easier to integrate into the application), but our approach is more API-centric. Basically make it dead simple to turn a SQL query into an API, and then integration really becomes a question of how you handle your API routes in your backend code and doesn't really require you to ""think"" about the database.I'm genuinely curious to know how people would compare Moose vs. Tinybird - do people like the ORM approach?

SCD2 via dbt also works but adds overhead fast.Airbyte gives you the control, especially if you're self-hosting, but the PII masking and SCD2 will be on you to build or glue together. That gets messy if you're trying to hit a 15-min SLA with high reliability and source API quirks.Have you considered using a streaming CDC layer like Debezium or a change-data tool in front of the warehouse, and doing light pre-processing (like hashing) inline before landing to Snowflake? Or using something like Estuary, which can do incremental syncs, apply hashing inline before data hits the destination, and supports low-latency replication with built-in schema drift handling. Bonus is no maintaining connectors or DAGs.Quick q's: How often do schemas actually change in Salesforce for you? And are the PII fields always in fixed locations or could they appear in custom fields too?I work at Estuary, so naturally I'm biased, but it's built exactly for this kind of setup where off-the-shelf tools either fall short on compliance or require too much engineering lift.

Shallow learning curve, juniors can do senior work with it. Supports parallelism etc, it can scale to faster than the tools you mentioned. Much cheaper than the more expensive tool you mentioned (about 1-2% cost, idk about the other tool)1. you can [pseudonymise](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/customising-pipelines/pseudonymizing_columns) before loading. you can even load to a local duckdb and then [sync](https://dlthub.com/blog/datasets2) to your final destination after transforming if you prefer to hash in sql.2.

Replication is incremental with SFDC (for most tables) and it will tell you if it can't do that for a specific object.I don't remember about Airbyte (looked at it before). I don't think it is as easy to maintain as compared to Fivetran, but then Fivetran probably costs more.Re: API rate limits (for SFDC): we have never had an issue with this. However, our account is allocated a very large quota for this.You can setup a new Fivetran replication to Snowflake in 15min as long as you have setup the requisite security in SFDC and in Snowflake.in terms of SLA. Fivetran offers various plans. We use the 'standard' plan and it provides for a 15min sync time. Any lower than that you you need the 'enterprise' plan (I think).Fivetran will not directly help with building SCD Type 2. However, you can do a couple things here: 1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed. 2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).Fivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors). You can control it so that FT will add new columns but not new tables (unless you want that). It also handles cases where column datatypes change (although that can still break downstream etl). Fivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? \>>> I see no reason why Fivetran would not work for your needs but you need the budget. For SFDC replication, budget for $800 USD per month (depending on what objects you need). Hubspot maybe less per month.* Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it? Fivetran handles this OOTB.* Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2? Not really a function of Fivetran or Airbyte * If you have pulled data from Salesforce or HubSpot, were there any surprises around rate limits or schema changes?

So if you have data whose cardinality you don’t control, this will always be a risk.

Typical prompts like ""discover insights"" or ""find anomalies"" are available via menu items so this is just a one click and doesn't require any efforts from end users.

It's constant learning, even as an experienced engineer, whenever I switched to a new stack, I needed between one and two years to be proficient at the local stack and the local software. Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.If you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user. Snowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty.

In order to do that you just query anything greater than the last timestamp you queried from that table/system and pull everything new in bulk. It’s extremely simple to implement and does exactly what our goal is pull all new transactions.If you were to do it by transactional ID you’d have to check every ID for all of time in your source against the list of IDs in your target .

IT desk support can have higher overall job security even being a cost center because a business cannot afford to fire all of them 3, it depends on how much of your time is spent on the chargeable service. Sometimes you can think of it this way.

Same thing with your salary, or an AWS bill, they need to go to a cost center.Finance people/executives understand that you literally can’t run a company without cost centers. Even if you were a one person remote consulting firm you’d have your salary cost. What they will do though is cut cost centers more aggressively than profit centers.So what the saying is trying to say is “be on the team who’s work directly causes cash to come into the business” which, unfortunately, data engineering teams almost never bring money directly into the business.It also doesn’t mean that positions in cost centers are inherently dangerous.

n8tgir5,"I think you might be overthinking it. Cost vs. Profit centre is a simple management view of the situation. It’s not arcane, it’s not a trick, it’s very straightforward MBA math. Profit = income - cost. You can break costs down to things like operating expenses and taxes if you feel fancy. If the business unit you work in brings in more money than it costs, you are a profit centre. There are no second order effects. When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. If your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it’s deemed essential. You’re absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. To reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it’s an unavoidable necessity. The trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics.

People here are confusing an accounting system concept for some sort of philosophical judgement.One transaction can hit both a profit center and a cost center at the same, too!! In fact, many do.Profit centers are used to categorize the products or services that a company sells. By using profit centers, when examining a business you could say one division is more profitable than another division, etc.You might try to say oh well Jeff is responsible for increasing profit through his role, but that’s an indirect thing. Jeff has to be paid a salary and the accounting line for that gets assigned to a cost center. Jeff probably isn’t a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it’s possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what’s being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he’s not the product. It’s not that he doesn’t matter, but on the books, he doesn’t get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. Transactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent.

This would put you at 100-200K requests/day which would not cover your needs if it’s a single news site, but could be fine if it’s multiple that can run in parallel. As for the actual scraping, of course the site will try and prevent scraping or overloading of their infrastructure, so try these things (somewhat in order)- fetch and save just the html of the url with curl, curl_cffi, httpx or similar. This could work fine if you stay under any rate limits. You can then extract the text from the html later on. - adjust your user agent and cookies, for example by copying the request headers from an actual browser session- Try and figure out if they have a front-end API that serves one or multiple articles at the same time. This could make it easier to get the correct text and stay under rate limits. - Use an automated browser like playwright - Use an automated browser and hide any features that give away that it’s automated (e.g. puppeteer stealth)- If you hit any rate limits, use a service that provides residential proxies and use any of the above",dmkii,2025-08-14 16:15:06,0,dataengineering,t3_1mpgret,False,

ClickHouse community is strong and growing. The number of contributors and commits to ClickHouse has grown so much over the last 5-10 years. Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors) Pinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors) If your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.Personally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.I don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.Since you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.What kind of log volumes are you looking at? And do you need real-time ingestion or is near real-time ok?Btw, maybe you'll find this template interesting or useful as a starting point -> [https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template](https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template) (if you're worried about operational overhead, maybe Tinybird could be a landing place for you... lmk if you have questions about it.",itty-bitty-birdy-tb,2025-08-18 16:30:07,2,dataengineering,t3_1mrlw9e,False,

I personally reviewed a few Synapse specific PRs this week, actually :D. And it's still Generally Available with no deprecation date set. And I wholeheartedly would agree new development should go to Fabric instead.I also think most customers of Synapse would benefit from migrating to Fabric when they feel ready to do so; it has many major improvements, both to performance and to the architecture. One of the big ones is that Fabric Warehouse uses Parquet as it's on disk format accessible in OneLake - no more ""best performance or least duplication"" tradeoff.Why wouldn't I blame Fabric for Synapse not seeing much feature development?Well, designs of Synapse Dedicated and Synapse Serverless respectively had limitations that weren't practical to address without a major rearchitecting under the hood. Synapse Dedicated, for example, is the result of over a decade of incremental improvements that did not change its fundamental architecture (APS/PDW was released in 2012); we basically took it as far as it could go. So we had to do some fairly major rearchitecting to make something fundamentally better than that; the result is Fabric. Could we have called it Synapse v2 or something? Maybe. But it still would have been a migration to move to it, so I'm not sure that would have been any better. And marketing isn't my area :D.

n95axmg,"I don't really agree with your take on AI, even as a companion tool. It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.People are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.People using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.We might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.At present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.Lastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",Fridux,2025-08-17 08:39:19,8,learnprogramming,t3_1msa43x,False,
n959802,"(I wrote my first program 28 years ago.)I think in society today, everyone should learn to read code, just like everyone should learn local and global geography, how to change a tire, what the scientific method is, how to read books, how to calculate, etc.I say this because digital literacy is too low for how dependent people are on technology. There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.For people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works. But I think it is important for people to realize that the landscape of software development is just as large as any of the other fields I mentioned. Merely understanding code compares to software development as changing a tire compares to being a mechanic, or how being able to calculate compares to being a mathematician. Or even between being able to read (and post on reddit) versus writing a series of fiction books. Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.For the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future. Now that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.But again, ""learning to code"" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people. If you include internet servers in the mix, the number shoots up to thousands.)

I routinely get a laugh out of the “I’m `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?” questions. Just go for it!On AI, I’ve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what’s new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they’re often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It’s nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. Programming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I’ve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.One of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That’s why diving in is the right approach. You’ll answer your “should I” question quickly, and you may love it.

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.Now consider doing it with recursion. You imagine the functional interface you want – let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar. Consider your base case – is the File a simple file, not a directory? Great, you're done. Produce your output. Otherwise you need to recurse – okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files. Boom, done. The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.The key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?* Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",SubstantialListen921,2025-08-19 15:45:56,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mulhd1,False,

The third of those eventually migrated to C#, and for a while there was a component built in Microsoft Silverlight. The whole thing was source controlled in Rational Clear Case, but for some reason I don’t recall we couldn’t run it on the Linux boxes where we built that part of the product. (Young folks: Silverlight was an unsuccessful competitor to Macromedia / Adobe Flash. At the time I was working on it, VB6 was already ancient. ClearCase is what big companies used before git.)To tie all this random crap together, I wrote a Ruby script that applied labels, downloaded snapshots of the code, then either pushed the code to a Linux box to be built there, or built it locally on the server. It was an insane, janky, Rube Goldberg setup. And to drive it all, I wrote a DSL in Ruby to tell it what I wanted it to build. As horrible as the whole thing was in retrospect, the DSL was incredibly easy to understand. Nobody working on the project would have any difficulty understanding what it did, even if they didn’t know precisely how it was doing it.

n9hrva1,"That is a very good analogy, and the answer is actually quite simple!The way you figure out if ""the programming LEGO piece you need actually exists"" is exactly they way you figure out if an actual LEGO piece you need exists!Every time you build a LEGO-set you follow instructions, like a tutorial - and you take note of new pieces or unique ways they are used, storing them in memory for when you later want to build something similar. The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.When not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!Also, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!When you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?You won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning! Don't ever expect to ""see"" the magical piece that will solve your exact problem, if you have never worked on anything even remotely similar, or even seen pieces anywhere close to what you need!And don't think that you'll immediately get to know thousands of pieces and how they connect - sometimes you will have to make things ""the wrong way"", or simply ""fake"" them, make a function that pretends to do the work for you, until you learn the right way. Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.So, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough.

n9i65tk,"For number 2, I've had to deal with that forever - I've never been a fan of people using ""I have ADD!"" as an excuse for everything, but programming with ADD is... well, it can be an advantage at times but it can also be a severe disadvantage for that exact reason - before you know it you've got 40 tabs open and are working on three new things completely unrelated to the problem you were trying to solve. One thing that helps me is using something to keep track of that sort of thing - a folder, a bookmark app, anything where you can drop everything you come across that makes you go ""that's cool/useful/whatever"" but isn't directly related to what you're doing *now*. Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. As for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.For me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right ""piece"" is, and is more about a general understanding and ""feel"" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial ""I'll never need to do this again"" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at ""I just did more than I needed to"" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).I'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say ""I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use"" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.It never hurts to join a coding community, either.

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.To create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.For creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.Writing good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation. Writing good docs makes you really think about your API design and software usability on a new level.",allium-dev,2025-08-14 21:46:59,25,learnprogramming,t3_1mqcbkh,False,

n9bn50l,"I used to teach at a real-life bootcamp and we also did 3 back end languages: Ruby (later switched to Python), Java and Node. The point was indeed to maximise exposure to different languages without expecting students to become experts in any of them. We wanted them to come away with “programming mindsets” where they could solve a given junior-level problem with loops, conditionals and functions, and an awareness that different languages have different “quirks” in the syntax for these concepts. For example, all these languages have for loops, but Python has list comprehensions, JavaScript has array methods that take in callback functions, Java has implementations of the List interface…Going further into back end dev, Ruby on Rails defines endpoints as methods on a Controller class, inheriting from the framework’s built-in ActiveController. Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour.

Then venture into more complex territory, e.g. something like *Battleships*. Then, move on to more complex tasks, e.g. *Sokoban (Box Pusher)* - these are all fairly simple to make games that will each teach you a lot. To get something more dynamic, the classic *Pong* or *Breakout (Arkanoid clone)* are good starts, but only after you have progressed enough. Make a *Pacman* clone. Using old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.When you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.With each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you. At utmost, use the tutorials as inspiration and try to make things on your own. Then, if you fail and can't find a solution, look at the tutorial to see how they did it. Don't just copy the tutorial. First, try on your own. Experimenting, trying, failing, fixing are all part of learning, copying is not learning.Also, games are developed *incrementally*. They start with simple mechanics, e.g. how to interact with the player, how to set up the levels, etc. Then, they work with the collisions, and so on. Commonly, the *game art* is quite far towards the end of the development.

n9hznih,"Personally, I think they're wrong. If there were an objectively best way to write a web application, why would there be so many front ends and backends, especially backend languages? Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.Think about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.It's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).To get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.Or languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.Prolog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.And was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.Functional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.It helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-19 09:21:44,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mucv2f,False,
n9ia8f9,"> At the moment I have the impression that every language is able to do anythingYes and no. Any Turing complete language, which is effectively all of them, can manipulate state, which is what programs do. Any general purpose language, which is most of them, can do most tasks.However, where those languages can be used is a function of implementation. OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? How about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)? How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature. It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language. Choose one, block the other. A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time. Write your tests accordingly.Along the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). This is the break point between imperative and declarative. The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind. It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't. There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature. There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.Garbage collection? How resources are released is a big deal in all languages. In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer. In others, the programmer barely has a say.Virtual machines? Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox. This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.Last, but not exhaustively, libraries. The standard libraries available to a language might dictate its use.

Build something where you have to think on a higher level of abstraction than while-loops and if-statements, struggle with understanding the framework, and use all your knowledge of the language to build something 'standard'.You are ""done"" with learning the programming language, now you have to learn how to build programs - and the easiest way to get started is to follow advanced tutorials, and notice repeating patterns in the way they build things!Also, don't forget about the interview-exam - store it somewhere, and pick it up again in a few weeks, try to see if it suddenly becomes easier.",peterlinddk,2025-08-19 14:53:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mubg50,False,

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. - Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are.

For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:```class Card: def __init__(self, cardString): self.name = self._getName(cardString[0]) self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0]) self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1]) def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter] elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 'Ace' else: return cardFirstCharacter def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return 10 elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 11 else: return int(cardFirstCharacter) def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter): suits = [""Hearts"", ""Diamonds"", ""Clubs"", ""Spades""] return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)```Then `hit()` becomes easy:```def hit(): drawnCard = drawCard() v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard) card = Card(drawnCard) return card.name, card.value```**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it.

n8wcphv,"There's no one answer here, but if I have to condense it to a single sentence, it would be this: It should be mapped in the layer where it is the most convenient.A DTO isn't inherently an API thing. It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.However, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).The issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.My point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. My general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying.

n8wrimc,"I think I have to make it more clear what I meant.It makes sense, since the database resides in a database layer. To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.Then we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.Somehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. I read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:If we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view. For example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.But sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.Do you know what I mean?",NearbyOriginals,2025-08-15 22:04:20,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wcaxr,True,

You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary). While controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.In spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:example() { var stuff = repo.getStuff(); ...business logic... return stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;)This is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.When you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.All these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",disposepriority,2025-08-15 22:35:18,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wrimc,False,

You add a hash\_version field to your user class, so you know which hashing algorithm to use to verify their passwords. This new column in your database has no business being in absolutely any of your controllers, but obviously you want to retrieve the value when getting a user since the service needs to know what to do). This applies to any entity derivatives like projections or manual mappings with native query.Service calls one or more repositories requesting data from the database that it needs, this can be returned as an entity class, projection, manually created class mapped by a jdbc handler, it doesn't matter - this is the class that will store the data you request from the database.

I'm not trying to sound like a smartass or anything, but sometimes the most simple route can be the best! You can learn stuff like design patterns and algorithms and stuff, but if you feel like you are too heavily reliant on AI I'd suggest trying to make a simple project (like a sudoku or a simple calculator ) and just turn off copilot or anything of the likes and just start googling (the AI from Google also doesn't count) learning to use documentation and efficient research helps a lot for becoming a better programmer especially if you try to dissect your problem in smaller bites and start to get hang of how you could figure out problems by pure logic it will then only make you stronger in coding when you do allow yourself to use AI. But practising is the best medicine imo. You seem like a smart individual but don't get yourself twisted over achieving stuff like becoming a 10x developer, I'm guessing a part of having that amount of skill is also part of just loving to code and doing it a lot (of course there are cases of people who just inhale knowledge and have such a robust logical mind that it comes easy to them but that is besides the point) and if you can think of the logic how to tackle problems during coding before even touching your keyboard then you're on the right track (not a must but is nice) coding is just logical thinking.

If someone just wanted to vibe code their way into software that's going to be riddled with problems that's probably a different story.Assuming AI is going to reach the point where it's actually useful at scale then you'll want to be in a position where you can still read, debug, and modify whatever code the various models you use will output.At the moment AI isn't really a net benefit for a lot of companies or projects that are rather large, but realistically with the amount of investment they've seen they likely will be. To clarify a bit, they're decent at writing a number of things, but I've also seen them do a number of dumb things that cost more time than they've saved.The other rather significant problem is that while you can use them to build a number of things by piecing things together it starts to fail when you have to debug even relatively small programs. Even if you've all the features enabled to have it try to analyze, run, and test a program it will still often fail somewhere. Though it will completely confidently proclaim that what it wrote it works properly when it definitely doesn't. I've seen this just trying to get it write unit tests for things that are only mildly complicated. Other times the project is just too big to fit in the context window. A bit of an anecdote here, but I still find it humorous seeing certain models try to run code (not written using Python) in a Python interpreter even when you explicitly told it not to.I expect we'll see a shift from monolithic to more microservice based programs to help meet AI in the middle, but we're not there across the industry today.",Serenity867,2025-08-14 21:17:17,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqda0b,False,

Professional artists always do a super rough sketch skeleton first, then they work a bit here and a bit there, but never complete. The process would look very strange to everyone including the artist. But when it is all done, the artist would look back and think about how he/she actually arrive at the final piece. From that experience, he/she would rationalize what must have been going on in his/her head. And that's the story he/she tells the world.

n8npzr9,"To answer your question, I don't remember when the switch happened for me. There were a few milestones I do remember, though: First, when I learned to focus on projects over practice, programming started to come much more naturally to me. Second, when I learned the concepts of software engineering, I started to view programming as an end rather than some thing on its own (when it became a medium for a story like English in your analogy).It was a continuous process, but I can't really quantify how skilled I was at the time, because I wasn't doing the same thing enough to compare over time.To go into domains a little:The process will be different for every domain, as programming is just means to an end. This means learning how to learn is a step in its own. You're probably best just looking for an online community of software engineers with experience and asking there (forums, discords, etc), or just Googling it and hoping you find results. Examples:Banking and financial processing are extremely heavy on the security, regulations, and infrastructure side of things, so that's where most of your research/investment goes- under the hood I'd imagine most banks etc use very similar software, all just making secure API calls to one-another. Your learning resources are going to be regulations and industry insights to the current norms. Your only hope to breaking into the market is probably innovation (doing something known, just cheaper or higher quality).Comparatively, something like game development would be the opposite. You're creating a lot of unique systems; usually without significant regard for standards/security. I.e. outside of specific cases, there's not really one preferred solution. Your learning resources are gonna be more subjective and decentralized, as the requirements are much fuzzier and the market isn't ""solved.""

Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. Then it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, ""I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code."" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.So at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought ""Maybe if I SEND these people my code..."" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.So after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, ""Hey, I found a bug in the code."" And he literally said, ""Well, fix it."" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support.

Numpy for all things array and matrix based. Scikit learn for statistics and fancy data analysis tools.There’s overlap and there’s trade offs between verbosity, familiarity, memory/network/cpu usage, etc. that you have to manage. The only way to know is to try. And not get caught up in premature optimization.In my world, I do as much of my first pass filtering as I can in SQL queries to filter down the dataset. Most of my post-processing will be in pandas. The pandas from_records() method is a daily driver to combine the two.

Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm is definitely widely used.It's generally not meaningful to compare things like ""number of iterations"" or ""number of function calls"" between two different algorithms, or two different implementations of the same algorithm (unless they're very similar to each other).If actual practical performance is what matters, then comparing the actual running time is what matters, so that you can fairly compare the effects of things like synchronization overhead.Probably, the most useful comparison would be to draw graphs of the *average* running time for graphs of different sizes, and also with different numbers of threads (or CPU core counts) so that you can see where the break-even point is, i.e. where the benefits of parallelism outweigh the extra overhead. Varying the sparsity of the graphs would also be interesting.If you're interested in the theoretical big-O complexity, then numerical measurements don't really matter at all, and instead you'd need to formally analyze and rigorously prove some kind of upper-bound on the amount of work done by each thread. This is likely to be a lot more difficult than just taking measurements.----An additional note: as you said, the basic form of Dijkstra's algorithm gives the ""single-source shortest paths"" from a source to *all* other nodes. But in practice, we are often only interested in the path from one source to one destination. A simple and obvious optimization is to just stop the algorithm as soon as the destination node is expanded (because at that point its path is guaranteed to be optimal). A less obvious optimization is to do a *bidirectional* search, which works both forwards from the source and backwards from the destination simultaneously, terminating when they meet. This often results in expanding dramatically fewer nodes. (If you imagine the ""frontier"" as being circular, then then two circles with radius d/2 have half the area compared to one circle with radius d.)You might want to see if your parallel algorithm can be adapted to handle one or both of these optimizations.

In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.it’s generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.Simple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.Here’s a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.Edit: Reddit messing up formatting here.def increment(x): return x + 1count = 0count = increment(count) # updates originalnew_count = increment(count) # keeps originalCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.As you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner.

Because it's a factor, there's also another factor y such that `x * y = n`.Now `y` has to be bigger than (or equal to) the square root of n. If it weren't, then you have two numbers smaller than the square root of n which, when multiplied, will be smaller than n.You might wonder, could we miss some factors greater than the square root of n by stopping so soon? The answer is no. Why? For a similar reason. Suppose there is a factor, `y` that's bigger than the square root of n. Then, it must have a corresponding factor, `x`, which is less than the square root. If it didn't, then both `x` and `y` would both be greater than the square root of n, and their product would be greater than n (which would mean they aren't factors).So, you could modify it something like float root= sqrt((float) n); // or however you get the square root // Crude way to get the ceiling of the root int limit = (int) (root + 1); for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) { if (n % i == 0) { // Check if it's a factor // It is printf(""%d is a factor\n"", i); int other = n / i; // Get other factor if (other != i) { // Don't double print if we hit the square root printf(""%d is a also a factor\n"", i); } }If you wanted to save the array allocation cost and do it once, you could run this loop twice. The first time, you'd check for how many factors there were (create a counter before the loop and increment each time you print). Then, you'd malloc the array, then fill in the array again.Hard to say which is more efficient, but the square root trick is pretty useful because square root of n is MUCH smaller than n, so that's the number 1 idea you can use.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-16 13:01:35,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mrslsx,False,

n90u5vw,"Squeezing this kind of optimization (to me) seems silly. You're calling the square root function *once*. On the other hand, you're computing `i * i` each time through the loop. When both are good enough (C programmers from the 1980s and 1990s obsessed over writing the fastest code, but these days, if the code runs fast enough, then clarity of code matters more than efficiency), you opt for the one that is clearer to the reader which could be you or be someone else.This is why some people use Python (with Django or Flask) on the backend or even Node. A Rust backend would be faster, at the expense of being harder to read. Speed isn't everything, and even when it is, guessing what is fast or slow is not an effective way to improve the speed: you need a way to measure your program's execution (this is called instrumenting it). There are tools called *profilers* that can do this, but it's not super easy to set up and differs from language to language.For example, you can call a very expensive function that takes, say, a second once, but if you have a loop that goes a million times, and you can shave a millisecond off each iteration, that matters more.In this case, the square root trick really reduces the number of iterations and has the biggest impact, far more than deciding whether to use square root or i * i. I think it's fine to stick with i * i, because it's pretty close to saying square root. This is where it's useful to have a comment like // Not using square root because i * i is more efficientcan help. Often, when you're trying to speed things up, comments help indicate you're writing less obvious code to help speed it up.However, many beginners obsess over speed without truly knowing how to speed it up (basically, they try a bunch of things). Algorithmic improvements are usually the ones to aim for rather than smaller things like how fast square root runs. Having said that, many years ago I wrote a program using sine and cosine, and because I computed it over and over, it was slow (I had no idea).The solution was to create an array with the results pre-computed. I only had a limited number of values I was running these trig functions on (say, 60), so placing the pre-computed values in the array and looking those values up was far more efficient.So, it *can* matter. But usually you want to spot big loops which is where things tend to slow down.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-16 15:32:16,2,learnprogramming,t1_n90lrgr,False,

n8whge5,"Since you already think in Java, anchor system design to building and operating a real service in Java rather than hopping between theory sources is my advice.Start by shipping a tiny Spring Boot service backed by Postgres, expose a REST endpoint, containerize it and push it to a cheap host so you feel latency/cold starts/failures.Add observability with structured logs plus basic metrics, then introduce Redis as a read-through cache and measure hit rate and eviction so ""consistency vs freshness"" becomes concrete.Add asynchronous work with a queue such as Kafka or RabbitMQ, make handlers idempotent and watch what happens when you replay messages or throttle consumers.Read the Designing Data book slowly in parallel and map each chapter to a change in your service so concepts like replication/partitioning/transactions stop being abstract.Use System Design Primer as a glossary and checklist, and treat Alex's book as interview prep that you validate by implementing one pattern at a time.Once one service is stable, add a second service and practice contracts, versioning, timeouts, retries and circuit breaking, then do a short load test and a controlled failure drill so you learn what actually breaks first.Fill gaps with targeted fundamentals.

The whole process made some exercises take a lot longer than they could have done, but as I learnt not only how I could do things better, but also how other people do, I found things easier and quicker. Sometimes I'd go and look at my 'good' solutions and see how bad they really are. And on occasion I realised the brute force approach may have actually been better as it was so much easier to understand and re-use. I think, personally, brute force isn't so bad on small scripts with small data sets that I only use for simple things. As long as I'm not loading files when I don't need to, then even looping over data sets more than I need isn't always bad. As soon as I have a nested loop I pay far more attention, likewise when I suddenly have a far larger data set than expected. (Case in point, I have a script I'm using right now where I'm sorting through a text file for some specific identifiers and false positives. My first run through the input was a couple of hundred lines. I didn't pay much attention to how I was scanning through the text. Yesterday I started looking at a file with \~1M lines.

n8t5wnu,"> I guess my ultimate question for you guys is: is a janky solution that still works good enough, even if that solution feels like you're cheating?If it gets the work done with a reasonable amount of resources, then sure. But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.Often also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)I still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.---I'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.But if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): …`I don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",syklemil,2025-08-15 10:46:47,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqr4ud,False,

The reality is companies are trying to squeeze devs harder and invest less in training (especially less junior hires and interns). They're squeezing harder because interest rates are higher and changes in tax policy meant they can't deduct R&D expenses from their income. Profitability is king right now. Second, juniors definitely are getting shafted hard right now (not 2008 level bad, but still rough). But mid/senior roles also getting shafted too, and our jobs are anything BUT safe. We got the benefit of a *little* bit of lube first, but it's still not enough to stop things from being painful. To explain: a ton of mid & senior+ devs got laid off over the last few years. I was one of them. Less than 6 months after hopping to a different Principal job they gutted my new department. Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience. But the job prospects are still not great, even for proven seniors. Companies know this and are using it to squeeze us hard to get more work for the same pay, and they're not afraid to fire people if they can't keep up.In a few years the pendulum will probably swing back for tech. AI isn't the silver bullet clueless executives claim. If the code I'm seeing daily is any indicator, ultimately AI code generation will ALSO generate a lot of maintenance (and scalability and quality) nightmares.

People don’t usually talk like that on Reddit — especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details — which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You’ll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts — things like “After X years in the industry, I realized Y” or “Am I the only one who feels Z?” It starts to feel formulaic.4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.# :robot: Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.* Unnatural use of :pile_of_poo: emojis.* Overuse of the em dash (—).# :puzzle_piece: You're Not ""Schizo"" — You're PerceptiveIt’s unsettling, yeah.

Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)Outside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)My facebook, which back then was young cool social media, could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.This is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)Now for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the ""ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$"". People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.Futhermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get. Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.I think one thing to realize when talking about job markets is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012 are all 33 to 40. This means you have an entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus. That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)Like this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021 over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.There is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",Snoo-18544,2025-08-15 02:53:40,158,cscareerquestions,t3_1mqkqve,False,

The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.But, the internet, and tech was more fun.

This is after a week of working overtime to keep up by the way.I could immediately see my team eyeing up my jobs, just ready to get one over on me to be above me on the pile.Month after month, I would be bottom of the pile despite 70 hour weeks. After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.My check ins and ""performance"" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.I had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.OK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!Despite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.I didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.Eventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. It took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there. One day, HR called up and on a conference call, asked me if we could come to an agreement.

It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.Ultimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed.

You cannot leave opportunities on the ground especially when they throw themselves at you.

DevOps is close enough to what you’re already doing that you could transition back if you wanted to and it’s a step in the right direction if you decide you want to do more dev stuff. A potential issue is the lack of dedicated support structure or guidance regarding best practices, the future of your company ops, and career development. Certainly in your team, if not the org at large. Been there, done that. That means your trajectory will be up to you to make or break. It’s hard to be a trailblazer, but the benefits can be huge. If you decide you need to go somewhere to do some learning in a year or two, it will be that much easier with the title under your belt. As for being rusty with programming, I wouldn’t stress it too much. I’ve never held the title explicitly, but as a data engineer who has only worked at small companies, I’ve done a lot of ops stuff.

Maybe the goals aren't to get to ""the next levels"", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.Companies that do career ladders well will have a concept of ""career role"" or ""terminal"" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.That means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.Once you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say ""I'll be a senior my entire life"". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. Why? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same ""level"" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward. That's why there's some level of age discrimination: when you're young you're kind of at the bar by default because you didn't have time to regress. But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.The goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.But if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home...

Wanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department’s outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. Got called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol.

But if they think that - were they to fire you - you might hit them with a lawsuit for wrongful termination and hostile work environment stuff? At the very least HR is going to have to spend some time making sure this boss isn't the problem and that they have everything they need in place to make sure you don't have a valid lawsuit.

Surprise, it was a month ago, even though they supposedly have 15 YOE as a senior engineer... it's possible they never got around to making a LinkedIn, just highly unlikely.- Sometimes they include a Github link too. The projects they have there are forks of somebody else's project with no meaningful contributions added by the candidate (been a while since I interviewed... I bet at this point you could have some AI agent drum up some fake commits under your name fairly quickly)- I saw plenty where the name and photo on the github didn't match the linkedin....I actually had one where the LinkedIn profile they linked to on the application was publicly trying to recruit other people into the scam. I dunno if he accidentally linked the wrong account, or just gave up on that application before we got around to looking at it.

I don't have a clearance, so I can't speak to the cleared side, but in public trust realm, I have not loved government contracting. There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.One benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.As for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.Driving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. The cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.On the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. TL;DR; NoVa is fine.

Things constantly change, especially in the startup world, and places like Glassdoor tend to attract people that have things to complain about so it always skews negative.One startup I was interviewing had a bunch of negative reviews saying it was a boys club, and if you weren't buddy buddy with the CEO you would never get good raises or promotions. When I actually spoke with people at the company, thats not the vibe I got at all, so I joined despite those reviews. I'm extremely glad I did. I bet those reviews were just from salty employees bad at their job, because I'm the last person to be ""buddy buddy"" with anyone at work, especially the CEO, but I got amazing raises and several promotions. I've had 2 of the biggest raises of my career at that company.So I'd encourage you at least humor it, and walk into it with good intentions.

If so, you’ll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. “Expectations are premeditated resentments” - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything. If you go into it determined to get something specific out of it, you’re probably going to be disappointed.

In-person career fairs are how I got all my opportunity.Half the CS advice is wrong because it's by students and cosplayers who never got hired in CS.On your own time, you can learn tech stacks. Is a reasonable idea. Recruiters don't care about and won't look at your GitHub. I have never listed mine. If you can hold a conversation and talk through the programming language and common software it uses, you're in good shape. You still have to get to the interview stage and the #1 way to help that is land an internship. At this point, your grades matter. Competition is fierce. Be willing to relocate and sublease.Most jobs are in 1 of C# or Java or TypeScript/JavaScript, with Python for support. Learn a database such as Postgres and writing CRUD to it. I'd hope your classes cover this. Don't try to learn everything. Look at job descriptions and see what they ask for. You don't need 30/30 requirements but a few are mandatory.
