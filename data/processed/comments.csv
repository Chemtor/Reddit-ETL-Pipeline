A *data engineer* manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.Data engineering as a fundamental concept is always going to be the same, but how this is accomplished has evolved and changed over time. The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. The decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. More recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse. Policy driven access control and dynamic data masking has changed how data governance is enforced. Snowflake and Databricks are continuing to gain market share. LLM's are changing what needs to be delivered to stakeholders.",DenselyRanked,2025-10-07 17:10:03,26,dataengineering,t3_1o0jhuk,False,

Data engineering is seeing the same uncomfortable growing pains that cloud computing (2008-2012) and frontend development (2012-2015) endured, with vendor repackaging existing alongside real innovation. While medallion architecture is undeniably repackaged data warehousing, open table formats like Iceberg are enabling radical change from proprietary silos to interoperable ecosystems (just like containers enabled a new infrastructure), zero-ETL is eliminating traditional pipelines entirely, and LLM observability is an entirely new problem space that did not exist three years ago.

I am quite forgetful and give myself a lot to do although I've found writing down a list of actions for a project, prioritising them, and then going through them one by one was great for my organisation.Second is to also be kind to yourself. Care about what you can control, accept that shit happens for things you can't. If you miss an edge case that you can't predict, then honestly, there's no point beating yourself up about it. I'll give you another story - I was getting a user reporting a migration ""wasn't correct"" even though it was 100% exactly the same as it was before. ""I don't see these characters that are appearing before. They're there now. The migration has failed"", they said. If you look at it with the naked eye, you'd be right. They don't exist...IN THE SQL DATABASE. When converted to parquet they show up. Shit was literally invisible to the naked eye and to the IDE looking at the text in SQL, but if you go and look at the fucking location specific character encoding and convert it, it is 100% there.This comes with experience. Some things cannot be helped. Mistakes will always happen. It's how we handle them after which defines us as people.",MikeDoesEverything,2025-10-07 15:19:52,2,dataengineering,t3_1o023we,False,

nim1zi3,"dlt cofounder here to add some perspective around the problem the main problem being solved here is automatic typing and schema inference and migrations. If you do not care to, for example, be notified of schema changes like type changes or field additions, or you have a limited nr of fields and you want to type manually, then maybe you do not care. If you do care, the discussion ends here - let dlt discover schema and accept the limitation that comes along. That being said, there is also also a benefit to using json in db - the data is pre-joined so retrieval of nested data is faster than re-joining tables. For this reason we are working to add typed complex data support to give you nested with schema discovery option where supported by the destination.If you do not care to manage schema then let's talk about the raw data - there is a benefit to storing json for debugging. My personal preference is to use a mounted drive and persist the extract and normalize packages (raw and normalised pre-loading) data in a bucket with <30d deletion (serves debugging and implies with gdpr without extra management), or to load via a staging bucket. IMO json does not belong in SQL because once it's there you havw to take it out to be able to use proper tooling to handle it. regarding raw data - dlt doesn't change the data, so if you want to just debug the data, you can debug it in db. dlt does change metadata such as column names, adds types, or removes null-only columns (they have no data, cannot be typed)",Thinker_Assignment,2025-10-09 15:35:27,2,dataengineering,t3_1o1b94r,False,

In other words, a majority of this complexity is just the result of compensating for platform gaps, which ends up destroying maintainability and predictability.My $0.02 - go with a platform that provides a declarative (as opposed to imperative) approach, where you focus on the data flow/transformation, and the platform handles the failures in a predictable manner. * If you are already on databricks, delta live tables are it. * If you are exploring alternatives and want something lighter weight, tabsdata is a good alternative that you can run on your laptop and expand on later.

It sucks because you could be a perfectly competent data engineer who builds solid pipelines without knowing every detail of the DAG scheduler or executor memory management, but some companies use these deep theory questions as a filtering mechanism. The frustrating part is there's no universal standard - one company wants you to explain catalyst optimizer stages, another just wants to see you write a working transformation. Your best bet is to have a baseline understanding of the theory (what happens when you call an action vs transformation, basic execution model, why shuffles are expensive) but don't kill yourself memorizing every architectural detail unless you're targeting companies known for this style of interviewing.The shift in how you prepare should really depend on the signals you're getting from your interviews. If you're consistently hitting walls on theory questions, then yeah, dedicate more time to understanding the ""why"" and ""how"" beneath the surface. But if you're getting through technical rounds and failing elsewhere, your time might be better spent on system design, communication skills, or just doing more practice problems. The truth is most associate-level work doesn't require you to debug Spark's physical plan daily, but being able to speak intelligently about it shows depth of knowledge that some interviewers value highly.If you want help for these unpredictable theory questions when they come up, I built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of curveball interview scenarios.",akornato,2025-10-11 11:31:47,1,dataengineering,t3_1o37lnr,False,

That way you end up with more clarity on which column goes to what. And optionally, you can prefix each column name with the role play if that works best for your reporting tool.

You are hired to deliver business value using data, do that. This will give you both credibility internally, as well as future buy-in for deeper technical decisions you'll make.In the mid-term, I think your intuition is correct: you'll want to move the data into an analytical database and do the processing there. This would allow you to ensure the data is in the right shape, is accurate, and is easy and cheap to query from Power BI. You'll probably need to be pragmatic there too, therefore a first step in that direction could be something that you can run locally. That would mean no risky business in terms of access control, would be a bit of manual work for you but wouldn't require additional buy-in from different teams.

nizgmvq,"A system call is basically just a fancy kind of function call. The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.The kernel can ""receive"" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.In terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the ""list of running processes"" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.Similarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to ""print"" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.On the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly.

Why are there 3 layers of indirection? Wat is this ;-; ?? "". The gap isn't about raw coding skill - its about how ""professional"" code is shaped - it doesnt simply \*work\*, but is architected to survive years of changes, changing requirements, multiple contributors and weird edge cases. What seperates a Jr. SWE from Sr. SWE is more about instinct, rather than pure DSA knowledge. 1. Read the classics. Reading literature is a great way to learn theory of things and new patterns. Stuff like *Design Patterns*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, *Anti-Patterns*, *A Philosophy of Software Design*, *Clean Code -* not saying you gotta drop everything and read them \*right now\*, but imo those are some of the books that kinda live on the must-read list for devs at some point.2. Rewrite your own old code. Grab a project you wrote quite a time ago and try to read it like you weren't the one who made it. Start asking yourself questions. Bonus: refactoring is way easier and faster now, because your ""thinking level"" has leveled up since then. You would be seeing it more as a system and not just a bunch of code glued together.3. Try contributing to large OSS projects. Tips: \- Dont just read the code - look at the directory structure, the test layout, how errors propagate. \- Look into how they are documenting it, how they introduce breaking changes, logging and observability. \- Notice how they isolate I/O, how they handle state across the application, how they make things testable. The feedback you are going to receive in your PRs is going to be invaluable (even if sometimes served cold). Soft skills become more and more important the further you go in your career. You may write the cleanest code in the world, but if you can't explain your thinking, review someone else's PR and give them feedback or advocate for better design - it is going to hold you back. Communication is \*key\*.**TL;DR:** Real-world code is about making it last. The instinct you will develop from experience, mistakes and seeing how big systems fail and evolve is going to shape how you design, develop and debug .

nj4vr6c,"**TL;DR: Good code is code that delivers the desired functionality and is as easy to maintain as possible.****Why our profession is culty on this question**One thing you need to understand about our profession is that most practices have the following pattern:* Some smart people devise an approach that fit their needs and allowed them to produce some exceptional value.* Some non- or less technical people saw the money and started either selling this approach as ""the right way to do things"" for money or telling their engineers to start doing it because they think it will make more money.* The purpose behind the practice is lost, but people nevertheless dogmatically follow the practice since it's ""the right way to do things"" and some smart people said to do it.You can see this with agile, OOP, functional programming, every framework you've ever used, etc.**What you actually need to do**Writing quality, maintainable code is about minimizing complexity, and there are multiple kinds of complexity.* Computer efficiency - How efficiently your machine can execute your code.* Local complexity - How easy it is to understand a file you're looking at on the screen.* System complexity - How easy it is to understand how all your files interact with one another across your entire application.Generally speaking you need to sacrifice one or two of these in order to achieve the other. Rarely can you get all three at once.Object-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as ""objects"" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.With functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.I have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.If you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is ""A Philosophy of Software Design"" by John Ousterhout.

For those you basically just have to have a language server or some other step to catch your goofs.

niiuk8n,"This is an entire field called GIS. The short of it is that you have two basic types of GeoSpatial data, vector and raster. Vector data is basically a table of attributes, but one of the fields has a geometry. Think Latitude and Longitude for points, and then just an array of those for Lines / Polygons. Raster Data is an image that you drape over your canvas, but it has embeded or an extra file with information saying where and how to place the image, like a tiff world ‘.tfw’ file.Any geospatial data will have a spatial reference for the coordinates, like WGS84 for your typical lat longs in decimal degrees or degree, minutes, seconds. Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.Anyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.Now you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map. You could make static maps (pdfs or images) using desktop software like QGIS or ArcGIS, or you could make the data available through a Map Server or WMS/WFS service and then have a web map the requests the data from those servers. The web server is usually something like QGIS Server or ArcGIS server, and then you consume it using a map library like leaflet, open layers, or ArcGIS JavaScript API. Of course, over the internet, this can be slow depending on the size of the data, so then you start getting into tiling your data. So for rasters, you’ve pre-tiled your data (vector and raster can do this) at different zoom levels, so as a user pans around a map, they’re only calling the specific tiles they need to display on the map instead of asking for the server to constantly clip and send the data they need for their extent.

The cartographers' term for these imagery maps is ""orthophotomap"". They aren't satellite maps, but they play them on TV. Web servers spit out those images as ""tiles"". The web map viewers have all sorts of fancy Javascript to retrieve, scale, and rotate those tiles so they look seamless.

Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.Similarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.Without OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.Sometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself!

nj6g1ar,">Why is OOP such a crazy thing to try to define in your own words, with it making sense?Because it's a very nebulous term that over the course of its history has been used to mean different things by different people. Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.Typically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of ""objects""; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.In a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like ""hungry"", ""happy"" or ""dead"". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.Many people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; ""encapsulation"" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), ""inheritance"" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and ""polymorphism"" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",DTux5249,2025-10-12 22:28:17,22,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,

An object ""dog"" based on ""pet"" would add on siblings (list), photo (BLOB), and maybe functions bark(), dotrick() and so on. But you can also create object ""cat"" based on ""pet"", add color notes, color pattern, photo (BLOB), siblings (list), preferred toy, etc.What are some things only cat would do?

An example of this would be creating an instance of a class called HTTPServer and using it will cause it to start an http server without exposing you to the underlying sockets or network protocols to make it work - you don’t need to know all of the variables used by HTTPServer.,Antsolog,2025-10-13 02:17:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,

Driver information is useful to the customer front end, the restaurant portal potentially, HR/Finance, etc. So again, this should probably be its own table, and accessed largely via JOINs. The restaurant list doesn't care about customers, or drivers. Continue down the line. You'll end up with a bunch of tables, a bunch of JOINs that are needed to process orders, updated the client front-end, etc. but all will be logical.

They're not mutually exclusive.There are products that are open-source, but they charge money for it. The motivations can range here - maybe the source is open to promote trust, maybe it's open so that hobbyists can access it for free while business users can pay for support.There are also products that are closed-source, but free to consumers. I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.So in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.If your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.A really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the ""top"" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.As an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They ""lose"" money on the free users but gain community.On the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you.

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.Most open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.Quick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",EliSka93,2025-10-08 19:28:29,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1jwxj,False,

As to how to implement, I'd lean on the architect to be able to break down the project into more digest able parts. Then you can somewhat figure what you need to learn for each part, and knock it out step for step. Rome wasn't build in a singular step, but building for building, road by road.Also AI is still a mixed bag, you can def give it the project concept, then what tech you are using, tell it you still need to learn the tech then create some kind of timeline, keep in mind real life is messy so the timeline is more of a guideline, but it can give you some handles.A prompt like this:"" \- explain what the MVP is supossed to do, and that it is an MVP - \- explain which tech choices have been made - \- explain which parts you still need to learn - \- Ask it to make a timeline for you and suggestions for where to learn what - """,shelledroot,2025-10-10 13:35:32,1,learnprogramming,t1_nirpkvv,False,

ni6s1kb,"The first thing to learn, especially for someone with ADHD, isn't actually a programming thing, but rather an organisational problem-solving thing; it's ""divide and conquer"": you need to learn how to split big tasks into small enough sub tasks that they're trivial. You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.Focusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.This is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.The second thing to learn is ""make skeletons"" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.For your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.At any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (""Agile"" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).There are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",GetContented,2025-10-07 03:26:54,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o038m7,False,

I like the struggle (masochist >,>)"" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.Second piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think ""Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break"" I write that down in this list. 2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like ""Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week"".3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.By keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. Also, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project.

Find some pods with Bjarne Stroustrup!Mister C++ himself perhaps wouldn’t agree with this, but much of the best books on programming basics use Lisps as a vehicle. This way, they can focus on the programming itself, rather than forcing complex syntax on the reader.One good example is “The Little Schemer” by Friedman & Felleisen. If you choose that one, I’ll spoil one thing: The “rules” and ”commandments” presented in the book are just rules within the book, meant to be applied when solving the exercises; they are generally not rules of the Scheme lang. This could be a bit confusing, if you haven’t understood it. Another thing: if you don’t solve a problem now, you maybe solve it next time.

From a central EU and USA perspective: A degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. A computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to ""self learn"" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. A software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. In some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. Then you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) Certificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done.

Computers are not capable of storing anything but integer values, which is why we devise so many various encoding schemes for things that aren't integers.And the answer it is more useful not to when treating them as string/character values, and not really all that useful when parsing a string into a numeric type. First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation. Even if we eliminate all of the control characters and limit ourselves to printable characters included in ASCII encoding, you still need at least 7 bits to cover those 95 characters with values from 0 (`b0000000`) to 94 (`b1011110`). We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really.

For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.Stay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you. And when learning and problem solving becomes addictive that's when you start building the software you dream of building, because you start to realize that nothing is too difficult you just have to put in more work.",W_lFF,2025-10-12 13:58:24,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o4ocgp,False,

Than this other game they didn't develop where they didn't have that loading screen constraint? How can you compare the two? How can anyone not in bad faith be affirmative that the current game is better than this other game they didn't develop without constraints? I know you didn't come up with these examples, that they come from people looking for stuff to analyze and make content out of. But they are just bad generalizations. In any projects, you have constraints, and your goal is do the best thing possible despoite those constraints. And sometimes, being creative with those constraints helps a lot in doing that. but people don't intentionally self-inflict contraints when they want to do a product. It can however be a nice way to spark creativity or to develop one's skill by forcing oneself to do something differnetly than how they were doing it. I'm thinking of game jams (to stay in the realm of video games examples), where the goal is specifically to add two massive constraints (time and a custom directive) in order to force developers to be creative.

nj369zq,"Oh brother, lets break this down, and I'm going to explain this in a high level, so I don't have any Java-specific tips to give. Maybe just general ones.So in this 2 weeks, you would have to create:- mechanics (movement, AI/automatons, pass/fail conditions, etc.)- look (UI, aesthetics, animations, etc.)- other utils that can be optional (save/load system, settings system, the extra stuff that can help with accessibility)There can be more things here and there depending on complexity, but as a bare minimum, you would make all of these and combine them all together.You're now probably thinking ""oh boi this is a lot of work"" and I don't know how many you are in the team, so my first suggestion is to make it as simple as possible, and only add features if it's possible within the timeframe. Don't try to make too much features that just ends up delaying the release. We call that ""feature creep"". Write a TODO list and gauge the complexity of certain features or aspects so that your team can prioritize on ones that are critical. Don't try to deliver a car without an engine. That's what happened to my team in my game development course in university and we used Unity3D, which has less boilerplate setup than Java Swing (or at least, we don't code the UI from scratch), and we're given a longer time to make the game. Feature creep fucked us over.Next suggestion is learning git and GitHub. Host your project there, and you all can collaborate wherever you are and you can revert changes if stuff did not work right. Creating branches is useful so that everyone's works can be isolated. And you can do peer reviews. This helps with code quality and engages collaboration with each other.Last suggestion: always test. If possible, reserve a few days for playtesting and bugfixing after playtest. That's why we have alpha and beta tests. Alpha test is your whole team testing the game, and beta test is other people playing your game. This will give you a fresh perspective on people interacting with your game. Like as simple as a certain hitbox not working right. Or a critical bug that can happen when conditions are met that your whole team has not encountered in your internal playtesting.And that's it from me. I'm not a professional game developer by any means, and I'm not specialized in Java Swing or Java in general (although it's my main programming language), but my game development course and my current job gave me a lot of insight and workflows on how to tackle potentially large projects like these. And I've realized that the difficulty is not necessarily on the programming, but planning and managing the project altogether. So I guess the first step now is to setup all the things. GitHub, the initial Java project and needed external libraries. Then plan it all out, so that you can assign tasks to yourselves. Feel free to chat in DM. Just don't show weird sht or send a virus that destroys my PC.Oh right before I forget that this post exists, my other advice is to not make AI do your work. Sometimes, they're just doing random sht. Other times, it collides with something. AI relies on your foundation code to become a good asset (which can still screw up, but it may screw up less). So assuming you are allowed to use AI coding agents (because this question will come up at some point), always verify what it types out. Again, this is where peer reviews come into play. Either do it in school or via GitHub PRs.And NEVER EVER USE GENERATIVE AI FOR ANY CREATIVE ASSETS LIKE ART OR MUSIC. We have free assets to use on the Internet if you have to.

nipypy0,"Programming is an extension of technology, or you can also think of it as a microcosm of technology. The main purpose of technology is to **improve the way we do something**, either with a tool or otherwise. Instead of calculating numbers by hand, we use a calculator to automate the process. Instead of converting a lot of numbers using a calculator, we use a spreadsheet program to do it in bulk. A lot of the constructs of programming serve the same purpose.At its very basic, most programs can be written with if-conditions and variables alone. However, we don't do that, and we use lists, loops, functions and classes instead, **not** because we have to (exceptions apply), but because we want to. Most of them serve the same purpose: **to shorten and simplify code at the cost of more complex and intricate logic**.For example, instead of writing: cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl;You can instead write: for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; }Classes serve a similar purpose: instead of having loose, disconnected variables and functions all over the place, you ""group"" them into objects. This gives you many benefits, making it much simpler to code certain algorithms, keeping your code organized so that you don't confuse yourself and others as your code base expands, and in some languages, it provides a layer of ""code safety"" as well.But to emphasize, you do **not** have to necessarily write code this way, in most cases. A lot of different syntax ""oddities"" exist to be **shortcuts**, such as how `i++` is mostly just `i = i + 1`. The same is true of a while-loop versus a for-loop, the former of which is more fundamental. This is why it seems there are so many solutions to the same problem, but they all do the same thing in varying levels of efficiency, in terms of logic and/or syntax.",Joewoof,2025-10-10 04:33:44,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o21qmk,False,

In practice, all platforms I've seen would support `-2**31` as well. I.e. the values -2147483648 up to and including 2147483647 should fit in a 32-bit signed integer. But the C Standard (at least all C Standards before C23) only requires platforms to support from -2147483647 to 2147483647 in order to accomodate storing the integer in non 2's complement form. However it seems that C23 requires 2's complement, so maybe that is different in C23. In practice, though, all platforms you're likely to use are using 2's complement. However, 1L << 31 results in 2147483648, a value that does not fit in a 32-bit signed integer, so you are invoking integer overflow (which is formally undefined behaviour, but since you're doing at ""at compile time"" maybe it's really implementation defined). In any case, we surely can't expect that the result will be the same in this case between platforms (32-bit long vs. 64-bit long).If you want the same behaviour, you should suffix ul on your integer constant (some people prefer writing uL or UL for readability). That way, you'll be working with 32-bit unsigned long vs. 64-bit unsigned long. The sizes are different but since you're still within the 32-bit unsigned range in your example, you'll get the same behaviour in this case. Since 1ul << 31 is unsigned long, you should also update the printf format from %ld to %lu to ensure the correct integer interpretation when printing it out.",chaotic_thought,2025-10-09 08:54:19,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1z9m5,False,
niln3xl,"> but declaring a literal's type as long, long long etc. seems to kill the whole point of using uint32_t in the first place.Correct. You see the contradiction. Literals are implicitly cast to the assigned type because this pedantic redundancy is a wholly unnecessary distraction that has no benefit in any sense of the word.So I've played with it, and wrote the variations: int x = 5; int x = 5L; int x = 5LL; int x = 5ULL;And I compiled them under GCC for ARM and x86_64. This is what I got: mov w0, 5 //ARM mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 5 //x86_64The compiler didn't care what my literal was suffixed. The type is determined by the type declaration of the variable being assigned, and the literal is implicitly converted at compile-time.Now as for your code: printf(""%zu %ld"", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);Yeah, the type is deduced from the literal itself, so of course you're going to get a non-portable result.---I think it's important to understand how to use primitive types.C defines a whole family of type aliases. They are guaranteed to alias the built-in types. First are the fixed width types: int8_tEtc. The fixed width types ARE NOT guaranteed to be defined in the first place - they are only defined on platforms that actually have native hardware support for those exact widths. If there is no 16 bit type support on that hardware, there is no `int16_t`. This comes up on DSPs and ASICs the most, though you'll also see it on FPGAs, in some old or really tiny embedded architectures, like old 4-bit machines, or some exotic or esoteric hardware few have ever heard of.The fixed width types are for implementing protocols. These could be file formats, hardware interfaces, or network/transport protocols. You will use these for defining types that are going to be serialized or mapped to hardware. You'll use these in data buffers.Then there are the `least` types: uint_least32_tEtc. These types are the smallest widths available with at least as many bits, and these types are ALWAYS defined. For platforms that support fixed width types, they're 1:1. They may contain more bits, but you cannot portably rely on that, nor should you, because that defeats the point.Use these types in your in-memory data structures to maximize system and cache memory density and bus transfer efficiency.Continued...",mredding,2025-10-09 14:21:26,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1z9m5,False,
nikgas6,"Okay, the example is unfortunate but consider the following: 1LU << 48 would still be integer overflow if long is represented by a 32-bit wide integer. On a different platform (where long would be 64-bits wide) this would not do integer overflow. My question is: which option is best for keeping literal constants typed and yet ensure portability between platforms.",Ssingleaspringle,2025-10-09 09:16:06,1,learnprogramming,t1_nike9it,True,
niln53s,"Finally, there are the `fast` types: int_fast16_tEtc. You should use these as function parameters, iterators, and locals. These are the most computationally efficient use of hardware registers on your platform with at least as many bits. Very often these will be larger than the bit size specified. Registers tend to be laid out in powers of two word sizes - word, double word, quad word... And so will these. Ideally, what you'll get is these values will be optimized and either never see cache or system memory - your code should be small enough that they exist only in registers - for sufficiently large hardware platforms.C has a weak type system, because C is a negotiation between the standard, the hardware, and you. This flexibility inherent to the primitive types is also a form of portability in its own right. This is how you can port Unix from one architecture to another, because you write code in terms of `int`, and you get whatever size and extent that hardware can handle, whatever hardware you go to. You get internal consistency. It's when you start working with external data that you need to accommodate data protocols and their data.Most of the time you don't need fixed width types - and it's actually not desirable for computation. They're either too big for memory, or too small for registers. Besides - if you're not defining a protocol, who cares how many bits you have exactly? All you care about is that you have enough - which is something you need to figure out at design time. What are you doing? How many bits do you need? Once you know, you want the fewest to store in memory, and then you don't care how many are used for actual computation, so long as it's fast and efficient.So the `least` and `fast` end up being the types you use the most. They're completely inappropriate and not portable for protocols, and you want to get away from the fixed width types as soon as possible - at the fringes, where IO happens.So this code: printf(""%zu %ld"", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);It's completely asinine. You're not outputting the size and extent of a type, but of a value, and the type of the value is up to the compiler's discretion - the implementation just PICKED SOMETHING, because it doesn't matter; in all other code, this would be narrowed or widened implicitly and correctly. This is fine for writing debug, but as you're writing to the `stdout` file descriptor and presuming you were trying to do something REAL, you'd be wanting to write in terms of a protocol, which means the correct thing to do is write this in terms of a fixed width type to make it portable.---The other thing is about the C type system - an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. You are not expected to use the primitive types directly - you're expected to make your own types in terms of primitives, and then describe your solution in terms of that. If you didn't care what the type was - then you'd write your implementation as a macro, and practice the Generic Programming paradigm.Your `int` is always something more specific, a quantity, a range, a unit of something. Make your types and control your semantics. An `int` can perform all arithmetic and bitwise operations, but a `weight` can only add to other `weight`s, and can only multiply against scalars. A `weight` can't be negative. So: typedef struct weight weight; weight *create(int_least32_t); weight *dup(const weight *); weight *copy(weight *, const weight *); void destroy(weight *); weight *add(weight *, const weight *); weight *multiply(weight *, int); int_least32_t weight_to_int(const weight *); int print(const weight *);Notice it's an opaque pointer. `print` returns an `int` because `printf` returns an `int`. `multiply` accepts an `int` because its an arbitrary value - unless in your design you know something better. An `int` is going to be the native word size, so efficient. Then you implement: struct weight { int_least32_t value; }; weight *create(const int_least32_t value) { weight *w = NULL; if(value >= 0) { weight *w = (weight *)malloc(sizeof(weight)); w.value = value; } return w; } //... weight *add(weight *res, const weight *w) { if(res && w) { res.value += w.value; return res; } return NULL; } weight *multiply(weight *res, const int v) { if(res && v >= 0) { res.value *= v; return res; } return NULL; }",mredding,2025-10-09 14:21:35,2,learnprogramming,t1_niln3xl,False,
nikm2yx,"> consider the following: 1LU << 48 would still be integer overflow if long is represented by a 32-bit wide integerYes, you're right. This may be why the Standard says you are only allowed to left-shift up to 31 bits for a 32-bit unsigned type. If the type of unsigned long is a 32-bit type on a particular platform (e.g. ARM), then indeed shifting it left by 48 is undefined behaviour.More on this can be found discussed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper)Also, I'm not really sure you can avoid implicit integer promotion in a single expression like 1ul << 48. Even if you write UINT32_C(1) as suggested in the other reply on the thread, the type produced by that expression is actually uint_least32_t (i.e. it could be 32-bit or it could be bigger).So in my view, an expression like 1ul << 48 is just not portable. I would hope that my compiler would give me a warning if I were compiling that code on a platform where unsigned long is 32-bit, but it's conceivable that on other platforms (where unsigned long is 64-bit), that it would compile with no warning but still be non-portable, as you seem to have discovered.If you're really in a bind and need to do something like the above in a portable way, you could consider computing it at runtime. Though in this case it seems a bit like a waste of time, since it seems like we want the final value 0 in this case: uint64_t tmp = 1ul; tmp <<= 48; uint32_t value = (uint32_t)tmp; printf(""%zu\n"", sizeof(value)); printf(""%lu\n"", value);This should give the same result regardless of what size long's are on the platform. And the result should be 0 on all platforms that support uint32_t (for all possible starting values of value), since vacated bits get filled in with 0 -- unless I'm misunderstanding something that could happen differently on some platform (seems unlikely though).",chaotic_thought,2025-10-09 10:14:19,2,learnprogramming,t1_nikgas6,False,

nj2pz1y,"You are barely a month in, it is too early to worry about things like that. You first need to learn programming, which includes thinking logically, solving problems, and how programming languages work, and then you can switch languages as much as you like. Learning a new language only feels hard to you now, because you don't know how to program yet. Once you know Python, switching to Java will be quite easy for example. And your friend is wrong. Python is plenty effective, and used in real world projects. Mostly in Web-backend, Data Science and automation. Of those three, Java or C# are really only useful as a web backend. I suggest you keep on learning python, until you can comfortably build anything you might want to build. A small webserver, a simple game like Tetris, a system that scrapes the web and alerts you when a point is scored in your favourite sport. Then you can start looking for a job you might want. Not to apply (yet), but to start learning what you need for that job. For example: Frontend web jobs require JS/TS, HTML and CSS, Backend you can do with Python, C#, rust, Java, Kotlin, PHP, ruby, Go, ... basically any language, although some will be more in demand in your area than others. More low level jobs will require C++ or something similar, many PC Programs will be done in C#, just because Microsoft pushes it, and so on. Once you have identified what it is you want to do, you can start working on that.

Because this is what people usually are doing when going for a Bachelor degree in Computer Sciences.

You will pick one field and specialize in that. Usually one or two.And then after having chosen the thing you like to do then go over different job listings in your target city (forget working remotely, for now) and see which tech stack they are requiring in these jobs.

niztvkg,"My first comment is about what you told in the end. Passion CAN feed. Sure, not always but it can. In my case, computer sciences was my passion and my hobby and I eventually went for a degree in it and started working as a software developer. If your passion is art, then yeah, artists are not making much, as I have heard. Do not pick software development just because of its salary. When I did my university studies I saw people picking computer sciences for all the wrong reasons: salary, a friend recommended, a mother wanted, a wish to escape an army service (it is compulsory here), etc. And they dropped out. I saw students burning out, being depressed, etc. because they realized they picked a wrong field. Do you need the same?Pick software development when you have an interest towards it. When you are good problem solver. When you have a mathematical mind. Because software development is all about analyzing different real life problems, coming up with ideas for solutions to these problems, and then implementing and delivering these solutions. If you are not a creative person, if you are unable to figure out solutions to random problems, if you are not interested in sitting behind a computer for 8 hours a day, then this field is not for you.The next step, pick a field that is in demand in place where you plan to start working. And for time being, that place will be Sudan. You are less likely to find a remote job as a beginner or even as a Junior software developer. Which means, you should set your current goal to find a job in your local market. Check job offers in cities around you. From there you can find the technologies and job positions that are in demand. For example you can be interested in blockchains, and it is a valid interest, but when there are exactly ZERO jobs for it, then should you pick it as your main specialty? You can pick it as a side hobby then, but not as something you will be doing for a job.And about machine learning, AI, web development (frontend, backend, full stack), applied cryptography, cyber security, etc. What about trying out these things? The same way how you'd try these out while doing your Bachelor studies in Computer Sciences and having these introduced to you during your courses. When I did my degree studies I learnt some embedded programming, web application development, telecom technologies, system administration, cyber security, different maths, etc. Did I specialize in all of these? No. I specialized in web application development (mainly backend) and in cyber security (did Master studies in it). If you are considering becoming a web application developer then better go for full stack. Which stack? Depends on your local job market. In some places they want PHP developers. Where I live they want Java developers. Pick the technology based on job offers. And the same goes for choosing the front end framework. May it be React, Angular, Vue or something else. Also, then you have to learn some web application security and also some DevOps (enough to deal with Docker, setting up Kafka or some message queuing tool, working with logs, setting up CI/CD pipeline, and perhaps even trying out Kubernetes). Because writing code is not enough. What if your stuff gets hacked? What if the application stops working when 100 people start using it?

Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.Second, make sure to study system design interviews.

Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.The above is for ICs who are still hands on.

You can go find another team, but recognize that the game is the same. If you want to be valuable to the team, you have to show growth in ways that the team values, not just what you deem valuable. On the other hand, if you can't do that, and feel strongly that you know what is valuable better than anyone else, that's the spirit that drives entrepreneurs.

Obviously the work you did won't be a tit-for-tat match with a backend engineer working on some Java WebLogic crap or something but at the end of the day what's more important is that you clearly have the background skills to build complex data pipelines.I'd say focus on selling your FAAS and AWS cloud skillset, those are pretty important in modern infra. >How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field?

I think anything is marketable with the right verbiage, personally. You could be a mainframe developer and as long as you demonstrate the ability to learn, manage complex systems, and build out feature services I think most places would be happy with it. Also, ETL is probably still very much relevant in the modern age. It's not like data pipelines are suddenly agnostic and all-encompassing. I don't have the personal experience with the BIG data boys though, as my only experience with ETL was with a financial firm myself doing similar work as yours but I can't imagine the practice is somehow deprecated and forgotten to time already. >And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again?

nip3aqv,"I'm in the same boat and basically had to up-skill myself and work on side projects to refresh my mind. I relearned some fundamentals using Udemy and started working on my Master's degree. I also picked up courses in System Design using [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com) and educative.io. I use ChatGPT a lot to create study guides for myself when I interview at companies, I try to get a refresher on their tech stack so I can speak their language. I also started doing Leetcode religiously, completed Neetcode's 150 and have about 170 problems on Leetcode.com. It's been a rough journey where I've been passing DSA interviews and System design interviews, but now companies are starting to ask on the job syntax questions to really filter down candidates. There's just too many of us, the market is overly saturated. So now I'm on the grind, building apps from scratch and iterating on it over and over again until I have the syntax down to a T as well. We'll see how my next interviews go. I've had friends in the same boat and I had one friend that studied LC for 6 months straight to get into Meta, but ended up failing the System Design. The other thing is they're super picky about languages now, if you say you know Java, they want you to do their stupid LC in Java. As if knowing syntax is going to make you a good engineer....I've been unemployed for a year and still looking, so you're not alone.People that are employed will never understand what we're going through. In fact, they wouldn't even pass their own interviews today. I can guarantee you that I have more skill than any of them in any system design interview or leetcode question. All they know is how to interview people and of course when you have all the answers in front of you it's easy to do that.Stay strong my brother, I've also considered other roles that are closely related like Customer Support Engineer, DevOps, IT Support, and wait until the economy gets better. I've been applying to those roles and it's been a lot better since they don't ask ridiculous questions and demand regurgitation of syntax immediately.

His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.Maybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.That's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.That creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often.

The company I worked for the longest time had three employees and does not exist anymore (this was *fun* to explain to Japanese immigration for my work visa), and the largest company I ever worked for had 8000 employees worldwide. I have never had a problem getting interviews.2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.3. AI will have a massive shift soon. Pretty much everyone noticed by now that there have been several trillion dollars invested into AI by now, so there will now have to be a few trillion dollars in revenue, soon, or investors will pull the plug. It won't be entirely dead, but completely different.4. Employment laws and expectations in Japan and Europe are different. My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.So basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the ""leave now"" option is likely better.

I think in most cases management does not even know what ""quality code"" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job. Now SWE ""talent"" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.I've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career. These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.Most of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base. They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary. SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project. They did the best they could with the skills they had. Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.The SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies. They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it. These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.They try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that: (off the top of my head)* don't know the value of their talent* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a jobSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed. I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. I'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor.

I got to the point where I knew the entire pipeline of the entire setup, I was then able to communicate with customers about what was possible and know how to fix stuff when things broke.

I remember experiencing the same feeling as you when someone at work asked me about the security side of the application. I had worked on the project for ~8 months and felt embarrassed I had to ask the senior SW developer for help. The honest answer is that it 1) takes time to get a hang on things like user stories and in general knowing the codebase and 2) don’t be afraid to ask questions.I’d say I felt really comfortable at around 1.5 years of working on the project before I stopped asking the senior dev. May seem like a lot but it’s better than pretending to know. I’d recommend making a documentation of some kind on the codebase and being diligent in recording each step taken when doing a task. Then you can refer back to your notes and eventually it starts to paint an overall picture of the code base you are working on. For example start by creating notes on the files in the code base you are most familiar with and then move on from there. Can even be 2-3 sentences if you don’t fully know - Auth.ts “This code deals with the security of client.” Eventually with good documentation will help clear things up, good luck!",YupYupMcgup,2025-10-13 00:09:14,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1o519hu,False,

nj74kfd,"At a large tech company where there's too much stuff for you to know the whole codebase in depth, I think the most important part is to get to a point where you feel confident (AKA you don't find yourself feeling out of your depth) picking up new parts of the codebase without much ado. This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions3. Having the (un)earned confidence that things will go well - I actually think this is the most important aspect. Most of the time, it's easier to just assume that you'll find what you're looking for and not fret too much about the task.

nipn7r9,"If you’re working as a repair tech, you definitely don’t have zero experience. That’s hands-on hardware and troubleshooting work. The question is how to leverage that experience to get interviews. If you can't get interviews your probably falling short at the application stage (missing some keywords in your resume, or languages/tools that are needed for the job). If you ever get a denial reach out to the hiring manager and see what was missing from your experience and work on getting that experience even if it's solo work. Worse case the hiring person doesn't respond, best case they give you some pointers. (This is assuming it isn't a fake posting) If you are you're getting interviews but not moving forward, then the HR or panel stage is the crux to get over. The HR round is your chance to show passion and explain how your background can benefit the **company**. The panel round is where you prove your technical knowledge and problem solving skills. Use your HR round to figure out what projects are currently being worked on by the company and figure out if they're interesting to you. You will burn out if you find the work boring, and then you're back to square 1. You mentioned companies hiring people with more experience, sure that will happen, but I have worked with people who have 10+ years of experience and they still got laid off with me. They are struggling to get past the HR round because they got too comfortable, they lost their passion, ability to adapt, and put less effort into what a company needs and is hiring for. Effort and curiosity counts more than people think. the only thing better is experience. Focusing on projects is the best idea to open you up to getting experience. Even better than that is trying to contribute to open source of projects you're truly interested in. You'll be working with other developers, getting real world coding experience, and getting feedback on your code. This is a HUGE advantage when getting through the panel round with other engineers reviewing your work live. Keep building and publishing your work, and make sure recruiters can actually *see* what you’ve been working on. That visibility can make a huge difference.Again this field is beyond tough right now, but keep applying, there are so many of us with experience looking for a job, but we are still working with other engineers to continue growing out knowledge an experience.

HR often encourages their employees to leave positive reviews while they work there. Those won't be genuine either.An anecdote of mine, I was considering joining an established startup, and their Glassdoor had a bunch of reviews complaining about nepotism, and how if you aren't buddy buddy with the CEO, you'll never get good raises or get promoted.I didn't get that vibe at all when I spoke with my hiring manager, the team, a manager from another team, and the CTO.

nimmtiv,"Not kidding but based on the way you describe your situation -- I would sincerely suggest using either ChatGPT study mode, or Claude learning mode, to ask questions and have it explain what's going on. You can also ask it to do web searches or research for you, if you tell it to find learning resources or videos for you (based on topics or styles that you tell it that you prefer).For example, if you have an enterprise approved AI LLM you can use, then when one of your AI/ML peers publishes a document or a slide deck, you can just upload the doc and give it a prompt like this ""I am a software engineer, trying to learn more about AI/ML. One of my coworkers shared this doc recently, can you help break it down and explain what it means? Assume I know basic software and technology concepts, but that I have no advanced statistics or data science training."" Of course, if you don't have a safe enterprise AI to use, then you can't be uploading sensitive documents to your personal subscription. But you can still take certain key phrases or concepts that are generic, and ask Claude or ChatGPT to explain then (e.g. what is XGBoost? how do you run an A/B test? what does stat sig mean? how does deep learning work? etc.).Using an AI LLM is no substitute for real education or reading and studying textbooks, and it won't make you transform into a full ML engineer overnight or something... but it can actually be a very useful starting point for someone who is a beginner. Eventually you can use it to help you generate sample projects, build your own ML model as a tutorial, etc. Also, once you feel like you've got a basic grasp, then you should graduate from asking your initially dumb questions to your AI LLM only, to asking (slightly?) less dumb questions to your actual coworkers. Don't pester them and don't make them responsible for teaching you, but generally speaking if you show serious interest in learning and put in work yourself, most people are happy to talk about their work with you (especially if, as an engineer, you might sometimes be able to help unblock them in various ways, then you can trade knowledge sharing and favors with them).",strugglingcomic,2025-10-09 17:18:01,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1o2b34k,False,

Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. Another challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years. It was actually three 1-year options, so they had to be renewed each year. Try to get an idea if they're really doing consulting work or they are more staffing/contracting.

At this point, the company has managed to convince a venture capitalist to part with a small amount of money. Don't take this as a sign of confidence though - to you and me it's the equivalent of lending a friend $5 to play the slots and promise us 20% of whatever they win.If they *are* successful (again - super rare) it can be an awesome pay day for you... but that pay day also can take a *long long* time. I joined one startup back in 2015 that *still* hasn't had an exit event - the $880 worth of stock I got back then is now worth about $110k (back of the envelope) but I can't (reasonably) actually do anything with it because it's still private equity.I joined another startup \~2 years ago though, which had a more typical liquidation exit - I got a fat offer from the next company that hired me and more career advancement in the year of working there than in the 5 preceding years in FAANG combined, but my $160k of equity earned me a total of $0 because there wasn't anything left over after the debts and preferred stock was paid out. Even *that* was a pretty lucky case - I was working for *way* less than I was worth and really stretching myself to do so, if my next (current) employer hadn't taken notice of me I would have just found myself sitting around putting my heart and soul into something with nothing to show for it.**Startups are FANTASTIC for learning a lot of things ""in the trenches"" though**. **This is NOT appropriate for everybody.** If you're really ambitious and love being part of the rat race (especially early career where this is especially helpful!) it can be an awesome thing. It means late days, doing things *way* outside your comfort zone, learning skills that you should never have to deal with as an engineer... but that also means getting a broad skill set and great experience in a short time.In my experience, judge the founders *very critically*. I like to ask founders hard questions to see how they react. It takes experience in business and industry to get a feel for what's good / not good, what you like / don't, I can't really give great advice here - but if you're interested in young companies and startups, the best way to get that experience is the hard way!If you're happy with the base pay and want to hustle for a bit, it could be a good opportunity. It will be a hustle, odds are much more than 50/50 that you'll end up working your ass off for something that fails, but you'll learn a ton along the way and make some good connections.

nifthvr,"Switching is worth it if you can show real ops skills and you’re fine with on-call; do it via internal projects and a tight home lab.Pick one cloud (AWS is safest). Containerize a small Java service, push to ECR, deploy to ECS Fargate or EKS. Provision with Terraform (VPC, IAM, RDS), wire CI/CD with GitHub Actions, add canary/blue‑green, alerts in CloudWatch/Prometheus, and cost alarms. Practice runbooks, rollbacks, backup/restore, and least‑privilege IAM. At work, volunteer to own the pipeline, infra modules, or a lift‑and‑shift of a legacy service; that experience counts more than certs, but AWS SAA then Developer or DevOps Pro will help you get callbacks.Day to day is less feature coding and more incidents, reliability, and cost/security reviews. Market’s decent for platform/SRE, but entry is noisy; real deployments and on-call stories beat toy labs.

Companies of decent size also are using frameworks/technologies to minimize developer major mistakes like that as well.If you can’t change job:1.) review the backend developer’s work (I assume you use something like GitHub/gitlab where reading PRs aren’t known to others2.) if have questions, ask the PR author about it3.) participate in design meetings (if open to public or just ask for access)4.) ask your manager about fullstack work, which I assume will force someone to review your work",kevin074,2025-10-13 13:50:40,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1o5iuhd,False,

It honestly sounds like the main thing holding you back is your own preoccupation with making a mistake, but I think you could make that argument about any job, and everyone has to start somewhere.Something that helped me worry less was understanding blast radius for the changes I was making.

njcy029,"I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.Here are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.First of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)After that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.You need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.You need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.Security is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.Overall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",dskfjhdfsalks,2025-10-13 23:24:09,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1o5iuhd,False,
njacjix,Yes.. I think a lot of it is psychology. I can't well connect the dots - I'm a senior on FE but worry my BE skills not even close to what a senior backend dev would deliver. I like your blast radius approach.,ineyy,2025-10-13 15:30:14,1,cscareerquestions,t1_njab2zp,True,
njaf1x4,"As someone who started fullstack and moved BE I had the same concerns but some problems in software engineering are just universal. BE engineering is just moving data around, and making sure it moves around either fast enough or cheap enough, and that only people who are allowed to see the data can see the data (which is also a FE problem). I joke to my coworkers that we’re all just data plumbers.Have you done system design interviews? That will honestly cover 80% of what you need to know for BE stuff, and every cloud host has their own version of the sys design components that you’ll study. The rest is LLD (which you likely already have experience with), dev ops if needed, and testing.",JustJustinInTime,2025-10-13 15:42:37,1,cscareerquestions,t1_njacjix,False,
