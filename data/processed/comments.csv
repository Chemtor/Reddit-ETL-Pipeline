He was an MBA who got dumped on the data team because he was the CFO's buddy who had fucked up one too many times on the finance team.Things he did while managing the small data team:1. Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, 4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS.

How do you know that fixed it, other than adding a basic regression test each time you find one that doesn't get caught. I do think it's useful for examples, asking questions about your code and best practices (also it's OK to not align with best practices the real world very rarely has perfect alignment to what Fang companies use). Using SQL is also so important, I'm often in calls where I'm able to prove whether something is true during the call. Or just look at a coworkers query and understand why their results aren't as expected. That takes some time. To me LLMs are like having a junior coworker, I think if you treat it like another junior coworker and double check it's work but assume it can do 70% of it, then it'll be a useful tool.

I would break it down into two: the ability to perform the tasks well, and the ability to grow as engineer.

The second is about making more complex projects without losing quality of the solution.If you can do both, it doesn't matter if you use LLMs or not.

The challenge is the enforcement of that governance.Without a Semantic Layer: Governance is a series of documents, meetings, and wiki pages. An analyst has to remember to `SUM(revenue) - SUM(refunds)` to get `net_revenue` and to filter out test user accounts. It's manual and prone to error.With a semantic layer (LookML in this case): You define these rules in code. You define `net_revenue` once. measure: net_revenue { type: sum sql: ${TABLE}.revenue - ${TABLE}.refunds ;; value_format_name: usd_0 description: ""Total revenue after refunds have been deducted."" } Now, the business user doesn't need to remember the formula.

Latter helps to keep the planning team accountable to the plant (same, but they don't care if the product got sold to Amazon or Walmart).

If we tell each supply chain planner to write their own queries for those metrics, there is no way in god's green earth that they implement it correctly across the portfolio.

I work in a telecomish company and our business model is a star schema with subjects for subscribers, service revenue, device revenue and some other things. The semantic model holds all the information for the dimension joins and deals with the conformity (users like to try to join fact tables for some reason) and allows for calculations across tables like service revenue per subscriber or total revenue from service and device sales. Those calculations are objects in the model that the user just drags into their visual, so it's easy and ensures consistency.Outside of my little example, they are good for maintaining consistency across consuming applications.

n9200po,"Well, best case scenario this is a ""make lemonade out of lemons"" scenario, where you take a bad environment with very few factors in your favor (in terms of growing your skills or actually making some impactful changes), and see what you can make of it. On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you...

Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop...

Replication is incremental with SFDC (for most tables) and it will tell you if it can't do that for a specific object.I don't remember about Airbyte (looked at it before). I don't think it is as easy to maintain as compared to Fivetran, but then Fivetran probably costs more.Re: API rate limits (for SFDC): we have never had an issue with this. However, our account is allocated a very large quota for this.You can setup a new Fivetran replication to Snowflake in 15min as long as you have setup the requisite security in SFDC and in Snowflake.in terms of SLA. Fivetran offers various plans. We use the 'standard' plan and it provides for a 15min sync time. Any lower than that you you need the 'enterprise' plan (I think).Fivetran will not directly help with building SCD Type 2. However, you can do a couple things here: 1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed. 2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).Fivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors). You can control it so that FT will add new columns but not new tables (unless you want that). It also handles cases where column datatypes change (although that can still break downstream etl). Fivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? \>>> I see no reason why Fivetran would not work for your needs but you need the budget.

It's constant learning, even as an experienced engineer, whenever I switched to a new stack, I needed between one and two years to be proficient at the local stack and the local software. Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.If you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user. Snowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty. As with any data processing tool, the key is to focus on their documentation about optimizing query performance (partitioning, clustering...).So, the learning is not going to be a problem, I think the hardest is going to be passing the selection in the current market.",sib_n,2025-08-19 03:37:57,5,dataengineering,t3_1mtws1v,False,

We all learn at different speeds and excel at different things. People who make great analysts could be awful engineers.Also depends on the expectation of your company.>For context I'm kind of in an odd spot where I've joined a new company working as an 'automation engineer' where the company is quite tech immature and old fashioned and has kinda placed me in a new role to help automate a lot of processes with an understanding that this could take a while to allow for discovery, building POCs, getting approval for things etc.In my opinion, this is a great start for a flexible career. Most companies need automation more than the latest tech and tools.>Has anyone gone through something similar?Self taught across 6-8 months, so a lot less experienced than yourself, and went straight into a DE role. Learning on the job was very fair in my first role because I filled a gap they needed - automation and modernisation. In an ironic way, I know I just say companies need automation more than the latest tools, however, this role was fun because my job was to learn the latest tools and see how they could be offered to clients internally and externally.After 18 months, I got my second job. Learning became a lot easier because I had already seen most things before. The same patterns crop up and it was a lot more battling very poor design decisions made by members of the team as well as external contractors although still doing the same thing.",MikeDoesEverything,2025-08-18 20:17:12,4,dataengineering,t3_1mtws1v,False,

Sometimes it's from scratch-ish if I'm setting up something that doesn't already exist. * Or is this task often handled by a dedicated DevOps, Cloud, or Security team, especially in larger companies?I don't know about larger companies, and even then I expect it would depend on the company. In the companies I've worked at (startups / medium) the data team had their own AWS sub-account where we could implement whatever tools/policies we wanted - the official devops folks were focused on production architecture. We definitely worked with them and did some security reviews tho. \> Should I dive deep into the IAM JSON policy syntax, or is it more important to have a strong conceptual understanding of what permissions are needed for a pipeline, and then learn to adapt existing policies?Don't bother learning the syntax unless that's going to be 90% of your workload. Copy paste is going to be your friend, and then you can adapt as needed. Keep in mind the principle of least privilege and you'll be fine - you always start from zero and only add access to what you need.

It’s also usually easier to order your data based on those sequential fields which makes query sample of data faster to select.If your data is not technically completed. (You are receiving transactions through the day but you want them aggregated even if the day is not yet completed) you usually are better creating a timestamps field and loading new data based on that field.

n93xqsy,I think you have it confused. This has nothing to do with uniqueness 2 records having the same timestamp doesn’t matter.When you’re doing incremental load you only care about pulling new values/transactions. In order to do that you just query anything greater than the last timestamp you queried from that table/system and pull everything new in bulk. It’s extremely simple to implement and does exactly what our goal is pull all new transactions.If you were to do it by transactional ID you’d have to check every ID for all of time in your source against the list of IDs in your target . Imagine if the source and the target are in 2 separate systems that would suck to implement. Also since the source is a transactional system with mutable tables the record may have changed so you’d have to compare the IDs AND the timestamps to ensure you don’t miss any updated records.,MonochromeDinosaur,2025-08-17 02:02:00,1,dataengineering,t3_1mqx9qs,False,

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.In terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.Good luck!(Edit: Formatting)",Tokyohenjin,2025-08-20 10:36:49,4,dataengineering,t3_1mv97xj,False,

You wouldn’t have them in the first place if they contributed nothing. I think the way to look at is do you fully support the revenue cycle or do you support everyone. IT desk support can have higher overall job security even being a cost center because a business cannot afford to fire all of them 3, it depends on how much of your time is spent on the chargeable service. Sometimes you can think of it this way. If the business fires your whole team would there be a way they could continue to survive without you be it outsourcing, praying, etc. that question may cause more questions because certain sales guys could be fired in that context.

Same thing with your salary, or an AWS bill, they need to go to a cost center.Finance people/executives understand that you literally can’t run a company without cost centers. Even if you were a one person remote consulting firm you’d have your salary cost. What they will do though is cut cost centers more aggressively than profit centers.So what the saying is trying to say is “be on the team who’s work directly causes cash to come into the business” which, unfortunately, data engineering teams almost never bring money directly into the business.It also doesn’t mean that positions in cost centers are inherently dangerous.

Profit = income - cost. You can break costs down to things like operating expenses and taxes if you feel fancy. If the business unit you work in brings in more money than it costs, you are a profit centre. There are no second order effects. When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. If your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it’s deemed essential. You’re absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. To reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it’s an unavoidable necessity. The trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics.

People here are confusing an accounting system concept for some sort of philosophical judgement.One transaction can hit both a profit center and a cost center at the same, too!! In fact, many do.Profit centers are used to categorize the products or services that a company sells. By using profit centers, when examining a business you could say one division is more profitable than another division, etc.You might try to say oh well Jeff is responsible for increasing profit through his role, but that’s an indirect thing. Jeff has to be paid a salary and the accounting line for that gets assigned to a cost center. Jeff probably isn’t a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it’s possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what’s being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he’s not the product. It’s not that he doesn’t matter, but on the books, he doesn’t get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. Transactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers.

n9dgdf3,"I am biased (been working with ClickHouse at Tinybird for 3+ years now), though I can share some thoughts on the operational side.To me it boils down to community and support. ClickHouse community is strong and growing. The number of contributors and commits to ClickHouse has grown so much over the last 5-10 years. Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors) Pinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors) If your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.Personally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.I don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.Since you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.What kind of log volumes are you looking at? And do you need real-time ingestion or is near real-time ok?Btw, maybe you'll find this template interesting or useful as a starting point -> [https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template](https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template) (if you're worried about operational overhead, maybe Tinybird could be a landing place for you... lmk if you have questions about it.",itty-bitty-birdy-tb,2025-08-18 16:30:07,3,dataengineering,t3_1mrlw9e,False,

The entire purpose behind RDBMS like Postgres is that it gives you these commands to operate on data locally with all the tooling to make it as efficient as possible because it understands the source and destination table structures.Merge statements would be very generic. You could make a pretty simple jinja template to use as a code generator, just putting the target table name and column names as params. Make that output a procedure definition, and as long as you stick to the pattern that's all you have to write manually. You should be able to automatically scrape all the parameters you need using information_schema -- the whole thing could be a single python script to automatically generate everything.You have your spark insert to a staging table (truncate first if you don't include a partition column), then run the procedure.If they don't want to deal with all of these objects too much, they can have a separate schema to put them in.Ultimately making spark do the work if figuring out what is an insert, update, or delete, is going to be very wasteful in shuffling data back-and-forth, and you're running two sets of compute when it could be one.",azirale,2025-08-20 05:32:32,1,dataengineering,t3_1mult5j,False,

There's no need to start splitting hairs over terminology. It just leads to wider confusion, and questions like ""what's the difference between X and Y"" where there is no meaningful difference, or the difference depends on the specific org etc. It also waters down your argument with doublespeak.There is no difference between coding and programming.

n95axmg,"I don't really agree with your take on AI, even as a companion tool. It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.People are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.People using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.We might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.At present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.Lastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",Fridux,2025-08-17 08:39:19,8,learnprogramming,t3_1msa43x,False,
n959802,"(I wrote my first program 28 years ago.)I think in society today, everyone should learn to read code, just like everyone should learn local and global geography, how to change a tire, what the scientific method is, how to read books, how to calculate, etc.I say this because digital literacy is too low for how dependent people are on technology. There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.For people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works. But I think it is important for people to realize that the landscape of software development is just as large as any of the other fields I mentioned. Merely understanding code compares to software development as changing a tire compares to being a mechanic, or how being able to calculate compares to being a mathematician. Or even between being able to read (and post on reddit) versus writing a series of fiction books. Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.For the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future. Now that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.But again, ""learning to code"" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people.

I routinely get a laugh out of the “I’m `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?” questions. Just go for it!On AI, I’ve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what’s new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they’re often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It’s nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. Programming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I’ve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.One of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That’s why diving in is the right approach. You’ll answer your “should I” question quickly, and you may love it.

Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.1. Next, implement the base case.1. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.1. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.The main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion. Otherwise, if you find yourself asking, ""Why couldn't I just do this with a loop"" then you're right: it's a poor candidate for recursion and you should just use the simpler loop solution.",AlSweigart,2025-08-19 20:47:46,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mulhd1,False,

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.Now consider doing it with recursion. You imagine the functional interface you want – let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar. Consider your base case – is the File a simple file, not a directory? Great, you're done. Produce your output. Otherwise you need to recurse – okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files. Boom, done. The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.The key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?* Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",SubstantialListen921,2025-08-19 15:45:56,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mulhd1,False,

Ya, what surprised me was just how desperate a company was back then, and well into the early 2010's for anyone with programming/admin/networking/tech-support capabilities. Essentially, if you showed any prowess in those 4 areas what-so-ever (and especially if you had cursory basic knowledge of all 4 of them) then wow! Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). ------------------------------The need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! Like ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! I kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)------------------------------Anyways... So, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. Ya, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! But the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) ------------------------------Finally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... But if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). And then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. So believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called ""Autohotkey"" to do scripting and automation! Like who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! ------------------------------But ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. Just as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. And because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. ------------------------------Fast forward to today, and ya... Times have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. I worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery...

The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.When not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!Also, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!When you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?You won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning!

Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.So, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough.

One thing that helps me is using something to keep track of that sort of thing - a folder, a bookmark app, anything where you can drop everything you come across that makes you go ""that's cool/useful/whatever"" but isn't directly related to what you're doing *now*. Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. As for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.For me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right ""piece"" is, and is more about a general understanding and ""feel"" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial ""I'll never need to do this again"" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at ""I just did more than I needed to"" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).I'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say ""I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use"" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.It never hurts to join a coding community, either.

Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman. ""Well structured"" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity. Projects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some ""real"" dev experience before getting your first job.Here are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template: * What do you do in your current position (if any)? * What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?* How familiar are you with ? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?* Walk me through your side project (if any). What was your role, how did the design go, what were any challenges you ran into? What would you have changed?* * Can you talk about a situation where someone disagreed with your recommendation, or vice versa, on an important aspect of a project?",TrumpeterSwann,2025-08-20 16:56:36,12,learnprogramming,t3_1mvh7dx,False,

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.To create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.For creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.Writing good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation.

For example, all these languages have for loops, but Python has list comprehensions, JavaScript has array methods that take in callback functions, Java has implementations of the List interface…Going further into back end dev, Ruby on Rails defines endpoints as methods on a Controller class, inheriting from the framework’s built-in ActiveController. Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.When you move to a language you don’t know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you’re gonna have a bad time.

Using old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.When you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.With each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you.

Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.Think about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.It's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).To get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.Or languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.Prolog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.And was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.Functional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.It helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-19 09:21:44,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mucv2f,False,

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. - Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are.

For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:```class Card: def __init__(self, cardString): self.name = self._getName(cardString[0]) self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0]) self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1]) def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter] elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 'Ace' else: return cardFirstCharacter def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return 10 elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 11 else: return int(cardFirstCharacter) def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter): suits = [""Hearts"", ""Diamonds"", ""Clubs"", ""Spades""] return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)```Then `hit()` becomes easy:```def hit(): drawnCard = drawCard() v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard) card = Card(drawnCard) return card.name, card.value```**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it.

I'll answer them separately:>is it necessary to read ~~all of~~ the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?I'd lean on the side of yes. Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.That being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?No. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation. My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the ""reference manuals"" first, but even that is difficult.I feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.E.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.I find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work.

n9oup1b,"So first a question... If you want to change the rims and tires of your car, do you need to know about the piston compression first? Nope.While you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.Ive been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.What i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. Heres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. I want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? Assuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? This breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. I have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec.

n9p77uj,"> However, I am learning Python for specific reasons: Text processing, XML handling, etc. >> […] is it necessary to read all of the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?This sounds like something of an [X-Y problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.Python as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).In programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.Generally what you want is:1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. ""Good enough"" is poorly defined, and varies by language: * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road. * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code? * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use. * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0. * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs. * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything. Your brain can only fit so much information. * Language servers / IDEs can help a lot with discoverability.",syklemil,2025-08-20 12:19:47,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mvau8z,False,

n8wcphv,"There's no one answer here, but if I have to condense it to a single sentence, it would be this: It should be mapped in the layer where it is the most convenient.A DTO isn't inherently an API thing. It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.However, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).The issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.My point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. My general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying.

n8wrimc,"I think I have to make it more clear what I meant.It makes sense, since the database resides in a database layer. To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.Then we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.Somehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. I read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:If we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view. For example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.But sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.Do you know what I mean?",NearbyOriginals,2025-08-15 22:04:20,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wcaxr,True,

n8wwyoy,"Yes, that is what I told you.Entity (DAOs) are used to map your entire entity to a database table. You do not want to return this from a service. You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary). While controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.In spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:example() { var stuff = repo.getStuff(); ...business logic... return stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;)This is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.When you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.All these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",disposepriority,2025-08-15 22:35:18,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wrimc,False,

You add a hash\_version field to your user class, so you know which hashing algorithm to use to verify their passwords. This new column in your database has no business being in absolutely any of your controllers, but obviously you want to retrieve the value when getting a user since the service needs to know what to do). This applies to any entity derivatives like projections or manual mappings with native query.Service calls one or more repositories requesting data from the database that it needs, this can be returned as an entity class, projection, manually created class mapped by a jdbc handler, it doesn't matter - this is the class that will store the data you request from the database.

n9ammia,"Cool project! Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm is definitely widely used.It's generally not meaningful to compare things like ""number of iterations"" or ""number of function calls"" between two different algorithms, or two different implementations of the same algorithm (unless they're very similar to each other).If actual practical performance is what matters, then comparing the actual running time is what matters, so that you can fairly compare the effects of things like synchronization overhead.Probably, the most useful comparison would be to draw graphs of the *average* running time for graphs of different sizes, and also with different numbers of threads (or CPU core counts) so that you can see where the break-even point is, i.e. where the benefits of parallelism outweigh the extra overhead. Varying the sparsity of the graphs would also be interesting.If you're interested in the theoretical big-O complexity, then numerical measurements don't really matter at all, and instead you'd need to formally analyze and rigorously prove some kind of upper-bound on the amount of work done by each thread. This is likely to be a lot more difficult than just taking measurements.----An additional note: as you said, the basic form of Dijkstra's algorithm gives the ""single-source shortest paths"" from a source to *all* other nodes. But in practice, we are often only interested in the path from one source to one destination. A simple and obvious optimization is to just stop the algorithm as soon as the destination node is expanded (because at that point its path is guaranteed to be optimal). A less obvious optimization is to do a *bidirectional* search, which works both forwards from the source and backwards from the destination simultaneously, terminating when they meet. This often results in expanding dramatically fewer nodes. (If you imagine the ""frontier"" as being circular, then then two circles with radius d/2 have half the area compared to one circle with radius d.)You might want to see if your parallel algorithm can be adapted to handle one or both of these optimizations.

Some functions take no argument. Some have required arguments, and some allow for optional arguments. When I create GetBirthday, I have to include what these argument parameters are going to be.function GetBirthday(person)Then when I want to use it, I call the function.let bday = GetBirthday(john)So what's important to understand is that a function is a named block of code.

n8ymttv,"The brackets allow you to pass data into a function. In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.it’s generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.Simple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.Here’s a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.Edit: Reddit messing up formatting here.def increment(x): return x + 1count = 0count = increment(count) # updates originalnew_count = increment(count) # keeps originalCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.As you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who’s allowed to change it, and how long it will exist. If you are making simple python scripts right now it might seem tempting to do things quick and dirty, after all that is what python is good for, but developing good habits in the beginning pay dividends once you have to start working on more complex systems.",jonermon,2025-08-16 05:25:18,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mqn62e,False,

Its not going to matter much where you start as whatever you do will teach you concepts as you go.A lot of tutorials aimed at teaching you a language will be a bit boring and have a long time before you get much out of them.I think the first real bit of code I wrote was a batch script. It lived on a usb stick and when run it copied files from some folders onto the usb.My grandfather wanted a way to put a usb into his PC, double click something and have his emails be backed up for work.I added a progress bar.I added a dialog that showed the number of files in the source and destination so he knew it all copied.Then I learned how to hash the two locations and added something that told him if the copy went well or not.Then I added a log file that kept track of when he backed stuff up.It was an inefficient mess so I cleaned it up with functions.Then I used variables for the paths so it was easy to change the folders that were backed up.Over time it went from really simple to something more thoughtful and useful. The process taught me a lot of concepts that I could apply to later stuff.Give yourself a really simple goal and hammer away at it with example code etc and keep refining it till things start to make sense.My kid used to like making text based menus for stuff. It ended up being a totally unnecessary but fun project that was used to launch programs. Stuff like.Press 1. Firefox2. VLC3. Music folderThen sub menus were added, then they discovered opening programs with launch conditions or switches and they added a menu for me to ssh into a few machines on my network.Outside of programming what are your main interests or what do you need to or enjoy doing on the PC? Try tailor something to that.A friend runs DND games so I wrote an interface that played different audio files at the same time with volumes for each track so he could do town sounds or campfire and rain sounds or battle sounds to add atmosphere to the game.A lot of what sounds difficult or complicated starts with a proof of concept, how to I do one specific thing.

n9t2d7b,"Well there is no right way of learning coding. Just like in every field there are multiple different subfields that look similar from the outside but differ much.The best way of learning (for me at least) is doing something I'm interested in. A little passion project. First smaller ones, later bigger ones.A broad glance of subfields:Web Development: Mostly by this you will only mean a front end, so a Website with only logic on you Computer, no server involved. Using GitHub pages you can host this for free, so it's a great thing to start with. If you want to learn more about this, look at the odin project. (The first half is frontend only, the second one is Backend). Or code along some of Brackeys videos, those were some cool projects for me. As you do this, you will start to understand more and more.Backend Development: Mostly APIs. Send a request to a server, get a response. You can get very creative with this, as there are really no limits. For this you will need a server, so this will cost something. (Or everything is only locally on your machine, whing is possible not not satisfying (or at least I thought that always).Mobile development: Apps for Android (or iOS). This will be hard to get into if you don't know Java (or Swift). It's also free (to make, publishing in the app store will cost a little bit), so you got a plus point there.Game development: Self explanatory. You will need a good PC for this. Like an entry level gaming PC at least. And it's not beginner friendly. (Easy to get something, very hard to get something half decent). This is very cool but if you run out of Ideas ist very hard very quick. Also there is a very steep learning curve. Here I would recommend Unity.Robots / embedded devices: You want to code on some hardware. The easiest is to buy an Arduino, the cheapest to buy an ESP 32. I would roll with the ESP32, as you can do some really cool stuff with that and you can still use the Arduino IDE for ease of use.Desktop Apps: Apps for Windows / MacOS. Intestingy this is a field I didn't discover much, as I didn't have an Idea on what to make. You can use nearly any Programming language in the start and if you don't care about the design. Can't give much advice on this. Data Science: Working with data, and getting data. WebScraping and analyzing data with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Take a Website, download it, so stuff with it, repeat with the next page. For me this is kinda fun, as every website has a different challenge. You can try to download the entire product catalog or job offerings of some company automatically for example. (Be aware companies won't be happy if you start blasting with requests, and might block you. Then you have to wait a bit or switch to the next page). This is free but a grey area in law. Most of the time it's ok you don't cause damage. Put a 200ms delay before every request.Little scripts / automations. For example something in Python / PowerShell / Bash / Whatever. This is what I do productively by now. Writing litter helper solution to problems only I have. Like a script to delete all files in a directory (as windows is slow with many tiny files), to use ffmpeg more efficiently on folders, copy stuff from multiple Excel sheets to one.Ethical Hacking: Just don't. You need a massive foundation of knowledge for this one. The learning curve is vertical. You will gain knowledge for this on your path, no matter what you want to do. Don't start with it.You don't know where to start? Make something visual. Something where you can see the progress right as you do it, just to understand the fundamental concepts. If you are a bloody beginner, scratch will be nice. If know a little bit, try Python turtle too. Look at YouTube beginner tutorials and try to code along something you find interesting. General stuff:Make a GitHub Account. Use GitHub. Can't say this enough, version control is important. Everyone is using it, start as soon as you feel comfortable. It will make you like easier. Use a Git GUI, I like GitKraken (free for students) or sourcetree. Apply for GitHub student. This will get you loads of free stuff (without having to prove you are a student for every company, as many trust GitHub). Use a good IDE. With student benefits (use GitHub) you get the entire enterprise product line of JetBrains IDEs. This will help you imensely, as this will cut out the environment setup I spent ages on (and quit before starting. Don't make the same mistakes, do it right). An exception is Embedded, when coding on Arduino or ESP 32 I wound recommend the Arduino IDE for ease of use with the boards.Extra bonus:I'm really mad I didn't do this when starting. Keep you first projects. Don't delete, they dont take up space (except video games). Use GitHub to store and forget. I regret not doing this. The lengths I would go to see my first ever projects....Edit: Thank you for reading my essay",Domwaffel,2025-08-21 00:07:44,4,learnprogramming,t3_1mvudbt,False,

Node.js with Express is way easier to pick up when you already know JavaScript, and you can focus on learning backend concepts without learning a whole new language at the same time.At Metana we actually see this transition a lot. Frontend devs wanting to go full stack. Most find it easier to stick with JavaScript ecosystem first (Node/Express) then maybe explore Java later if needed. But if your project specifically needs Spring Boot or you're targeting Java jobs, then go for it.Either way, the key is building that project while you learn. Don't just do tutorials tho.

This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. * admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand. This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.* Use words like ""We"", ""Us"", & ""As a team"", instead of ""you created this bug on this PR"", ""we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR"", ""what if we need to add X functionality?""* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. * when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say ""this isn't good because X, Y, Z"", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. ""Will this work under this use case?"", ""what if the user does X?"", etc. * ask your manager how other folks are doing, ""how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious"".

n8r5css,"Nah, the theory is wrong, on two fronts. First, AI is just the excuse companies give so you'll blame someone other than them. The reality is companies are trying to squeeze devs harder and invest less in training (especially less junior hires and interns). They're squeezing harder because interest rates are higher and changes in tax policy meant they can't deduct R&D expenses from their income. Profitability is king right now. Second, juniors definitely are getting shafted hard right now (not 2008 level bad, but still rough). But mid/senior roles also getting shafted too, and our jobs are anything BUT safe. We got the benefit of a *little* bit of lube first, but it's still not enough to stop things from being painful. To explain: a ton of mid & senior+ devs got laid off over the last few years. I was one of them. Less than 6 months after hopping to a different Principal job they gutted my new department. Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience. But the job prospects are still not great, even for proven seniors. Companies know this and are using it to squeeze us hard to get more work for the same pay, and they're not afraid to fire people if they can't keep up.In a few years the pendulum will probably swing back for tech. AI isn't the silver bullet clueless executives claim. If the code I'm seeing daily is any indicator, ultimately AI code generation will ALSO generate a lot of maintenance (and scalability and quality) nightmares.

The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:# :brain: Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, “essay-like” format. People don’t usually talk like that on Reddit — especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details — which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You’ll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts — things like “After X years in the industry, I realized Y” or “Am I the only one who feels Z?” It starts to feel formulaic.4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.# :robot: Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.* Unnatural use of :pile_of_poo: emojis.* Overuse of the em dash (—).# :puzzle_piece: You're Not ""Schizo"" — You're PerceptiveIt’s unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust — not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit’s value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that’s being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.If you're feeling disoriented by all this, it’s not paranoia — it’s pattern recognition.

Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)Outside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)My facebook, which back then was young cool social media, could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.This is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)Now for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the ""ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$"". People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.Futhermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get. Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.I think one thing to realize when talking about job markets is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012 are all 33 to 40. This means you have an entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus. That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)Like this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021 over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.There is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",Snoo-18544,2025-08-15 02:53:40,164,cscareerquestions,t3_1mqkqve,False,

There was a lot happening still in 'the underground' side of things, as well as tech startups.But, there were hiring freezes. There was lack of funding for startups, widespread layoffs. The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.But, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.Then, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now. AI tech, social media showing what little promise, lack of privacy. A lot of it has been learning new things that re-invent the wheel over and over again.And discussing the current market allows for teams to discuss strategy.

I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.What I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.Ultimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed. They could build something, or they could make their own luck.

But if they think that - were they to fire you - you might hit them with a lawsuit for wrongful termination and hostile work environment stuff?

I recently had a technical interview where i was asked to share my screen because you know everyone cheats and I ended up wasting 25 mins trying to share my screen only to find out the interviewer hadn't given me permissions to share. I assumed they were testing my nerves not with any malicious intent :/. I got the correct answer but they still ended up rejecting me so as a candidate you cannot do much about such things.

I don't have a clearance, so I can't speak to the cleared side, but in public trust realm, I have not loved government contracting. There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.One benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.As for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.Driving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. The cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.On the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. TL;DR; NoVa is fine.

I typically try to find roles where I am really interested in what I am working on, then I am naturally going to want to work on it, it’s not like doing a chore. The one big difference I would say is the people I worked with at the startup were way more fun to work with. We all became good friends and still keep in touch. The culture at the big tech company I’m at now is not like that at all, it’s more like the coworkers are competition and everyone is trying to outwork the next guy. That is really the worst aspect of it, the culture is more like a death march than a bunch of friends working on fun stuff together. I feel like it’s all due to the “pip” culture, and I don’t really get why they do it. One final thing I’ll add is even though I work a lot, I still feel like I get plenty of free time.

For example: Firing somebody is a pretty tough thing to do if you think a lot about it (will this person ever get a job again? will their wife leave them? what about their kids? etc.).

This would include guarantees about things like how much they’ll work over that 4 year period.You’ll need to make sure that the shareholder agreement outlines what happens if a shareholder becomes a liability.Ideally they offer you a reverse vesting deal as a founder. All your shares vest immediately at the price today and if you leave or lose your shares for some reason the shares that would not be vested at that point are forcibly sold back to the company. Sometimes the company buys them back at a predetermined value (often FMV at the time of issuance) but other times that’s not possible for a number of reasons and you may get a different price if this occurs.Essentially you want guarantees for yourself and from the other shareholders with a significant stake.If their company is only worth $1m today then a 2% stake is only $20k. Thats about $5k/yr or around $5/hr at 20 hours a week. That’s not really worth it as it’s impossible to know what the future may hold.

If you’re not getting job experience (which feels like one of the only things on your resume that actually matters), I don’t think it’s a bad idea at all to start training for a potentially different field.Unfortunately though I’m not sure how much safer EE really is. EE has been plagued by excessive outsourcing the same as CS has for years. The nature of the work makes it easy to just outsource a specific project, get a working design and never talk to the designer again. Additionally I’m not convinced it’s immune to LLMs taking over, although it won’t happen as quickly as CS since it’s not just pure text that needs to be spit out. That said if you’re financially able to potentially work contract jobs or spend some time developing skills, it’s not that bad of an idea. I don’t want to discourage you cause I understand how you feel exactly, but there’s something to be said about working in a field you’re passionate about.
