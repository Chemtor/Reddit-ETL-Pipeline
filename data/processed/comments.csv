Now flip side. We have some spark jobs that need to be spark jobs. They deal with massive amounts of data, plenty of complex logic and you just aren’t going to get it all to fit in a single node. These are not being migrated away from spark, but are being tuned a bit as we move them to ingest from redshift instead of hive. And I’m going to say that length of runtime when reading from hive to generate an extract is not directly related to decision to keep in spark or migrate out. Some of our jobs run for a very long time in spark due to the hive partition not being ideal. These will run very quickly in redshift because our distkey is much better for the type of pulls we need.

mx65fev,"It's a good write up, I agree with most of his points, especially about how 95% of companies don't need 'Big Data' solutions for their Little Data problems. But there are a few points I don't entirely agree with.I also work for a company that is relatively reasonable in its tech stack. We only have a few TB of data for more than 10 years of operations and most of it runs on an on-prem setup using mostly open source tools. No cloud bloat or any of that.> There’s a tool for ingestion. A tool for orchestration. A tool for transformation, reverse ETL, governance, monitoring and if you’re lucky, a tool for remembering why you started this project in the first place.I'm a big ELT proponent. Part of the ELT philosophy is that each part of your pipeline performs as few tasks as logically necessary.My ingest/outgest scripts run in python and they *only* do ingest/outgest. They don't perform a single transformation unless they absolutely have to.I run my transformations with dbt.I schedule my jobs with Airflow. I don't really see how I would orchestrate my pipeline unless with an orchestrator (CRON would also do fine). Or does the author imply we should have an alarms set somewhere so we can manually run these singular scripts he seems to such a big fan of?> But here’s the secret the consultants won’t tell you:> Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs. Faster answers. A fighting chance that someone on your team actually understands what the hell is going on.One script. One machine. One person who can debug it without a PhD in vendor certifications.I have seen these 'One script. One machine. One person.' solutions he's talking about. I've made a bit of a career out of refactoring them. Often that 'One person' fucked off some place else and now no one understands this one script that is taking 40 minutes to run every 30 minutes.These one scripts typically had hundreds of moving parts that seemed to perform tasks with varying degrees of usefulness and efficiency. Except it's almost impossible to figure out what part does what since it's all thrown together.If you One Script performs ingest/outgest and transform at the same time, good luck debugging your hot mess. If something goes wrong you've now got hundreds of lines of code to comb through to find the offending part.When something goes wrong in my stack, debugging is easy as hell.Does the problem happen between the source and my RAW schema? Well, just look in the ingestion scripts. Is it between RAW and the final data set? Check the dbt queries. Is it between the final data set and the consumer? Check the outgest scripts.When each moving part performs a single, clearly defined task, debugging is a lot easier.Yes, it is true in engineering that fewer moving parts typically means a less complex system, trying to cram as many functionalities in as few moving parts as possible is also not the best idea in general.Imagine building a house and having your water and your electricity lines all using the same pipes in the wall/floor.

At least in my experience, the key thing to remember is that you get charged for the time the warehouse is turned on with a minimum unit of one minute. That is, assuming that you set your warehouse to auto suspend after 60 seconds. If you didn't do that, I would definitely suggest starting right there.To that end, the more you can get queries to execute in batches together the better. If you've got something waking your warehouse up to run a two second query every minute, it's just going to keep the thing on all the time.",toabear,2025-06-12 14:26:28,80,dataengineering,t3_1l9njzn,False,

That'll make a significant cost decrease. * Dont stack tables on top of each other in layers if you dont really need to. e.g if your table is almost 1:1 from your staging to your gold layer make bronze and silver views then gold a table -- Conversely if some of your long running queries have a lot of joins on heavy views then make those incremental tables * Last one - heavy filters on CTEs where possible",CingKan,2025-06-12 15:01:15,44,dataengineering,t3_1l9njzn,False,

I really want to emphasize that before my next comments, as you did ask for a roast =). Also really appreciate you showing your limitations and where you asked for help in this. Now for the actual roast part...While I have no issue with the whole ETL as a tech process and completely agree with it, I wonder if going for a full analytics/column-based solution as your destination was the right call here. From what I understood, you want the users of your product to be able to look up the weather for their next climb. Meaning your back will probably have to serve data a couple of rows at a time, at most. Look up a crag, get the weather, yeah no it's bad, look up next crag, and so on. But no aggregation on the average yearly temperature at 6pm every day on all the crags in Cumbria. The first example is a row based workload, or transactional; the second is columnar, analytical. Parquet and duckdb are really good at the latter, no so much at the former.I understand you tried using PostgreSQL then failed and went to duckdb in order to make some progress, that's good. Going forward I really think you should give PostgreSQL another try, it's way better suited to what you want to do. Also it has a great extension (postgis) to deal with geodata, which you will need to. For the same reason I think you would benefit from reconsidering your data model, as I think a fact/dim approach is going to be deserving you. Your model feels like you had to forcefully bend it in order to fit in. Sure, it works, but there's a lot of tension between your data and the model. Don't know how to express it otherwise.Hope it helps, don't hesitate if you have questions, I'd be happy to provide further guidance if needed.",Thlvg,2025-06-15 09:10:03,1,dataengineering,t3_1lbi0re,False,

mxs4wj4,"While the general recommendation is to use taskflow api, and for a reason (readability, less bloat), I highly recommend that you get a hang of what operators and tasks are in Airflow. They are the backbone of Airflow and, in fact, they are being used underneath the taskflow API. It's important to understand that there's no direct value passing between task-decorated functions in Airflow (xcom is used for that). Note that I'm talking from my experience with Airflow 1.x and 2.x, and the newest 3.0 release may invalidate some of my knowledge :)Always treat Airflow tasks as separate processes running on separate virtual machines, even if they aren't. It'll save you time when you decide to scale Airflow workers. E.g. use shared object storage or database to exchange the data between tasks. Make tasks granular enough for ease of retry and debugging.Use idempotency for complex data pipelines to its fullest.

mxsubfl,"Here is a list of common causes of failures I encountered:1. Use airflow for orchestrating not for data processing, while that is not a hard and fast rule, I see a lot of failures when workers run out of memory because their pandas ingested too much data. Worst part of that is, you loose all your logs, so it’s hard to work out what went wrong. What to do? Track the size of data you are processing and compare them to the memory you have. If you see a trend that tells you you are headed for OOM situations, export the data processing function into a serverless option, be it a k8s pod or any other option.2. When you download files to a worker, make sure you clean it up reliably, to avoid running out of disk space eventually. Use the tempfiles module appropriately.3. Avoid large xcoms. It stresses the meta data db and impacts overall processing. If you have large data to pass between tasks, consider using external storage.4. Avoid dags that run more frequently than once every 10 minutes. The round robin nature of the scheduler means for a non trivial setup can exceed several minutes and you may not be able to keep up. 5. Avoid dags that watch for file changes and do that every few minutes (as above). See if you can have an external file watcher trigger the day instead. Alternatively space it so it checks every 30 minutes.6. Review the day code for expensive functions at module level. The dag gets executed every few minutes and everything at module level gets run every few minutes. So variable.get uses your database, why stress it with hundreds and thousands of such calls. Move these into your python functions.7. Use logging but use it judiciously, your logs can end up in your metadata base, or at least in your file system. 8. Monitor and manage the size of your metadata base. If it’s too big you can’t run snapshots/backups.",smeyn,2025-06-14 20:44:50,11,dataengineering,t3_1lbenix,False,

my3ak25,"My advice is maybe they're right. IMO that's not a basic tech stack, a cron pulling some data directly into powerbi is basic, that's a tech stack powered by three separate vendors that can get very expensive.The first question is: are you part of the product the company is making or is it a cost center? I assume you've priced out what it would cost and what you expect it to cost in a year, in addition to how long you think it would take to move to that stack? So that's the first place you can sell it, that it will return you more money as part of a better/more robust product feature or that it will be cheaper overall than paying devs to maintain these scripts.The second question is: what does it give you that you don't already have? A very reasonable question you might receive is 'yes it's a hack but it's working for us, is rewriting it the most important thing to be pursuing at this time?' Like if all the data is there and I just want to see a report about how many frobnozzles we foobricked and or how much uptake my great new feature is getting and you're like 'first we should rewrite the entire tech stack' you need to be able to articulate the value of it beyond 'these JS scripts offend my aesthetic sensibilities'The third question I would ask is what are the long-term expectations of you in this role because IMO startups don't actually need DEs, but since titles in this industry are relatively meaningless, it's possible that what they really want right now is a 'data analyst' (often code for 'pbi monkey'), so the third question to me are everyones expectations aligned here?

DBT is nice, but it’s mostly sql and some python so if your fundamentals are solid you will pick it up on the job fast.",stupid_lifehacks,2025-06-16 06:30:07,54,dataengineering,t3_1lck2tc,False,

I would say Python is a quick and easy language that is the most broadly used in data. So learn it. Orchestrate: airflow has been around a long time and is very good. Some people tend to say it’s way harder to get setup than the “new” stuff. Usually they used an old version were a lot of things needed to be managed for the system to run correctly. Then you have “new” orchestrator in the market which try to make it easy like Dagster, prefect, mage.Clean and transformation : you have the python frameworks (pandas, polars), you have your sql engine (DBT, trino, presto), you have spark, you have your DuckDB.Most compagnie would be fine with an up to date version of Postgres. But they usually run old 2010 version of sqlserver that run REAL slow, so they think they have a lot of data and switch to an OLAP system when they migrate. If you heard something like I have a LOT of data to transform. 1 million rows, 10 million rows, 100 millions rows you can assume that the company DOESN’T have a lot of data at all. And that any db would work. If it’s 100 millions rows every hour that’s another thing but usually people talk about their global table size unless they have really a lot of data and usually when they do they already know the solution because they already hit issues so many times with their systems.For OLAP (managed) you have snowflake, Databricks BigQuery, Redshift.OLAP (OSS) Pinot, clickhouseThere’s a lot more but that cover most scenarios or “new” companyAccess : you have a bunch of tools here but like tableau, power bi, sigma if you are 100% snowflake, metabase for small company, superset for bigger. And a bunch more.So no real definitive stack but you have those.If I was to start fresh in a new company that has received funding and that I know there’s going to be A LOT of data (multiple terabytes at least) I would probably do Dagster, DBT, snowflake, sigma, python ingestion in Dagster.Why? Because if they have investors and the company is pretty small they want to delivers new things fast even if it cost them more. If the couple of new things works or fail fast then it’s good for the business, they’ll hire more and continue growing the business. And the stack is pretty much all managed so you pay for maintenance and upgrades and everything you don’t have to do those things, and you can focus on business requirement.If it was a small company that expect a lot of data with no funding, I’ll go the datalake approach. Because snowflake will be expensive no matter what.If you don’t have a lot of data Postgres Dagster python, DBT might be a good fit.There no real stack but those are nice.Personally I would always go with a sql framework for transformation at start not because it’s better just because sql is easy enough that mostly anyone can understand and build some stuff while python transformation can get confusing when you chain a bunch of stuff together and it require programming knowledge which not everyone has.Good luck",Commercial_Dig2401,2025-06-16 11:40:53,17,dataengineering,t3_1lck2tc,False,

You can always make better ETL process, or program, but if your goal is to get something out then you have to stop optimizing at some point and publish or finalize something.",DeliriousHippie,2025-06-15 19:49:09,3,dataengineering,t3_1lc2270,False,

This is also work-intensive, this approach, but DE-person agnostic. Have each DE that does a change, in JIRA, write some conditions for success. Have a person dedicated for the DevOps / UAT testing phase.A great place I worked at, every sprint rotation cycle, a different person was assigned the DevOps/UAT, so that we all gained the experience. Over time the code base improved.I've seen many companies not even have a DEV environment, only one, that is prod. Ideal is 3 environments, Dev, UAT, Prod.

If you want a portfolio project for data engineering jobs, spin up a tiny Kubernetes or Ray cluster on something like AWS Spot nodes. Even a three-node run shows you can handle cloud orchestration.Streaming ingestion can be worth it if your target is “near real time” dashboards for devs watching new reviews flow in. Stick Kafka or Redpanda in front, keep micro-batches small, and output rolling aggregates to a cache.

mxfdwjf,"Been doing data engineering for 15 or so years now (even before it was called data engineering) and for about 8 of those years Ive worked for different health plans. If there's a constant... It's that healthcare data is an entirely different ball of wax than you're used to working with everywhere else. Not only are the structures weird and deeply nested but the context of the data can be hard to grasp for some. Also, security is a big factor you have to understand. For example no offshore employee can even get a sniff of production Medicaid or Medicare data or you're violating the law. That's a federal law. Some onshore people can't ever look at federal employee plan data for certain situations. Not only that but the amount of vendors and integrations that have all these mind numbing weird schema layouts that don't at all conform to a standard like FHIR makes everyone's life hell in this space.Understanding the complexity of healthcare plan info like the relationship of a member to the group to the plan(s) to the product(s) can get a little out of hand. Then you have a claims where you need a 45 day runout because a single healthcare claim line can change a ton of times before it's actually approved or rejected but you have to capture everyone of those steps along the way. Then you always have to be prepared and ready for an audit by either someone internally in your org or someone from the government so your documentation and processes need to be on point.The reason why we need people with experience in healthcare data is because it's very hard to ramp up people with 0 experience. When I bring on juniors to my team I don't expect them to ""get the data"" for like 24 to 36 months and even then you are always learning new parts or domains of healthcare data and probably still don't understand all the nuances around the data.

mxv5u0p,"At least 2 layers, 4 for most cases.First is for the landing, as dbt needs to have the data loaded inside a database to work on it (it's not an extraction tool). Second is to join adjacent tables. If you have like 3 tables about the same thing and it make sense to just have 1 table you join them. The second layer is where you test your data extensively. At this point there was no business rules applied or anything. Just renaming, retyping, null value handling at most. Your tests will return errors present in the system you extract. Third layer is where you add your business rules. I like to make one model for each business rule as dbt with duckdb takes like 1-2 seconds for 200k rows. Having multiple transformations together is exhausting to debug, and not really more efficient. Forth layer is where I make my Kimball modeling. One fact for each thing I look at. Dimensions all around. Junk dimensions are build using a SELECT DISTINCT to only have values that happens. Just remember to generate surrogate keys with dbt so you can joins dimensions and facts using a single column. And never join facts together, it's not how a star model work. Having multiple facts inside a single powerbi dashboard works well if you keep it classy. Also remember for each dimensions to have a default value for missing keys.

When you come to a case where the simplicity itself is a blocker then address that with some abstraction. But don’t go learning all these “patterns” to modularize what should be a few scripts.

No more 3am pipeline debugging sessions.Three years ago our data team was drowning. Beautiful medallion architecture (bronze → silver → gold) that looked great in slides but was a nightmare to maintain. Every layer had schema changes, quality issues, debugging headaches. We spent more time figuring out which layer broke than building features.Breaking point: a simple schema change cascaded through 7 tables and killed reporting for two days. That's when we rebuilt everything around FITT principles.The four FITT principles:1. Functional - Pure functions only. Same input = same output, always. Made everything immutable by default. Storage is cheap, debugging corrupt state at 2am isn't.2. Idempotent - Run it 1000 times, same result. Recovery = just re-run it. Junior devs actually experiment now instead of being terrified.3. Tested - Tests as architectural components. Every pipeline has data quality, business logic, and integration tests. They're living documentation.4. Two-stage - Raw → Final, that's it. Raw data stays immutable forever. Final data ready for consumption. Everything in between is ephemeral.We ditched bronze/silver/gold entirely. Those layers were just arbitrary complexity.Key implementation patterns:Dev/Prod split: Dev uses yesterday's data + today's code. Prod uses today's data + yesterday's code.

A lot of people who work in IT are obsessed with there only one way to do one thing e.g. the idea of something being production grade.Reality is it entirely depends on a lot of factors.

mx8dqb3,"Here's some general suggestions:1: Care more about what your file/module look like than about whether you use classes in the right way or follow code patterns. Avoid large interconnected codebases, have clear interfaces and responsibility splits with other teams. Your main measure of maintainability should be whether you can easily transfer ownership of your code to another team with little context.2: Simple imperative code in pipelines is perfect for most usecases. Be explicit and avoid magic. [Push for loops down and ifs up](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html) to make it at least possible to optimize code later and be very careful about functions that can't operate on batches. If you use streaming iterators, use your languages equivalent of chunked and call batch functions on chunks, don't call single element functions in an iterator.3: Understand the difference between struct of arrays and array of struct (aka row based vs column based), be aware of which of the two applies to the data formats you use and process things in their natural order. This combines nicely with chunking.4: If you use python, use ruff and uv, declare dependencies clearly in pyproject.toml, and use type hints on anything public. Prefer simple functions over classes, take protocol classes as input and spit out concrete data structures as output. Use asserts often, especially if something might need a comment.5: Make your data partitionable if possible. If you use a database, there should be a clear way to split it into (for example) ten smaller DBs with the same layout, and only need to copy small tables. Try to identify or create natural keys that are shared over the entire data pipeline that can be used to neatly split data without overlap.

The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Ingestion system is down when scheduled to run, crashes, etc - cannot run, this period never runs or only runs after someone wakes up and starts it. The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Infrequently-run scheduled processes often have enormous data volumes and run very slowly.

mx42w9t,"I've had experience with multiple clients with similar use cases -- specifically dealing with many single tenant use cases (same schemas) and aggregating into a warehouse for analytics.A few questions you have to ask yourself: **What are you optimizing for downstream?** \-If your use case is dashboarding and analytical queries across large datasets, Redshift will scale better than Postgres. It’s columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.**Is it important for data to get into the ""warehouse"" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. **As for your questions:** 1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. 2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. 3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You’ll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. 5.

my5ilkk,"I would understand if you’re hesitant given the current political climate, but have you considered looking into the national lab complex (DOE) ? Some labs have pretty narrow research focuses, but most do work on more fields than you’d initially think, and likely have groups/divisions dedicated to what you’re interested in. This is especially true for teams in the computational science sector, and having practical experience in data engineering and knowledge of the subject matter you’re into is very valuable. On the upside: Pay tends to be a little better than other non-profits, though certainly less than industry. Also, while national labs are partially funded through and ultimately report back to DOE, most are actually run by contractors (Battelle being one of the big ones). This means that we’re usually treated similarly to government employees by everyone but the actual government, so we don’t (always) have to deal with the same BS federal employees are going through right now. This can also make it more straightforward to get access to certain data that wouldn’t otherwise be available. On the downside: Most funds that come into the labs still come from other government offices like NIH, DOT, DOE, etc. So there is still susceptibility to political trade winds, especially for environmental stuff. Fortunately most research staff are pretty savvy at making subtle/small changes to existing projects to fly under the radar and appease their sponsors, as it were. Also, in my experience (YMMV) labs tend to be insular, so it can be hard to get in, but it’s easier to move around (even between labs) once you’re in and making connections.

Are you trying to scan all 11 TB to find certain information? Can you partition the data based on additional knowledge to reduce the amount of data you need to scan? If you do need to scan all 11TB, can you add additional indexes to your data table to help processing.

There already also projection indexes that you could add to help with the processing. You could extract specific keys from the JSON string you are trying to scan and index off that.

If those don’t work and you are running into issues, it may be time to consider a different processing engine. Spark is excellent at processing large data with distributed processing.

We cannot keep up proper optimization of every single one of these platforms tables by setting the correct split and dist key it's just unrealistic (yes they have an automated version now last I heard it was in private preview but I don't expect it to be good)Databricks automatically handles via liquid clustering and automated vacuuming.Because of this your price per compute usage is so much lower on Databricks (probably other platforms as well). The queries run much quicker on the same priced clusters. - Severless yes redshift has Redshift serverless and it's fucking dog shit and you're paying a lot. Because it's so bad you're effectively still tied to paying for compute + data, which scaled horrendously for us.Other platforms allow spinning up and down compute much simpler than Redshift does imo -> more savings.- Because of the simplified compute system you can separate jobs much more easily so resources aren't fighting with each other during a heavy dev dbt run or fivetran sync. You can do this in Redshift by modifying the WLM but it's just a bitch and you can still run into problems, it's very much a trial and error process.- If you're working with any JSON in redshift I'm sorry.- We had some governance problems that were helped via the transition, but I don't think the problem was redshift specific.- Not totally relevant but we also had some ML/GenAI jobs we were wanting to use Databricks for so doubled up our use case.- Federated queries make a migration insane easy.Caveat databricks really can be just as pricey as redshift serverless if you leave it to auto scale and aren't particular with your compute sizings.

Additionally, developers can write either custom hand-written SQL tests, or write some generic tests that turn into SQL.

mx0yvcs,"I have thought about this a lot lately. I disagree with you when it comes to students. They absolutely SHOULD NOT use A.I. A.I. destroys your ability to think. It may not happen immediately, but it does. I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time. This isn't just happening to programmers. This is happening to other fields as well. The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it. Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool. It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning. This is also why you take so many math classes. Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world? Probably not, but that's not the point. The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills. The same goes for programmingI'm speaking from experience on this. I'm a 3rd year CS student. My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class. Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion. Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I. I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer. I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps. I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again. I actually retained the information that time.I have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code. I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects. This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design. Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity.

Use it to figure out the problem rather than solve it.

For example, accessing the first item in an array. It doesn’t matter how many elements are in the array, it always takes the same amount of time.O(n): linear time. This describes behavior that scales linearly as the input gets bigger. For example, printing each element in an array. As the input grows, so does the time.O(n²): quadratic time. This usually shows up when you have nested loops (a loop inside a loop) both running over the same input. For example, comparing every element in an array to every other element.

mx5zav1,"People are often thrown into this class with only a vague notion of what a log in math is. This is a bad starting point right off the bat. Also, its VERY easy to get confused about WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING. Bad books; you can't tell if they are counting the comparisons or the swaps in a sort algorithm. Those numbers can be similar or very different.You are in part telling me without telling me that you don't understand the NOTATION. The concept aside, O(1) is notation for the simplest thing you can do: you do one operation (this can have several steps) and get the result. Eg array\[user\_input\] = 0; you go there, you do something, you are done. Sure, that is like 8 assembly instructions or something, but big-O is a conceptual level thing, not a detail level thing. You wanted to know how many assignments, you did 1.O(N) is similar. you iterate an array and add 5 to each element. How many times did you add 5? Well, you did it for whatever the size of the array is, but we didn't say... that is abstracted to the letter ""N' which just means ""some amount of them"". You write that one O(N), see how that works?looping over every element with nested loops is a multiply.. for(1-n){for (1-n again)} .. how many times does the inner part happen? Its N\^2 .. the outer loop does n inner loops for 1, n inner loops for 2, ... right? And that is unsurprisingly written O(N\^2).So the notation is O (some expression of N). some expression of N could be almost anything you might see in math, from N! to log(N) to N\^3 to sqrt(N) or whatnot. Big-O only keeps the dominant terms (eg 3n\^3 + 11n\^2 + 37) is just written O(n\^3) .. because in the big picture, the cubed term will soon dwarf the others and give you a general sense of how slow it will be.\-------------------a log is just an exponent, with its own math notation that is weird and a bunch of cool properties that you are told to memorize without being led to connect the dots, the first time you see them, and many people never get much past that part. I mean, its stuff you know, though, if you can just see past the notation and look at the numbers. 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ... you know these guys ... its the powers of 2. How many times, using only integers, can you cut the number 100 in half? Even rounding it up.. 50 (once), 25(twice) 13(three times), 7(4), 4(5),2(6),1(7) and done. Hmm. 2\^7 is... 128. Hmm. See the connection? The math problem is ""to what integer power do I raise 2 to get 100"". The answer is 6 or 7 depending on if you want to over shoot or under shoot the target. THAT IS A LOG problem, and its all you are going to see in big-O is powers of 2. No base 17 logs or e or anything from math that gets weird, just powers of 2, and that is the question it is asking and the answer. Its not that scary, when you see it written out, hopefully? All the log algorithms are about cutting the data in half over and over, just like that, for example think about how you search a physical book dictionary for a word: you open in the middle, and its more towards A or more towards Z, so you cut the half where it will be in half again... is it more towards M or Z... more towards M or S ... whatever... (and yea humans jump to the first letter section better than by halfs but play along with the blind approach ... this is just what a binary search does ... cuts the list in half until its down to 1 element and its found or not at that point). That is about 85% of the big o stuff. There will be other notations at the same time that denote best case, average case, worst case and so on that you just need to memorize (the notation, I mean, memorize THAT) and rules (like the dropping of constants and taking the dominating term of the equation that your code defines.there are not that many REAL in use big-O answers. There is 1, lg(n), N\*lg(n), N, N\^powers, and the ugly stuff like N! or 2\^N etc. And practical algorithms rarely go abouve N\^3 before someone gets mad and finds a better way (there are some things where there is no better way, but MOST stuff you see day in and day out has an answer N\^3 or better). I mean there are screwballs... shellsort for example often ends up with some form of O(N\^(x+1/x)) eg N\^7/6 was a common find back when I studied that algorithm. But shell sort needs a freakin PHD level analysis to find the complexity for many of the sequences and its not handed out lightly to students.

mx5uv2a,"Big-O notation is a fancy term for approximation. Basically you count the number of operations that your code performs.For example, the very first LeetCode problem: given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a given target. An example of non-optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: for i in range(len(nums) - 1): for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)): if nums[i] + nums[j] == target: return [i, j]It has a loop with n iterations (i index) and inside each iteration is another loop with n iterations (j index). So the code may evaluate the if statement up to n \* n times, hence O(n\*\*2) time complexity.An optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: prev_numbers = {} for i, num in enumerate(nums): complement = target - num if complement in prev_numbers: return [prev_numbers[complement], i] prev_numbers[num] = iIt has only a loop with n iterations. The code may evaluate the if statement up to n times max, hence O(n) complexity.Another common introduction to the notation is a binary search. In a binary search you halve the length of the list at each iteration. How many times you divide the length of the list (n) until it becomes 1? Roughly log(n) / log(2). Hence O(log(n)) complexity for binary search.Look up multiple tutorials and introductions and build your own understanding of the subject.

mx982ds,"So lots of other people have given good breakdowns on Big-O, but when it comes to practical applications I find where a lot of learners struggle isn't actually the time complexity part, it is the part where they look at real algorithms and figure out the Big O. Because they can't read and understand code well enough to make any conclusions on how many times some code might loop or the like.Like, look at some pseudo code like: function maxproduct(List l): int { int maxproduct, i, j = 0,0,0 while (i < l.length) { while ( i + j < l.length) { int product = l[i] * l[i+j] if (product > maxproduct) maxproduct = product j++ } i++ } return maxproduct }If the list contains 1 item, how many times will the ""`int product = l[i] * l[i+j`\]"" line be executed? What if it contains 10 items? 100?If you can look at the code and figure that type of thing out pretty quickly, then figuring out Big O becomes a lot easier to understand - you're really just talking about the relationship between the number of inputs and how many instructions and how one grows as the other grows.But if you *can't* look at a code block like that pretty quickly and tell me roughly how many times the interior loop will run based on the length of the list, your problem isn't really understanding Big O notation. It is that your programming knowledge isn't advanced enough to really be able to grasp it. So if that's the case, I'd put worrying about Big O aside and instead return to focusing on the basics of reading and writing simple code until you really get it and can read it easily before returning to more theoretical concepts like Big O.",PoMoAnachro,2025-06-11 19:39:41,2,learnprogramming,t3_1l8m6fx,False,

How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof? It sounds like you're thinking about this the same way I did when I first looked into the subject. ""So, I'm supposed to generate a big-ass random number while jillions of other devs are simultaneously generating big-ass random numbers and just hope that none of us bump into each other? What's the logic here besides 'Trust me, bro'?"" The secret, at least for [Version 1 GUIDs](https://guid.one/guid/make), is that it's actually not entirely random, and that's a good thing. The idea behind a GUID is that it should be unique in time and space. With that in mind, it's pretty easy to deliberately avoid collisions by incorporating spacial (physical or logical space) and temporal components in combination with randomness. Identifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second. The thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table. With that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table.

At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ?Well, you *don't* do it with an inheritance graph like Object->Character->Player->\[Fighter|Mage|Archer\]. Instead, you could give the class that represents a player an attribute, like \`role\` and a corresponding \`Role\` type that sets the expectations for what a Role is. Fighter, Mage, and Archer *could* be derived from Role, or they could just be instances of Role -- i.e. all exactly the same type of object, but with different data. For example, it might be that any role can hit an adversary, and any role can cast spells, but a Fighter might just hit harder, and a Mage might have a higher probability of success with magic. If a player can have more than one role at a time, then the \`role\` attribute should really be \`roles\` and refer to some kind of collection or combination of the roles.>Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.That depends on the language.

This is where something like an ECS shines because it's designed to give you maximum flexibility when defining types and assigning properties to them.I also don't think that DOD necessarily conflicts with OOP.

Joe Armstrong, the inventory of Erlang (a functional/actor language) once said that he thought Kay would disagree, but he considered Erlang more ""object-oriented"" than almost any other language, and Kay agreed.Now, that's a bit of a minority opinion, but it just goes to show how widely the definition of ""OOP"" can vary.IOW, I think your view of OOP is frankly very incomplete.

You need to research/evaluate these trade-offs and decide, which side your projects want to be on.Traditional databases are on the left side and provide a lot of ""safety"" and strict reliability for clean data.NoSQL databases typically fall on the right side. They sacrifice a lot of ""guarantees"" for scalability. If you choose one of these you have to consider issues that might occur from ""eventual consistency"" and not being able to really rely on the data structure returned by your database.Relational databases offer quite flexible queriing. Need to now which `Product`s a `Customer` has added to their shopping basket? SQL can query that! Later, need to now which `Customer`s have bought a certain `Product` (reverse)? That's just another SQL query! You don't have to change your database structure to support that.NoSQL often are not that flexible. If you structure your database to efficiently support the first query, it won't be as efficient to support the second query. Worst case, you'll have to completely restructure your DB to support the use case.Paradoxically, NoSQL makes it very simple to store/retrieve an object structure, without much upfront-thinking about how your data looks like.

The correct approach is to first have a working program/code/feature, and then assess whether the performance even is problematic, and then if it is, use profiling or instrumentation to see which part of the code is slow and why. Then, focus on optimizing only that part of the code.3. In order to understand why code is slow, you can look at it from an algorithmic standpoint, like for instance noticing a double for loop, meaning a potential N\^2 algorithm, which could maybe be redone in some clever way to become O(N) or NlogN, OR you can look at it from a systems standpoint, for instance you are only using 1 thread/1 cpu core but your machine as 128 cores available, or you should be doing CPU work and IO at the same time, etc. to maximize utilization of the resources.4.

Use that judgement to trend toward low complexity, so that if/when you get to an optimization pass the basics are already sane. 2. Pay close to attention to your intended throughput.

If you do it right it'll probably involve having/obtaining some math knowledge that you aren't thinking of yet, which is why IMHO business applications are a tad more approachable if you just want to get the right mindset regarding project work, while doing some goal-oriented coding.",E3FxGaming,2025-06-11 02:44:44,11,learnprogramming,t3_1l8fqfr,False,

Python usually clicks around week 3-4 for most people, but everyone's different.About whether you should continue, programming skills are pretty valuable right now, especially with AI stuff happening. Even if you don't become a full time developer, knowing how to code helps in almost any field.As for next language, worry about that later. Get comfortable with Python first.

What you need to do is learn to write a function that takes inputs, aka parameters. The basic idea is that you write the code once using the functions parameters, and then you can call the function any number of times with whatever values you want. You can use parameters for anything that you want to be adjustable in the function. If you write a function that draws an enemy, you can use parameters to specify the location of the enemy, but also what color(s) to use, how many legs or teeth the enemy has, and anything else that could change from one enemy to the next.Once you’ve got a function that draws the enemy, you can create a list of sets of parameters. Then, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and call the `enemy` function with each set of parameters, and the function will draw all the enemies in the list one at a time.This is one of the fundamental ideas in programming.

You don't *need* one but, again, if a company is flooded with applicants you can toss all the resumes without a 4 year degree in the trash and still have plenty of choice. If you don't, you're going to need some networking (as in leveraging and building your network of personal contacts, not TCP/IP!) skills, so work on building those up.But the really important things are - can you *think for yourself?* Can you *solve problems?* A lot of young programmers have never really solved problems by themselves, they've either just been following tutorials or, worse, using AI for everything. Once you get past the HR filters, getting through the interview is going to be show that you've got the interpersonal skills every job needs (can you take direction? work as a team? self-motivate?), and then your problem solving and thinking skills.Not every interview is going to have a ""whiteboard coding"" problem, but all of them are going to try to do something to capture how much skill you have versus just how much you've memorized.",PoMoAnachro,2025-06-12 15:17:16,16,learnprogramming,t3_1l9otfl,False,

Entry levels are really competitive because of a combination of a couple things: 1) AI is replacing a lot of aspects of a junior role, 2) as a result of the AI influence, companies seemingly want more specialists vs generalists in the market rn (this is my opinion though from speaking with companies and seeing their sentiment), and 3) in general, less companies are looking to spend the time mentoring + training junior talent when they know they can use AI for a certain amount of tasks + hire intermediate/senior talent to come in and hit the ground running right away.What I'd recommend: build your projects and experience in a way that shows your adaptability to pick up new technologies/skills as fast as possible. Show that your insight, productivity, and understanding of how to solve a problem is there, something that AI cannot show! Some things you can do: build an awesome portfolio website to showcase your projects and present them in a case study like format (showcase your thinking and process), align your resume to the very specific skillset that the company is looking for and if you have some dream roles/companies, building projects very specifically towards that, and most importantly: build up your network. Reach out to people on LinkedIn/reddit/conferences/forums etc and build connections to learn and connect with them. You never know where a connection can lead to - I've had people that I met 6 years ago offer me a great job when I needed it most! And finally, as I always do, you can always check out our talent community where we help you upskill on exactly this and find directly recruited jobs for you (but ofc, you're welcome to apply outside of our community too).

The perpetual license only has 1 year of upgrades, maybe 4 patch releases, but you can modify the source code and fix GUI defects forever. Get at least one perpetual license and enough 3-year subscription licenses to complete the development phase, then get a 1- year upgrade for the perpetual license before going to 510k so you pick up the latest patch release versions.

mxdllyg,"I'll give 3 I can think of. Or 2.5, maybe.1) Honestly I'd already learned most of the important lessons the hard way before hearing advice around them. One piece of advice I can think of though that I didn't stumble into myself was that an engineer once said they view passing self/this to a method/function to be a smell. I hadn't considered that and I don't even really know why it's true if it is. Maybe it's true because it reveals a potentially unnecessary bi-directional dependency/coupling. Sometimes I can't figure out a way to prevent this where the pros outweigh the cons but sometimes I can and in those cases it seems to result in a much better design.2) Not advice per se, but, If I go back, as in really really far back to before I programmed professionally, I saw somebody diagram a program top-down before implementing it. This indirectly resulted in organizing the procedures by level of abstraction and exposed a mental model of the program to latch onto while implementing it. Thinking of things that way (or bottom-up works, too) felt like it unblocked me to create much more complex programs before drowning in my own mess.3) Some advice I got but debatably not ""software engineering"" advice, I would say it was actually a soft-skills thing. A product manager mentioned to me after a meeting that instead of saying things like ""we can't do that"" it would be more helpful/productive to say things like ""Do you think X would be a problem if we do that?""In other words, it really matters how people feel as a result of technical back-and-forth. I think this can be overlooked if you only interact with engineers. Seems obvious in retrospect but this helped me be more effective when communicating with non-engineers which actually made me a more effective technical lead as well.I think in certain types of software projects cross-team communication of technical mental models around the problem solution is crucial. So this was a breakthrough for me and arguably made me a better software engineer than any technical advice I'd ever received.So I would say to your ""but I wonder if there's more"", YMMV but I would advise to focus on people stuff and notice that people problems are actually more likely to kill certain projects than technical decisions are. And also along those lines I think for certain projects the value is actually more in the understanding of the problem/proposed solution and effective communication around it than the implementation itself is.",azimux,2025-06-12 13:26:34,2,learnprogramming,t3_1l9lb7e,False,

mx0x1fx,"Can you give an example?Generally, it's a separate skill. Teaching as a TA or tutor helps practice; so does a client facing job like consulting. My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.My other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.It's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.I will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like ""I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\].""

Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description.

But for this, there is ""the table of contents"" and ""the index"" which may seem quaint but are actually better for learning, in my opinion.

That is why everyone always suggests doing projects, because then you apply your recently gained knowledge, and then you learn!Books have the downside that it is tempting to skip through the boring stuff, and only read whatever confirms what you already know. They can give you a feeling that you totally understand things, because the book explains it so nicely.Interactive tutorials like free code camp and others, have the downside that they only ask you to answer predefined questions, and you risk becoming like a monkey pressing switches, without any idea of why or what you are doing. And since they tend ""finish"" every topic without ever returning, you forget the first things you ""learned"" before the course is complete.Video tutorials are mostly just watching someone else repeating a project they have done before - kind of like watching someone play a game they've already completed. It can be great for actually seeing what is going on, but like in life, there's a huge difference between seeing someone else doing things, and do them yourselves.My recommendation is to look around, try some different things, see what you like, and then focus on applying the knowledge to projects where you can't just fast-forward or skip to the page with the solution.

I'd say with Go there's a slightly higher chance the interviewer wouldn't be as familiar with Go and might ask you a question about your syntax. Should be fine if you're good at it, though.Picking C as your primary language for interviews can occasionally be a weakness. While C is a great language, there are some things that are just a lot more tedious in C. Just about any problem that involves appending strings, for example, is more tedious in C, especially if you want it to work with arbitrary sizes and handle errors correctly - whereas C++ and Go have nice high-level string objects that you can easily split, append, and so on.It depends on the problem.

When you do an operation like copyto, the underlying code performs a loop requesting the amount of bytes to fill the buffer, it then moves those bytes to the specified destination. If the amount of bytes received was less than the number of bytes requested then it repeats the operation fetch operation until the number of bytes received is less than the number of bytes requested.The idea being that some streams have an overhead for reading or writing, by reading a chunk at a time (rather than a byte at a time) you can avoid a lot of that overhead.

my0j0my,"I keep hearing and seeing this question everywhere and want to answer this once and for all.1. The United States is a much wealthier country than most of the developed world. Look at [this link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income) of disposable income after transfers - the US is literally 50% ahead of even many wealthy European countries, and nearly double that of South Korea. So part of the reason why American wages are higher than that of Canada is the same reason why American wages are higher than that of Nigeria or Pakistan.2. Silicon Valley emerged as the global tech capital due to unique historical timing. While Europe and Asia were rebuilding from WW2, the US had intact infrastructure and universities pumping out engineers. Stanford, Berkeley, and the defense industry created this perfect storm in the Bay Area thanks to much looser non-compete agreement laws in California (read the story of the [Traitorous eight.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight) Basically a bunch of elite engineers who left some batshit crazy micromanager's firm realized they could only create their own startups by staying in California due to them not enforcing non-competes, and ended up founding Intel and Kleiner Perkins - which funded Amazon, Google, Sun Microsystems, and basically jumpstarted the modern VC scene). By the time other countries caught up industrially in the 70s-80s, Silicon Valley had already established itself as THE place for tech innovation.3. This created a self-reinforcing cycle that’s nearly impossible to break. Top talent moved to Silicon Valley → venture capitalists followed the talent → successful companies emerged → created more high-paying jobs → attracted more top talent. Repeat for 50 years. Now you have the densest concentration of tech talent, capital, and successful companies on Earth all competing for the same workers.4. The US has a massive advantage other countries can’t replicate: 340 million people in a single market with one language, one currency, and one set of regulations. A startup in San Francisco can instantly sell to someone in Florida. Meanwhile, a startup in France has to deal with 27 different EU regulations, multiple languages, and a much smaller domestic market. Canadian startups have to follow separate securities regulation for every province dramatically limiting scaling. This scale creates far more valuable companies that can afford to pay more. This effect also explains why sky high pay is available for elite engineers when adjusting for COL in India and China.5. The regulatory environment in the US is far more favorable than other countries. European bankruptcy laws until very recently would destroy you personally, while Chapter 11 bankruptcies were very lax. At-will employment means companies can hire aggressively knowing they can pivot if needed. This risk-friendly environment creates more unicorns, which drives up wages for everyone as they compete for talent.All of these factors combined together supercharge American wages across all sectors of the economy compared to other even developed nations.",Ok-Contract-2759,2025-06-16 02:27:15,1003,cscareerquestions,t3_1lcgitw,False,

That's not to say that you shouldn't document and do proper design, but balance and know when to prioritize a less perfect solution that solves the problem.Also FAANG tries to build everything from the ground up. Need a pipeline to load data from X place? Cool, let's build it. Orchestration? Sure, maybe we get an open source tool that requires some time to set up. Or build our own taking a quarter to do so. Or use the in-house solution that does not rely on external libraries and no one else outside of the company knows.Startups are messy and sometimes cannot wait for that clean code that only uses internal libraries, passes compliance and security requirements in all known legislations including countries where they don't even have customers and optimize for the best design and algorithmic solution at the cost of spending more time planning.Lastly if nothing works it is totally okey to change companies or to leave the startup world to go a regular employer where the pace is the right for you. Even if you don't get a fancy stock package (that might be worth 0...), your mental health is important.PS: some startups would rather hire from other other startup than FAANG precisely because FAANG tend to house in-house tools and focus on building from the ground up instead of just using a vendor.PS 2: IMO, 2.5 years at a FAANG probes you are a capable engineer.

But then COVID hit and a bunch of tech jobs moved here, and it made the housing market go completely batshit crazy - and it was largely because a bunch of people with a bunch of money flooded the market.At the same time, that drove salaries up - because to afford working in Austin, you need to afford living in Austin. The issue was that salaries didn't increase in every sector - so teachers and government workers got completely fucked. But us in tech? Doing great.Now, Silicon Valley and NYC are a different story - those are cities where that cycle of salaries -> people -> housing has been going on for decades now. Now things are someone shifting because jobs are moving out of Silicon Valley to lower cost areas, and that implications of that are going to be complicated.Now, offshoring - yes, it's 100% tied to cost of living differences. Not just housing - it's also food, services, healthcare, etc. But the same issue above at a city level also happens at a country level - countries with great quality of life and resources can offer better pay to attract more talented people who then have more money to spend on goods and services, etc.I do agree that the US has a ton of opportunities to lower cost of living - and I think you're right that housing is a big one (with healthcare being the other one).And I think you're also right that the nimby movement is extremely damaging to our ability to deliver affordable housing.

How cheap do you actually think good offshore devs really are? Latin Americans are now being paid almost as much as Western Europeans nowadays. Talented senior devs in India are making six figures. The truth is that offshore salaries have increased a lot in the past few years because as more work gets offshored the costs go up since there are only so many quality devs out there. Also, an effect of that is that the cost of living in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, etc. is increasing because now that they have more money to spend, realtors can now increase the prices of rent and houses over there.

Even these interviews were a lot more tough and you could tell they had several good candidates in the pipeline. There were some other factors but if you’re trying to get into a company with competitive pay, I’d start the interview prep now and start getting an idea of what salaries they’re offering.TLDR: I had several months of notice that our team was likely to be laid off.

mxz7kp8,"You might need to think about if you hate this specific job, or if you hate ""working"".Daily standups, time tracking, etc are all pretty standard in the industry. If those things are draining to you... even if you take a year off to refresh, you're just going to immediately get drained again once you start working again after the break.That's why I always recommend *against* people wondering if they should go for the nuclear option of taking a year off in order to combat burnout. Taking a year off will feel amazing, you'll be super happy during that year, but you're going to just burnout again the moment you get back. Taking a year off will not be a magic fix. You need to try and actually fix the root cause of your issue. Taking a year off is treating the short-term symptoms, not the long-term root cause.I hate working. I only work so that I can afford to live my actual life. I have a very clear separation between my work life and my personal life. I don't like daily standups, I don't like time tracking, I don't like pointless meetings, I don't like having to be available 9-5 M-F. I don't think anybody does. But we all do it with the understanding that yeah, some of it sucks, but we do those things because we get a deposit into our bank account every other week that lets us afford the things we actually like doing.As for where you're in your career, it's also not a smart move. You have a year of experience. That puts you firmly into the ""entry level"" category, which is objectively the most difficult category to be job searching in. When you're that early into your career, everything is very fragile. Taking a year long break now, versus taking a year long break when you have 5 YOE are completely different. When you're mid-level, you have a lot more stability, and your re-entry into the industry will be *significantly* easier.All that said, it's also not a smart move financially. Early in your life is when the money you save is most important. The money you put into a mutual fund today is going to be worth *a ton* when you're older. The more money we have stashed away, the more money we make. The rich get richer. When you intentionally nuke your entire life savings to do a big year long trip, that's a decision that extends far beyond the immediate impact. Sure, immediately you lose $X. But you also are losing a very significant amount of unrealized income that would've made if you had kept that money invested.Even setting aside the income aspect, money you have saved is supposed to be your emergency fund. Sure you can afford to live for a year without income... but what if something unexpected happens, as often happens in life? What if god forbid you get into a car crash? Now you need to buy a new car, and you have 5-6 figures of medical bills. What if your sister has a destination wedding? Now you get to decide if you want to miss your sisters wedding, or shorten your vacation to be 8 months instead of 12. What if a million other things pop up? Financial planning isn't about the ""happy path"".I'm all for taking a year off, traveling, living your life, etc. But I think you need to do it for the right reasons, and you need to understand all the costs and risks associated with it. Personally, I would wait until I had at least 5+ YOE before even considering something like that. If my job sucks, I'll find another job, not take a year off. Anecdotally I have enough money saved up to live for over *a decade* without income. But I still understand it'd be a massive financial decision to actually go voluntarily unemployed.

If they have a “nice to have” section do some research on some of the topics. Maybe put together a small project or a larger project design doc including some of them. It will at least get you thinking about how they might be using that particular skill to solve a current issue or what they might be trying to do to improve a current problem.Think and research how they might solve some of their more technical problems. Come up with some questions around them. “How do you prioritize x’s backlog when z seems to change often and requires a lot of maintenance.” Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions. “With Company A partnering with Company B to build a platform that allows users to do X. What strategies are being considered to compete in that space?”This is the kind of shit that’ll separate two candidates that performed equally well on the technical parts.

My earliest resume that is not really polished and kinda embarrassing got the attention of a FAANG company, another FAANG-adjacent company, and a mid-tier but large multinational company. They are interested even though they would need to do visa sponsorship (non-US).2. I failed a lot in my initial interviews at multiple companies (including the only FAANG) since I'm really rusty with interviewing. I was so burned out by the experience, I try to not be such a tryhard anymore. I go into interviews thinking I wouldn't be able to clear it anyway, but at least I'll get free mock interviews with the best engineers in the industry. I faced a lot of unfamiliar tech questions, but I try to do bruteforce and optimize based on patterns that I know. I answered behavioral questions as transparent as possible even though it wouldn't put me in the best light. After the interviews, the recruiter will give me great feedback especially on the behavioral questions, which I thought I obviously bombed. Coding interviews and system designs are also mostly positive, only I bombed the FAANG-adjacent one due to communication issues I think.Just like you, I think luck does play a major factor in my process.

It's still  fundamentally a software engineering job. You will get more ROI by learning Docker than reading the latest reinforcement learning paper.There's definitely training of models but that's not all. You oftentimes just call third party APIs like OpenAI. Or you are building out data/cloud infra to support your model development or deployment.

So yes super maths heavy, its not just training the model, they build the model.3) Other roles are more applied, but you still need a lot of maths, you need a solid understanding of the models and the statistics behind them. You usually focus on finding solutions for business problems. For example, the current models might not work well on the specific use case that your company need.

mxo5j12,"Most junior positions won't hit you with heavy system design questions, but you'd be surprised how many companies are starting to include lighter versions even for entry-level roles. You're not going to be asked to architect Netflix's entire streaming platform, but you might get something like ""design a simple URL shortener"" or ""how would you build a basic chat application."" The key is understanding fundamental concepts like databases, APIs, caching, and load balancing at a high level rather than diving deep into complex distributed systems.Focus your prep on the basics: know the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, understand what a load balancer does, grasp basic caching concepts, and be able to draw simple diagrams showing how a web application talks to a database. Practice explaining your thought process out loud because interviewers care more about how you think through problems than getting the perfect solution. Even if you stumble, showing logical reasoning and asking clarifying questions demonstrates the problem-solving skills they're really evaluating.I'm actually part of the team behind [interview help AI](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically for these kinds of tricky interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate your reasoning clearly.",akornato,2025-06-14 01:48:32,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1laq6uc,False,

mxmgo78,"I heard from a manager that 1 year is the minimum to stay at a job for it to look ""ok"" but 2 is best. So leaving after 1 YOE isn't horrible. However, I wouldn't worry about the growth opportunities. I think that gaining experience is what's important, even if there's not a clear promotion path, because you can always go somewhere else with that experience and not jump through silly hoops for some promotion game. Here's another take on the promotion issue: I was on a small team that had a few senior and a few principal level devs. I wasn't quite at principal level and wasn't really thinking about promotion and I don't think many were also because there's just those two levels. I was at a FAANG before this and I actually kindof liked this mindset better because at FAANG we would work on stupid stuff sometimes until later you realize you were a tool for someone else's promotion project. However, at the smaller company to motivate people they still gave ""spot raises""; if you did good work you were rewarded. I liked that process more because people were actually invested in just doing good work and not ""putting on a show"" of good work.

mxmtjf2,"Under no circumstances should you quit without another job. Suck it up and deal with the situation you are in until you find something better.I have interviewed a lot of people. I really like folks who can tell me about projects they completed, and how they iterated on those projects based on the outcomes of good or bad decisions they made. Typically that means they have been somewhere for more than a year and a half, but not always. What you are doing is pretty normal. Most folks have a job or two with only a year or so of experience, and frequently one of them is their first job. It's hard to tell what you need in the beginning, but avoid making it a pattern.I would also consider a therapist. Personally, for me, acclimating to adulthood was tough. It's both awesome and terrible. I definitely made bad career decisions because I wasn't mature enough for adulting.

mxghqhk,"Here's what'll get you an interview:1. Network. Not like a coffee chat with someone, but like you've delivered value to them somehow already and they're willing to take a gamble on you. To get my first job out of a boot camp I took a gig stocking shelves in a warehouse at a tech company, networked my ass off for a year internally, and got hired into the next junior role they had.2. Build useful things. Not a movie rating app, build something that you could charge money for. In fact, if you can actually monetize it, that's the best case scenario. Ideally, you'd build something that confronts some of the more challenging problems in web design. An app that solves caching problems with real time interactivity across users is cool and shows something, but your movie rating app won't count for hardly anything.3. Don't go remote. Anyone in the world can compete for a remote job, so it's orders of magnitude harder to stand out. Apply for in-office jobs with local companies who can meet you face to face. It filters out the competition and let's you make the process a little less sterile.Honestly, if you're 100% self taught, you need a bangin project. Even with boot camp programs you get some kind of ""OK, they know *something*"" assurance. If you're self-taught using online resources (which is what I would consider Udemy) you're going to need to be able to show some good work.The good news is that if you *can* show good work, I think a self-taught dev that can build is always going to be viewed more favorably than a boot camp dev who can build, just because self-taught takes some grit.",Traditional_Lab_5468,2025-06-12 21:52:37,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1l9wual,False,
