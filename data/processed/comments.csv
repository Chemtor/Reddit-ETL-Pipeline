Analytics focused pipelines and business logic (more advanced dbt models such as mrr models). Technical overlap with the data engineers and business logic overlap with the analysts. Not so much focused on optimal usage of compute and so on but more focused on business.Data analyst -> data modelling in dbt to the specifications of the analytics engineers and data engineers and most importantly of course: analytics. The analysts in our company also write similar models to the analytics engineers but usually with less of a focus on complex models and more of a focus on analyses. Though that can vary on a need by need basis.The data engineer never does analytics or visualisations and neither does the analytics engineer. However, all are required to work with git and dbt. We also require knowledge in these technologies for analysts but most analysts would no know how to set up a dbt project or how to structure it. That's not their focus. But they still need to understand dbt well enough to create models and run tests, for example.Data engineering is definitely still viable. Basically, they are the people that keep the data sphere clean from a technical point of view and most knowledgable when it comes to setting up infrastructure (the analysts will never set up a dockerized dagster ec2 instance to orchestrate pipelines, neither will the analytics engineers, at least no in our company). And everything downstream hinges on that technical ability. For example: I, as a data engineer, run around the dwh and pick up queries to optimise. I can often reduce runtime from something like 1 hour to 2 minutes by configuring materialisation and implementing proper requirements for partition pruning (snowflake).

I know that this is going to draw a lot of downvotes, but I am yet to see how a cloud setup outperforms, both on cost and performance, a well tuned SQL Server.

One thing that isn’t talked about enough here is that if you have on-prem it has its own costs that are slightly different from being cloud based, such as physical maintenance of the equipment as well as purchasing the equipment. I view it in the same way I do a legal capacity in a company, not every company needs to have a dedicated legal capacity available to them at all times, so they outsource that bit (in our case use a dedicated consultancy to run it all, likely cloud based for access). Over time they may bring in a singular lawyer to coordinate things and deal with the majority of the paperwork, but they’ll still need advice or capacity help (singular data person with consulting support probably still cloud based). Then you have a mix of stuff where the legal department expands all the way to a full blown department with dedicated head count and seat at the board (everything from a small data team who are cloud based to a dedicated data department who have at least one person for every role including maintenance because they’ve brought it on-prem) but even then that legal department won’t be able to cover every single base and will have to bring in external help on occasion, probably keeping someone on retainer (there’ll still be some workloads cloud based).We all look at this as a purely technical and budget problem whereas you need to take a far more holistic view of the requirements of the individual business.",Nwengbartender,2025-04-19 10:10:45,10,dataengineering,t3_1k2so1d,False,

I've seen/known firefighters and paramedics who report zero stress in _their_ emergency response work, and this is the only way I can explain that. Of course, many emergency responders would also report much higher stress levels. Those folks are probably doing just as good a job as the no-stress folks, but they're thinking about their work differently. Something has clicked in the heads of the no-stress folks, and they can get on and deal with terrible situations effectively without it affecting their internal state. They presumably have healthy mental hygiene outside of work: hobbies, practices etc that keep them on an even keel.I think this applies to all office/corporate/white collar jobs just as much.

First, it has a couple of key differences:* Dataframely does not introduce a new runtime type: while `dy.DataFrame[Schema]` exists for the type checker, the runtime type remains `pl.DataFrame`. This makes it very easy to gradually adopt dataframely in a code base (and, similarly, to get rid of it again).* Dataframely natively implements the definition of schemas instead of ""dispatching"" to pydantic. This allows for much more flexibility in the schema definition.Second, dataframely provides a bunch of features that patito does not currently implement:* Support for composite primary keys* Validation across groups of rows (i.e. grouping by one or more columns, ensure that the _group_ satisfies a condition)* Validation of interdependent data frames with a common primary key (dataframely introduces the concept of a ""Collection"" here: invalid data in one data frame can then also remove rows from another data frame)* ""Soft-validation"" via `filter` which allows to partition data frames into rows that satisfy the schema and rows that don't* Structured info about failures that can be used e.g. for more debugging or advanced logging* Integration of the schema with external tools (e.g. export to SQL schemas)* Automatic data generation for unit testing, both for individual data frames and collections (in this case, dataframely takes care of generating rows with common primary keys to allow rows to be joined)",borchero,2025-04-18 09:54:33,6,dataengineering,t1_mnqcsrw,True,

mopcy3u,"They can be, but you need to use them appropriately. In data systems there's often a tradeoff between latency, throughput, and query volume. You can easily get a distributed k:v store to ingest millions of entries per second, and each write can be retrieved essentially immediately for low latency results, but it will generally struggle to handle large analytical queries.Your deltalake tables can ingest enormous volumes of data, and are great for huge analytical queries, but there are limitations on the types of write that you can do in the process. Most importantly here MERGE operations have *a lot* of overhead -- you'll be rewriting entire files for an update to a single row, and every write is going to leave behind another time travel copy of the data it just superseded.You can clean up these time travel copies. You run compaction periodically, then do a VACUUM with a custom short time with the necessary override to let it delete files less than a *week* old. You'll still have a lot of overhead processing the merges, however.What is often better with rapidly updating data when using something like deltalake is to move away from merging every single change, and instead just blind-inserting new values to an append-only log with a timestamp of when that row version becomes active. From there a window function looking for the latest timestamp for a given key lets you filter for the 'current data'.Over time the total amount of data will get pretty large, and that will get inefficient. So you can periodically create a proper merged 'current state' table that *doesn't* need the window-function-for-latest filter. Then when querying for the latest data you start with that fully merged table as your base, you anti-join the keys from the timestamp filtered append log, and union data with the window-function-for-latest filter only on the new append log data.That query will skip all the 'previously merged' data from the append log and keep the window processing to a minimum, but still lets you get the latest state from the append log where it applies.You'll want to do something like a bucketby on both tables on the key, so that they are properly organised to minimise shuffles to achieve the joins and window functions.You can tune the full merge period to whatever suits. It could be hourly, or daily, or any frequency you like. Each time you do a merge you can also compact and vacuum to clear out old data. If you partition your append-log by a time bin you can also drop old partitions to save storage space there too -- and it can help with skipping files that won't be relevant.---These sorts of 'streaming into big analysis' issues seem to come up from time to time. We had [another one last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jfwyyn/streaming_to_an_iceberg_scd2_table/) but that one went a step further to doing full SCD2 history, not just latest value.",azirale,2025-04-24 00:16:07,2,dataengineering,t3_1k66f2e,False,

mnwrr71,"Personally, as someone having used the tools, i would say its down to the overhead and use case of design for each. Sure, spark sql can work as a general query engine, but it wasnt really designed for that.There’s some differences under the hood, particularly around how spark executes in stages, and uses more I/O steps than Trino.Essentially, for ad-hoc queries that change frequently, or you rerun things to change and shape results, Trino will nearly always be more performant. You can make some tweaks with a spark application (and then run it interactively to try and do the same), but tbh, Trino’s entire design, really, is for extremely fast reads on object storage datalakes.Spark is better places for wide ranging transformations, that are potentially more complex in nature. A good example here is the fault tolerance nature of spark, which matters way more in big batch pipelines, than analytical ad hoc queries. Sure, data loss and the task fails, just re fire the query. In a pipeline, you cant manually do that if its all running automated. Again, different horses for different courses in my opinion.I see it a bit like:Spark was a natural successor to Hive, for better big data transformation.Trino was a successor for something like Impala, as a faster query engine over datalakes",Some_Grapefruit_2120,2025-04-19 11:17:44,21,dataengineering,t3_1k2tgbe,False,

mo1qu6i,"As others have explained in detail, Trino is optimized for responsiveness and thus excellent for interactive queries, whereas Spark is optimized for throughput and thus a good fit for batch workloads. In my opinion, the key differentiating feature between Trino and Spark is not the speed, but support for fault tolerance, which is required for batch workloads. As such, many organizations deploy two separate systems, despite the increase in complexity, added infrastructure costs, and the overhead.I think Starburst is well aware of this trend, and they are promoting Trino with fault tolerance suport. You can find some report that Trino with fault tolerance enabled works well in production and even saves the compute cost. From our own testing, however, Trino with fault tolerance does not work well for large queries (which it is designed for) because Trino coordinator crashes repeatedly. In any case, even Starburst recommends two separate deployments of Trino, one for interactive and another for batch. So, I think it is (and will remain) common to deploy separate systems for batch and interactive: Trino + Spark, Trino + Trino with fault tolerance, Trino + Hive-Tez, and so on.That said, we offer a solution that simplifies operations and reduces costs by eliminating the overhead of maintaining two separate systems, with a single unified system.

Our primary offerings of Starburst Enterprise (you install wherever) and Starburst Galaxy (SaaS) do NOT have Apache Spark in the stack.

mo8d5t4,"If you can’t touch the source (no log access?), your best bet is the full extract + diff approach you mentioned.You can try primary key diffing: Compare today’s extract to yesterday’s and consider anything missing likely a delete. This works fine for daily batch and is reliable if PKs don’t change.To make it a bit more robust, consider soft-deletes downstream. In your warehouse, mark missing records as deleted rather than removing them. This way you keep history and avoid accidental data loss.To “optimize”a bit, you can do a hash-based comparison. If tables are huge, and full PK comparison is too slow, you can hash rows or chunks of data to detect changes and only diff those chunks.Also, some teams snapshot the full table daily and treat it like slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2). Storage-heavy, but you get full history without needing to touch the source.Re: tooling, Python with Pandas or even dbt (as an SQL option) can handle the diff logic but it will be kinda complex to maintain.Now, the issues with this are:1. Late-arriving data can look like a delete if yesterday’s extract was missing a row that shows up today.2. Extract gaps (like job failures) can cause false positives.3. High-churn tables can make diffing expensive or slow.So keep these in mind.That said, I definitely recommend pushing for log-based replication though. It will make your life 100x easier. If you want something more automated, [Estuary](https://estuary.dev) can do snapshot + CDC streaming with minimal setup.

mo8gc8a,"I recently had to do this exact thing. The ingestion is written in Python that loads data from the source database hourly. I then have a separate script that loads the PKs from the DWH and from the source database daily. I then use the polars python package (nearly a 1:1 to pandas, but it's written in rust so it's a lot faster) to compare the IDs and write the missing IDs to a dataframe that's uploaded to our data lake, which is then loaded into the DWH as a separate table e.g removed_ids_ORDERS_TABLE. We then do WHERE id NOT IN (select * from removed_ids_ORDERS_TABLE) at the first layer of the DWH",paskinator_,2025-04-21 10:28:05,4,dataengineering,t3_1k46wz7,False,
mohczdr,"I had an exact use case as yours and PK diffing was what I did. So I used Spark and Delta as the PK storage. So here it goes:1. Create a Delta table with change data feed enabled2.

In your DWH, update all the records with the deleted PKs to flag them with is_deleted or something like thatThis approach went quite well for me. Another tip, you can take a look at Fivetran's teleport sync and try it out. If your company has a budget to use it, good for you. If not, try to use the Fivetran teleport sync on a test DB where every query is shown in the log. You'll see each query that Fivetran uses to do their CDC. You can try to reverse engineer it.

mo5bnaz,"I’d recommend against DMS for production grade continuous pipelines. It breaks often and is hard to use at scale.There are a few options to consider:1. Append-only + latest view: Just write every change and use views or queries to pick the latest version (row_number() over pk, updated_at). It’s simple and scales ~okay.2. CoW vs. MoR: For update-heavy workloads, merge-on-read is usually more efficient with Iceberg. But frequent small writes still hurt performance (you’ll want to buffer and batch). [Here’s](https://estuary.dev/blog/apache-iceberg-cow-vs-mor/) a detailed article about the two.3.

That's how I've learned most of my data engineering stuff after I started. However, databricks is probably overkill for most small companies. I assume other platforms offer similar training though. And of course make sure that you know SQL. Spark/pyspark is very helpful too.

mobx3f7,"Infrastructure: Is your data on-prem or on cloud? The overwhelming trend is that most organizations are either already on cloud or planning on migrating. I recommend sticking to the big 3 - AWS, Azure or GCP. Platform: You have Snowflake and Databricks as the major ones. Use Snowflake if you only care about data warehousing and BI. It's easy to learn and quick to get started on. Use Databricks if you also want machine learning and a few other neat features like advanced analytics and big data processing. The learning curve is a bit steeper in my opinion, but it's worth it because of better flexibility/control.Tools: look into are dbt, SQLMesh, airflow, kafka, fivetran, terraform, pyspark and the list goes on. I highly recommend dbt because it allows you to easily abstract data modelling and transformations while remaining (nearly) platform agnostic. SQLMesh is also proving itself to be quite good, outperforming dbt in certain things like write operation times and incremental models, but has a much smaller community than dbt. You can use fivetran for integrating a gazillion sources. I won't go through all of them, but I definitely recommend looking into pyspark if you're working with large data sets. It will significantly boost your pipeline performance! All in all, there are so many decisions to be made. My advice is to keep it stupid simple. Pick only what you need and nothing more.

Tooling in this case is probably irrelevant - you just need careful engineering and separation of groups of tables that are being synced. Typically migrations are handled by modifying writers which temporarily write to both DBs. I'd probably stay away from Kafka/other queues because they will increase your synchronization lag. I can probably say more if you provide more details. What maximum latency are you looking for? I'm looking at a similar setup in production right now (MySQL -> PostgreSQL) and I see that under load P95 latency (time of write in destination minus time of creation of item in source) is about 850 ms.

My concern is implementing the schema transformation layer correctly, especially with the completely different structures.For the historical data migration, your async transfer approach makes sense.

moj785f,"Seminal book on the topic is “Designing Data Intensive Applications”, but that is pretty general.I think for spark specifically, the best thing you can do is inspect the spark ui. You can read about the different types of joins spark does (shuffle, broadcast etc) and even use hints in your SQL or pyspark to force a certain one.SQL and pandas and spark have a lot of differences, but one thing that’s helped me is learning the fundamental data structures at play. SQL databases use a B-tree for its index, so if I 10x my data size, my reads are only 2x slower. Parquet uses a bloom filter so you can filter it with a WHERE clause extremely quickly. Chapter 3 of designing data intensive applications goes into this.Related to this, one neat optimizations databases do is use statistics for query optimization. For example, if you have [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) statistics, the query optimizer can get more accurate cardinality estimates on your data. This can really help if you have many joins. There’s a good paper from Meta and others (including Pandas creator Wes McKinney) going into the differences between all of these systems, and it gives a good overview of what needs to happen between you submitting a query and getting data back: https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2679-pedreira.pdf",Candid_Art2155,2025-04-23 01:11:49,4,dataengineering,t3_1k5mazo,False,

moibijc,"1. Iceberg is a protocol that defines both how the metadata and data files are represented in your object storage. That means that all your existing non Iceberg data, even if already parquet, has to be rewritten in Iceberg format. The data itself will end up as parquet files, but these parquet files will be located and structured according to the Iceberg spec. 2. If your new data arrives as parquet files on S3, you'll have to configure some kind of pipeline to detect new files and INSERT/MERGE them into existing Iceberg tables. I recommended to someone on here recently to use a cron or lambda in conjunction with Athena to accomplish this. There are many ways to approach this. 3. Yes! a lot of engines support reading Iceberg (and Delta Lake). Particularly if you are using AWS Glue as a catalog. You can leverage Iceberg tables in Redshift, Spark, Athena, Trino, Snowflake, Clickhouse, and a few others if you have Iceberg tables cataloged with AWS Glue.

mokfigo,"I actually built Iceberg support in daft and can speak to some of the… frustrations about the ecosystem :face_with_tongue:1. Iceberg is just a storage format. In order to do anything with it, you need a data engine that understands the protocol and can read/write from it. Historically, only Spark really understood this protocol (because all the logic for this protocol was written in a .jar). Nowadays, other engines are slowly catching on. 2. Yep — if a new parquet file drops somewhere, you’re going to need to run some kind of job with your data engine of choice to read that file and write the data into your iceberg table. No magic here unfortunately and different engines might do this differently :(3. Now here’s the real kicker… if you want the latest and greatest features in Iceberg I would argue (very sadly) that Spark is the only engine that can do the newest stuff. Iceberg itself is pretty much just developed against Spark, and there is even logic in Spark that doesn’t follow the Iceberg spec that other engines have had to follow because of how ubiquitous Spark-written iceberg tables are in the wild :(The problem is that the iceberg protocol itself is very complex, and all the logic for adhering to the spec was originally written for the JVM. So only JVM tools such as Spark can leverage the latest features. That being said though there is tremendous progress being made in other ecosystems such as the PyIceberg ecosystem and iceberg-rust that are promising. We leverage PyIceberg for reads/writes of metadata (but do our own data reads/writes) which so far seems to be a great compromise :)",Hgdev1,2025-04-23 06:28:14,5,dataengineering,t3_1k5ghoy,False,

That way if you mess anything up in your pipeline, you don’t need to find the hard drive again. Use dd to create a disk image, and build a pipeline off of that. Parquet is a good general purpose way to store time series, and also works well for logs and images (hint: use zstd compression for large blobs, not snappy). Importantly it is fast and compact, and this data is optimal for your analytical/ML workflows. You can also set up batch reading/writing if your dataset gets bigger than available memory. Then records can be loaded from parquet to your OLTP database. Depending on how your data is stored on disk, duckdb could be a good tool here - especially if you have a larger than memory workload. It supports reading data in many formats, including raw blobs or text data (for images/logs). It can then store the data as parquet or in a .duckdb file - the export to parquet can even be batched, which is where it comes in very handy for larger than memory workloads.

With proper partitioning, storing and accessing this data into the cloud is likely going to be extremely cheap. Any other always-on database solution is going to be really expensive :(4. For multimodal data, you can most likely get away with storing a URL pointer in Parquet, and the raw data as a file with an appropriate encoding (e.g. JPEG). These encodings work best because they’ve been honed over the years for compression ratio and compute required to decode the data. As for the engine, check out Daft (https://www.getdaft.io) which is built for multimodal data like images that you mentioned!

And it's not just because ETL is ""different"", it's also because traditional ETL workflows usually don't adhere to the same standards of CI/CD, testing, etc. as services written by software engineers.What I've witnessed was that a huge part of a financial platform that used to be owned by DEs, was completely replaced by services owned by SEs. The DE's had a bunch of messy scripts in all sorts of places, typically Spark jobs, that were orchestrated by airflow and run once a day. About half of all of that was replaced with near realtime Flink jobs, that were adhering to the highest CI/CD standards. The costs more than halved, and no-one was woken up in the middle of the night anymore.So this doesn't mean everything will (or can) be replaced.

mnx51jd,"*This is long, feel free to TLDR and move on.*Here's the problem with interviewing programmers. Most of us work with a large codebase that can take quite sometime to learn and work with, partly due to its size, partly due to its organization, and partly due to knowing what the program does. Consider a tax program. How long would it take for you to learn the various tax codes used to determine how much taxes you owe? OK, maybe if the software was well-designed, that part would be isolated to areas where tax experts could work on that logic.But in many other situations, as part of building the software (or, more likely, maintaining it), the programmer becomes the de facto expert.If I'm interviewing you, I can't have you look at our production software. Let's skip past the fact that it might be proprietary. Simply put, in an hour interview, you can't learn enough to absorb even a fraction of the details (which is often why people feel completely insecure when they're hired and have to deal with software that they don't understand).In the past, sometimes the key was graduating from a top university. If you went to Stanford and could answer basic questions, then that degree could get you hired. The reputation of the university was enough. It was also common to ask people brainteasers (I'll give you one in a moment). It was thought if someone was intelligent enough to solve brainteasers, they would be good coders. Turns out, not so true. Some people love and are good at brainteasers (for example, I liked brainteasers) and this can make such people feel perfectly qualified. After a while, the so-called FAANG companies realized brainteasers didn't really help.The technical questions that were often asked in interviews were often confined to intro courses up to data structures and algorithms. That's because the typical CS major takes a bunch of optional electives in their 3rd and 4th years (in the US). You can't assume a person knows SQL or neural networks or undecidability or even NP completeness (at least, proofs of such problems).They'd ask basic coding questions, instead.But with leetcode, they can ask similar kinds of questions that rely on data structures and algorithms. These problems are self-contained, and more importantly, can be programmed without learning much and done in around 100 lines or less.This is clearly not the kind of programming most people do which is why you're not so good at it. This skill is kind of important, but it's like learning knife skills and being able to chop something quickly. Maybe a working chef needs this skill. Maybe it's nice if a home chef has this skill. But you can make a great dish without this skill. It's a nice to have that may come in useful in certain situations.You can do a simple search `how to solve leetcode problems`. There's even a leetcode subreddit /r/leetcode. There's a YouTube channel called neetcode where the guy tells you strategies to solve leetcode style questions. It's popular enough that there are lots of resources out there.These questions have become today's brainteasers. They share similar qualities, but they are also unrelated to most typical programming.Finally, I mentioned a brainteaser, so here is a common one.> You have eight seemingly identical balls. One ball out of the eight is heavier than the other seven identical balls. Your goal: find the heavier ball. Your tool: you have a scale that tells you three pieces of information: the left side is heavier than the right side; the right side is heavier than the left; the two sides have equal weight.> Next piece of information: If I put an uneven number of balls on either side, say, 2 balls on one scale and 1 ball on the other scale, then the side that has more balls is *always* heavier.> One restriction. Each time you use the scale, I will charge you money. You want to save as much money as possible. What's the fewest number of weighings you need to find the heavier ball? And, tell me how to find it?The other kind has to do with estimation or weird mental puzzles. * How many gas stations exist in the US?* If a commercial plane had its wheels on super treadmills that could go very fast, but the plane stood still (just as a runner on a treadmill doesn't go anywhere), does the plane lift off? Explain your answer.Sorry for the long reply. It was meant to show why leetcode questions are being asked and to explain that it has little to do with your ability to program, but has become this necessary evil (it's not evil, to be honest, as it's useful but not essential to know this) in programming interviews.",CodeTinkerer,2025-04-19 12:59:13,33,learnprogramming,t3_1k2v36s,False,

For me, this kind of approach meant I never really could work out what to do on my own when faced with a problem, nor could I creatively think of how to apply concepts.I know this isn't just ""programming"" but I went the other way and bought some electronic components, then worked backwards trying to understand how to get my devices to work together. That made me encounter issues with memory (as an example) and led me down the rabbit hole of all kinds of concepts - some of which would never have been a part of any of these tutorials. So now, I find myself more engaged, more ready to even experiment in my programming and with a list of things I want to try/make.I'd also note that I'm a hobbyist, so I'm not looking (at least for now) at learning programming as a way to carve out a career, which allows me to take it easy and not feel too down when things aren't working.

mommpil,"Everyone else is talking about speed and I think that's completely missing the point, there are very good reasons to use C++ other than just speed.Here are some things you can do in C++ that you can't do in Python. All of these things you can also do from C. Many of these things you can also do from Rust and other languages that compile to native code, but not all of them.1. Call native operating system APIs directly. If you're on Windows, go to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and explore the tens of thousands of APIs. The ONLY way to call these APIs directly is from a compiled language like C++. If you call them from any other language you're just calling some wrapper function that calls the function from C. That's even true for C#, even today there are some Windows APIs that you can't call from C#. Some specific examples below.2. Memory mapping. Let's say you have a 1 GB file. In C++ you can memory map that to an array of bytes with 1 billion elements. The memory map function returns almost instantly, it doesn't copy the file into RAM. When you access byte 777,000, it doesn't read the previous 700 thousand bytes, it just reads only one small chunk of the file from disk into memory at the moment you access it.3. Shared memory. You can have multiple processes on the same computer that ""share"" a chunk of memory directly. To communicate they don't need to copy huge data structures back and forth if they don't want to.4. Hardware drivers. Using C++ you can write directly to a memory address, or read directly from a memory address. Most hardware peripherals are entirely controlled this way, by communicating via nothing other than accessing special memory addresses plus hardware interrupts to let you know when something changed. On a modern operating system you can only do this if you write a kernel driver, but if you get an embedded development kit you can write bare-metal code that talks to keyboards, sound chips, push buttons, or whatever just using direct memory reads and writes.5. Hooking system functions / injecting code into other processes. For example on Windows, write a DLL that provides an alternate implementation of some common function like ShowWindow, then inject that DLL into some other process so every time they call ShowWindow, it actually calls your function instead.",dmazzoni,2025-04-23 16:00:35,218,learnprogramming,t3_1k5xqyo,False,
molmju8,"A useful resource is Bjarne Stroustrup's site for A Tour of C++: [https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html](https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html)Even if you don't use that book, you can look at his exercises document, which could be used in principle along with ANY C++ learning reference. And if you look through it, you will very quickly find little ""baby projects"" that could be made that are very C++-specific. For example, let's look at the list for concurrency:> \[2\] Write a program with two threads: one that writes ""hello"" every second and one that writes ""world!"" every second.>\[3\] Time a loop. Write out the time in milliseconds. Do this for the default setting of your compiler and for a setting using an optimizer (e.g., −O2 or ""release""). Be careful not to have the optimizer eliminate your whole loop as dead code because you did not use a result.>\[4\] Repeat the histogram drawing example from §5.6.3 for a normal\_distribution and 30 rows.>\[5\] Use a regex to find all decimal numbers in a file. So, on that list, \[2\] and \[3\] \*could\* be done in Python, but they would not make sense. The issues that Mr Stroustrup is trying to teach here (e.g. how concurrency works on the OS or hardware level) is probably best observable in C++. Also for \[3\] this is purely a C/C++ thing. Python turns code into bytecode in a completely different way. I very doubt that Python does loop elimination or anything like that, for example. Also, to properly do all parts of \[3\], you will also need to look at the assembly language output of your code to see what optimizations your compiler is doing (and to really verify whether it is eliminating loops, and under what conditions it does that).Exercises \[4\] and \[5\] probably could be done in any language, of course Python would be an easy language to use for \[5\]. I'm not sure why Stroustrup placed these exercises in the concurrency section. Maybe he mentioned those topics in the same book chapter for some reason.",chaotic_thought,2025-04-23 12:53:27,25,learnprogramming,t3_1k5xqyo,False,

Manually controlling gears, downshifting into a corner, clutch kicking when you want the ass end of your car to slide, and dumping the clutch for a nasty burnout are things you can only do in a stickshift. Similarly, manually allocating heap (and stack) memory, directly accessing processor register information, running online assembly and other features are only possible in systems languages like C and Rust. Most people just want to get to work and back safely which is why most cars these days are automatic. Business software (and jobs) are the exact same.

mo9nlfg,"Hi, Ive got a few trainees under my wings and yours is one of the most common yet somewhat generic questions. Let me throw my opinion.You're asking yourself how a ""programmer"" thinks as in, what's the type of mentality you should be following to produce proper code.But the truth is the code and good coding practices is just one of the many tasks one actualy has to think of about because being a ""programmer"" almost never means _just coding_.The actual job involves a lot of aspects, to name a few potential examples: finding customers, understanding what they need and want, planing resources like time and money, concepting about data transfer, data quality, user experience, security aspects, documenting all of the above... and endless others.You can study all you want, do plenty of tutorials and watch a dozen YouTube videos but without a proper project this all means little, and this is the reason many people fail to find a job or gather experience to begin with.So here is what you should be doing: simulate projects. Find yourself either a friend or family member. Inform yourself about their daily tasks, their interests or hobbys and figure out where there could be need to have an application or automatization process to make their daily routine easier.Or, at last resource _pretend_ that you have a hypothetical customer, take up on different and role-play with yourself (for example, pretend that you're Person ABC, a developer, DEF, a customer, GHI, a project manager, etc, and even send emails to yourself).Now that you have a _reason_ / a project to code, research about all the steps that a project usualy requires from start to finish (GPT can help you if you don't undergo a specific training) and go through all of the steps.Yes, this will triple or quadruple the actual effort rather than just coding, but this is essential for your experience, professionalism, and ensuring you've concepted and properly planned the actual development phases and don't end up stuck in a loop of overcorrecting your implementations, because you also must set yourself time and hypothetical budget deadlines.There is only so much information I can provide here in a few sentences but I hope this helps you understand how a ""programmer"" works. Being ""just"" a programmer doesn't realy exist. You will in most cases be at least a team member, preferably also a Consultant, potentionaly even a project manager or even a freelancer. Grasping all the involved roles and being able to understand their minimum requirements will help you understand what's actualy important.Also, last tip, start very small, with little apps and ""customer expectations"". Stuff that seems easy done and implemented can add a lot of effort and grow the project exponentionaly because each part of the project needs some extra time for that specific aspect to consider.

morawh7,"\> I'll just memorise the syntaxThe reason you're struggling is because memorising has nothing to do with programming. Now programmers do indirectly memorise syntax, but it's only because this is a byproduct of understand the syntax.This would be my suggestion:1. Take an example of some C++ code from the internet.2. Open a text editor and type in the code. Don't copy and paste the code. The typing will help you to remember things.3. Run the code through a compiler making sure it compiles and runs. Understand what the running code is doing.4. Now go back to the editor and write one or more lines of comment for every line code in the file. Tie some of the comments back to the behaviour you saw when you ran the code.5. Now go back to step 1 and repeat this for another dozen or so different examples.Those 12 examples could easily be a day's work, only because you will need to research each and every line of code so that you can write the line of comment for code that makes sense and is accurate. But what you should also find; as you loop through more examples that process of adding a comment get easier; you should also find the typing gets easier and is more accurate.Now if you repeat this for two or three weeks, you'll find your way on the way to being a programmer.And using this approach you can actually measure your progress. If after one week you're still struggling to write a line of comment for each line of code, then you really have not learned much. Over those many examples there will be many common lines of code, meaning the comments will also be common. It is the details found in those comments that you are trying to memorise, not the code.PS: For context, here are some examples typical line comments.

mo0wt9w,git pull requires the existence of a local repository along with a remote origin. It’s used for getting things up to date.git clone is used for setting up a local version of a remote repository for the first time.

mo1iusu,"Ok so in git the command names are stupid and don’t mean what you think they probably should mean. Having a cheat sheet is helpful.So, work with git is done locally in your local folder where you store your source code. When ready, you explicitly send your changes to the master copy on the remote git server. To open a code project (and any of its branches) locally, you need to copy it down to a folder on your local machine. That’s what git clone does. It makes a local copy of a remote repository that you will then work in. You generally use it once when you join a team working on a codebase or if you get a new laptop or something.Once you clone, you get to the second command: checkout. In every other source control system I’ve ever used, checkout means you want to edit something and want to prevent or inform other users of that. In git it means either you want to switch to a certain branch or you want to make a new branch from the current branch. Just remember that. Checkout is for local branch switching and changes nothing in the remote repository.Here are the basic commands for doing local work and explicitly communicating it to the remote master copy:Fetch - I want to update my local list of branches and their history so I can view what my coworkers did and maybe checkout someone else’s branch if needed.Pull - I want to update my current branch with the latest changes from the repo. This may prompt a merge if there are conflicts. You often do this to update your local copy of a main develop branch and rarely the one you’re actually working in.Push - I want to send my committed changes to the repo for other people to use. This may trigger build automation.Stash - I want to preserve select changes in a local side store while rolling back the files for tracking purposes. You do this to preserve a draft for future use.Merge - I want to move changes from my current branch into another (e.g. I’m done with my feature and want to merge it into the main dev branch). This is done locally. You pull dev first. Then commit and push the merge into it. That merge btw, is often done using a process called a pull request which puts a review request in front of the merge.",Far_Swordfish5729,2025-04-20 04:21:38,13,learnprogramming,t3_1k3b27q,False,

You usually don't use classes in Python, but you will need to structure the classes. Think of the Service Class as the class that defines the functions you use in the Application Class. The Application Class is supposed to be the one that is run and will provide the UI and functions that are built on the Service Class. 2. Learn How to Use UML Diagrams. UML Diagrams will be very useful in the long run as they tell you all the functions you need to program with. Here's an example structure: \------------------------------------------------ | Class Name | \------------------------------------------------ | Variables in the Constructor | \------------------------------------------------ | Functions in the Class | \------------------------------------------------3. Think of the Language as Python, but instead of tabs, you use curly braces {}. You also must not forget to add the include for the scanner. The scanner is like the iostream C++ library. It provides functions used to take in input. Make sure to reference the scanner by using Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in); So those are my tips.

mo73clx,"Hello, I am a little late to the party but will chime in here... From a hiring perspective, especially for junior / entry level, \*what\* your project does is almost irrelevant. I do quite enjoy asking candidates \*why\* they worked on this particular problem because hearing about how people have scratched and itch that they have found is usually quite interesting and clue to how they think about the world. However... it's 98% about how they have structured a project and how their code looks. I'm afraid, as an apparently satanic friendly Russian has already pointed out, there is quite a lot of issue with the code itself and this, I feel, probably would work against you. When I am reviewing code I am expecting to see some consideration of 4 groups of people... 1) Your usersI don't mind that there is not a UI, there are plenty of technical, command line utility projects out there, but why are you telling me what I need to call my files? You have a CLI tool, where are my flags and options? Why do I have to accept all your hard coded values like 'chat.txt' and all the thresholds and things? Why can't I configure these on the CLI and experiment with the results? This is a CLI tool for technical users right? Who are they? What are their skills and what might they need? 2) Future developers looking to understand your codeThere are plenty of improvements to be found here. Separating the files, and not doing things like calling regular expression variables 'pattern', which can be clearly seen by the fact that you assign it a.. well... pattern. What pattern? What is it for? You had an opportunity to provide a descriptive name here, and you went for the most 'technically correct, but useless' option. This is a microcosm and applies all over your code. Go through it, and refactor giving consideration to other people who will want to understand what you are doing. 3) Future developers looking to \*extend\* your codeWhere are your hooks? You don't have to have a network accessible API but where are the places in your code that future developers might hook into to provide additional or improved functionality? I'd like to see that you have thought about where things might go next and left the code in such a way that somebody other than you might pick that up and run with it. 4) The reviewer This, in some sense is an extension of number 2, but if you are submitting your code for review for job applications you want to be applying number 2 here to a more elevated degree than you even might in other projects. I don't see a single comment in your codebase. Comments are a bit out of a fashion on some professional codebases right now because people have the (correct and noble) goal of writing 'self-documenting code'. Few who attempt this can do it effectively honestly and you definitely can't right now (not a dig, this might be the hardest coding skill to actually learn and takes many years). Without self-documenting code, you need to be documenting with comments. As a reviewer I don't have a huge amount of time to spend on each application (especially at junior where there are, these days, potentially hundreds), so if I don't 'get' your code within a few minutes, I will probably put your application into the 'maybe' pile to come back to if other applications are not better. I need to return to the 'maybe' pile for an applicant perhaps 5% of the time... because there is usually something better. Your energy and drive is great, and you have picked a problem and solved it. Really good for you and don't be disheartened. Many, most, juniors have \*nothing\* to submit, you just now need to take what you have done and think about the 4 groups I mention and consider their needs and interests and you will have something very valuable to put on your resume.

mo836k8,"This would absolutely contribute to proof it's worth giving you an interview for junior data analysis type roles. The larger companies will not analyze this, but instead put you through competence tests that they themselves devise, so I disagree with the reasoning behind some of the other comments here. The projects on your CV at your level are to demonstrate domain interest and active learning.For higher level roles, your current project would not count as a large project that holds the same weight as an employment entry on your CV. The closer your project is to a product then the more likely you would be to gain/pass a product-centred interview stage(s). It's perfectly fine to gain product development experience primarily through employment though. So you should really be focusing on being valuable over pretending you are a highly experienced product developer.From here, in my opinion, you've got two options to continue your active learning - develop this project into something closer to a product, or begin a new project that fits a target domain. The point being, don't spend time upgrading this project at the expense of genuine interest, by for example; appending unit tests onto it. If you want to genuinely learn about test-driven development then begin a new project.

Make it more interactive or add shortcuts to get there faster.)* Try writing the tests first. * Then try mutation testing.

Stick to one style, or write your own.

While they get recommended to beginners, most experienced programmers use them as it allows you to do many complex things in a few lines of code at the cost of reduced performance and greater overhead. Python has more complex syntax as it allows you to do more complex things, which is why it’s used in machine learning.Lua has a simpler syntax as it’s expected for the developers to create a well defined API for it, which is why it’s mainly used as an interface for programs such as neovim and Roblox. This makes sense in the context of its history as it was mainly developed for clients who were engineers, not programmers, to interact with provided software.That’s why trying to rank them by how “easy” they are is a bit superficial, as the point is that they try to accomplish different things.",InsertaGoodName,2025-04-22 23:22:34,65,learnprogramming,t3_1k5kb0r,False,

Python has built in docstrings, `help()`, `dir()`, `breakpoint()`, an `inspect` module, and fairly standardized reprs so you can tell what you're working with in the REPL, and standard ways of doing that for your own code. Lua doesn't even have a built-in way to print a table out; you have to loop over it yourself.

This includes goddamn function arguments- despite arrays not really existing, there is still a length operator- indices starting at 1 ... but ofc. since arrays and maps, sorry *""tables""* are the same thing you can still *assign* to `tablename[0]`- another consequence of this absurdness is this completely valid assignment: ´arr[-42] = ""oh uh""`- tables are also conflated with objects: `t[""name""]` and `t.name` both work the same. Not even Python is that stupid.- without `local`, assignments default to the nearest var of the same name. If there isn't one, they default to global. Meaning, accidentially generating or overwriting global state is really easy. Combine that with the silent nil-derefing, and you see why debugging Lua feels about as good as a papercut.- only the last arg to functions works as a vararg, but you can still put a vararg before the last...and silently get everything but the first argument dropped- general syntactic idiocy: the `:` pseudo-accessor, the `..` operator, the `#` operator. The lang has `not` as a boolean operator, but somehow `~=` (not-equal) is a thing. The `end` keyword to end blocks with. We an exponential operator `^` but no increment/decrement operators- metatables, aka. what happens when someone thinks: *""Hey, how about we take the worst ideas from prototyping and class based OOP, and mush them together by shoehorning them into the only data structure we cared to build into our pseudo language!""*- Since there aren't really objects (everything is a table), you can actually call an ""object"" method passing a different object as `self`- `break` exists, but `continue` does not- strings assume the unicode table ends at 255, therefore, strings are really byte arrays. meaning, handling unicode requires libs- despite tables being the only datastructure, there is no built-in way to copy a table- despite having pseudo-exceptions (`error()` and `pcall`), tons of built ins refuse to use them, returning `nil` instead",Big_Combination9890,2025-04-23 00:18:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k5kb0r,False,

They can “reason” but they can only hold so much context. While humans can do this almost indefinitely and switch contexts at will without having to be instructed. That’s what makes humans so adaptable. We can kind of change our brains instantaneously to solve a problem. We can come up with solutions on the fly while LLMs are essentially just looking up the answers to things stored in a database quickly and telling you what it thinks you want to hear. Human best guesses with little information even when we’re off the mark often put us closer to the answers we’re looking for.

mofa23w,"At their core, APIs are just the public side of some service. So, when you call \`my\_dict.items()\`, you're just using the 'items' method of the dictionary API for that particular dictionary.There really isn't anything special to learn about APIs; they're just a set of calls that are permitted to use from the outside of your codebase. if we're talking about some web service, then theres some authentication to do as well, but thats not particularly special; if you can authenticate users, you can auth (a subset of) users for this purpose.The 'I' is the operating term: Interface. If you understand that concept, you pretty much know all that you need to to make an Application Programmer's Interface. You could take a read into Interfaces in Java, for example, to get a better sense. (Not all languages have explicit Interface constructs, but the concept still exists: a set of abstract calls that do something specific that can be used without any specification on how they are implemented (a black box)).",rinio,2025-04-22 13:02:14,2,learnprogramming,t3_1k55eqj,False,
mogevaw,"POV: I've taught CS for many years, including general programming and APIs.APIs are a specific style of data transfer, which is a variation of input and output. So what you're wanting to learn is a particular style of programming. That's a good goal, but you need to learn general programming concepts before you can comprehend a specific subset of coding. There are two distinct ways of thinking about APIs, and both depend on some knowledge of core programming ideas. First, you can write a program in any language that *consumes* an API. That is, you can write a program that uses an API to find the current weather in Barbados. This is a relatively straightforward process in most languages, but typically you learn this after you've learned more fundamental things, like how to get information from the user or from local files, how to handle looping and branching, and how to write functions.The other way to think about APIs is to *produce* an API. In that sense, you are writing a program that lives on some type of server that produces data in some kind of machine-readable format (usually JSON, but other formats are certainly viable). This is also not a difficult process, but it requires knowledge of essential programming concepts, and typically you'll also want to write a front-end package to test your API. I would say start with any good programming course. There's a good reason Python is taught as a first language in most CS courses. It's reasonably straightforward, and is excellent for a number of use cases, including working with APIs. You can read and create APIs with Python out of the box, but for creating an API, you'd probably be better off using a library like flask, bottle, or rapidAPI. I would definitely learn standard programming ideas first before digging into libraries. Express.js is fine, but it's a specialized form of JavaScript that doesn't make any sense if you don't already know how to program in vanilla JS. It seems to me that CodeAcademy has a more organized curriculum. It doesn't go straight into using APIs, but that is fine. If you can't drive yet, race cars don't matter. Learn to program in a language, then we can focus on the particular skills you want. FreeCodeCamp is great for looking up a specific skill, but it often makes a lot of assumptions about what you already know.

This massively increases adoption and helps you get grants and sponsorships \- Build it for you first; everyone else comes second otherwise you lose grasp of the visionBasically:\- No one will use it if the documentation sucks or if the github looks dead \- Integrating with other tools is the fastest way to grow since you are tapping into existing userbases \- During downtime or if you get writers block, use your framework as a content creation engine...this gets you views and also helps you apply for grants etcAs for resources:\- Look up ""Commercial Open Source Software"", even if the point isn't to make money it helps you understand how big frameworks gain momentum \- Keep an eye out for fellowships and foundations, eg I received over $15k in grants from Processing Fellowship alone by integrating with p5.js and three.js",qrxer,2025-04-23 15:43:26,4,learnprogramming,t3_1k61676,False,

For 99.X% of general purpose applications, the hardware is super super fast and you don't care that much about precision.

That [1.XXX](http://1.XXX) fraction is the ""mantissa"" and the power of two is the ""exponent"". The number of bits in the mantissa gives you your precision. It's very precise near zero, and it gets a lot less precise for really big numbers. You can simulate any arbitrary precision you want in software though by just storing all the mantissa bits and simulating the floating point operations with fixed point.Another interesting bit is that for machine learning, they do care a lot about the buildup of errors from layers and layers of floating point.

So no software engineering formal training.There are two, maybe three, skills from math that will be very useful.a) reading, specially maths.Definition, theorem and proof. This translates into software as declaration/definition, function and test, respectively. If you leant to make math proofs, you will be able to stress code in many ways.b) the important part of math is logic and language, not the numbers.If you know that logic has a sense like the following two logic relations:If A then B, A -> B ; andif Not(B) then Not(A), A <- B.You will be set apartThere are engineers that write very wrong the ifs in code :( do not be one of themc) when writing numerical math, you first learn the abstract concepts then you implement.Most junior and mid engineers do the opposite, they say first yes then they try to learn while doing, it is a very slow process.So if you like to read maths and you understand them, you have an upper hand in this industry. For reading you will only need time, you read, learn, write your notes and when you are in front of the computer you write your code :)If you pay attention to the industry, they are saying nowadays, that one writes code in a very mathematical approach, otherwise it doesn’t scale. It is because of this. We didn’t need this 3 decades ago.Now code doesnt scale up without this logic, just try to scale when the if then rule is inverted.For a book, numerical linear algebra form trefethen and bau; also the art of proof from Beck and Geoghegab.If you need examples or more help or specific questions, I can always help.

mokosj2,"Python is a good start and is enough to understand programming concepts.To be completely fair, the most important concepts you need to learn have nothing to do with actual programming or languages. Those are your foundations - Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Databases. There’s a very good reason most universities focus on theory for the first two years of a CS degree, and not so much on coding. Learning these will make you understand programming as a whole. After that, any language will be equally valuable to you.To answer the question. I’d say, after learning Python well, you can either go useful, frontend or lower level (well every other language is lower level but that’s not the point).If you want to find a job as quickly as possible, learn Java or C#. Those languages are by far the most used in the industry and there’s never lack in demand (keep in mind that there is also a lot of supply). If you choose this option, you have to know that you’ll also most definitely need to learn their respective web frameworks - Spring and .NET, as they are pretty much required by the job market. This is a very good path to take and I can highly recommend it. Also, keep in mind that there’s a very good chance you circle around to Java/C#, even if you choose a different path now, since these are one of the most essential languages and are taught and used everywhere.Another popular route is to master JavaScript and become a capable full-stack developer. That’s also where React comes in. React is a JavaScript framework used for simplifying the way to build responsive web interfaces. I think there will be time in the future to worry about frontend, so I wouldn’t choose learning JavaScript at your current stage.Finally, the lower level route. I personally encourage any beginner to go deep into the land of pointers because you gain soo much more understanding of the way a computer works, than you do by using Python or JavaScript. For this I recommend you go with either C or C++ (personally, I’d go with C). These languages are what we call “lower level” because they don’t have fancy built in features to simplify the hard stuff and you have to think a lot more about everything. Those languages have no “garbage collection” meaning you need to allocate your own memory, and you need to free it when you don’t use it anymore. They use pointers to reference the data you use. C has no Object Oriented Programming, meaning you can only encapsulated data using a “struct”, and you can’t have methods tied to that data (procedural programming).",todorpopov,2025-04-23 08:04:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1k5s9wt,False,

momk8j9,"Big O, `O()`, is an **abstraction** to help us _estimate_ algorithm complexity, performance, and scalability. * In _theory_ there is no difference between theory and implementation. * In _implementation_ there can be a HUGE difference.Like all abstractions the devil is in the (implementation) details.The reason we DO count instruction cycles when profiling is because it gives us an absolute time that we can use to compare against. We can compare:* _actual_ **run-time** time versus the* _expected_ **theoretical** best case. That is, we can do A vs B comparisons such as A is `X%` faster or `Y%` slower to answer the question: _Is our optimization helping, hindering, or neither?_But oftentimes we want to know HOW an algorithm scales up relative to input size. `O()` is an _estimate_ of this which may, or may NOT, be accurate:If we have three algorithms that all perform the same task and have this scaling ... * O( n )* O( n^K )* O( K^n )... then the linear `O( n )` algorithm is probably going to be the fastest, by far, all things considered.However `O()` IGNORES RAM speed, RAMaccess patterns, and branch prediction -- all which MAY be factors!The _reason_ this was done was that pre-2000's CPU speed and RAM speed roughly had a 1:1 mapping. We used to store calculations in tables because the computation speed was SO slow.However by the 2000's CPU speeds became significantly faster than RAM. As CPU speeds increased and RAM didn't (as much) it became faster to calculate more, lookup less.Unfortunately Computer Science textbooks never got the memo that `O()` has COMPLETELY failed to adapt to the changing hardware and performance uplifts of modern systems. **It is an INCOMPLETE metric.**Let's take a [simple example](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/cache_line_speed) of summing up entries in an array. sum = 0; for( int col = 0; col < STRIDE; col++ ) for( int row = 0; row < SIZE; row += col ) sum = data[ row + col ];_Normally_ stride is 1, sequential acess, but what if it isn't?We can change the stride to show HOW we access data (and the data cache) plays more and more of a role the larger the data set.For example with an array of 2^30 elements (1,073,741,824) we see this falloff:| Stride | Op/s | Time ||--:|--:|--:|| 1 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 2 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 4 | 733 M/s | 00:00:01s || 8 | 388 M/s | 00:00:02s || 16 | 213 M/s | 00:00:04s || 32 | 141 M/s | 00:00:07s || 64| 116 M/s | 00:00:08s || 128 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 256 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 512 | 100 M/s | 00:00:10s | | 1024 | 66 M/s | 00:00:15s |EXACT same O(n) but HUGE differences in the Real World^TM.HOW we access this array matters! This is why ... * AoS (Array of Structs) and * SoA (Struct or Arrays) ... can have such a HUGE difference even though we are iterating over the _same_ data. **All those cache misses add up to slower performance.** This demonstrating O() IS incomplete for modern algorithms.In modern performance programming, often times we want a _branchless algorithm_ as we are _trading latency for throughput._ We want to keep the CPU pipeline saturated with work and not cause pipeline bubbles or flushes via branching.There are 3 categories of optimizations from slowest to fastest:1. **Micro-optimization** or [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html). On older compilers and slower CPUs you would replace `MOD` with `AND` for powers of two, division with multiplication and bit shifts. i.e. Calculating `7*n` as `n + 2*n + 4*n` -- assuming your CPU even has a `MUL` instruction!2. **Algorithm.** Using a faster algorithm used to be the second step in optimization . We would use `O()` as a guideline for performance/scalability.3. **Macro-optimization** or Cache-Oriented aka Data-Oriented Design (DOD). As we deal with larger data sets optimizing for _minimizing cache misses_ becomes more important.See [CppCon 2019: Matt Godbolt “Path Tracing Three Ways: A Study of C++ Style”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6c4Kwbv4I) where OOP, FP, and DOD is compared.",mysticreddit,2025-04-23 15:48:41,5,learnprogramming,t3_1k5y2ma,False,

mo73cm8,"To most computer science guys, there are 3 language levels. There are more if you get into a big thesis level discussion with theorists and such, but your average coder probably thinks in terms of 3. Those are the machine's actual language: ones and zeros, the computer is wired electrically such that circuits have power or not, if they have power its a 1, if not its a zero, and these 1s and 0s represent actions and data. The next level are low level languages, which humans can work with but are extremely tedious. Most of the low level languages are considered ""assembly"" languages and that looks something like move data from memory to a cpu register, perform an action on it, and move the result back to memory, possibly with other things like jump to a different next instruction if that result was not zero. Its explicit, step by step telling the cpu what to do. High level languages are the third, and those gloss over the tiresome details by providing a way to express a bunch of those tedious actions in a simple, natural way. Instead of moving memory to a register and a result to memory, you can just say x= a+b or something akin to that. In all cases, the code you write is rendered to machine language eventually. Machine language is what you think of as a 'binary' or 'executable' program file -- you can look at those with a hex editor if you know what it means, but its largely gibberish if you are not an expert at dealing with machine language. Assembly is almost, but not quite, one to one conversion to machine language. High level code has two major approaches, compiled (turned into an executable file, a runnable program) and interpreted (turned into an executable program in memory instead of into a file on the disk, which is executed and discarded, but can be modified on the fly to some extent as it is running, and observed as it is running).

So my question was two fold: what is the information that a program is? from another comment, I now know the terms ""source code"", and what that information is in the computer's 1's and 0's distinct from post compilation (machine code). I ask this, because I wanted to see what the actual process it is I am doing is here. Plus, because I don't know what it is I am not knowing, this is an active attempt to organize my information into a conceptual synthesis, which is hearable in how rambly this is (I am self aware). With that, I didn't know what a developer environment is, with CLI, what commands actually are, and how this integrates across the file system of the computer, so when I get told by VS Code that something didn't work, well that's just that, because I didn't know what a command even is in terms of what's happening in the computer when I tell power shell something.

We can prototype an RPG or FPS game really fast in Unreal or Godot, but not a TCG.Those are the ""problems"" I have, so I personally would love an engine for that.

Creating your own 3D engine IS NOT A WASTE OF TIME WHATSOEVER!!!! You will learn so much and have so much problem solving and understanding core mechanics of engines. Many game companies build their own engines such as ROCK STAR.

The overall look and feel are on point. The way you’ve implemented functionalities, like task clearing intervals, is really smooth, and the light/dark mode toggle works flawlessly. Seriously, great work—I'm genuinely impressed!Now, just sharing some feedback and more of the approach I usually take:Once the design is finalized and everything’s working as expected, I like to take a step back and imagine I’m just a user—not the creator. I try to look at it from a fresh perspective and ask myself: *What could I do differently? What can I learn from this?*So, doing that here—on the initial “The Toh Do!” screen, I noticed the white space is quite prominent. The left side is dedicated to a vector graphic, while the right side houses the task list. If it were me, I might consider removing the vector and instead using that space for something functional—like a dashboard or a timer countdown panel, which could add value and balance out the layout.One cool thing I picked up from your code was the use of Redux Persist. I’ve typically just used localStorage directly, but seeing how you’ve integrated Redux Persist has definitely piqued my interest.

If you edit them from that point, you can see how they changed from the time they were committed with `git diff`, or you can revert them to how they were with `git checkout $FILENAME`.The point is, you don't need the Testing subfolder any more. You can safely modify the files in situ. More importantly still, you can back-up the repository to a remote host like GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted solution.I don't know if it's game changing, but I really like Fish for its programming language.

I don't actually use it for that because I rely on some old-school features it doesn't support, and I'm too set in my ways to ditch them.However, it also has a scripting language that I find much more intuitive and consistent than Bash or Sh (which is what most people use for shell scripting on UNIX systems).

mon7ldu,"Then you can just run them from the command line as regular commands. Otherwise you have to prefix them with their directory name (e.g. having to run `./my-app` rather than `my-app`).But it's just the directory you add to PATH.So for example, if I have a bunch of scripts in `~/projects` that I'm working on, I can copy them to `~/.local/bin` if I want to use them like regular commands. So if I want to change my monitor resolution, rather than typing `projects/displayresolution` at the terminal, I can just type `displayresolution` to run the command. But I can only do that if I copy the command to `~/.local/bin` first, because that directory is in my PATH.Now if I want to modify `displayresolution` for some reason, I can make the changes in the ~/projects dir, as usual; test them by running `~/projects/displayresolution`; and then copy (install) the script to ~/.local/bin when I'm happy it's stable.By the way, in the distant past, you used to be able to run a script from any directory just by typing its name at the prompt (so long as you were in that directory); but it was discovered that nefarious actors could copy a malicious script with the same name as a commonly run system command (like `ls`) to your $HOME directory (or wherever), and then, the next time you ran `ls` from your home directory, you'd run the nefarious script rather than list your directories; so they introduced the requirement that any command in a directory that doesn't belong to $PATH must be prefixed with its directory name (e.g. `./ls`).

And I had to put together an entire deck for my boss to tell the board what our ML strategy was. The point is, you couldn't get left behind. Even though the ROI was trash, you had to throw money at it. Most companies had no idea what they were gonna get out of it.And I feel like at some point, that broke. I think Twitter under Elon opened the floodgates - he went the opposite way (let's get rid of bloat) and to a degree it allowed every company to reset. And sure enough, every company immediately took that as an opportunity to pivot into cost savings mode - even though most of these companies are still doing great financially.So when will the job market improve?One answer is when the overall economy starts doing better.

People like FAANG because it once you’re in, you have high pay and a well defined trajectory, and you get sheltered from what it means to have a business succeed. The average Google engineer isn’t going to worry about budget, competitors, head count, etc. That’s not normal, because businesses are in constant competition and don’t have unlimited money like Apple, Google, or Meta. You can find jobs at other companies that pay quite well and these companies don’t have LeetCode interviews. Go on Blind or Glassdoor to find these. In theory nothing is wrong with LeetCode. But it’s because the questions you get are random when you interview. It would be more fair if it was like: “you’ll get one tree problem, one sorting problem, and one path finding problem”. But that’s not the case, you can be given literally any problem and be expected to solve it. A very stupid test simply meant to fail most candidates, because you’re expected to know literally every algorithm and data structure. The study has 0 application to your actual job, unless you are studying for some hardcore algorithms or low latency engineer. In which case you’d be told ahead of time which algorithms they expect you to know, etc. Now we have Cursor and other AI IDEs too, these skills are less and less needed.I get contacted by Google and Meta recruiters regularly.

mojbqka,"Outsourcing to India sucks from the US for a reason that's entirely unrelated to racism: Time zones.Collaboration sucks. Needing to ask questions during the work day is impossible. The number of times I've seen a team work for eight hours on the wrong task, or a solution that's completely unviable, is nearly equal to the number of days I've worked with Indian engineers.And there's another reason that outsourcing to India sucks: The best developers in India don't want to work under those conditions, and they don't work for $20/hour or whatever you're paying your outsourcing team members. I'm told that many of the junior developers who get hired by outsourcing companies are making $10/day, and it's blatantly obvious that they do just enough work to keep the contact live for as long as possible. None of this is even remotely racism. Put a billion people in an area that has insufficient employment opportunities and you'll find millions who are willing to learn just enough software development to be able to do a crap job in outsourcing as part of a scam to extract money from richer countries. It's human nature. It has nothing to do with their culture or the color of their skin or their accent (though extra strong accents can impede communication, and that's a real problem).Not only that, but scammers running consulting companies run them in the US as well. Several of such companies are well known as defense contractors. Remember the debacle of the Obamacare web site that had something like 50 different consulting companies working on various parts? I'd have a hard time assigning that work to fifty people much less fifty teams. And the result was a disaster.That said, at the low end of developer skill? It may very well be permanent. For the last 30 years it's been bad for lower skill developers more often than it's been good. Higher skill developers are still doing OK even now, at least if we're willing to accept lower salaries. So the question to ask yourself is what your relative skill level is. If you have always been in the bottom of your class or the slowest employee wherever you have worked, it might be best to try for a pivot.(Edits: Fixed auto complete fails)",TimMensch,2025-04-23 01:38:40,189,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5mwwc,False,

India has plenty of amazing engineers, but those engineers are actually getting their money's worth and companies won't be saving by going with them as much as the other picks.The cheaper ones that are tantalizing to companies consist of higher amounts of self-taught and bootcamp coders. They are incentivized to focus on passing the interview rather than long-term transferable skills. I'm sure some of them are good enough for the position, but that isn't always the case.With AI and vibe coding, it's never been easier for mediocre developers to pose as a higher skilled one, especially when you only work remotely. Once the companies start to smell the shit pilings of AI generated code as it starts to cost them in maintenance, we might see a recovery.

mojn42z,"I dont think this is permanent. Tbh, i may be optimistic but look throughout history. It always takes a few years to fully recover. The 2008 crash we probably didnt fully recover until like 2012 or so. The argument i always make (and i have little actual numbers or data) is that covid made everything ridiculously high. Government was giving out money like candy to any independent worker or business. People were getting money that they didnt deserve to get (some did need it). I didnt deserve a stimulus check tbh, and i got one. In 2020 everybody stayed put to their jobs because they didnt know how the future would look like so it was best to stay put. Then things open up in 2021, companies all have the money to use for hiring so companies of all shapes and sizes ar hiring. Jobs become remote and it looks like remote is the future. But what i think happened was that companies didnt realize how hard it was to hire remote workers and have them quickly learn their codebases. Jr engineers didnt have any camaraderie with their older engineers. Then the free money is gone, people arent spending as much as they did in the high time of covid, and many projects get acwd because small companies can no longer keep up after the government help ended. Bigger companies realize that they can either get a similar engineer for less money or that they overhired in 2021-22 and can fire PIPd employees quicker without having to give severance. Companies have still paused hiring for some time and because of that many people have stayed without a job. I also think potential candidates are too in love with the idea of remote work that anything less than that they are avoiding. But i applied to many jobs and sooke with many recruiters.

mouus6m,"Just a similar anecdote, in late 2023 / early 2024 my previous employer implemented some really fancy AI tool that would scrape jira, github, etc to allow management to analyze how much time was being spent on various features, vs prod support, vs etc.It was emphasized very strongly, and very frequently, by management that this tool would absolutely not be used for performance tracking of an individual, and was only going to be used at the team/department level for aggregate stats. Even though the tool absolutely was tracking stats at the individual-level, they just said they weren't gonna use it.Everyone knew they were gonna use it. We're not stupid.That company used to have an amazing WLB, and then there were a couple C-suite changes and a bunch of upper management changes and not long after those changes this tool was introduced, and the culture went to shit.I found another job by mid-2024.It's nothing inherently wrong with my previous company, or with Microsoft. It's just a culture shift. They went from chill, to micromanagey-PIP-culture. Different strokes, I'm not gonna demand they keep a culture that I like.I always say culture shifts are the *only* inevitable thing in this industry. It's why I recommend if you're at a good employer, you hold onto that employer for as long as they stay good. They *will* change at some point, so cash in while you can. Then when they change, you jump ship, and your salary gets re-adjusted to market rate.I found another company with a great culture/WLB in 2024, and it's still great now. I'm praying it stays good for the long-run. If the culture/WLB stays like it is now I will happily stay here the rest of my career.

mo7o0lh,"It's pretty common in all forms of Comp Sci IMO. I think Game Dev has such a bad rep because its seen from the outside as a ""Fun"" coding job. There's a lot of people willing to take a pay cut, or work longer hours to be part of something they are passionate about. So people get into it thinking it's going to be a fun job. Then the reality hits - a lot of the time, you might be on a huge team, just working on a very small part of a game without a lot of say in how the game is put together. It becomes the kind of work you'd do anywhere else, it just gets plugged into a game at the end. Ultimately, I think the gaming industry is kind of past it's prime. There was a time when a team of 1-10 people could build a ground breaking AAA game. Rollercoaster Tycoon was built by one dude, for instance. Now, AAA games are made by teams of 100+ people. But the games don't cost 10-100 times more just because they required an investment of 10-100x what they used to. Game Studios are much less likely to take risks, it's just like games like ""Call of Duty 153, Ultra Future War"" or whatever, there's not as much innovation which I think is why a lot of people are drawn to the work. So people who love gaming get into the industry. They are smart enough to make 50-100% more doing any other corporate job, but the game companies know they can get top talent for a fraction of the price, and in fact, need to, because of how expensive development has gotten. Then they work there for a while, and find that while the work and team structure is similar to any other corporate job, they are being under paid/over worked, while their peers who went to work at some boring fortune 500 company are walking out the doors after 40-50 hour weeks, making more money, enjoying other things in life.

You also need to know when it's time to jump ship.If you want a stable 9-to-5 where you can plan your life, startup life unfortunately isn't it.If you want to stay at the startup, you need to create boundaries and enforce them else that startup will consume your life and your health. If your boundaries clash with the company, it may be time to move on. Your health is going to be important to you long after the company goes out of business or gets bought by another company.Every startup is 6 months from shutting down. You are one heartbeat away from dying every moment of every day. As long as your heart keeps beating, you're alive to wait for the next beat, and life goes on. It's the same way for startups. Instead of heartbeats, it's customers and funding rounds.Don't let the startup drama sink you. In the end, it's just a job. We want it to be a lot more than that, but at its core, it's a way for us to pay our bills and hopefully more our careers forward.",midnitewarrior,2025-04-21 17:48:57,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1k4izk8,False,

mo89bff,"My 2 cents from the perspective of a manager - this has the markings of management failure. It sounds like your team isn't taking ownership and that they are happy being dependent on you. It could be that you just didn't hire strong candidates, or it could be that something in the company or team dynamics isn't helping people flourish. It sounds like you are pushing to upskill others, rather than others being the driver of their own growth. This means management needs to get to work. It's their responsibility to create a healthy team dynamic, where everyone is pushing to be better every day, actively trying to upskill themselves. But fixing this situation isn't your job - it's the job of management. So my question for you: what is management doing about this? Do they see the same issues? Do they have a plan? Do you have confidence in their plan? If the answer to the questions above is ""no"" then I'd start looking around for other opportunities, because the situation is likely to persist until some crisis happens that forces management's hand.",apeinalabcoat,2025-04-21 09:17:03,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1k445wa,False,

The one and only thing you should use them for is to help you formulate questions to ask during the reverse interview process, and so you know what you keep an eye out for. Then based on the reverse interview you need to form *your own* opinion on if the company sounds like it has any of those negative traits you read about.The obvious reason why you shouldn't take those reviews as truth is they're often by disgruntled employees, or employees pressured into leaving good reviews by HR while they're working there. Neither end of that spectrum is reliable. Rarely does a content employee just think unprompted to themselves ""You know what would be fun? Let's go write a fair, unbiased review about my very average employer!""But beyond that, companies change over time. A review that was accurate even last month, might not be accurate today. All it takes is a single change in management, and a team's culture can shift literally overnight. So just because someone said they worked long hours, doesn't mean people are still working long hours. The reverse is also true, just because someone said the WLB is great, doesn't mean it's still great.Teams within companies also vary drastically. Even at small companies. I worked for a startup once that had \~30 engineers, spread across a few teams. The team I worked on was super laid back, modern stack, essentially no red tape so we moved very quickly, etc. Even pre-pandemic, we'd only come into the office once or twice a week, and nobody was watching us so sometimes we'd just WFH all 5 days and it wasn't a big deal because we got results. But another team was the polar opposite of us. Their stack was older, they had a *ton* of red tape, they moved very slowly, produced very little, and they were straight up told by the CTO that they need to be in the office strictly 3 days a week because they needed to get their shit together.So if you read a bad review about Team A, it doesn't mean Team B will share those traits. You need to talk to *your* hiring manager about *your* future-team to figure out what that team is like.The startup I mentioned earlier had a fair amount of negative reviews on Glassdoor talking about nepotism, and it being a boys club, and that if you're not buddy buddy with the CEO you'll never have any career growth. When I interviewed with my hiring manager and the CTO I didn't get those vibes at all. The culture seemed amazing, which is why I decided to ignore those reviews and join them. Lo and behold, the culture was great. I was absolutely *not* buddy buddy with the CEO, or anyone for that matter, and my career skyrocketed at that place. I've gotten the biggest raises I've ever seen there. It was a great place to work. The person complaining about nepotism probably just sucked at their job and got fired, and decided it'd be an easier pill to swallow to blame nepotism instead of themselves. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",SouredRamen,2025-04-18 17:29:57,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1k2a7a2,False,

On that last point, it really drives me crazy, but when you have managers/stakeholders in the room, you need to speak to them with a language they understand, about concerns they care about, and at a granularity level that matters to them.I have one guy on my team, great developer, who spec'd out an EPIC level feature set, and wanted to present that to a manager. The only problem with his presentation is that it was way to granular, and talked about tickets in progress, focusing on the details of the how, and not the what/why. That's going to confuse the shit out of any manager whose trying to make sure the high level plan of the team is aligned to what they believe should get done.That's one thing, another is example is someone on my team shipping a feature without good product rationale, like the feature was just sort of garbage and we couldn't tell either way, and not backing down or and providing weak evidence that the feature was useful. What they said was basically: ""since we don't have data it's not good, we should keep it released and just observe"".

You don't just consider it black box you can't peer inside and must take as a given. And you don't do this because you love it, but because you recognize this is part of your job.When you're more experienced this gets easier because you have a larger body of knowledge to fall back on. It's most painful when you're new, and to be honest a lot of people never get over the hump. This is because it's possible to get by for a while without this curiosity at lower levels. You have to actually choose to put in more work than you necessarily have to at some point.However you reach limits of what you can do without it because at a certain point your job is no longer about doing well defined widget-adjusting tasks, and furthermore this comes more suddenly than you'd think.Most of the times I've seen people flame out in this industry is because they precisely fell into this trap. They got comfortable doing simple things at lower level that didn't require curiosity and ended up digging themselves into a point where it was either psychologically or practically impossible to get up to being a ""grown up"" eng in the timeframe they needed to, because so much of what they were doing was just learning to invoke what may as well have been magic spells by rote.",OkCluejay172,2025-04-22 20:25:53,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5dvrp,False,

Nobody's policing where the line actually is, and yes, frontend SWE is a thing that people hire for.Personally, I find the labeling thing a bit silly given that the tone is usually along the lines of ""you can't call yourself X because you can't do [insert hard thing] (and I am better than you because I can)"", but that makes no sense because junior SWE who don't know how to do [most hard things] obviously exist and are, well, SWEs.",lhorie,2025-04-22 19:43:03,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5dvrp,False,

mnt1zac,"They shouldhabe salary bands—if they’re smart.As for the amount, it depends. Some companies apply a flat percentage for promotions; companies I’ve worked at, for example, used a flat 10%.Other companies have set salary ranges and will use comp ratios to determine the increase. They also consider your current compensation. Generally, managers and the comp/HR team aim to bring employees close to a 1.0 comp ratio. For high performers, they may go higher. However, some managers or comp/HR folks might think that bringing someone straight to a 1.0 is too large of a bump, so they might offer a lower comp ratio instead. They may also feel a candidate needs ramp-up time or isn’t fully qualified, which can also justify a lower comp ratio—though there’s usually a floor, such as 0.9.Comp ratio, short for comparative ratio, is a measure used in compensation management to compare an employee’s current salary to the midpoint of a given salary range for their position. It’s calculated by dividing the employee’s salary by the midpoint of the range and is usually expressed as a percentage. A comp ratio of 100% means the employee is paid exactly at the market or target rate. Below 100% may indicate they’re underpaid relative to the range, while above 100% suggests they’re paid more than the midpoint—possibly due to experience, tenure, or performance.

I am certainly not competitive enough to land a FAANG job. I’m also aware that entry-level jobs are extremely competitive. I’m worried that without an internship/job offer before graduation, I won’t be considered for these positions either.Starting in IT seems to be discouraged nowadays as it can “trap” people, or it can be a blemish on a resume if transitioning to development. I don’t see much talk about people attaining CS degrees with the intention of getting into IT. I wish I could more clearly express my thoughts, but I’m basically asking if I can take time to up-skill after graduation while working in IT and still be considered for a dev job in the future, or if getting into IT is a death sentence.",EstrangingResonance,2025-04-22 15:42:40,4,cscareerquestions,t1_mog1gwv,True,

One hired an ex-FAANG recruiter who was a resume writer but basically they both filled in their linkedins and got premium and connected with as many recruiters as they could to start the process, sent some cold messages.

So I'm not saying that you don't get call backs from cold applications and you're doing the right thing with applying as soon as possible, but I think your geographic region matters a lot too. A lot of it is just luck. The numbers are insane. We're into a new presidency and past Q1 2025 so things might be looking different in terms of effective advice compared to even 2023 - 2024 which were both brutal for the SWE market. While you do cold applications, polish your LinkedIn profile, increase you SEO with recruiters. You don't need to pay anyone for that, I think the various job search subreddits have a lot of LinkedIn tips all for free. You just need to pay for LinkedIn Premium. I'm averaging 1/100 ratio of applications to call backs as a data engineering applicant with 2 YOE of direct DE experience, though on prem and I'm working with a huge gap of almost 18 months. I only use cover letters on applications to startups on Wellfound or YComb jobs. Otherwise I've just been submitting without a coverletter following the advice posted on r/EngineeringResumes for working on my resume using their wiki and template. I've applied to around 400 jobs, almost all of them directly through the HR portals of the company but a few through easy apply because I saw someone on reddit say it worked for them, totally by chance. I've applied for mostly on site or hybrid positions in most of the major geographic regions of the US. I've had recruiters reach out on linkedin, after I changed my LinkedIn seeing their success. 2 actually, for contract work but better than nothing and if my shitty profile can get it then there's hope for others with even some experience. Also not to shill for a service but to really maximize the cold applications I used hiring cafe because the Job Title + multiple Geo region search was a bigger time saver compared to LinkedIn and just opening all the jobs in new tabs and working through each one, one by one.

You do need to be VERY familiar with the programming languages you choose, especially various optimisation techniques.

There aren’t a ton of jobs available, but candidates who have mastered the topics above stand out.

Same for the bad experiences.I'm quite picky with the ones I speak to these days anyways so there aren't many to keep track of.

mo9atgx,"I have a recruiter ""shit list"" made up of all the recruiters I have caught in lies.The top 3 are:1. Recruiter who took my details, got the right to represent and then just did nothing because they were planning on quitting the company they worked for so they just stopped doing their job.2. Recruiter who lied to me about the details of the compensation so I looked like an ass to the employer when I reneged on the role 2 weeks after accepting.3. Recruiter who strung me along through 6 interviews because they told me the compensation was $X cash + $Y RSUs. Turns out it was $X cash + $Y Stock Options! ""Sorry, my bad"" was the most he could muster. Didn't know the difference between a stock and the ability to buy a stock and why they might affect my decision to interview.",Kooky_Anything8744,2025-04-21 14:02:38,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1k49khy,False,
