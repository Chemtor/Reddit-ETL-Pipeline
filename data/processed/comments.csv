That being said, a great percentage of DE’s need to study DSA, time/memory complexity, and CS fundamentals, instead of memorizing frameworks and assuming everything’s Gucci. It’s the fundamentals that evidently are the “hard stuff”.To provide an actual metric that illustrates what I mean: at a company I will not name, I encountered a legacy process that took 55 hours but was reduced to 6.5 seconds, as well as ~5x less memory allocation, simply by using Aho-Corasick instead of regex, parallelization instead of serialization, and basic optimizations using concepts like “tidy data” and sets.

my9eck4,"My path has been different but I'd like to add few tips for you.1. Keep testing your knowledge by building things. Try to automate at every step of the way. The more problems you face and solve, the better you become. But this is an endless loop, know when to move on.2. You might experience some SDEs looking down on DEs, do not get demotivated. DEs work on pretty cool problems as you'll see, try not to argue and move on. 3. Stick to a roadmap because there are endless things to learn and one might feel they will never be ready. It is good to know what will work at this moment, learning will never stop. 4. Most of the content is available for free, courses will give you the same content but in a structured manner.5. For later when you are working in DE: You might not get cool problems to work on right away, find places where you think you can add value, take initiatives and you'll end up with something cool on your plate.",ProbablyResponsible,2025-06-17 13:33:45,45,dataengineering,t3_1ldl5t5,False,

myaldfm,"tl;dr: 50+ year old SWE embarking on the transition back to DE, so I know the struggle.On a similar journey - been programming for almost 30 years (C/C++ stuff in DoD land) and now hoping to go back into data. First gig was moving a company from solely paper to Microsoft Access. Things have changed in the intervening years and while “select * from ” still works, my SQL is rusty as hell - so feels like starting over from scratch.Anyhow, I am going through a lot of free resources, but I need to be more disciplined with the learning and actually finishing projects/courses. Bad ADHD keeps me starting or reading about new tech, but not actually fully understanding them before I move on to the next shiny. The tech environment is festooned with tons of shiny stuff that actually gets in the way of finishing a project.So, been doing the DE ZoomCamp free course. It’s a bit janky, the instructors vary in quality (although I really like Alexei) and not everything is straightforward, but I think it’s a pretty realistic way to learn DE. Real life is not going to be laid out well either and projects will develop their own idiosyncrasies that have to be navigated. Also taking Joe Reis’s Data Engineering course on Coursera. It’s very AWS focused, but I think I’ll be able to sit for the AWS Data Engineering Associate Cert with some extra study time. I’m not a certificate enthusiast but the job market seems to like them, so why not help our your resume. It’s very streamlined and I am only in course 2 but he does talk about the non-tech skills DEs need to have to do their job. That’s been helpful.Also looked at Joseph Machado’s StartDataEngineering newsletter. That’s been informative and has exposed me to some new ideas. Since it is a free news letter, it doesn’t hurt. I also joined a couple of groups that SeattleDataGuy has running over LinkedIn, but haven’t really done much with them at the moment. There is a LOT of noise in the DE space, with “influencers” pushing a ton of crap on hopeful DEs, so being skeptical of some of the recommendations is wise. My LinkedIn is flooded with them since I put a data engineering focus to my profile. I have a couple of ideas for some projects I’ve been mulling over. I have one in mind to grab all the publicly available BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) data/projections and then see how they’ve revised them in the following months. I am curious to see how (in)accurate they have been since they’ve started.

Then you have to think through input rate, output rate etc etc. Other challenges you have to account for is being able to take input resources from different places as they run out!

IMO that's not a basic tech stack, a cron pulling some data directly into powerbi is basic, that's a tech stack powered by three separate vendors that can get very expensive.The first question is: are you part of the product the company is making or is it a cost center? I assume you've priced out what it would cost and what you expect it to cost in a year, in addition to how long you think it would take to move to that stack? So that's the first place you can sell it, that it will return you more money as part of a better/more robust product feature or that it will be cheaper overall than paying devs to maintain these scripts.The second question is: what does it give you that you don't already have? A very reasonable question you might receive is 'yes it's a hack but it's working for us, is rewriting it the most important thing to be pursuing at this time?' Like if all the data is there and I just want to see a report about how many frobnozzles we foobricked and or how much uptake my great new feature is getting and you're like 'first we should rewrite the entire tech stack' you need to be able to articulate the value of it beyond 'these JS scripts offend my aesthetic sensibilities'The third question I would ask is what are the long-term expectations of you in this role because IMO startups don't actually need DEs, but since titles in this industry are relatively meaningless, it's possible that what they really want right now is a 'data analyst' (often code for 'pbi monkey'), so the third question to me are everyones expectations aligned here?

With that said, I feel qualified to speak on it as a data engineer given I've devoted the past ~3 years to this problem and I'm writing an O'Reilly book on the subject.First and foremost, ""shift left"" pulls from already established paradigms in security and DevOps; and applying that to data. The core problem in those two spaces was disparate and high volume changes that downstream teams could no longer manage, and thus responsibility needed to ""shift left"" to upstream software engineers to manage such requirements.Key to this is not just shifting responsibility, but making it as easy as possible for these upstream engineers to engage in the desired practices within their existing dev workflows. Thus ""shift left"" isn't respective to where you are in the data lifecycle (e.g. upstream vs downstream), it's clearly looking at application code if we are following the same patterns it was established in other domains mentioned earlier.Thus, ""shift left"" in data revolves around prevention at ""design time"" as compared to ""run time"" like observability (both are valuable). This is why data contracts are core to the shift left narrative in data, as it validates if changes meet expectations within the CI/CD process.Here are some great resources if you want to learn more:1.

my2bhma,"You need to ingest your data.You have to orchestrate what runs when.You need to clean and transform your data to make it usable.You need to store your data.You need to access your data.That are the fundamentals which will never change.With that being said all tech stack depends of a lot of factors.Ingest : could be done in any language. I would say Python is a quick and easy language that is the most broadly used in data. So learn it. Orchestrate: airflow has been around a long time and is very good. Some people tend to say it’s way harder to get setup than the “new” stuff. Usually they used an old version were a lot of things needed to be managed for the system to run correctly. Then you have “new” orchestrator in the market which try to make it easy like Dagster, prefect, mage.Clean and transformation : you have the python frameworks (pandas, polars), you have your sql engine (DBT, trino, presto), you have spark, you have your DuckDB.Most compagnie would be fine with an up to date version of Postgres. But they usually run old 2010 version of sqlserver that run REAL slow, so they think they have a lot of data and switch to an OLAP system when they migrate. If you heard something like I have a LOT of data to transform. 1 million rows, 10 million rows, 100 millions rows you can assume that the company DOESN’T have a lot of data at all. And that any db would work. If it’s 100 millions rows every hour that’s another thing but usually people talk about their global table size unless they have really a lot of data and usually when they do they already know the solution because they already hit issues so many times with their systems.For OLAP (managed) you have snowflake, Databricks BigQuery, Redshift.OLAP (OSS) Pinot, clickhouseThere’s a lot more but that cover most scenarios or “new” companyAccess : you have a bunch of tools here but like tableau, power bi, sigma if you are 100% snowflake, metabase for small company, superset for bigger. And a bunch more.So no real definitive stack but you have those.If I was to start fresh in a new company that has received funding and that I know there’s going to be A LOT of data (multiple terabytes at least) I would probably do Dagster, DBT, snowflake, sigma, python ingestion in Dagster.Why? Because if they have investors and the company is pretty small they want to delivers new things fast even if it cost them more. If the couple of new things works or fail fast then it’s good for the business, they’ll hire more and continue growing the business. And the stack is pretty much all managed so you pay for maintenance and upgrades and everything you don’t have to do those things, and you can focus on business requirement.If it was a small company that expect a lot of data with no funding, I’ll go the datalake approach. Because snowflake will be expensive no matter what.If you don’t have a lot of data Postgres Dagster python, DBT might be a good fit.There no real stack but those are nice.Personally I would always go with a sql framework for transformation at start not because it’s better just because sql is easy enough that mostly anyone can understand and build some stuff while python transformation can get confusing when you chain a bunch of stuff together and it require programming knowledge which not everyone has.Good luck",Commercial_Dig2401,2025-06-16 11:40:53,28,dataengineering,t3_1lck2tc,False,

Regarding scaling, it would possibly make more sense to scale-out (more XS warehouses to serve requests in parallel). What we did is performing the transformations in Snowflake and export a denormalized table, and imported it into a Postgres.

So you’ll also need warehouse clustering. So spawn a XS with a high cluster enough that you are not queuing you requests at all.At 1 credits per hour you are looking at 24 credits per day per WH.

Your tests will return errors present in the system you extract. Third layer is where you add your business rules. I like to make one model for each business rule as dbt with duckdb takes like 1-2 seconds for 200k rows. Having multiple transformations together is exhausting to debug, and not really more efficient. Forth layer is where I make my Kimball modeling. One fact for each thing I look at. Dimensions all around. Junk dimensions are build using a SELECT DISTINCT to only have values that happens. Just remember to generate surrogate keys with dbt so you can joins dimensions and facts using a single column. And never join facts together, it's not how a star model work. Having multiple facts inside a single powerbi dashboard works well if you keep it classy. Also remember for each dimensions to have a default value for missing keys. Like adding a ""missing customer"" to your customer dimension.Lastly with dbt and surrogate keys you do not need to join fact and dimensions during the ETL phase as you do not need to use the foreign keys to retrieve the surrogate keys.

When a schema change for column addition is needed, we make sure they're ok for us to add columns without changes on their end, and do so. Once that data is ready, they can make changes on their end to bring in the new column(s). Avoiding coordinated change windows is the key, because it causes immense difficulty when working across teams.If a column is being removed, we essentially do the reverse. Downstream removes their dependency on it, then we remove it. If this ever has to be inverted, then the new first-moving team needs to set up a view or some other 'dummy' mechanism to spoof the presence of the data, so that they can make their change now and let the other team catch up later.For ingestion we make use of lake storage -- we capture raw data and raw files, exactly as upstream provides them. We read the data as long as it is compatible, it does not have to be identical, but we do flag for changes in schema as they will need to be addressed. After read, we write to conformed tables that use a schema we set, so we can add in dummy data or drop columns as needed. Ideally upstream works with us and provides two copies when a change is happening, one in the old schema and another in the new, then we can switch over at any point (ie they are first mover in this scenario).",azirale,2025-06-20 11:25:16,3,dataengineering,t3_1lfxkuw,False,

myj8m20,"Re ""products do not match between systems"": if you really do need a contract fact, with a grain that includes product, then you absolutely need a conformed product dimension that harmonises the product data from both systems. You need to work to _make_ them match. Then the single product dimension becomes part of how you associate rows in one fact table with rows in another fact table. You don't ever link one fact table directly to another. You traverse the model via one or more dimensions that the two facts have in common. (Those common dimensions might include degenerate dims like a contract number, perhaps. If so, the DD should be un-degenerated (!) back to a very narrow true dimension table, with surrogate keys in all the relevant fact tables.)You should work on that Product dimension before the facts, at least to get the basic approach and structure sorted, if row-by-row matching will take time. You can use tools like splink to figure out the links, potentially.(Unless they are actually different unrelated products? Like the contract is for a finished car, but the invoice is for components like engine block, axle, brake disk, etc. If so, Product and Component are probably two separate dimensions.)",sjcuthbertson,2025-06-18 22:45:40,2,dataengineering,t3_1ler091,False,

It is big enough that sustainability and ecotox is a very big deal given the scale and there is obviously external pressure being such a big company. Small changes to supply chain or ingredients can have big implications on the environment (and communities). There is a big push internally for eco-labelling our products in the way ingredients are.There are lots of data challenges when selling in ~200 countries with tens of thousands of products. Being able to estimate say, greenhouse gas emissions and life cycle assessment for a product portfolio right down to biodegradability of packaging types, or even how well recycling centres can detect plastics etc. isn’t easy.

my5ilkk,"I would understand if you’re hesitant given the current political climate, but have you considered looking into the national lab complex (DOE) ? Some labs have pretty narrow research focuses, but most do work on more fields than you’d initially think, and likely have groups/divisions dedicated to what you’re interested in. This is especially true for teams in the computational science sector, and having practical experience in data engineering and knowledge of the subject matter you’re into is very valuable. On the upside: Pay tends to be a little better than other non-profits, though certainly less than industry. Also, while national labs are partially funded through and ultimately report back to DOE, most are actually run by contractors (Battelle being one of the big ones). This means that we’re usually treated similarly to government employees by everyone but the actual government, so we don’t (always) have to deal with the same BS federal employees are going through right now. This can also make it more straightforward to get access to certain data that wouldn’t otherwise be available. On the downside: Most funds that come into the labs still come from other government offices like NIH, DOT, DOE, etc. So there is still susceptibility to political trade winds, especially for environmental stuff. Fortunately most research staff are pretty savvy at making subtle/small changes to existing projects to fly under the radar and appease their sponsors, as it were. Also, in my experience (YMMV) labs tend to be insular, so it can be hard to get in, but it’s easier to move around (even between labs) once you’re in and making connections. My advice would be to make connections with staff whose research you’d be interested in assisting with. Some will be more open than others, but if they like you and need your skill set, they may be able to create a new DE position with you in mind, or at least point you to another group that might need you.ETA: I ended up in renewable-adjacent work with a background in mechanical engineering and experience with machine learning. I’ve learned everything I know about DE on the job, and I’m not the only person I know who’s done that. I will also admit I knew someone (outside of research) at a lab who was able to pass my resume around more directly. So I mean it when I advise making connections with existing staff.

The inability in dbt contracts of being able to do varchar(n) max length type checks - I come from a MS SQL server backgorund and am used to defining max field lengths for most text columns. This one is interesting though - I'm going to be using postgres for the database for the first time and I have just realised the strict varchar(n) types I'm useed to aren't really needed for the majority of columns because text / varchar data types will suffice - so it's less of a concern now. 2. I saw it as likely being a better debugging experience to pick up schema errors by tests (rather than using contracts which prevent the models from creating - although I get it that's what you'd want to happen). I'll also be creating other tests for expected values etc, so having all tests implemented the same way I saw as a cleaner apprach3.

Assist or own data pipelines that prep data for dashboards using sql and or python.A Data engineer in general will do some of the following:Operate as a database administrator for a “data warehouse” to ensure the warehouse data is secure and queries are executing efficiently. Build data pipelines from data sources into the data warehouse. Be responsible for scheduling and deployment architecture for DAs pipelines.

mymaxc6,"Despite the emphasis on computer code as something that does something in a computer, what it also fundamentally is an expression of human thought. (That's not as pretentious as it sounds. Pretty much any thing else expressive is, especially if it involves language, like a song or even this post.)When you look at someone else's code, you're looking at how they expressed their ideas in a form that can be executed on a computer. Different people will have different takes on that, even for the same problem. (That's one reason why one person's code may make immediate sense and someone else's doesn't - it can very much depend on whether you're thinking about the problem the same way they are or not.) So a key part of being able to read someone else's code is to approach it from a ""what were they thinking when they wrote this"" point of view. One of the first things you can do to help understand the code is identify what concepts they're expressing in the code - what the various players are, so to speak. The sooner you can grasp the bigger picture and what ideas are involved, the easier it will be once you get down into the details.One thing that will help you over time is having more and more exposure to different ideas. If you're looking at an HTTP server implementation, for example, it will make a lot more sense if you've seen one before, so you know what things are and how they interact. So a big part of being able to more readily understand code is having already been exposed to the concepts its trying to express, even if later it's expressed in a way you haven't seen before. You can know what the underlying ideas are.Unfortunately, this is where a lot of documentation comes up short. The individual calls makes sense once you have a broader view - the big picture - but the documentation often seems to start from the (unspoken) point of view that you already know all that. So you end up having to try to work out it's an elephant and not a tree or a snake.What will make reading code easier over time is:\- Seeing (and understanding) enough code that can know the various idioms and, more importantly, what they *mean*. That is, what the developer was most likely trying to say when they wrote the code.\- Gaining knowledge in the domains the code is a solution for, so you can know what things mean more readily and can more quickly get the lay of the land once you dive in.\- Writing more code yourself. Discovering how *you* express ideas will give you critical insight into how *others* express ideas in code. Eventually, you'll get to a point where you'll be able to see code and go ""I know what that means"" because you've not only seen it before but written it yourself before.Hope that helps!\[Note: Not all code is going to be so easily digested, even with experience.

Because you're not starting from scratch, you're hooking into a long-living, already existing framework and ecosystem for creating applications, with well-defined and delineated structures to organize your program to ensure it works within the framework.You would see similar levels of triviality if you tried to make a ""bare metal"" web application with native javascript and HTML, as well, the complexity comes in when you pick up a framework, because you're CHOOSING that complexity in exchange for the power the framework offers you. Same with servers, you can write your own bare-bones HTTP server in C++ and simply use that as a REST-API handler, but that's a lot of tedious work... why would you do that when ready-made frameworks exist that, yes, take a bit more work to get started with, but over time drops your workload by a hundred times?Mobile platforms are different because they REQUIRE you to use their platform to be able to run your applications and ensure they don't do ""bad things"", you cannot do ""bare metal"" development. These platforms are hardware limited, run fundamentally different ""operating systems"", and have a much higher level of integration and centralized control than a PC. This requires you to break up your applications into event-driven models, state-based triggers, setting structures and sign up for all the functionality you want to hook into so that the OS can integrate these things, ensure you get your fair share of background time, and run your app in the correct situations. You *can* do close to native app development if you jailbreak Android, and skip all the framework stuff if you really want to, but you won't be able to run on a locked down, consumer platform.You will see that over time as you get more experienced with development and the applications you write get more substantial, you will either gravitate towards the same level of complexity, or you will be stuck doing so much manual work and trying to ensure it all works with each other that you drop it entirely because you get sick of it.

myxhvrv,"I’m seeing weird answer here. The reason why a simple hello world is so difficult to get going dates back to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In the old days demonstrated by the console programs that you’ve been playing with you have ASSCII printable characters (the letters you see for instance like a, b, c, etc.) and the non-printable characters like carriage return (CR) that return the cursor to the beginning of the line, new line (NL) that advance the cursor to the next line below, etc. All very easy to control with basic system calls.Enter GUIs where it’s not that simple. With a GUI you have to define what is called a draw or layout surface that allows you to place elements like text boxes, buttons, etc at various positions within that draw surface. That overall draw surface is stored in the form of a series of buffers or layers to present to the user visually and a further layer to track finger touches or mouse cursor movements so the system can track what the user want to interact with. Now, with SDKs they need to handle a lot of the overall setup for you and you utilize objects that represent text or buttons or other widgets that place on that surface.Now as you can see we have gone from simple system calls to print text to screen for your console apps to presenting a presentation layer for GUI elements that cannot only rely on system calls alone to display.This is why a simple hello world program on Android is so difficult because:1. You need to set up a display buffer with the resolution and how it will be displayed to the user2. You need to create a text box element in that buffer to display the text3. You need to set up what text is displayed in that text elementI hope this gives you a good idea in answer to your question.",ButchDeanCA,2025-06-21 03:31:24,3,learnprogramming,t3_1lgkpxz,False,

myhpw5b,Coding is an industry where hungry business man pray on the passion of people that couldn’t care less about the outcomes but enjoy the journey. This is an unfortunate reality of today’s developer market. I am in the same boat as you and even went much stupider into enrolling into a software engineering university as well as a bootcamp and some self learning myself. I have some familiarity some projects but nothing fully transactional. The market itself makes me build my own SaaS instead of even thinking to try anything like internships and so on. I thought university will actually provide internships but it seems I am so far away from that that I can’t even believe it how ridiculous it is. It’s majority about networking and actual shipping products. I had in mind a bit of technical ability and then get into the project management leadership roles as I already have experience as a manager/leader…. I have no chance for anyone to invest in me as I’m not a code monkey and no one does anything these days because of the budget… It’s just pushes us into other jobs until we are able to find a team to fit ourselves into and then that belonging will be limited until this will again happen. That’s the cycle of a developer. So in conclusion yes get a job- you’ll learn less and invest more time but you will have something for the time being. Make sure the job you choose can actually be something you can always jump back to once developing ends until it starts back again.

myxujx2,"1. If you’re learning recursion as part of a degree, then it’s a good bet that your professors think it’s pretty important. Trust them.2. Recursion comes up all the time. Many important data structures are defined recursively. For example, linked list is either null or a structure that contains some data and a pointer to a linked list. And when you have recursive data structures, recursive functions are often the best way to work with them.3. Recursion isn’t just some academic exercise. Consider a GUI framework. Typically, anything that’s drawn on the screen is drawn in a *view*. Controls, labels, text fields, menus, etc. are all specialized views. If a user clicks the mouse button, the framework figures out which view was clicked by asking the root view which view contained the click location. That view then asks each of its sub views which view contained the click, and so on. Or, if part of the screen needs to be redrawn, the framework goes through a similar process.4. Any problem that can be solved recursively *can* be solved iteratively, but recursion is often the easier, cleaner solution. Recursion uses the stack to keep track of intermediate results; things can get messy fast with iteration because you have to manage that state explicitly.5. There are some languages in which recursion is the only way to loop.6. If you’re working on a computer science degree, you probably have courses in theory of computation, compilers, and operating systems in your future. Recursion looms large in each of those. As a small example, read about the `fork()` function in Unix-like operating systems.7. Your question reminds me of high school math classes when students would ask “why do we need to know trig identities?” or “when are we ever going to factor polynomials in the real world?” It’s easy to understand that feeling, but it’s hard to provide a satisfying answer because someone asking a question like that just hasn’t seen enough to appreciate the importance of the topic.

You need to learn and practice it (even if it initially feels awkward and even if some examples feel alien or niche). Then, when you face real world problems, sometimes you'll realise that, hey, it kind of feels like if I split this problem up into pieces the algorithm will be simpler or the code cleaner...and maybe I can do that again in the same way...hey, this is recursion! I'm recursing! And when your problems don't nest that way, go back to ordinary imperative code.Kinds of data where recursion comes up naturally are common. Trees are obviously very likely to involve recursive operations and trees come up all the time in real world data wherever data are organised hierarchically: DOM trees, parse trees, nested spatial info, organisational charts, I'm sure you can think of many more examples where data are naturally nested in a self-similar manner.Most of my code is not recursive, but I wouldn't be a competent programmer if I didn't know how to use recursion when it's the better choice.",AdministrativeLeg14,2025-06-21 04:14:18,3,learnprogramming,t3_1lgngqf,False,

What you lack is database knowledge. :) I would recommend picking up some cloud certifications too. This will enable you to ensure that a website or a network resource is operating in addition to maintaining the page itself, and making sure it looks good. You’ll pick up additional skills and make friends at an MSP.

You can use it to create whatever tools you need to make your life easier. You can make tools with any language really.

You need to research/evaluate these trade-offs and decide, which side your projects want to be on.Traditional databases are on the left side and provide a lot of ""safety"" and strict reliability for clean data.NoSQL databases typically fall on the right side. They sacrifice a lot of ""guarantees"" for scalability. If you choose one of these you have to consider issues that might occur from ""eventual consistency"" and not being able to really rely on the data structure returned by your database.Relational databases offer quite flexible queriing. Need to now which `Product`s a `Customer` has added to their shopping basket? SQL can query that! Later, need to now which `Customer`s have bought a certain `Product` (reverse)? That's just another SQL query! You don't have to change your database structure to support that.NoSQL often are not that flexible. If you structure your database to efficiently support the first query, it won't be as efficient to support the second query. Worst case, you'll have to completely restructure your DB to support the use case.Paradoxically, NoSQL makes it very simple to store/retrieve an object structure, without much upfront-thinking about how your data looks like.

Try to do that with any other SQL manager - good luck.There's a catch though, you don't have the safety the schema is giving you. So you must be EXTRA careful when you change the schema of your database. We abide by the following rules : \* A collection only holds one type of document \* If we add a field to a document, we must add it to every existing object in the database \* If there's a relationship, materialize it with a foreign key ( basically, \_id)Just following those 3 rules got us really far with a very homogenous and reliable DB, so much that we are transitioning to supporting both SQL and no-SQL - we want to offer an on-premise version of our app, hence using the customer's favorite DB.

Im curious about what interviews look like now that theres a bigger focus on ai…The best advice I can give is if your understanding of java for example is not great take a course to become an expert on it and that will probably help with your confidence. No one is good at reading documentation. For that you just have to force yourself to read it line by line and then summarise each paragraph to yourself to help cement the information in that paragraph. I especially struggle with pushing myself to learn more, but because I’m aware of it, I can now push myself to work on correcting it. It sounds like you probably know what your weaknesses are, your best way to fix it is to find a way to build your confidence in those skills. You very likely know more than you realise and just need to find a way to change your mindset. It’s pretty common to struggle with this but if you’re looking to specialise in something focus on what you enjoy and just branch out from there. Good luck!

myhe5yf,"I really relate to your experience. During the pandemic, I used to cry because the classes were so difficult and confusing — everything felt very strange and disconnected. On top of that, we didn’t have AI tools back then to help explain concepts step-by-step like we do now.Honestly, a lot of the time I felt lost, especially since many professors kind of checked out or weren’t available. StackOverflow became my lifeline. There were so many moments when I was stuck and had no one to ask, so I had to figure things out on my own.About AI — I think it’s important to understand that AI doesn’t just solve the problem for you or give you the perfect answer every time. Instead, it helps guide you toward the solution, giving you hints or a direction to think in. At the end of the day, it’s still you who needs to understand the problem, connect the dots, and come up with the real answer.That guidance is incredibly valuable, especially when you feel overwhelmed or stuck. But relying solely on AI without building your own understanding won’t get you far. I think being aware of that balance — using AI as a tool, but still doing the hard thinking yourself — is what makes a real difference.So, hang in there. The fact that you’re reflecting on this and want to improve means you’re already on the right path. We all had shaky starts, but what matters is how we keep moving forward.

mynn2sf,I would say just this. If you don’t work in an environment where you design the code the architecture and so on those are useless skills as long as you are paid to ship products and the how doesn’t really matter in most cases as much as the end product. In regards to your own abilities yes some jobs are really really bad as they will not develop good skills but force you to compromise on it. My advise will be to focus on that back end structure and architecture that you said you are loving and have smal windows where you either ask chat got to explain to you things like you were a beginner and they are your pair programming partner and so on or you find communities of people that share the same interest. For example you could start mentoring junior developers and have them contribute to your own back end small to medium and later expert api designs while implementing all the testing strategies and so on. It doesn’t matter if that direction is provided by chat got as long as you explain that to someone else as it’s coming from you as the one you explain to will struggle to understand or follow and you need to constantly repeat yourself hence learning the subject as you teach it. Pair programming is very good and the practice of small iterative steps while using git hub and commits push and pull requests with branching is an amazing collaborative tool to provide knowledge for yourself and for the mentored pupil. This will make both your GitHub’s active and it shows consistency. Setup the backend repo make a snap quick dummy - trace the steps and then delete it and provide the same from scratch to your newbie taking it slow explaining everything like he has no clue - which he won’t anyway - forcing you to explain your code differently even though you have an idea what it means. Encourage them to ask questions and focus on interacting instead of building. Follow the driver navigator pattern and make sure you stay within the roles themselves both the beginner and you and then switch after either functions being made or later features depending on the project itself. There is more to it on the aspect of self development here but I won’t get into that either as I’m writing too mi ha but find an actual person that works on backend and ask for being mentored by them as well. This will provide you with both as a mentee and mentor experience and will help you develop your skills in no time compared to what you doing. Focus on finding solutions together other than shipping a solution. Enjoy,Daydreg,2025-06-19 16:28:21,2,learnprogramming,t3_1lef7fp,False,

I would say Python is a very great one to start - it's syntax is quite readable, it's easier to use than many other languages, and yet it will certainly get you into the ""flow"" with how to think about how to solve programming type problems.I would 100% recommend coding along to a YouTube channel, namely BroCode (his videos and teaching style are amazing). There are also some great sites like CodeCademy that have guided practice / learning sessions - these would probably be more than enough to teach you the fundamental terms you'll want to familiiarize yourself with.More than anything, it is \*totally\* normal to feel lost.

Caring about every single unit of code is not where you're at.[Test bahavior, not implementation details](https://codeling.dev/blog/testing-behavior-or-implementation/) which will tell you immediately if any of your features break and makes refactoring code much less risky and certainly less of a pain in the a$$.**Where to start:**Since you're really concerned about existing working features breaking when you change something, I would really suggest writing a few tests for the most important features.Maybe start working in version control when you feel you're up to it,...but at least start with a few end to end or integration tests which focus on behavior.

myd9ojx,"I think it depends on the concept. Computer science itself is inherently mathematical, but most programmers don’t really engage with that side of CS outside of academia. I think you sum up your issue here:> I only had occasional sporadic 1-2 hour studies of a programming video, mainly copying the code line by line and aimlessly googling every keyword in the documentation while being confused by the meaning of the syntax and still unable to make anything by myself, mainly being more concerned with schoolwork. I would focus heavily on trying to understand math on a more conceptual level or at least get enough practice to be prepared for theoretical computer science, but I consistently failed when implementing algorithms for projects. Algorithms typically employ a type of math called discrete math, and understanding it is crucial to understanding algorithms; but you also need to understand programming principles. A lot of discrete math is, unlike the higher-level continuous math in a CS curriculum, much more intuitive. It is much more logical and “common sensical” than, say, divergence of a series. Sorting a list or traversing a tree, for instance, often just makes sense without delving too deeply into the underlying mathematics. You should be focusing more on the data structures themselves than deep diving into the theory at this point. There are many clever tricks used in DSA problems (I’ve always liked the sliding window problem), but this is more about creative problem-solving than applying mathematical foundations. Having a theoretical understanding of DSAs will not get you far there. Mathematical *reasoning* is much more important here. Outside of a few fields such as data science, the most math you’ll use is probably basic statistics and algebra, and perhaps discrete math such as bit-wise logic and graph theory. Ideally, however, if you’re struggling with simple syntax and concepts, you shouldn’t be too focused on *any* of the math yet. If you’re not understanding conditionals, loops, logic, and native data structures, you shouldn’t skip to DSAs, since the foundation of data structures and algorithms lies within those rudimentary concepts. You should be able to solve basic to intermediate problems before DSAs. If you can’t write a program to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit or find the factorial of an integer, then you need to revisit the fundamentals.",sch0lars,2025-06-18 01:03:23,7,learnprogramming,t3_1le3ksf,False,
mydeyfo,"Data structures are hard even if you are good at coding. They're also more advanced tools, so if you're not using the basic tools, it makes it even tougher.My best advice would be to get coding. Reps to get comfortable with the syntax, and going from idea to functional. When you're stuck, talk to AI and tell it you don't want the answer, but to help it tutor you. You have this problem, you're here, and you got this error. Ask it to help you step through the code to identify where the error happens. Ask it to help identify few different possible avenues that may cause an error that you should look to check, and how to prove if that is or isn't where the problem is.Next I would take on studying big O. You want to understand how optimized your code is. If you rewrote the same code using a hashmap or array, which would be better? why? In all scenarios? Big O helps you understand efficiency.Once you understand that, then DSA comes into play. A lot of DSA is purely conceptual. The code looks similar to other code with if statements and some variables. I've also seen most DSA just use an array to accomplish it, so it makes it even more confusing. If they're just using an array, why add all the the complexity?Some problems, that are not even that hard of a concept to understand, are tricky to code efficiently.

myecb0x,"> mainly copying the code line by line and aimlessly googling every keyword in the documentation while being confused by the meaning of the syntax and still unable to make anything by myselfThis is an indication that you did not get enough practice.As you can clearly see, copying the code line by line does not actually teach you anything. Even if the teacher is explaining things, and you feel like you kind of get it in the moment, that's never enough. You managed to complete your assignments before the DS&A class, so you've obviously written some code that solves problems based off the learning material and your ability to google the rest, but what you should have been doing is spending some extra time with each assignment after you finished it making sure you understand the code you've written. This could involve things like messing with the code and seeing what happens, or coming up with your own slight variation on the problem and solving that. It could involve asking other students about how they solved the problem (after it's been submitted, and without seeing their code), or discussing things with them (again, without sharing code) while working on it. If there is time to ask questions during class, make sure you ask them when you're unsure about something. If your teacher has office hours, make use of that. You don't have to learn entirely on your own, but you do have to be willing to recognize when you're not getting something and take the initiative.What you need for DS&A above all else is a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming. What I mean is understanding how things like loops, conditionals, variables, and functions combine together to create specific behavior in your program. And I don't mean at a conceptual level, I mean understanding it deeply enough that you can actually write programs that solve problems on your own (this does not mean without looking up functions or syntax, but it does mean knowing roughly what you're looking for). Without that, you are woefully unprepared for DS&A.even a solid understanding of discrete mathematics alone would not get you through a DS&A class, because in the end your assignments will be primarily implementing specific data structures or algorithms, and while that math certainly helps, it doesn't magically make you able to write code on your own. It only helps you understand what you're writing.The only way you develop this knowledge is through practice. You need to sit down, and actually try to solve problems with code enough that you actually develop a feel for how to use the tools you've been taught.Here's an analogy. Let's compare learning to program with learning woodworking. Following along line by line is like the teacher explaining each tool, giving you a complete blueprint, and then telling you *exactly* how to make that specific thing out of your wood. Sure, you came out the end with something that more or less resembles what the teacher showed you how to make. But that alone is not going to teach you the nuance about how to actually get a nice straight cut, what steps to take to go from a block of wood to the piece you need, what order to take those steps, or any of the nuance involved with using each tool. Those are all things you develop through experience actually using the tools.College expects you to be smart enough to recognize when you are not actually understanding things. It also expects you to be willing and able to learn on your own.I want to be clear, I'm not trying to say you're completely screwed. What I'm saying is that what you've been doing up until now is simply not enough. You need to devote more time and effort into actually learning the material properly. If you are in a position where you absolutely cannot Devore the necessary time and effort into learning the material, them maybe you need to take some time off, self learn during that time, and come back later to finish things.Consider this: can you write a basic text based program that plays rock paper scissors against the user? If you think you can, go write it. Try the same with tic tac toe. Writing the code to check if someone has won a game of tic tac toe is an algorithm, albeit one with a single very specific application.If you don't think you are capable of writing those, then you need to sit down and figure out how. You have at least learned all the necessary building blocks to put together to make those programs by now. It's up to you to spend the time playing with those blocks and finding out what ways you can put them together that makes those programs.If you don't even know where to start, don't think about code at all. Think about the steps a program would have to go through, and write them down in plain English, or in pseudocode. Once you have the basic structure of what that looks like, think about how you might convert each step into code. If a step seems too complex, try breaking it up into smaller steps, then try to convert each of those.The idea here is that before you actually write code, you should understand at a conceptual level what your program should roughly look like. Not the fine details, just a rough outline. Once you've come up with a rough idea of what your program looks like, then you know enough to actually try to write it. If you just jump in and try to write code without some idea of what your program should look like, chances are you'll have no clue where to even begin, or you'll just flail about trying to randomly slap different ideas together until you get something that works.",Bobbias,2025-06-18 05:10:17,5,learnprogramming,t3_1le3ksf,False,

mycjf03,"You need to start managing this project by capturing the business requirements and tracking how long it takes you to deliver them.The temptation is to just work on features as quickly as you can, to the best of your ability, and try to hit the deadlines set by your manager. *Don't do this: it's a recipe for burn-out and failure*.Instead, you need to plan your work up front, calculate how long it will take, and manage the business's expectations accordingly. You're a junior, and your working alone, so you need to give yourself time to do the necessary research and to correct the inevitable mistakes you'll make along the way.Businesses like *certainty*. They are less concerned with *how long* things take; they want to know *when* they will be ready so that they can plan accordingly. Your job is to give yourself enough time to deliver your work to an acceptable standard, to tell your manager *when* things will be complete, and to warn your manager *when* they will be late *as soon as you are able to*.Below is an outline of how to do this effectively: You have some high-level requirements already. Break those requirements down into units of work that deliver business value. We'll call those units features. The features need to be as small as they can be, such that completing one delivers some value to the business, even if it isn't usable in isolation.As an example, imagine you need to implement user accounts so that people can log onto the system and use it. The complete set of features that make a complete working implementation might be the following:- Registration- Login- Reset password- Update credentialsAll of these can be delivered as separate features. Even though registration is useless without login (and vice versa), they can be developed independently and each add business value independent of the other, so they count as separate features.The reason we try to make features small in this way is that it makes them closer to each other in size; therefore the time it takes to complete any of them will be of a similar magnitude. This will be important later.Once you have a collection of such features, you can begin working on them. As you work on them, you want to set aside some time in your week to plan the next set of requirements while you deliver the first.It's up to you to find the right balance between planning and delivery. Basically you want to be delivering as much as possible, but doing enough planning that you always have something in the backlog to work on. You want to make sure you capture all the requirements in the planning phase.You should have a nice predictable cadence to your work. You begin a task and you work on it until it is done. If you have to stop half way through a task because you failed to capture a business requirement, or failed to predict a technical problem, this is an indication that you didn't do enough prep work. We call these issues *blockers*. They happen to everyone - even experienced devs - but they will become rare if you are able to identify and fix their cause.You should keep a record of the features you're working on somewhere. It could be a Trello board, a GitHub project, a spreadsheet, a list in your diary, post-it notes - it doesn't matter where it lives. What matters is that you move features from the backlog to *in-progress* while you're working on them, and then into *done*, when you complete them; *and crucially*, you need to record *when* you completed them. Tools like Trello do this automatically for you.Once you have completed some features, you will have some real knowledge of how long it takes to complete a feature. Let's say you complete 5 features over a 2 week period. That means you have a velocity of *2 days per feature*. *Now* you can predict how long it will take you to complete the remaining features. As you complete more features, your velocity will become more accurate. Maybe by the end of the month, it turns out that it takes 2.5 days to complete a feature. Feed that back into your predictions.If you break your features down into small units of business value, like I outlined above, you will reduce the margin of error in the prediction. Realistically, some features will be completed sooner than others, but it all averages out over time.You can also use your velocity to make long-term predictions. If you count the average number of features that make up a high-level requirement (let's call it an ""epic"") then you can get a rough estimate of how long it will take to deliver an epic.Don't *guess* how long a feature will take to complete. You'll just get it wrong, but you'll still be obligated to achieve the deadline you set for yourself just the same. Use the velocity to *predict* how long it will take to complete your features, and keep updating that velocity. It's a good idea to put a couple of days on the end of the prediction in any case, to give yourself some wiggle room if anything goes wrong.Initially, you won't have a velocity. Tell your manager that you'll give him an estimate just as soon as you've completed a few features. If he really needs an estimate now, give him your best estimate, but update it as soon as you have a velocity, and update it again every time that velocity changes.Sometimes businesses actually do have deadlines they need to meet. Once you're tracking your progress effectively, you have the means to tell your manager if those deadlines are realistic. If you can see that you aren't going to deliver all the features required for a deadline, you and your manager need to negotiate what you're going to do about it. You're likely to have one of 5 options:1. Move the deadline;2. Remove features;3. Hire another developer;4. Work overtime;5. Cut some corners.4 and 5 are real options, but they are riskier, and they need to be managed carefully. If you're going to work overtime, you ought to be getting paid overtime, and you'll also need to take a holiday afterwards to recover your energy. There is also the issue of whether or not you *want* to be the one making all the sacrifices, and whether or not your company is taking advantage of you.If you're going to cut corners, you need to fix-up your work as soon after the deadline as possible. Time needs to be set aside for this and future deadlines may need to be delayed. This is called *paying back your technical debt* and failing to do so can ultimately sink a project.Along with features, you're also going to have to perform other tasks, such as bug fixes, refactors, meetings, and so on. You only need to track product facing tasks (i.e. features and bugs), but you can track other things as well if it helps you organise and manage your workload.Bugs are an important dimension to measure. Together with velocity, they give you a real measure of the success of your project, and some actual quantitative data to share with you manager. (Managers love data.)You can track bugs on the same board, but track them separately, and *don't include them in the velocity*; that's for features only. More bugs will usually coincide with a reduction in velocity, and both trends mean that you need to fix some underlying issue with your code. Maybe it needs refactoring, better linting, or more unit tests. Maybe it's outgrown its architecture. They're an indication that you're either delivering too quickly and neglecting the quality of your code, or have some limitation in your architecture that you need to overcome.You need to pay attention to what is causing these issues because it will help you inform decision you make about the project going forward. E.g. have you finally outgrown those Google Sheets? Or, are you spending enough time keeping your code tidy.Again, all of this is intended to help you make room for yourself to improve the parts of your project your manager won't see and ultimately doesn't care about unless they produce a failure (which they will if they go unchecked) while providing the velocity that shows predictable progress. You need to give yourself room to try unit testing, or some library that you need, or whatever it is you think the project needs.Don't hide these kinds of data for fear of being criticised. You can use them to demonstrate why you need the things that you know you need.",marrsd,2025-06-17 22:35:59,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ldpb8b,False,

Proper design, performance and maintainability comes later in the learning curve. Syntax, the algorithm and the availavle libraries are the main focus here.2. Can I make this secure? Know the most common attack vectors and how to mitigate them. Don't settle for ""just use library X"". Understand the principle what the issue is and how it can be exploited. Then use the library.3. Can I fix performance bottlenecks. Learn profiling techniques and caching for starters.Now you've hit the milestone that you can deliver usable software. It might not be pretty but it works and is secured against most common attack vectors.4. Can I deliver fast? Time is money and to be competive you must learn to deliver quicker. Tooling, frameworks ai come into play here. Optimize your workflow for quicker results5. Can the software adapt to changes quickly? The main goal of software maintainability is to be able to adapt to changing requirements. New market oppertunities, chaning legel requirements. Compitive software can be changed quickly. Learn common patterns and practices. Learn about software architecture for differnt levels of scale.At this point your technical skills are what I would expect of a senior developer.Now I just ask myself the question. Can I make X?If the answer is no I follow these 5 steps and expand my knowledge for each step where needed. It looks like you are expanding your skills in step 1 and you have dabbled a bit in the others. Good. Now look at your work from the perspective of the other points.

First, you need to learn the ""alphabet"" of programming such as variables, loops, functions, algorithms and other basic concepts that are applicable to any programming language. Then you need to learn idioms for the programming language of choice, e.g., object-oriented programming for C++ or trait-oriented programming for Rust, as well as the standard library for that programming language with basic string operations and so on. Then, finally, you need to learn the chosen problem domain, such as blockchain API and smart contract API.That's a lot of material and that's why a proper Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science takes 4 years. I rarely see a programmer who writes maintainable, usable code with less than 2 - 3 years of experience. Five years of experience is the minimum to be able to build serious, larger systems without constant supervision.My advice: don't waste too much time on passive, video-based courses.

If you know what concept you need to apply to get some problem solved, you can always look up the syntax how to do so.For example; You want to parse json data from the APIYou would need to use ""encoding/json"" for converting that json data to a ""programmable format"" called parsing. To do that you need to know concepts like parsing, json unmarshalling/marshalling, learning what even API means etc. You don't need a deep understanding of these concepts first and I think they can be learned by doing projects and then asking chatGPT or fellow humans for assistance when you hit a roadblock or need further explanation. When you do project based learning you will encounter many points, in which you have to dive deep into the inner workings of a computer to get past something or after you are done building for the day, you can further your understanding on some new concepts that you encountered/applied. Basics can be drilled by practicing for loops, if statements, variable declarations, playing around with data structures like looping over them, learning some basic searching and sorting algorithms and then diving deeper into paradigms and how to identify some of the key patterns found in some of the problems.",Fancy-Letterhead-692,2025-06-17 11:59:44,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ldjnyt,False,

I do embedded design and development and the framework has everything I need for fast graphics, rapid development, and localization support with good tools for translators. I have a product on Qt 5.15 which has 19 patch releases and is very stable, and am starting a Qt 6 product. I don’t trust any other framework as much. The Qt framework has 30 years in the market as a native speed, C++ solution… 15 years of QML in the market, and it’s in in cars and medical devices. There’s a million developers today. That’s less than half the number of Flutter developers right now, but Flutter is too new for me to trust.The next product I’m working on will be on an LTS Qt 6 release. I researched the options and Qt came out on top for our team.BTW, if you are making a medical device, it is possible to get a perpetual license, but you must request it. The perpetual license only has 1 year of upgrades, maybe 4 patch releases, but you can modify the source code and fix GUI defects forever. Get at least one perpetual license and enough 3-year subscription licenses to complete the development phase, then get a 1- year upgrade for the perpetual license before going to 510k so you pick up the latest patch release versions.

(or whether someVariable actually exists). now imagine this call is being done in code outside of your reach. (a client library for instance). you wouldn't know what variables they are using. so if you ever change the database you won't have an automatic warning that the field they are selecting on exists. Except at runtime which is not ideal. If you make the same changes in the first example, (remove a findBy..... because the field is no longer offered), the client will get a compilation error when a developer updates to the latest version of your library. which they will be much happier about than an error in the rare situation a user sorts a table by pressing a UI element the developers never touch.I know what I write is slightly charged / exaggerated but I tried to sketch the use cases where you would know the difference.I think you are falling into a beginner trap where more code looks inefficient. And creating a godly one-liner that handles everything / runs the whole program looks good. But more verbose self-documenting code generally is code that will have less bugs later on. because you won't be the only programmer working on your code. You may not even be at the employer when someone tries to work on a function / replaces something. for instance in your case: it is easy to replace findById with findByIdOrSecondaryId because it'll be clear where you use it and you'll get a compiler error if you forget one since the original doesn't exist. But it is entirely possible you overlook GetObject( ""id"") (possibly because of whitespace differences and such.Think about cleanness of code in the sense that it should be straightforward to read. Don't shy away from extra functions. However what you can do is have findByName and findByEmail and findById all internally call GetEntry(string field, string value) if you wish.

Learn C (great book: https://seriouscomputerist.atariverse.com/media/pdf/book/C%20Programming%20Language%20-%202nd%20Edition%20(OCR).pdf) -- do practice problems, write a few programs to understand how programs are written and execute on your computer2. Learn some computer architecture -- helps you understand what your CPU is doing and the purpose of a GPU3. You should have spent A LOT of time on doing steps 1 and 2, so it depends what you want to do from here. The two most common applications: 3a. If you're interested in programming on a GPU for AI reasons, then study what kind of math operations are performed for most deep learning applications (e.g., matrix multiplication). 3b. If you want to do something related to graphics, start with something like OpenGL (https://learnopengl.com/)It's important to lay a solid understanding of programming and computer fundamentals before diving into parallel programming. Parallel programming APIs like OpenCL are a huge abstraction, and it assumes the user has a solid understanding of how they want to parallelize their workload and exactly how they're going to manipulate the GPU.If you have any questions, I'd be happy to chat for a bit!EDIT: Here's a good book for learning about computer architecture.

You listen to a bunch of tennis teachers on YouTube explaining how to hit a forehand. Maybe you choose to imitate Roger Federer's forehand. You watch how he hits in slow motion. You shadow stroke it.Then, you go on the court, and you don't hit anything like him. What happened? There are subtleties about his game you can't see if you just watch video. Maybe you focus just on his hand, but ignore the rest of his body: his torso, his legs. Maybe you don't fully understand how he gets acceleration. You observe things, but they still don't fully capture what's really happening because you make assumptions.OK, maybe this didn't happen to you, but it did happen to me. It made me realize looking at someone do something doesn't teach *me* how to do it. I lack a lot of information despite paying attention.I think the same may happen to you. Yes, you'll learn some things looking at projects, and yes, programming isn't tennis. Programming is more quantifiable. But, like watching a pro tennis player, looking at a completed project may not be enough to understand it.Even when the person who programmed it explains it, they're likely to skip all the beginner stuff and assume the person listening is not a beginner. If I built a website using Python and Django and you didn't know how a loop works in Python, then I'd spend forever going over the basics of Python just so you could understand it.Instead, I'd assume you know Python, you had some idea of how Django works, and then I'd go into the specifics.

Something as simple as a test that runs the code that depends on the singleton twice can become impossible to implement properly. And refactoring a singleton away can be a lot of work.Another general issues with singletons is that you can access them from anywhere (as there often is a global Singleton::GetInstance() function or similar). This means that (as opposed to using dependency injection) it is hard to tell what code depends on the existence of that singleton, making it hard to reason about the code. And then there are other issues like initialization/deinitialization and dependencies between multiple singletons, etc. That's the reason why the singleton pattern is considered an anti-pattern.That being said there are common cases where I see singletons used frequently (e.g. for a clock or a logger object) where it can be justified but even for those I've seen it cause problems that they are implemented as singletons.For your specific case, I would not implement a Configuration as a singleton.

However, to get Windows to load an unsigned driver, you have to use the boot menu to disable driver signature enforcement.The driver will expose an API (accessed through IOCTL calls) that will allow a user mode program to pass it a process ID. You will then write a user mode program that will find or get the process ID of the target application and pass it up to the driver.The driver can then use functions like MmProbeAndLockPages, and MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache to build MDLs for the virtual memory regions that you are interested in in the target application, lock them into physical RAM, then map them back down into the virtual address space of your user mode program.Once you have done that, the user mode program will have a ""live view"" into the memory of the target application, and can write whatever values it wants to disk.That is assuming you have solved the problem of figuring out which virtual address you are interested in in the target application.Note that this is all quite difficult, and not something for a novice programmer to take on. I used to do this kind of stuff for work, when I was working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on it.

myclnx1,"> I know I should validate the input format with something like the express-validator middleware, but what about for something like a text-area where a user might have a perfectly valid reason for including ""dangerous characters""?Characters are not dangerous, and any system that treats them as such is poorly designed.You don't need to escape *inputs* i.e. strings that you receive. You must correctly escape *outputs* when you embed them in anything that's going to be parsed: an SQL statement, an HTML document, etc. (For that reason, I think that having HTML escaping in an ""input validation"" library is pretty nonsensical.)Escaping is essential for the parsing on the other end to work correctly, even leaving aside the dangers of XSS.When you're running JS code in the browser, and you set a property with `textContent`, you don't need to do any escaping because the string you're providing is not going to be parsed as HTML. It's just being directly passed into the DOM. On the other hand, if you assign to `innerHTML`, then the string you assign will be parsed as HTML. So if you have text that should be interpreted as text rather than HTML, it must be escaped.If you are using EJS to generate HTML code, then HTML escaping is likewise necessary. But EJS already handles this escaping for you. (But it's very important to read the documentation to ensure you understand when and where this happens!) You can use ""View Source"" in your browser to see the escaped output for yourself.> However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?The whole point of escaping *outputs* is that no matter what string the attacker puts into your database, if you escape it correctly, the recipient of your output will interpret it as that same string of text, rather than as HTML tags.Reddit does not prevent me from typing `alert(1);` in a comment, nor should it. Me causing that string to be saved in Reddit's database is not ""manipulation"", it's just normal usage. But that's why it's crucial that Reddit correctly escapes the string when generating pages.> Finally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?As long as you always use parameterized queries, and never build queries with string concatenation, then yes. (And as long as you don't do other silly things that would enable *indirect* SQL injection, like reading a value from the DB and then executing it as a query.)",teraflop,2025-06-17 22:48:16,3,learnprogramming,t3_1le0uos,False,

Also, don't forget other big areas like mobile apps, enterprise, embedded, and desktop apps - between all of those there are probably 20x as many jobs as AI/ML.Your friend is right that companies don't want people who know only one language. The ideal candidate knows several languages and can use the right tool for the job.For now I'd say don't stress about what language you pick because you shouldn't be learning only one.

The 2008 Financial Crisis caused a 2nd ""bubble burst"".Go into CS because you enjoy it, but don't forget that the reason we get paid well is because not too many of us enrolled in Computer Science because so many people thought the bubble was bursting.Computation isn't going anywhere. The need for programmers will continue to increase for decades. AI will not replace programmers any time soon (in fact, it's becoming clear that it enables more modalities for computation and we'll need more).It's silly to me that we jump right to the notion of AI replacing programmers and don't discuss all of the types of jobs that use a subset of the total skills required to be a good software engineer.Logically, before you see a programmer wholesale replaced you'd have to see Translators/Court Stenographers/Draftsmen/Accountants replaced. They do a subset of work that programmers do with deterministic rules and regulations (which we don't have).There are so many canaries that need to die before we should be concerned.It stands to reason, how can a human hope to control a tool when they can't understand the output?

my0j0my,"I keep hearing and seeing this question everywhere and want to answer this once and for all.1. The United States is a much wealthier country than most of the developed world. Look at [this link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income) of disposable income after transfers - the US is literally 50% ahead of even many wealthy European countries, and nearly double that of South Korea. So part of the reason why American wages are higher than that of Canada is the same reason why American wages are higher than that of Nigeria or Pakistan.2. Silicon Valley emerged as the global tech capital due to unique historical timing. While Europe and Asia were rebuilding from WW2, the US had intact infrastructure and universities pumping out engineers. Stanford, Berkeley, and the defense industry created this perfect storm in the Bay Area thanks to much looser non-compete agreement laws in California (read the story of the [Traitorous eight.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight) Basically a bunch of elite engineers who left some batshit crazy micromanager's firm realized they could only create their own startups by staying in California due to them not enforcing non-competes, and ended up founding Intel and Kleiner Perkins - which funded Amazon, Google, Sun Microsystems, and basically jumpstarted the modern VC scene). By the time other countries caught up industrially in the 70s-80s, Silicon Valley had already established itself as THE place for tech innovation.3. This created a self-reinforcing cycle that’s nearly impossible to break. Top talent moved to Silicon Valley → venture capitalists followed the talent → successful companies emerged → created more high-paying jobs → attracted more top talent. Repeat for 50 years. Now you have the densest concentration of tech talent, capital, and successful companies on Earth all competing for the same workers.4. The US has a massive advantage other countries can’t replicate: 340 million people in a single market with one language, one currency, and one set of regulations. A startup in San Francisco can instantly sell to someone in Florida. Meanwhile, a startup in France has to deal with 27 different EU regulations, multiple languages, and a much smaller domestic market. Canadian startups have to follow separate securities regulation for every province dramatically limiting scaling. This scale creates far more valuable companies that can afford to pay more. This effect also explains why sky high pay is available for elite engineers when adjusting for COL in India and China.5. The regulatory environment in the US is far more favorable than other countries. European bankruptcy laws until very recently would destroy you personally, while Chapter 11 bankruptcies were very lax. At-will employment means companies can hire aggressively knowing they can pivot if needed. This risk-friendly environment creates more unicorns, which drives up wages for everyone as they compete for talent.All of these factors combined together supercharge American wages across all sectors of the economy compared to other even developed nations.",Ok-Contract-2759,2025-06-16 02:27:15,1057,cscareerquestions,t3_1lcgitw,False,

mxuwfbe,"Advice from someone that was at FAANG and went to a startup.Even if you are introvert, force yourself to engage with your stakeholders.Startups go at a difference pace, and sometimes they don't rely as much in designs and documentations and they might care more about output. That's not to say that you shouldn't document and do proper design, but balance and know when to prioritize a less perfect solution that solves the problem.Also FAANG tries to build everything from the ground up. Need a pipeline to load data from X place? Cool, let's build it. Orchestration? Sure, maybe we get an open source tool that requires some time to set up. Or build our own taking a quarter to do so. Or use the in-house solution that does not rely on external libraries and no one else outside of the company knows.Startups are messy and sometimes cannot wait for that clean code that only uses internal libraries, passes compliance and security requirements in all known legislations including countries where they don't even have customers and optimize for the best design and algorithmic solution at the cost of spending more time planning.Lastly if nothing works it is totally okey to change companies or to leave the startup world to go a regular employer where the pace is the right for you. Even if you don't get a fancy stock package (that might be worth 0...), your mental health is important.PS: some startups would rather hire from other other startup than FAANG precisely because FAANG tend to house in-house tools and focus on building from the ground up instead of just using a vendor.PS 2: IMO, 2.5 years at a FAANG probes you are a capable engineer.

Sometimes you're learning a new area of the code base that takes you longer. If your manager/team don't know, they're gonna just assume you're slow because you're slow. These things should be brought up in standup, or as they happen directly with your team or manager. Being proactive and vocal is the key here.

Having experience is critical, but what’s going to get you that early experience is a mix of your credentials (such as a degree), but a large part of it is going to be your likability, interviewing prowess, and network (they can refer you for jobs). Even if WGU was blacklisted somewhere, it doesn’t really matter at this point because you can’t change the past.

mxz7kp8,"You might need to think about if you hate this specific job, or if you hate ""working"".Daily standups, time tracking, etc are all pretty standard in the industry. If those things are draining to you... even if you take a year off to refresh, you're just going to immediately get drained again once you start working again after the break.That's why I always recommend *against* people wondering if they should go for the nuclear option of taking a year off in order to combat burnout. Taking a year off will feel amazing, you'll be super happy during that year, but you're going to just burnout again the moment you get back. Taking a year off will not be a magic fix. You need to try and actually fix the root cause of your issue. Taking a year off is treating the short-term symptoms, not the long-term root cause.I hate working. I only work so that I can afford to live my actual life. I have a very clear separation between my work life and my personal life. I don't like daily standups, I don't like time tracking, I don't like pointless meetings, I don't like having to be available 9-5 M-F. I don't think anybody does. But we all do it with the understanding that yeah, some of it sucks, but we do those things because we get a deposit into our bank account every other week that lets us afford the things we actually like doing.As for where you're in your career, it's also not a smart move. You have a year of experience. That puts you firmly into the ""entry level"" category, which is objectively the most difficult category to be job searching in. When you're that early into your career, everything is very fragile. Taking a year long break now, versus taking a year long break when you have 5 YOE are completely different. When you're mid-level, you have a lot more stability, and your re-entry into the industry will be *significantly* easier.All that said, it's also not a smart move financially. Early in your life is when the money you save is most important. The money you put into a mutual fund today is going to be worth *a ton* when you're older. The more money we have stashed away, the more money we make. The rich get richer. When you intentionally nuke your entire life savings to do a big year long trip, that's a decision that extends far beyond the immediate impact. Sure, immediately you lose $X. But you also are losing a very significant amount of unrealized income that would've made if you had kept that money invested.Even setting aside the income aspect, money you have saved is supposed to be your emergency fund. Sure you can afford to live for a year without income... but what if something unexpected happens, as often happens in life? What if god forbid you get into a car crash? Now you need to buy a new car, and you have 5-6 figures of medical bills. What if your sister has a destination wedding? Now you get to decide if you want to miss your sisters wedding, or shorten your vacation to be 8 months instead of 12. What if a million other things pop up? Financial planning isn't about the ""happy path"".I'm all for taking a year off, traveling, living your life, etc. But I think you need to do it for the right reasons, and you need to understand all the costs and risks associated with it. Personally, I would wait until I had at least 5+ YOE before even considering something like that. If my job sucks, I'll find another job, not take a year off. Anecdotally I have enough money saved up to live for over *a decade* without income. But I still understand it'd be a massive financial decision to actually go voluntarily unemployed.

Interviewing is a task where working engineers are incentivized to minimize their time on it. This means that they want interviews that take them zero time to prep and “objective” evaluation criteria. Twenty years ago Google made headlines by asking brain teasers in interviews like “how many ping pong balls would fit in a jumbo jet?” This led to the rise of cargo-cult interview processes where you just grab two leetcode medium questions to ask in a 60 minute interview. If we run seven rounds like that then we can claim that we only hire the smartest 0.1% of all engineers. (Approximately none of that is true, btw.)In other words, it’s popular because interviewers are lazy and there’s a huge population seeking jobs.Here’s my advice: give yourself a time limit to practice this stuff, but take s many real interviews as you can—even just for practice (and even if you fail).

myq9vta,"Quick caveat that if you're in India, I have no idea if this applies to you.In my experience, which admittedly is only about 6 years so maybe a grey beard can correct me, is that the biggest mistake you can make is thinking that a technical interview is like a test at school. Most of the time they are not, and if you come across a company that does treat interviews that way, you don't want to work there anyway.A technical interview that's administered well and evaluated fairly is an evaluation of your problem solving process and your understanding of the technology you're working with. Here are my tips, many of which I've gotten from FAANG recruiters so I assume they're good for most of the industry:- Do not start coding right away. Collecting requirements is a good thing, and something that good interviewers will appreciate.- Always think out loud. You're better off talking through a problem than keeping your entire process internal. It allows the interviewer to hear how you arrive at a solution, what you're taking into consideration, and even allows them to interject if they have a suggestion or you've misunderstood the problem.- As you're outlining and then coding your solution, talk through what you're doing and mention trade offs. Stuff like ""I'm going to use DFS here instead of BFS because...."" will demonstrate to the interviewer that you're not just reciting a memorized solution and you understand the options before you.- Do not get nervous if you get stuck. I'm naturally a bit nervous, and my first reaction is to get very sweaty if I'm not sure what to do next and it's cost me positions before. When you get stuck, just stay calm and talk it through with the interviewer. Most of the time they're happy to provide a hint or two, and as long as you don't come across as entirely clueless, it won't count against you. I would even go so far as to say it might help you a little, since someone who gets stuck isn't using an AI cheat tool. At least they know they're not being lied to. In summary, the technical interview isn't a test of whether or not you can invert a binary tree from memory.

That said, a good interviewer should be nudging with ""You can probably start coding now"" or similar, when you've caught all the cases they expect you to.Also; I give a strong hint that I'm really only interested in the core algorithm, not the data classes, or really even method signatures.

myqk7hl,"Asking clarifying questions and understanding the problem is good... but you shouldn't just sit there and burn 10-15 minutes on it before writing a single line of code.Right now you're approaching interviews in a waterfall style. You're collecting all the requirements upfront, which takes a large amount of time, and you only start once everything's extremely well defined.Instead, maybe start approaching interviews with an agile approach. Sure ask your questions, but at the same time aim to get *something* on paper as quickly as possible. Get something going, and then ask clarifying questions as new things pop up while you're implementing. You don't need to spend 15 minutes asking questions before you're able to at least *start* coding, right? The questions aren't *that* vague. You don't need to be ""fast"", I think they're expecting you to be ""agile"" and take an incremental approach. Just like they don't expect you to arrive at the optimal solution the first time, they expect you to arrive at the brute force solution which you then iterate on to improve.I'm just hypothesizing here, maybe I'm way off base. I'm not the greatest interviewer, but my interviews are very much agile. I'm extremely communicative throughout, but I jump into running through examples ASAP, and get what code I can written ASAP. I can work out ambiguities and questions as I go.All that said, in the current job market, you don't need to be ""perfect"".

While you do have to massage a couple keywords into your bullet points, it should feel natural and not excessive. The skills sections is usually the better place for keyword stuffing technologies, whereas the bullet points are better for keyword stuffing higher-level concepts. Excessive keyword stuffing might get you through ATS more often, but it also will turn off humans. Try to strike a balance.Lastly, I skilled a summary altogether. I hear mixed things about them online, but I've found that dropping it improves the focus of my resume.My current resume is <400 words.

For your virtual/physical setups be sure you still have a good foundation on Linux, Windows, and MacOS to be most marketable globally.Learn of all the different cloud providers capabilities pros/cons for AWS, Azure, GCP and start building in the cloud to include dashboards, building metrics, building automated workflows, etc. and see if you can upgrade your skills to the point to where you can move on to a new job. Make sure you are also continuing to train using official and non-official high quality sources to keep your hard skills sharp.

During my time in university a lot of people mistook me for a CE or EE major; I had more interviews aligned with hardware work. Most of my CE & EE friends could only find web related roles.It's not as glamorous as other areas in tech, but IMO it feels more secure. The shortest I've been unemployed was 1 week. The longest was 3 months. Average has been 6 weeks. Oh, and I get to charge a premium for my age because the pool of talent skews older. Currently I'm the youngest on the team by 20 years. Chances of working in big tech are a bit lower (I have), but so is the stress much lower IMO.To put this in better perspective, while there might be 1000 web dev jobs in an area and have 1000000 people applying for them, there's probably only a measly 50 hardware jobs, but only 200 people applying to them.EDIT: want to throw some extra flavor into the mix?

myvy9gt,"Practice absolutely *does* make it better.I think you just might have unrealistic expectations about what that phrase means. It doesn't mean that if you force yourself to present, one day all your anxiety and stage fright magically goes away and suddenly you're a pro presenter.It means that the more you do it, the easier that anxiety becomes to manage, and the less it impacts your ability to present. The anxiety's still there. It'll probably *always* be there. You're not going to ""get over"" it. But you will absolutely become better at managing it.I also hate presenting. I've always been uncomfortable with it. In college, and early in my career, the anxiety would really get to me. The anxiety would hit me so hard I can feel my voice straight up changing, dry mouth, stuttering, stumbling over my words, rushing, I start sweating, if it's bad enough I'll be shaking like a leaf.With years and years of on-the-job practice in the *professional* world, that anxiety slowly became more and more manageable. I think maybe 4 or 5 years into my career is when it became so manageable I started considering myself a *good* presenter.For example, not long after I started at my current job, I got the chance to present a demo of a new feature to all of our stakeholders. It was a very not-casual call with 50+ people on it. I crushed it, I spoke slowly and clearly, I communicated my points well, it went great. I got multiple comments, and even a formal email to my manager, mentioning how great of a demo was, specifically calling out how well I presented it.The anxiety was absolutely still there. Tons of it. Leading up to, during, and afterwards. But, at this point in my career, I can manage it to a point where it doesn't impact my ability to do an amazing presentation, it's not showing through my voice, or stuttering, or shaking anymore. I'm able to keep it mostly internal. Everything that goes into presentations today are very much leaned behaviors that come from practice.Presenting is going to be a very important part of your career.

There is plenty of time to ramp back up in first-year courses.> I’m kind of afraid that this would ruin my careerIt absolutely, and I cannot stress this enough, *will not*. I know more kids who burned out after college from the endless grind throughout their whole student life than I do those who ""ruined their career"" before it even began. I actually don't know any of the latter, but a lot of the former.> Some people also told me that I can take a gap year anytime, so I should spend my most meaningful years at school with friends.I can get behind the friends part, but both a gap year and going to school with your friends are very valuable things to spend your ""meaningful years"" on, though I disagree that meaningful years as as limited as that sentiment implies. Also, you'll make a ton of new friends at university, and being a year older won't change much there. 5-10 years, maybe, but you're still a peer to everybody after only 1 year away. That opportunity won't change.Taking your gap year *after* university is way more likely to effect your career, however. You'll hopefully make some connections at school, and having those connections be fresh as you look for jobs is a big deal. Applying to jobs or grad school while you're in your last year is much easier, especially if you're interning somewhere that may want to hire you.This is absolutely the *best* time to take a gap year, but if you do take it you should know what you want from it, even if that is just time away from the stress of the student grind.",skodinks,2025-06-18 23:12:39,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1lev7tz,False,

I used both Claude and ChatGPT to create it, and according to those tools, I got a near-perfect ATS score.But then I ran the same resume through sites like Rezi, ResumeWorded, Teal, and Simplify, and suddenly the score dropped to less than half. Each of them then suggested fixes, but only if I paid for a subscription, which is usually around $40 a month. That feels kind of ridiculous when you're actively job hunting and not even working yet.I know Rezi is well-liked on this subreddit. Teal gets a lot of praise on LinkedIn. ResumeWorded pops up in a few other places too. Honestly, it feels like some subreddits are just being run by the dev teams of these resume sites.Out of all of them, I actually like Simplify the most for autofilling job applications. It does about 80 to 90 percent of the work, which is great. But again, the ""pro"" features cost $40 a month.So here's my question: **Is there a good resume tool that actually helps with both autofilling job apps and making your resume ATS-friendly without charging a crazy monthly fee?** I'm not too concerned about the resume template itself.
