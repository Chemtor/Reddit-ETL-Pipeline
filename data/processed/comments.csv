n219wr6,"Hey, [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/)! Hope you're having a good day.We are excited to announce Sail 0.3. In this release, Sail preserves compatibility with Spark’s pre-existing interface while replacing its internals with a Rust-native execution engine, delivering significantly improved performance, resource efficiency, and runtime stability.Among other advancements, Sail 0.3 adds support for Spark 4.0 while maintaining compatibility with Spark 3.5 and improves how Sail adapts to version changes in Spark’s behavior across versions. This means you can run Sail with the latest Spark features or keep your current production environment with confidence, knowing it’s built for long-term reliability and evolution alongside Spark.[https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/)# What is Sail?Sail is an open-source computation framework that serves as a drop-in replacement for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built in Rust, Sail runs \~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by 94%.# What’s New in Sail 0.3* **Compatibility** with Spark 4.0’s new `pyspark-client`, a lightweight Python-only client with no JARs, enabling faster integration and unlocking performance and cost efficiency.* **Changes in the installation command** now require explicitly installing the full PySpark 4.0 library (along with Spark Connect support) or the thin PySpark 4.0 client, offering greater flexibility and control, especially as Spark Connect adoption grows and variants of the client emerge.* **Automatic detection of PySpark version** in the Python environment adjusts Sail’s runtime behavior accordingly to handle internal changes, such as differences in UDF and UDTF serialization between Spark versions, ensuring that a single Sail library remains compatible across both versions.* **Automatic Python unit testing** on every pull request across Spark 3.5 and Spark 4.0 to track feature parity and avoid regressions.* **Faster object store performance,** reducing latency and improving throughput across cloud-native storage.* **New and improved documentation** with updated getting-started guides, architecture diagrams, and compatibility to help you get up and running with Sail and understand its parity with Spark.# Our MissionAt LakeSail, our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads, empowering users to handle modern data challenges with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By integrating diverse workloads into a single framework, we enable the flexibility and scalability required to drive innovation and meet the demands of AI's global evolution.# Join the Slack CommunityThis release features contributions from several first-time contributors! We invite you to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and engage with the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail). Whether you're just getting started with Sail, interested in contributing, or already running workloads, this is your space to learn, share knowledge, and help shape the future of distributed computing.

We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over. I've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos.

You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable).

I think this is the closest to what you're asking, but will most likely be dissapointed in the lack of functionality.\* Dagster - great if you're only doing ""ETL"" but the whole premise is kind of that every task that runs is a table in your database... not great for doing more general things even if it is ""doable"".\* Cron - just schedule with cron, what could possibly go wrong? except loads of functionality for retry/error handling and stuff\* Windows Task Manager - (yea not kidding) better than Cron, but worse than any other option. Going completely ""off script"" you could also just run DBT. We did investigate the concept of using DBT's ""Python Models"" to run arbitrary python code that would pull in data from different sources.

It would just be extra tooling you'd be learning for no gain, for your use case. They're fine tools for other situations, but it's very likely you can accomplish everything you need already using using just the features of SQL Server.Personally, I'd prefer to get everything to one server which you can do pretty simply with either Replication or Log Shipping (though there's other options too). And for any large tables that you'll be running OLAP against, you could try columnstore indexing to satisfy your query performance needs. Indexed Views, Filtered Indexes, and Partitioning are some other out-of-the-box features that can help you with performance and data management as well.I say this as someone who ran OLTP and OLAP against the same SQL Server databases, that had tables which individually had 10s of billions of rows and multi-terabytes of data, on minimally provisioned hardware (8 GB of Memory and 4 CPUs), and most queries ran in sub-second time.",jshine13371,2025-07-07 12:15:19,2,dataengineering,t3_1lsg7gu,False,

n1qlfvr,"There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**This is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. For example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, ""real-time"" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. That said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.**Complex transformations (2)**It's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.Fundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute ""incrementally"". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables ""change"" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.For an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables ""change"" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).What this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**You are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.When it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).For example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).**Hype vs reality (5)**There is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",Unique_Emu_6704,2025-07-07 02:01:26,15,dataengineering,t3_1ltg0pt,False,

n202zx2,"First, OP, your post reads like a marketing flyer with all the buzzwords. There are definite good practices for many needs but not a generic one size fits all. There are a list of things I would suggest,1. Stop calling it medallion architecture (it is a pet peeve of mine). The three tier design has been around for 35+ years. It was originally called staging, core and semantic layers. There are very few hard and fast rules around them; just generic guidelines.2. The best datawarehouses don't have any particular purpose (at least not until you hit the semantic layer). This is especially true of the core layer. It should be modeled around the business processes. As such, it only changes as often as the business does. Normally, this is not very often.3. Things happen in the processes between layers. It is not very often that things happen inside a layer.4. Staging is for landing data and, if desired, keeping the historical feed data. You should always have the original feed from the operational system so that you can trace your data back to it. The data warehouse is considered ""correct"" when it balances back to the system of record (SOR). If the SOR isn't right, you don't fix it in the DW, you fix it in the SOR and let the correction flow forward. When you change source data in the DW, you lose your chain of accountability. The Line of Businesses (LOB) or legal will tell you how long they want you to archive that stuff. Remember, they look at it differently than IT.5. The core layer is where data is kept that has been cleaned and adjusted to standard values. Different LOBs may have different abbreviations and meanings for data components. The processes to create and update the core data is where you adjust those to the standards. I tend to make my core layer in 3NF because it shows the proper relationships between the data parts without assigning specific purpose to the data. You make it fit for all purposes. This is where you also clean up things like addresses. (These can be a nightmare. Look at all of the ways Peachtree is used in Atlanta.) You also generalize things like customers, employees, vendors, etc. to generic terms like Party. You don't have to have the entire core flushed out before you use it. Just have the design as far as you can and flush the data out as project come along to fund it.6. The third layer, semantic, is where you put your data products, created from core, that the various LOBs need. When you create something like a star schema, you assign specific purpose to the data. It may or may not fit with other LOBs in the organization. Trying to reuse data products across various LOBs can be a tricky proposition and needs a bit of thought.7. Traditionally, you would only give access for users at the semantic layer. I tend to break this guideline. While still having appropriate security controls, I give users access to any layer they want. Data Scientists tend to like data a early and close to the operational data source as possible. I give them access to staging with the caveat to them the data is still abit of a mess. Regulatory reporting normally can wait a bit for the much cleaner data in the semantic layer. Those are just two examples.8. Don't ignore the other data parts like security, metadata, governance, etc. This is why you want to find an experience data architect to help you.

Data warehouses can be altered and rebuilt as needed, and various constraints can be, and are, skipped to enable high throughput performance.If you're ingesting customer data, account data, and a linking table of the two, you don't need a transaction to wrap all of that because you use your orchestrator to run the downstream pipelines dependent on the two after they've both updated.> This is extra problematic if you have a workload where you constantly trickle data into the Data Lake. ...

This data could come from a Kafka queue or perhaps some web servers streaming in logs. This is a very common workload and the kind of pattern you need for big data and Data Lakes to make sense in the first place (if not, why didn't you just run a single PostgreSQL on a small EC2 instance?).To be honest a lot of people have 'data lakehouses' that could be run out of traditional rdbms or clickhouse on a big server and the reason for that is fashion, but it does make a lot of these issues he mentions not ones that will come up for most practitioners, in the same way that people can rightly criticize transaction wraparound in postgresql but most people will never have 4 billion unvacuumed transactions to know it's even a thing. So people running at high scale who have hit issues with iceberg may be tempted to look at ducklake or whatever but they aren't compelling to companies like mine who don't actually need a data lakehouse but have one anyway and don't feel the pain of any of these issues.It's also kind of funny he complains about the bloat of a 1k avro file, my brother in christ that's a rounding error in s3.",sisyphus,2025-07-09 16:50:25,1,dataengineering,t3_1lv3xd0,False,

The fundamentals, however, change very little—unless there’s a true paradigm shift.

For uncached ad-hoc queries, set a hard timeout and ask clients to batch.

In my experience it's best to focus on conceptual know-how and broad technical skills with your main ability being 3 things. 1) listen to and deeply understand what people need, and what they mean by what they say. ask questions until you understand (with a drive to answer these questions yourself or by asking people if you can't).2) train yourself to be really good at problem solving, with whatever tools you have available. Do expand your toolset over time and if you can, but do not focus on the tool as such. Instead focus on solving the problem at hand with the tool(s) available, as effectively and efficiently as possible. Also keep in mind someone else will eventually pick up where you left off, so document what you've done in an accessible way.3) know and paint the bigger picture for yourself and others to understand more easily what is going on. This helps you to do a better job and explain what you are doing, but it also helps others to understand and match their skills to the task at hand. If you focus on these 3 abilities, you can work in any company of any size. Your experience in some tools, like Databricks, counts of course, yet less so because you know the tool technically, more so because you know how to apply it to the above 3 abilities.

n24wolg,"Hey!First, sorry to hear that. Startups are tricky to get into and until you have been working for a bit, it’s hard to know the right questions to ask to avoid coming in too early.Regarding what you should do next, I would advise against freelancing. Most companies don’t want to hire freelancers with 10 years of experience as they can simply go with a boutique consulting company. I’m not saying it is impossible, but it is a steep hill to climb and it also sounds like you could benefit working in a team environment and learning from more experienced engineers.The top 4 things that will help get the average data engineering job are the following (in this order):1. SQL2. Python3. Shell scripting (aka bash)4. Data modeling (i.e. fact and dimensional modeling)Once you get a good grasp of these, then you layer on whatever are the current popular tech stack tools/platforms like the following (no order):1. Clouding computing (AWS/Azure) - sounds like you are already good here.2. dbt 3. Snowflake/Databricks4. Orchestration (Airflow or Dagster)5. Extract Load tools (dltHub, Airbyte, etc.)These are going to be your most common tools. While there are things like Spark, Trino, Kafka, etc., not all companies use them so there is limited value in focusing on them.Next, I’d also pick up good software development tools like:1. Docker2. source control (GitHub)3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)4. Infrastructure as Code (i.e. terraform)This is quite a bit and I suggest starting at the top of my post and slowly working down.

n1ags9c,"> do modern BI systems need an analytics DatabaseTechnically no, in practice yes. The reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. ""store this order"", ""lookup this invoice"" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. This is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. ""order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment"" or ""show all customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months"".These aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.Another aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.With this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.Regarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.They key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",scaledpython,2025-07-04 11:37:57,2,dataengineering,t3_1lrcx96,False,

Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID. That solves 99% of the data interaction mismatches.Having said that you're still ultimately persisting to a database somewhere, and that part will require an unavoidable migration. This is where the hack-ish solutions are usually found. Usually here you either go with the slow-but-safe versioning approach or with a simpler 'all downstream services upgrade simultaneously' one. Or just don't rename a field unless there's a strong business requirement. Pick your poison.EDIT: there is actually a cleaner option for column renaming in *some* databases, though I personally haven't used it. You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this: CREATE TABLE example ( old_name String, new_name String DEFAULT old_name ) This effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure. The caveat being that inserts into the new column won't be visible in the old one.

In general, the team owning an application and its database should also be in charge of its change event streams and their schemas, evolving them with compatibility in mind, ideally implementing the idea of ""Data Products"", i.e. consciously designed data streams with a well-defined, documented, and stable contract.

All the time.> that I won't get a ultra fat comp since this is contract and without the bonus that full-time get it's not gonna be a crazy numberThis is ass-backwards. As a contractor, you have to pay the employer component of a number of taxes and other contributions, see below.Unlike full time employees, you are also taking on the significant risk of your contact not getting renewed at the drop of a hat. Contractors are always cut first when projects are completed or budgets get tight. Btw once there, don't let them death-march you to the finish line while only paying 40 hours per week with a promise that ""it gets better when we're done"". They will cut you off without remorse, I've seen it myself. That risk needs to get paid to reimburse you for any gaps between contracts spent looking for a new one.All this to say it is customary for contractors  to charge significantly more per hour than a full time employee, between 50% and 100% more.This recruiter is trying to pull a fast one on you because they sensed your lack of knowledge. Consider yourself informed, and use chat gpt to give you a professional phrase to let them know that you are aware that they are full of shit.

The ""terminal"" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the ""shell,"" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type ""ls"" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the ""ls"" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).SSH, ""Secure SHell,"" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.When devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\*\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\* I'm simplifying a bit. Details @ [https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/) \*\* Well, really SSH supports arbitrary data transfer.

X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick.

It's somewhere between Java and Python where it's a lot less boilerplate-heavy than Java while also being a lot more secure than Python. With these tools I have mentioned you will be able to make what you desire, and make it better than you currently can imagine.

Essentially, your backend program is responsible for preparing data to be consumed by the browser in some form or another. The simplest web program might look like this: print('HelloHello, world!')This can be run by telling your web server to run this script as a CGI program. This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. Once you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",InVultusSolis,2025-07-07 17:03:39,11,learnprogramming,t3_1ltr5uy,False,

n1gi5yi,"Having read some of the replies after this post, I think the repliers should have attempted to summarize what they think OP tried to say. When I see ""Agree"" or ""Disagree"", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.OK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write ""Hello, World"" in a dozen languages. OP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.I don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.As an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.Why is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.Programming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.Having said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.My minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",CodeTinkerer,2025-07-05 12:06:17,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ls1kp8,False,

It is from _that_ kind of thinking, that expertise develops.Well, of course, if one wants to stay a mediocre dev with limited perspective due to limited exposure to the things that are out there, then no problem! The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.If one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.Don't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know. There is tons you don't know and there will always be tons you don't know. What matters is, that you continue learning.

Some are even fortunate enough to be able to do so on the job, at some functioning organization. Most others will not or are not at organizations that encourage learning.Example: In the past I have been at an organization that had fake ""learning days"". I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else ""learning HTML"", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job.

If you're spending a bunch of time learning a little bit about a lot of different languages, then you'll never build up your depth. Pick one language to really focus on, and then you'll discover that the other languages will naturally come easier over time, as you make connections.2. In whatever language you've chosen, learn as many built-in functions (and operators, syntax, etc.) in that language as you can (with the theoretical goal of learning all of them). New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time.

n25v8on,"You're asking more questions than you think. 1.) Tech is extremely competitive. Many factors contribute to this. It used to be that tech seemed such a brain-dead obvious bet for a lucrative career that it seemed foolish *not* to attempt some sort of STEM career. This means that you can have a CS degree, several fullstack apps in your portfolio, and are able to steamroll the LeetCode 150 and not even get interviews. The constant rejection of any job search process is soul sucking, but the energy that goes into the ground level for software development makes the search a really special journey into feelings of worthlessness.2.) Gaming is the worst part of tech. That's not even discussing the wild freefall the AAA side of the industry is experiencing. The reason is because gaming is a prestige position. No matter what happens, folks like you are gonna say, ""I don't care. I want to make games."" Because games are awesome. Since the line to work on projects is out the door, management can pay less and work their talent harder. A normal tech job outside of start-ups can give a really good work/life balance, even more so if you land a remote position. That is considerably less likely for a similar position at a gaming company. Call it crunch or ""Bioware magic,"" but those companies you dream of working for know about your dreams, for better or worse. 3.) As game projects increase in scale, distribution of labor gets more distinct. You aren't ""programming a game,"" you're ""responsible for the flow of the inventory system but not the menu system itself or the actual UI of the system."" This isn't a bad thing. It's just how the sausage is made. But it can take away some of the razzle-dazzle of ""making a game."" 4.) This is an incredible time to work in a small group or going yolo solo. Unreal Engine is free, and blueprints make it a lot more accessible than raw-dogging C++. Unity is free (but don't use Unity). Godot is free. Phaser3 is free. YouTube U is free. Check out /r/gamedev and r/IndieDev. There are posts on those forums every other day from folks who are further than you in this process asking themselves, ""Am I wasting my time?"" And the answers may be illuminating. 5.) Game dev just isn't something you should be going into for love of the game if you want to make money. If you shift to the most lucrative corners of making games, you will bleed out your love, and if you focus hard on making projects of love, you won't have as much money or as much help (co-workers), and it's an uphill battle to be noticed. Undertale is the exception. Balatro is the exception. Vampire Survivors is the exception. I hope you're an exception.... but you'll probably need a day job or a rich spouse/parent. 6.) Learning to program is worth it as a skill on its own, I truly believe that. I LOVE that I can have an idea, think about how to make it, and just... make it. It's a really, really fun superpower. It was also really hard won. Understanding how all the pipes fit together beneath the user level is incredibly useful. I think everyone should at least learn to build and deploy a CRUD app without AI so they can just understand what the hell is happening.

And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.My experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...I studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.?

But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the ""perfect mathematical solution"" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.For this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.Now do the same for how many ""o""s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....So in this situation I would say that the ""goold ol' C-style for loop"" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop: // Pretend that height comes from the user. let height = 4; // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \n so that it looks // nicer inside the JS Console. let pyramid = ""\n""; let ohs = 1; for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { pyramid += "" "".repeat(spaces) + ""o"".repeat(ohs) + ""\n""; } console.log(pyramid);Some people won't like that style and will prefer a more ""functional"" or ""mathematically correct"" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough.

If your code has a bug, fix the bug, then figure out how and why you made the bug. Decide how to change your practices so that you reduce the chance of similar bugs in the future.3. Compare your code, without ego, to others' code. Compare approaches. Decide what works best. 4. When making a decision or a trade-off (for example to make a function static or not, or to use a particular data structure), explain to yourself why you are making the decision that way. Consider adding that as a content. 5. When you change your mind about a decision or trade off, figure out if you're doing it because (a) the requirements/constraints changed, or whether you just had incomplete information, or (b) you made the weren't decision at first. If (b), think about how to make a better decision next time. 6. Look for opportunities to collaborate with other thoughtful programmers. Ask for feedback. Think about it when you get it. 7. Extend these ideas of feedback and improvement to the other activities too - design, documentation, architecture, and so on. Even choice of language. 8. Read code. Read books.

In this phase, for example, I would make a mental note of technically heavy parts (e.g. code examples) but would not go through them meticulously or line by line.Step 2. Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what ""things"" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other ""what ifs"" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).After step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of ""todo list"" of sorts for what I actually need to ""actively do"" to learn that material ""for realsies"".Step 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.Suffice it to say that ""Step 3"" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a ""library"" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).For step 3 (""implementations"") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes ""unfinishable"" for me in practice because I tend to write ""too many"" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little ""checklist"" to keep progress:\[ \] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\[ \] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\[ \] (146) \*bar\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\[ \] (146) \*\*cmdline\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept ""\["" and ""\]"" as synonyms for ""("" and "")"" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\[5\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \* \[1 + 2\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \* (1 + 2).\[ \] (146) \*\*\*cmdline\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output....In my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a ""\*"" mark to mean ""it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise"", \*\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \*\*\* or more to mean it is an ""advanced"" exercise.The stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.These ""checklists"" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual ""stuff"" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE). If I'm following a book with chapter 1, chapter 2, etc. style then normally I'll name subfolders with the chapter number and the topic, e.g. ch3\_pointers, ch4\_memory\_management, etc.",chaotic_thought,2025-07-03 07:30:59,5,learnprogramming,t3_1lqgaeq,False,

That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.Find a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book ""Effective C"" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).Then, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.If you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet.

Then model a portfolio that can track buys, sells, profit/ loss, etc of individual stocks. Then build something that will fetch historical data from an online source and build up your historical data. Might also need that to analyze the data for cleaning: find holes, potential anomalies, normalize for splits, etc. I'm not familiar enough with crypto to know the analog, but hopefully that gives you a way to begin.

In the U.S. an example might be Minneapolis or Atlanta. Both cities have lots of software jobs but nothing like Silicon Valley, Seattle, or NYC.

Memory stays constant and predictable unless you create new objects manually.However, in case of recursion, each function call gets **its own stack frame** in the call stack. This stack frame stores local variables, return address, parameters, etc., When a recursive call is made, the current function is paused and pushed onto the call stack. Once the base condition is met, the calls start returning one by one as the stack entries are popped.Now you might understand that if you go too deep using recursion, it will cause too much of piling on the stack and if the input is too big, it would end up creating a **StackOverflowError**.Hope it is helpful :) I'll may be write a detailed blog post on my Substack and a link here later when it is done.",Intrepid_Macaroon_92,2025-07-09 03:36:50,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lv1uqx,False,

A person who has gotten good at leetcode is often pretty passionate about programming. Programming is a wide field. There are people whose jobs look a lot more like leetcode problems. It's also critical to understand the basic tools you would use for leetcode. You should develop a basic intuition for time complexity. I always think that working on improving at leetcode problems will make you better. To get really good, you need to have a deep understanding of the language and everything happening under the hood. But there are really 2 factors here: getting good at solving difficult problems, and getting good at optimizing simpler problems.

n218if7,"Sorry if this is not what you're looking for but here's a brief summary using C as an example because it is kinda the base and most other languages like java and python run by doing something with C.First, computers have CPUs, they are the things doing the instructions your code makes. Code and CPU instructions aren't a one to one mapping, the way a language works is it must be translated to CPU instructions. In the case of C the thing that does this is called a compiler. CPU instructions are whats known as binary code. Assembly language is a CPU specific programming language that takes CPU binary code and puts labels on specific binary strings that mean do this thing. For example ADD. CPUs also have access to registers, which just hold a few bytes of values, for example a 32 bit machine 4 bytes 64 8 bytes, etc. These registers are what the CPU uses to do math with. So ADD register1, register2 would take the sum of these two numbers and put it into register 1. Assembly is a 1:1 mapping with that architectures binary, meaning if you learn to understand it you can write code that tells the CPU exactly what to do. C is an abstraction on assembly, meaning that it let's you write code, the compiler does something, then you get an assembly file. For your use case you don't need to know how this file works, but the general theory is pretty simple, basically it builds a stack, which is just like a pile of variables, and the compiler writes the assembly in a way that instead of variable int x, it's base of the stack + 10 bytes or something. And that is how it knows where x lives. But again you don't need to know this right now. What you need to know is that when you compile C code, you get an executable, a file you can run directly in the command line, or just run like any other windows exe or other executable I forget the mac and linux extensions. You can do this in command line or depending on the code treat the executable like it's own app.Python is a little different. Python itself is a language built in C. Python does not compile into an executable, python is an executable. When you click run, all it does is the command python3 yourfilename.py. python3 is an assembly file that opens the file yourfilename.py, reads what you wrote, and then figures out what to do with the text and updates things accordingly. You CAN compile python, but it's not popular, not efficient and kinda weird.

Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. You should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. You will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. 5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. 6.) Be proactive. You can’t fail if you go hard at all the above every single day. The above 5 steps should be your full time job until you land a job. It might take time - but you’ll land something eventually - in fact it took me almost 2 years to land a job after learning how to code and following the steps above after 6 months of coding. So don’t give up.Bonus tip: Never think that a job is below you. If you get an opportunity that sounds shitty but it’s software related, take it - because you will be able to build credibility to add on your resume which will help you land that dream job much easier down line.First dev job I took was a shitty TA gig at a coding bootcamp.

But one year of learning puts you in this weird spot where you have some skills but not enough real-world experience to stand out.Something Ive seen work is:1. Don't just build projects, solve actual problems. Instead of another todo app, find a local business that needs a simple website or build something that scratches your own itch. Real problems = better portfolio stories2. Toronto has a decent tech meetup scene. Start going to Js meetups, hackathons, even just coworking spaces. The hidden job market is massive, probably 70% of junior roles never hit Indeed3. LinkedIn is brutal for juniors but try reaching out to actual developers at companies you like. Not HR people. Find the devs and ask genuine questions about their stack or recent projects. Some will ignore you but others might give you solid advice or even referrals4. Consider getting some structure around your learning. Self-taught is awesome but companies sometimes prefer candidates who've been through more formal training because they know what they're gettingThe qualification thing is mostly in your head btw.

Worse comes to worse you meet some cool new people, best case you start getting tips.\- integrate your projects with the LLM companies APIs. Considering how popular these tools are in tech right now, you'll have a bit of an edge over people making boring boilerplate apps. If you want to be hired, working with these APIs will look good when you're demoing your work and show you're on the cutting edge.\- Don't let doomers discourage you. Tech is a very boom-bust industry. The dot-com bust didn't kill software development, the latest trends won't kill it either. Get good, show your passion and you'll stand out over a sea of apathetic grads who are just in it for the six-figure payday.\- Lastly, most importantly: only become a front-ender if you genuinely love it. Programming and software development are one of the best jobs in the world, but after a post-pandemic big tech hiring boom we're seeing massive layoffs and salaries are shrinking.

In the `SDL_Init` scenario, each bit (flag) corresponds to a subsystem you want to initialize.`SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)` passes a collection of bits where everything is off (`0`) except for the one bit that corresponds to the video system, therefore signalling that is the only thing you want to initialize.The main advantage of using bit flags over booleans in scenarios like this is that it gives people using the library a very convenient way to specify a combination of flags they want to enable.

We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:```some_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);```Now this function call only says hello.This way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params.

And they can control anything that can make use of a condition, from a switch to a loop and in some languages, even a computation (eg in C++ you can use the false==0, true == 1 in a computation to zero out a term: its valid to say integer = 3\*x+2\*y + 42\*(x>0) ) to conditionally add either 0 or 42.

In that case, you'll have to *think* about how to solve the problem you're faced with. And there is always a possibility of making a mistake in your thinking. Those are the mistakes that tests can help you catch.To use your example of input validation: Maybe you have a set of ideas in your head about what kinds of inputs are valid, and what inputs are invalid. And maybe you write a regex that matches only valid inputs. The test exists to make sure you wrote that regex correctly, so that its behavior matches what you had in mind.(You could argue that if the regex is wrong, you'll notice the problem just by running the code and experimenting with it.

For clean code, you should really use these constructs for only the associated purpose above, even if you can use the other, since the names ""semaphore"" and ""mutex"" come with these connotations.Additionally, just sticking to using them for these purposes will basically automatically help you avoid problems with differences in reentrancy and and who can call up()/unlock().",TheBlasterMaster,2025-07-09 06:24:03,2,learnprogramming,t3_1lv13v4,False,

The point is to exercise my very meager skill in the new lang with tiny, manageable problems.Later once I feel bored, or like I'm wasting time with the ease of the problems, or I want a greater challenge, really any negative dull non-transient feeling, I move onto building a very small program. Usually it solves an imaginary problem, but if I could do something I could conceivably use (still small!) I try to do that.

n1evc3g,"To add to what u/dmazzoni said, `Predicate` is just an alias for `Func`, a function that takes an argument `T` and returns a `bool`.You can write it as:```Func isGreaterThanTen = x => x >= 10;```And it will work.Another use for these is if you want to swap in a function depending on some logic.```Func isGreaterThanTen = x => x >= 5;Func isGreaterThanFive = x => x >= 10;Func filter = someCondition ? isGreaterThanTen : isGreaterThanFive;List higherThanTen = numbers.FindAll(filter);foreach (int number in higherThanTen){ Console.WriteLine(number);}```And these come in handy when dealing with methods that do things to a similar set of arguments, and have some sort of controlling input.You can assign class methods to Funcs if the type arguments match. Note that the last type argument of a `Func` is the return type. So `Func` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`So instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:```Dictionary> handlers;void Init(){ handlers.Add(""A"", HandlerA); handlers.Add(""B"", HandlerB);}void Handle(string value){ if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler)) { var output = handler(input) } throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));}private SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value A...}private SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value B...}```",rupertavery,2025-07-05 03:05:22,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lrzkl0,False,

You have to use a pointer. Arrays have never become full first-class values in C. You also can't assign one array to another: int x[2]; int y[2]; x = y;The reason, 50 years ago, was that it would have required emitting too many assembly language instructions from that one statement (and passing a large array as a value can overflow your stack); the restriction has never been lifted because `strcpy` and `memcpy` work better for most people.*As for why it's a pointer to the first character of the string and not to the string: pointers in C are designed to be the interface to arrays. They're how you access any element of an array, any time you do. An array, when used as a value, is always converted to a pointer to its first element; adding (or subtracting) an integer to a pointer moves it that many places through the array, and, of course dereferencing the result accesses the selected element.`x[i]` is syntax sugar for `*(x + i)`, which means (assuming `x` is an array): take a pointer to the first element of `x`, move that pointer (hopefully forward) `i` positions, then get the element at that location.So once you have a pointer into an array, you can access the whole array from there.* Citation needed, according to anyone who's ever passed the wrong length to `memcpy` and smashed the return address on the call stack.

You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.But at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.All companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible.

n244cc2,"Be specific. Not landing interviews…. or interviews but no offers?Let’s break it down.If you’re not getting interviews, it’s likely a resume or positioning issue.What I’d do in your shoes:Post your resume here or in r/ExperiencedDevs, from this account or a throwaway tied to another email.Anonymize whatever you need. Be upfront:“I’m applying to jobs like these [link a few], and here’s my resume. I’m looking for candid,  ruthless, feedback from actual hiring managers (not students) on how this stacks up for the roles I want.”DM people on LinkedIn who:Aren’t currently hiringAre in roles you’d want down the lineOr are in adjacent functionsAsk for resume feedback. Keep it low stakes. Let them know you’d appreciate the help and would happily send a Starbucks e-gift card as a thank you.The more blunt, no-strings-attached feedback you can get from people in industry, the better.If you’re getting interviews but not offers, figure out where you’re falling short, technical or behavioral.Technical:Leetcode is helpful, but also practice mock interviews.At my company, solving everything perfectly doesn’t guarantee a pass. You’re expected to communicate as you solve, treat it like pair programming, and involve the interviewer in your thinking.The goal is to simulate collaboration, not just code in silence.Practicing this with peers (even students) can help a lot.Behavioral:Honestly, I’ve rejected way more candidates for behavioral than technical.A lot of people sound like they’re full of it, as they are trying to sound impressive. Trust matters more than buzzwords.People hire people they want to work with,  not walking Medium articles.Have a bank of common questions and a few strong stories you can adapt to different prompts.Mock interviews are great here too. Try to do them with people who are already working if you can. Pramp might be worth checking out.consider if there are any tutoring opportunities, even if volunteer. Tutoring was integral for me to get better at interviewing Harsh but helpful trick:Use a question randomizer.Record yourself answering questions for 30 minutes straight while looking into the camera.Watch it back later. You’ll catch habits that are distracting or undermine confidence — over-explaining, filler words, nervous gestures, etc.I did a training once where we were recorded while doing a simple task, it was wild how different I came across than I expected.If the issue is losing momentum applying…An accountability partner can seriously change the game.Just one other positive person who’s also putting in the work — it doesn’t matter if you’re applying to the same roles.If either of you lands something, amazing. But in the meantime, check in regularly, share progress, give each other feedback, and keep each other going.I’ve seen this work really well for people who were burning out or losing steam.Getting a good job is honestly partially luck — being the right person at the right time. So staying alert and consistent is key. Don’t disappear from the process.On the topic of networking:I find networking with peers way more helpful and natural than the expected networking with hiring managers which is so one-sided. Finding people in your position with a good attitude to share knowledge could help you now ofc but it’s also a genuine connection that could later have a more tangible benefit. Similarly, helping others selflessly whenever you can is a sure way for that person to have your back when you need it. Plus I think its good karma that will come back to you. One last thing on mindset:If I were you, I’d take messages from devs in the industry, even when they push back on negativity, as good faith attempts to help, not as dismissive.Whether the market is tough or not (which I think most of us wouod agree it is), dwelling in that energy just doesn’t serve you and a bubble of negativity can seem comforting but it’s just wasting your energy. I’ve seen it happen so many times: people start blaming the market, stop improving their resume, stop applying, stop learning, and eventually give up entirely. They never ask if there were valid reasons they didn’t get the job. Sometimes.. by the time they get an interview, they have already convinced themselves there is someone better (which comes through) or are just SO nervous, as it seems like the only chance, they fumble. That energy could be spent productively, like you’re doing now by asking questions, trying, improving.I know some if not most of this you already know but hopefully there is at least one helpful tip in there. Good luck! Lastly, check out Recurse Center. It seems like a great way to reset and grow with no pressure, surrounded by curious devs.",Prestigious_Sort4979,2025-07-09 03:48:46,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1lv0mhk,False,

The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.I speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities.

If you want to move to SF, look for jobs in SF, and only move once you find one you like, that meets all your personal criteria.As for COL, AI, and google searches aren't good here. Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.Compute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in. That gave me a realistic number of what it would cost for me to move, and what my COL hike would be. Find apartments you would *actually* live in.

Depending on the place you're employed that may not be an option. IE if you're in a faang and they pay you a dump truck full of money every year that may not be an option for you. If you're expected to push through the burn out or get pipped out, you may want to start looking for a job with better wlb and take the pay cut. There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.But, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap. For now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. When you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else. If that means you go do something else or change your physical location then that's what you do. You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.Once youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much. It's something we do to get ahead and it can be good but if you want to be at your best you have to compromise with what is possible. Don't ignore your warning signs.

How much you prioritise the business goals over the technical goals (etc, etc).Do you feel comfortable taking what the team is telling you and communicating that to leadership (spending time on powerpoint, and project management software to communicate this). Do feel comfortable interpreting and communicating changing demands from the leadership to the team?I will regularly talk about what I don't know and the path gaining that knowledge. Having said that tools like NotebookLM and equivalent have made it much easier to become a rapid expert on a given subject.Gaps in CVs depend heavily on how you sell it. Selling it as T shaped individual is an amazing way to make yourself look better not worse. I've taken large amounts of time off and live a fairly unorthodox life (nomadic) and if anything it's helped my career rather than hindered it. I'm seen as a little bit crazy and edgy and that helps break preconceptions.Things like taking up sailing or other activities can be a great way of demonstrating that you have depth. Writing and art are both things that are very shareable and show passion. Being an amazing writer can be a great way of enhancing your (introvert focused) communication.Long and short though is that I wouldn't lie at all. I would definitely take everything you believe about yourself and spin it to explain why that would make you a good product manager. Every development experience that exposed you to good and bad product management. Every time you stepped in to wear that hat.I'm expecting there to be a real hybridization of some of these roles anyway over the next few years with the increasing impact of AI, so enhancing your skills on this side is a wise move regardless of whether you become a fulltime product manager.",vert1s,2025-07-04 15:01:31,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1lriuft,False,

n1e2umn,"Honestly, I think you're overthinking this, and honestly, your ""weaknesses"" are actually strengths that most companies desperately need more of. The best PMs I've worked with were the quiet ones who asked penetrating questions rather than the ones who dominated every room. At Slack, our most successful PM was an ex-engineer who would straight-up say, ""I don't know, let me find out"" in stakeholder meetings. That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. Your dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work. The buzzword thing is spot-on; the best PMs translate complex ideas into simple language that engineers, designers, and executives all understand differently. If you want to level up your PM knowledge systematically, Product Alliance has some of the most comprehensive interview prep and frameworks I've seen. Their modules cover everything from product sense to execution and they're particularly strong on teaching you how to structure your thinking without relying on empty jargon. Don't fake being someone else. The industry needs more thoughtful, technically-grounded PMs who ask hard questions rather than confident performers who can't actually ship anything.",rencie11,2025-07-04 23:42:42,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1lriuft,False,

n1zrr14,"Not fully remote but hybrid. The little things I 'collected"":* As others have said, do not roll out of bed into the computer directly. That is a way to make the WFH day worse than an office day.* Wake up at the same time as you would going to the office. It's tempting to wake up at like 9 AM. Don't.* Hooray! You have just freed up a block of time you can use to do whatever you want instead of walking to the office and sitting in a bus. I usually use it to start my morning slow. I wake up, go take a shower, put on fresh clothes, go prepare a real breakfast, and then eventually get to work. No rush. I am trying to wake up a little easier and actually fit more into this. Like, if I am able to get up earlier than usual on the WFH days, I could probably get the right temperature for a quick run and bike ride before the usual routine.* I have time flexibility. If I wake up early and I don't feel like doing the full morning routine, I just do a minimal one, get to work early, and call it a day early. The only requirement we have for WFH days is that there are two small blocks of time (1-2 hours each) where you **must** be available to answer a call. As long as you are available to answer a call during those two blocks, nobody really cares how you organize your time.* Set boundaries with extreme precision. It's very easy both to overwork yourself and work through your lunch break, and do the opposite - just go do something else and take an extra long break that ends up biting you. I try to use timers and alarms.* If possible, I try to get out of the house right after work. Quick walk, going to some event or gathering with friends, run some errands, etc. I find it's beneficial if you ""simulate"" the same separation rituals you get from an office day, except they are not time completely thrown into the garbage, but time slots for things that are good for you, or tasks that you should make anyway.Extra goated golden bonus tip:* If I want to take a break, instead of just going to get a coffee and use my phone or talk to people a bit as I'd do in the office, I do a quick errands break. Like, I do a part of an house chore I need to make. Load up and unload the dishwasher, clean the kitchen, something like that. This has two benefits: 1) it keeps you active and away from your screen, which is the best way to get a break. 2), when done consistently, it frees up a surprising amount of free time.

At Metana, we've definitely seen this progression, people who get comfortable with their first language but then hit a wall when it comes to designing scalable systems.The thing is, you don't need to go back to school for a full degree.

It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.Before any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.Get your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.Sign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.As for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.Ask questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up. Edit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. Also find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with.

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.This is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.Instead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. Generally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.What you want to avoid is generic ""entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models"".Now, what can you do to enhance your resume:1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. 2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. 4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the ""under the hood"" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff. And realistically, it's a new enough field that there should be plenty of room for someone with a Physics PhD to find an area within it where you can get yourself up to speed and be dangerous.",dfphd,2025-07-07 14:48:42,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1lttg8h,False,

Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.So again, don't think ""well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD"", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.Instead, I would look for jobs where you can say ""typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this"", and those are the jobs you want to apply for.

I thought I had some advantage because of my 1 year intern + part time experience in a big corp while being a student, but it figures that most of these ppl hiring for junior positions dont really care about internships you did as a student. I've applied for 600+ jobs this past 5 months and got 4 interviews - half of them is not paid positions - which they kind of made fun of me trying to validate my internship experiences. Most of the time i thought ot myself 'its fine, maybe i can show off some of the passion projects I've been developing to the companies and maybe they'd hire me' but the field I worked on for these 3+ years by myself via passion projects didnt even made me get an interview on that specific field. It is a tiring, exhausting process but i still apply with hope in my heart to see if i can land a job which might get me out of these paradoxes in 2-3 years.

Being in a consultative role also develops valuable skills that can be applied anywhere.For Option 2, I'd be direct about asking the startup some hard questions: What's their runway looking like? How many months of operating capital do they have without additional funding? Profit sharing sounds nice, but startups often don't reach profitability for years. With 80% of startups failing, you want to know if you'd be joining during a stable period or right before a cash crunch.The hybrid requirement after a year is also worth digging into. Is this flexible if you're performing well? Often, these policies are more flexible than initially stated.If stability is a priority right now, Option 1 with your existing company offers that while still providing growth opportunities.

n21bf5p,"My situation is a little different from yours, only having done SDET / SET roles for \~10yr, but my general thoughts are:\* Most companies have an ebb and flow cycle where they believe in SWEs doing their own testing, finding that doesn't work, hiring SDET/SET, and then going back to SWE testing. I think we're leaning towards the SWEs doing their own testing part of the cycle at the moment because people are being pushed to wear multiple hats with the job market as it is\* Having QA-related roles on your resume can be very polarizing. Some managers believe that to be a huge plus, especially if you ever go back to SWE, because that indicates that you will test your own code along the way, and take testing into consideration when you plan anything. Others think that a SDET/SET is unable to code as well since they do QA along with other work. It's hard to say. \* One more thing that comes to mind is that most places that have dedicated QA generally operate on inflexible timelines. If you're burning out, having those kind of hard deadlines (which can be hard to meet due to a whole host of reasons) might not be as pleasant as you expect.All that being said, and noting that a lot of that sounds negative, I personally enjoy it. Places that value quality will value the fact that you're bringing in perspective about testing that is often overlooked, especially when you're bringing these discussions to the table early instead of as an afterthought. I have been seeing some roles pop up on LinkedIn and otherwise, so I'd like to believe that as hiring picks up more of those roles will open up as companies flow back to having to build up quality around projects that have had minimal testing..",Spokenlore,2025-07-08 18:58:38,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1luwr1b,False,

Like one of my now regrets was quitting my job at this really easy QA job I had where I finished a week's worth of stuff in a matter of hours. Cause in retrospect I wish I stayed there and used that job to cover expenses while I work on a masters. Or even go back to school to pursue a different career,downtimeredditor,2025-07-08 19:40:13,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1luwr1b,False,
n24hzd2,"Man, 8 years in and feeling burnt out from the mentorship and leadership load, I totally get it :') The constant context switching between coding and people management is exhausting.Here's the thing tho. Jumping from SWE to QA might not solve your core problem. In most places, senior QA engineers end up in similar mentorship roles, training junior testers, leading automation initiatives, and being the go-to person for complex testing scenarios. You might just be trading one set of responsibilities for another.QA automation is definitely growing, especially with the shift toward CI/CD and DevOps practices. But the day-to-day can still involve a lot of hand-holding with manual testers and coordinating with dev teams. The technical challenges are different but the leadership expectations often remain.Have you considered more specialized SWE roles that might reduce the people management aspect? Like backend-focused positions, DevOps engineering, or even transitioning into a more technical architect role where you're solving problems without direct team management?At Metana, we see a lot of mid career folks looking for these kinds of pivots. Sometimes its not about changing disciplines entirely but finding the right company culture that values deep technical work over constant mentoring duties.",darkstanly,2025-07-09 05:29:32,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1luwr1b,False,

n1u7wbn,">Are such on-call rotations common in this industry?On call is common, yes, but yours sounds worse than an average on call. Every 3 weeks (especially 24/7) is absolutely insane and would burn me out easily. Even putting you as primary on call as a junior at month 4/5 is pretty aggressive. Most companies ive been at , usually 6months is the minimum before you get put on the rotation and I'm more senior. Also, it's a load of crap that the seniors get to be on call less just so they can work on features. I've never heard that before When you look for your next role, simply ask the hiring manager what on calls are like there, and try to get as many questions answered as possible. To survive your current on call, try to look into the root cause of your pages. See if youc an try to fix the core issues so you're not getting hammered (or creating tickets and advocating your manager for people to work on it). Some pages tend to also just be noise, do you get a lot of pages that people say to just ignore? Maybe that's something you can just remove entirely etc. Unfortunately youre just going to have to survive, but honestly if i were you, i would get out cuz every 3 weeks is going to burn you out.",lewlkewl,2025-07-07 17:12:38,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1ltzgxc,False,

There are rare cases where you won't have on-call, but that depends on the product you work on.There's lots of way to 'alleviate' the pain of on-call. More mature companies generally do a 'follow the sun' model, where you are responsible for on-call during business hours, and after business hours, some other team takes over in a different geographic location, during their own business hours.There's also the aspect of product maturity. The more mature a product, the more stable it will be (usually). If you're working in a start-up or fast-paced environment with a product that hasn't had the chance to stabilize, then yeah.. on-call is going to suck. That's just how it is.TL;DR find teams or companies with more mature products that do something like a 'follow the sun' approach to on-call.

n1u974i,"Sounds like you are part of a small project (maybe small company). Larger projects are better about the on-call rotation. They are all different so there is not one way to do it.I've only done it at one company, though im getting prepped to do it at my current job.My first company in FAANG was a major project with offices in US and India. So what theyd do is there was about different teams for every product in the project. My team had about 30-40 people in the US and about the saem in India and it rotated betrween each person. So I had to be on-call for aabout 12 hours once a month. At first it sucked because we had no automation at the time so every issue was hard to find and any customer issue had to get on a call with the customer for a few hours. It sucked. But then automation got better and dropped the amount of customer calls because issues were getting resolved before the customer realized it. Usually the issues in this on-call were onest that had to be resolved immediately.There was a 2nd on-call that lasted 3-4 days, this was for less serious issues that could wait a couple days to resolve. But people in this on0-call would get a lot because it was mostly minor issues. My current job, does weekly on-call but from what I hear we will get all types of incidents. But it's mostly to be owrked on during business hours unless it's a tier 1 issue which has to be worked on immediately.

n20x2ws,What is your team doing to address these pages after it is done? If you are getting paged for an issue I am assuming it is impacting customers internal or external. The team should be taking steps to make sure issues that caused the pages never happen again. That is how you drive the pages down. If your page numbers are not going down over time (except for new feature launches that may have problems) there is something wrong with your team's operational culture.,kakarukakaru,2025-07-08 17:54:34,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1ltzgxc,False,

Speaking to the process, I think 9/10 companies that interview you for a role and bait and switch like they have aren’t good companies to work for. What they should have done is clarified the job you were interviewing for before the first round and certainly by the second round. Clarifying the job you were interviewing for at the offer stage is scammy. There are situations where that could make a lot of sense for everyone but this doesn’t sound like that.

I was up front from the beginning about my interest in the staff position: I think it's important to lay the groundwork early - if you go through everything at one level and suddenly ask for the higher, that won't go over well.

n1difly,"Everyone is going to tell you something different and biased. Here's some perspective. It comes down to what you want out of it,.the actual program offered by the uni and the industry where you live.If you want to be creating new AI / ML algorithms or pushing the boundary further (effectively research) - most of those jobs exist in US / Europe (if you aren't there) and require PhD level research experience and significant output in research. It's also an intersection of computer science and maths. Most people here are more theoretically maths/stats heavy. Think advanced stochastic theory, measure theory, etc.If you want to be.in the camp of majority of people here / software engineers that want to be implementing, building, or having sufficient conceptual knowledge around AI / ML - then you can get it from any combination of uni, self study, work and practical experience.Most unis offering these programs are masters by coursework. Some might have a small thesis component or project at the end. A masters by coursework is just units/subjects similar to your undergraduate. Most people take them to shift into a new field. A master by research is for those considering dipping their toes in research - effectively ""create new body of knowledge and how to build on others research"". It's more likely for someone to upgrade their masters by research to a PhD. They are two different purposes.For your situation - You could consider a masters coursework and supplement it with practical experience and self study. The industry moves fast and you still won't learn things that people talk about now that trendy like mcp, ai agents, LLM, rag, all those tools people talk about like cursor / Claude etc. These are just implementations / practical applications and they will change quick, some will be adopted and accepted and other dropped.The masters program would be useful if you need a planned study program and if you wanted theoretical foundation that underpin AI (provided the uni program unit) such as statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning Bayesian theory...
