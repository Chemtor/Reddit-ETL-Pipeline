I am in same situation and the simple answer to this is ""It's time for a new adventure, either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.""Further Details of my past couple of weeks- I'm an 8-year experienced Data Engineer who has been working at the same organization for the past three years. I was quite satisfied until I was asked to conduct technical interviews for few of new future team members with 4-5 years of experience each. The interviews went well, and I shortlisted several candidates for further rounds.Last week, I was pulled into a call with HR, the Team Director, and PM, where I learned that they had shortlisted two candidates, both with around 5 years of experience. However, both candidates turned down the offers, requesting better compensation. The salary they rejected was approximately $11,750 more than what I currently earn annually. I would like an extra 800$ every month, Who wouldn't?This revelation devastated me. When I discussed it with friends, everyone told me there's no point trying to negotiate a raise with my current organization. They advised me to either start interviewing elsewhere and leave, or only discuss a raise when I have a competing offer in hand. According to them, there's no easier alternative - either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.Most companies show no empathy toward their employees and view them merely as workhorses.

msxfok2,"Ways I would tackle it:1. Denormalized counters in your post record (small scale)You add integer columns like `comments_count`, `likes_count` directly on your posts table.Whenever someone adds or removes a comment (or like), you increment/decrement that column instead of re‑scanning all comments.Most relational databases (Postgres, MySQL) can do an atomic `UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = ?` cheaply, especially when that column is in memory.This would be my first pick given you can ship this in minutes with zero infrastructure beyond your main database.2. Sharded or distributed counters (mid scale)For “hot” posts with millions of comments/likes - think celebrities, viral content etc., a single counter can become a write hotspot.You break it into N shards: UPDATE comment_counter_shards SET shard_count = shard_count + 1 WHERE post_id = ? AND shard_id = rand_between(1, N)To read the total, you sum over those N shards. N is tuned (often 4–16) so no single row fights over locks.This solution pays off only when your single‑row updates actually become a bottleneck (once you hit sustained write contention). Until then its probably an overkill.3. In‑memory caching (Redis, Memcached, etc.)Maintain the “current” counts in a fast key‑value store. On each write you atomically INCR or DECR the Redis key (e.g. post:123:comments).Feed readers pull from cache, falling back to the database only if the cache miss occurs.Each 1 & 2 solutions could be combined with this method for low-latency reads.I am about to drive - lemme think of other ways, I will edit and add to this post if something else comes up.UPDATE: Some more thoughts:To keep write latency low, counters could update asynchronously (e.g. via a message queue).You accept sub‑second lag in the displayed count in exchange for high throughput (which for non-YMYL stuff like like/comment count is acceptable).Also worth noting, there are specialized data stores with native counters like Cassandra and Bigtable from Google. They support atomic counter columns across distributed nodes, so you offload the complexity of sharding and locking.But if you are at that stage and its your own service, you probably made it and I want your job :)Anyways, its weekend.

mtqpww7,"You really should be developing within a feature branch on git and once your own unit testing is completed you move it over to dev branch.The way I’ve developed things at least has been a little more strict due to internal requirements that lower level envs (dev,test) contain NO prod data whatsoever. This is fairly common though, so the thought of cloning a prod table to dev environment could get you in trouble. Generally speaking though, any transformative logic that needs to be worked out can be done via specially curated files containing essential data points and scenarios within the data. Or you can simply write up a script against prod data so you can ensure your features make sense and then plug that in. Though in my experience the latter is less common.And yes during deployment phase you would ensure that these parameters that point to specific environments would be replaced with the relevant environment that the code has been merged to. Dev -> Test, Test -> Stage, etc… keep in mind though that there are times where dev, test, stg, prod are not simply different schemas in a larger database but are entirely different databases/workspaces themselves and have maintained the same naming convention so sometimes nothing needs to change. An example of this would be databricks workspaces with exact same naming for database objects for each individual environment and when you deploy to other environments you just ensure the target workspace is where the code is being deployed.

msze1ti,"I'd say that an Inmon approach (at least originally, the man keeps evolving his ideas and publishing new books) compares better as a data architecture, much like a data mesh, more than Kimball (at least when he started, that guy kept on expanding his concepts as well).Inmon's DW design favored more or less 3 data layers:- A raw layer, that started as a landing zone and eventually evolved to an ""operational data store"". Originally is way quite simple, but an ODS was supposed to provide operational level reporting capabilities, with even near real-time if possible (it was quite visionary when proposed in the 90s);- A Data Warehouse layer, which was supposed to have a fully integrated view of the business for analytical purposes. This matched mostly his definition: ""subject-oriented, non-volatile, integrated, time-variant collection of data"". The DW layer is rarely, if ever, accessed by BI tools or end users. It is the single source of truth that feeds the specific databases (next bullet) supporting analytic and decision nerds. As such, it tends to be more normalized (not really full 3NF, but in that direction), as this would make it more reusable for different sets of requirements - including future ones.- Data marts: these are tightly scoped to the needs of specific use cases. For reporting and BI, it's common to model those as Kimball star schemas; for data science, other formats, even files, are possible. For specific reports, it could be a very custom thing.This actually is the source for a medallion architecture, and also became a full data architecture before Kimball came up with the concept of a DW using ""conformed dimensions"". I built quite a few DWs using Inmon's approach, and I can tell you they evolve well and survive a lot. The main challenges are:- Figuring out a good priority for which domains/subjects to build first. It's no use trying to model the whole DW layer before delivering something, but people still try that.- Knowing how to capture a business in its entirety in a data model. Eventually, as you iterate, you'll find inconsistencies, redundancies, things no one thought about, politics, etc. Solving those to one common model is hard; letting them pass reduces the value of the DW layer over time, putting g the entire architecture in check;- Compound effort of having data go through 3 layers (or more) before delivering value. Again, this is people just assuming they have to adopt and build it all before any value is delivered. My approach was to first do a high level business mapping in domains to identify opportunities and prioritize. The first 2-3 deliveries usually had very light landing and a straightforward middle layer model, generating stars was straightforward, fast and cheap. As the platform grew, complexity would be added but not as a burden - it is a way to actually represent the business and deliver higher-level analytics. The kind that needs cross domain analysis, decision and optimization. Doing that on top of starts is incredibly harder (been there, done that).Inmon kept evolving his design, addressing data quality, unstructured data, real-time and others, but he lost importance as the world moved to cloud and Hadoop - even though he published about those and his designs were perfectly applicable there. It's more that everything pre-cloud and pre-agile was sort of left behind by a new generation.Edit:typos",bobbruno,2025-05-18 17:11:04,25,dataengineering,t3_1kpm88w,False,

mt58el1,"Wait, am I understanding correctly: did you set up Airflow such that it is pulling DAG code from multiple repos? That's what the ""git submodules"" thing makes me believe is going on.My advice: do not do that. Unless you have literally thousands of engineers, **just do a monorepo for Airflow DAGs**. There are few reasons to make it more complicated than that and there are a lot of upsides to the monorepo in terms of how real world projects develop, in addition to just relieving yourself of the deployment headache (which is the #1 reason). Those other reasons are:- a single commit can touch multiple DAGs across multiple projects- projects can share Airflow-level utils- sync dependencies in Airflow runtime- external DAG dependencies- easier to run a local version of the whole instance if your Airflow isn't dependent on CI-specific things to glue things together- less magicSo save yourself the headache and just do the monorepo.From there, deployment is very simple. Every major Airflow deployment method, including the Helm Chart but also MWAA and Astronomer, just mounts the `dags/` folder as a volume, and so deployments that do not introduce new dependencies are as simple as updating the folder.External systems that get called by Airflow can be in their own separate repos, but know where the dividing line is between those systems and Airflow as an orcestrator: KubernetesOperator, CloudRunCreateJobOperator, EcsTaskRunOperator. Yes modifying the `argv` of a container's command requires two commits across two separate repos, but that's not a big deal (cross-DAG commits are way more annoying when they're cross-repo; within-DAG commits being cross-repo is really not that annoying. The monorepo really wants to optimize for that case to be easier).Also, never ever use git submodules.

mswmi2c,"A major purpose of a 'landing zone' is that you don't do any processing of the data before storing it, so that you can just immediately store it however you received it and move on. Once you've got your own copy of it, you can rerun any processing on it as much as you like.Nothing going to a landing area should be running for 24 hours, and unless you're directly querying from some tabular source like a database you generally wouldn't be saving directly to a tabular format.You would be aiming for something like storing every individual response (or page, in this case) as you go. If they're large enough, you save them as s3 objects in their own right. If they're small, you send them to something like Kinesis Firehose, which will automatically buffer objects up to 15mins/300MB and then save them out to s3.If you want to track where you are up to, and you are running all this in a single process, you can just have a json object in s3 that you overwrite with the currently active data, so that if something stops or crashes you can pick up from the last request. If you have multiple concurrent processes or it is updating very fast, you can store it all in a tiny DynamoDB against a particular key.---Microbatching ingestion into a single duckdb database sounds off. You replace objects in s3, so every write will be a full rewrite of the file. If you wanted to make data like this available to duckdb for processing, you would be writing append-only to some other file format that duckdb could read.For remote data instances with updates like this, you might use duckdb as the processing engine, but you would be using an open table format like deltalake or iceberg to allow you to do write transactions on the data in a way that is more amenable to the way object storage works.",azirale,2025-05-18 04:31:30,17,dataengineering,t3_1kpaisy,False,

Learning from other people is a crutch and always will be. I always thought in my previous career ""well, I'll just learn from this person until I can stand on my own two feet, and everything will be fine"". It never happened. I never improved and ended up hating my job because I became more experienced on paper, but in reality, my knowledge didn't correlate with my experience. And it showed.When it came to DE, I taught myself and found it liberating not feeling like I was stuck, waiting for somebody else to hold my hand all the time. I could just look at a piece of work, play around, get a feel for it and then continue from there. Every time I learnt something new, it stuck much harder because I discovered it myself rather than somebody saying, ""Make sure you sort out XYZ"" before I had time to think about it.On top of that, it's another incentive to go ahead and start building instead of another excuse to sit on social media all day, pushing you into the greatest trap - the illusion of learning.My recommendation is to stop chasing the ideas of other people and develop your own. Knowing what's good and what's bad comes with time. It's really common with beginners that they want to be perfect from the get go, so go out of their way to try and seek knowledge from people who claim to know more.

So I think it could be useful where: \- A: you need to interact with non-technical staff\- B: You need controls (e.g. security, special data processing rules, high complexity) that warrant implementing via code and having that version controlled-- think GDPR compliance on automating marketing data workflows.\- C: The data you are working with relies heavily on 3rd party connections (e.g. CRM data from Hubspot).I'm still exploring, so would love to hear what others are thinking, but I think it's one of the best tools out to build quick AI workflows while having some form of version control and staying on a local machine.",on_the_mark_data,2025-05-23 17:20:30,1,dataengineering,t3_1ktc6so,False,

You can set up error workflows to capture and send errors to a logging service, and also store general execution data in this logging service, but if you have a staff capable of managing this why are we using low code? In my org the people using N8n don't do this. I'll get slack messages and then have to comb through the GUI's very limited execution log screen.People also use it for use cases where it's not needed because they don't know any better (e.g. scheduling a query in your warehouse). You can probably tell I really detest working with it and look forward to not dealing with it at whatever my next job is.",aksandros,2025-05-23 20:14:29,1,dataengineering,t1_mtvx9uo,False,

mty4gug,"Practical advice: You mention wanting to organise your files but didn't state a clear end goal. You have to first ask yourself: why is it important and/or useful for me to organise this? What benefits do I hope to achieve? Answering those first will give you some guidelines on what needs to be done. Then from there you can pick specific techniques. Though it's important to note that having a 'random stuff' drawer where everything gets put in with no sorting can actually be useful since it cuts the cognitive load of having to sort things. If you haven't found a compelling reason to organise it after 15 years then it's a strong indication that you either don't have a strong reason to do it, or the system you currently use - albeit informal - is workable enough.Ok now I get to put my autistic hat on: As an autistic person I have at times enjoyed organising things 'for their own sake'. Whilst it's been fun and I learned a lot, the end results were never anything \*that\* useful. If you're anything like me then just be aware of it. It's fine to spend time and enjoy the process but be cautious about any perceived future benefit.The system I like best for lots of random stuff is the PARA method. You can start by dumping everything into one big 'archive' folder and then either move things out one-by-one into an organised place, or you can move things ad-hoc when you 'touch' them. e.g. if you find yourself needing to use an old python script or look at certain docs, then make sure to move those into the organised structure when you do so.",nNaz,2025-05-24 02:46:06,2,dataengineering,t3_1kro76m,False,

mt5lc2z,Not able to answer the first two questions but can answer the second two as I made this transition myself:3. the technical requirements switch from analyst to engineer can vary greatly however I would personally say you’re best to approach it assuming you have a huge amount to learn. SQL will help but data engineering can require experience across a broad scope of systems depending on the role and will require significantly deeper understanding of software engineering best practices. 4. The market (at least where I am) for data engineers is very up and down at the minute. On the whole the salaries are typically much better but the definition of data engineer varies quite a bit between businesses and a lot of business do not see a huge amount of value in data engineering as a practice.

It depends, if you’re a legitimate DE then it would be more technical unless you’re a pipeline monkey. You typically have to have advanced knowledge of SQL and some programming language. Tableau would not be a very convincing Transform skill as a DE like it would be for a DA. You’d be better off learning dbt, Python, or Spark.4.

When next time the same user calls the api with the same columns they do not go trough the pain of compiling it. And as one suggest previously wrap the dbt in a service with the queue.

Instead of having to think through how to handle things like incremental loads, materialization, and workflow, you can just focus on the model definition. It shifts the focus to creating and maintaining the business logic instead of the mechanics of getting data from a to b. You write your model to show you the output you want, and it takes care of the rest. We use dbt in our databricks pipelines currently, and it makes management of 100s of models MUCH easier. Also, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects. Ultimately, dbt is a great framework for maintaining all the business logic that goes into semantic models.

And why do you specify your filter conditions in lambdas? Spark has no way to know what you're doing inside the lambda -- it passes in the entire row so it cannot know what columns are being used, or for what -- so it can't optimise anything. For example, if you had a DataFrame with the tablename, api, and offset cached, then when you chain a proper spark filter off of that it can avoid making API calls for the other tables in the first place, because it can apply the filter earlier in the sequence (as the value never changes). It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.Also, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check.

And IMHO the possibility to stretch such a huge costcenter over time by paying for usage was the main driver cloud became so popular.

mt8cbqt,"[I’ve answered this same question before](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/s/rsxWDC8zme) and my answer is the same, so I will just quote it here.—As a personal recommendation I have found that learning how to program is best facilitated and supported by using a language that can be used to interact with some personal interest that the learner has. This allows you to use an existing passion to help fuel a growing passion— or, more literally, you will be less bored and more curious and driven to experiment and learn, because you have the ability to apply your learnings to something you already enjoy.In my case, I believe this to be true because I picked up JS to write some user scripts that helped me automate some tasks as a customer support worker. This experimentation of using programming to help me make my life easier lead to me learning other languages for other things, but in general having that user script to work on while I was doing customer support allowed me to actively identify and experiment with new features that could make the job easier for me. That experimentation is what made me keep going with coding, because of the instant gratification provided by my new feature making my job easier.Ultimately, if you can think of an every day thing that you do that you deposit a significant amount of time into, if you can find a language that will allow you to effectively “hook into” and augment that interest of yours, you will find it a lot more rewarding and satisfying to write code.Practically speaking, with Java or Python as your two presumptive options, if you’re interested in AI you will have to use Python. On the other hand, I know so many people who have tried python and just given up on coding, while I know so many people who have gotten into Java development because they wanted to write mods for Minecraft— this Java development then blossomed into a career in software development.If you play Minecraft, learn Java.

You have to get used to writing smallish projects (and mediumish projects and then eventually largish projects). The act of writing and debugging (thinking your way out of the maze you are in, tacking bits on an existing solution, rewriting / refactoring code) is how you learn to get better at writing code. Start with something basic. text based calculator for instance. The thing I like to work on with people is a dungeon crawler. a text based game where you walk through a dungeon. it teaches you all sorts of abstractions (whether you prefer OO or not) and it's a good way to write a solution first, then later on realise there is a better way and to have to rip the guts out of your code and write it again but better.look up gameloop (it looks a little like:) public void game() { while (true) { // for keyboard (and non-realtime): Command c = getUserCommand(); c.perform(player, world); // do stuff like ""go north"" or ""pull lever"" world.update(); // have other game objects do their thing. String map = world.render(player); // draw an ascii image of the local map, player gives player position // this isn't a very good game loop per se but it is a rough start. System.out.print(map); } }with something like the above you can practically do anything. for realtime rendering there are changes you need to make, but for a roguelike the above is sufficient. Build just a single room you can walk around in. (a room is for instance a 2d array with wall or non-wall . player position dictates where the player is. have the player move around. write that as code and you can then move on to player colliding with walls, items being located in places. write other mobs, have mobs move around. create doors, pitfalls, have mobs attack or have them calculate field of view (and if they see player they move toward them). all sorts of things.then when you've build a number of these things you'll find it's inefficient. and then you start learning when you rewrite parts to be better/work better for what you want of them.I would stay away from leetcode problems and the like. try to work on something actual.if the above isn't it for you, try doing something that parses an excel sheet or does stuff with sound. or create a small paint program that lets you set pixels. just pick something you actually are interested in because that helps you with thinking of what next to add.",josephblade,2025-05-21 23:27:20,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ks72oe,False,

Most of the top software engineers make a ton of money at work and then spend their free time with their families and friends—they don't hang around on Reddit all day typing comments about OOP. Typically it's the jobless, the students, or the juniors with low responsibility at work who have extra time and motivation to hang around on programming forums all day. Exceptions apply of course, but that's the general gist of it.2. Most of the best software out there is written with OOP, Java, C++... Basically with everything that you don't see as being fancy or recommended on Reddit.Can you find a connection between these two points?Could it be that the real seniors who are working on real projects and being paid top money are still using OOP, Java, C++, etc.? Or to be more accurate, they use whatever works the best for the task at hand, whether that's OOP or FP or something else entirely?Meanwhile the ""seniors"" who either 1. haven't quite grasped OOP *yet*, or 2. gave up after they failed once instead of thriving to improve —are the very people who are most active on these forums, trying to justify their opinions to others, religiously hating the most successful and widespread paradigm of all time instead of learning the ups and downs of each approach.So why do these people hate OOP in the first place? Because it's easy to get wrong. It's an insanely potent tool when used right, but it takes years of experience, active studying, experimenting, and trial and error to get right. They've seen horrible inheritance trees based on the ""is-a"" vs ""has-a"" rule, which completely fails if you use it with the English language rather than the physical constructs. Some examples of this going with English are:- Wrong: A football player *is-a* human -> `FootballPlayer extends Human` - Correct: A human *has-a* job or a hobby -> `player.hobby = football`- Wrong: An invisible video-game enemy *is-a* video-game enemy -> `InvisEnemy extends Enemy` - Correct: An enemy character *has-a* opacity -> `enemy.opacity = 0.0`- Wrong: An android phone *is-a* phone -> `Android extends Phone` - Correct: A phone *has-a* operating system -> `phone.os = android`These are just some of the examples where following the English language fails you, and where you should rely on the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle instead. Of course people have taken this too far to the other extereme as well, going as far as erasing all of language support for inheritance and forcing inheritance through composition... which sucks as well.

The engineering world is in a bit of a strange place right now. With the rise of AI and a shaky global economy, tech jobs have become harder to find. But I do believe this will shift in time.One big challenge is that many people involved in hiring aren’t developers themselves. They're often finance-driven decision-makers who don’t fully understand the nuances of engineering work. That can make things frustrating — especially when the hiring process includes unrealistic coding challenges that don't reflect real-world development.These days, there’s a dangerous expectation that every dev needs to be ""elite."" The truth is, tech moves fast, and everyone has different strengths. Some are more technical, others better at architecture or communication. The role of a developer is evolving — communication, collaboration, and adaptability are becoming just as important as coding skills. The era of working in isolation, coding for hours without interruption, is mostly gone.Still, there *will* be jobs. The industry is in transition, and once it stabilizes, opportunities will open up again.

mtduilu,"Perfectly normal.It takes a lot longer than you might expect to get good at this. School teaches you a mixed bag of general things in order to give you a solid foundation. Also LeetCode and that type of programming doesn't really translate to real world projects. The best way to get better is by doing simple projects at first, and add complexity over time. For instance, I used to be a trainer for cyber developers in the C programming language. We used to start them off by having them build a simple calculator. What they didn't know is that we weren't really grading how well they could add and subtract numbers, but rather how secure their code was. Can I break it, or exploit it in some way? Are they checking for underflow and overflow? After a couple failed submissions they would finally catch on and understand what they needed to do to pass the tests. Next would be FileCalc, which is okay do the same thing, but all the equations are stored in files, and I want you to give me a file of all the solutions. Again we'd test them by giving them bad files to see if they were doing proper error handling and such. Then there was ThreadCalc, which was okay now do everything using a thread pool. And NetCalc, okay now do ThreadCalc but over a network.If they could do all of that we figured they had learned enough to be on the team and contribute. But it takes time. You do most of your learning through failing, not succeeding. So take everything you're doing right now and understand that it's hard and that's okay. Nobody should expect you to be able to contribute immediately unless you're experienced.Also, we have quite a few west point grads, and they struggle as much as anyone would. So don't feel like you're going through it alone. It takes time to get good. A lot of it is about pattern recognition. Over time you'll start to see what are called ""code smells"" and you'll immediately see things that look weird and out of place, which means you're improving. If you can look at code you did 6 months ago and your immediate reaction is: ""this is garbage"", then that's a tell-tale sign you're improving.

The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then ""compile"" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.I use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.I recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working.

You have Django, which is a powerhouse of a framework, making development of any backends very secure and reliable.Golang is very nice to use. Static typing makes it a lot easier to work with. Also, the performance is almost comparable to language like Rust and C++, especially considering how much easier it is to write good code in it. I personally quite like the community behind it. They seem to not like using too many dependencies, which alines with my personal preferences. Building a solid, thoroughly tested API in Go can be done exclusively using the standard library. It’s also very efficient. Small scale APIs and apps can run containerised on a few dozen megabytes of memory, which I imagine could be very good for freelancing, as it will lower cloud bills for clients. Unfortunately there is no Django-styled batteries included framework in Go, which can make development of smaller projects harder.I’m also going to add one more suggestion - Java.

Also, it has been running literally on billions of devices for decades, making it pass the test of time with flying colours.

mtwd7ys,"I can give you some advice, brother. What you should learn really depends on what you want to do with programming. Try answering these two questions:1. What kind of job or project do you want to do?2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?I'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.Python is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way :face_with_tears_of_joy:Apart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too ""at the beginning"", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",CostRepulsive693,2025-05-23 20:30:52,10,learnprogramming,t3_1ktsh09,False,

To be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, ""just allow yourself to get into it"". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere. Lua is often used for modding games as I understand it, so you could maybe play around with some of that. There are frameworks for building web applications in Lua.

You need to make mistakes and learn from them. Write something bad, and then go back and refactor it now that you know better. It’s a slow, iterative process.

I’d learn stuff alongside friends who were struggling with a topic over the summer (it’s how I started with the basics of Vulkan after it released in 2016, though, I’ve not evolved much beyond a beginner in graphics haha). I found projects worked for me. If you want something driven, give the puzzle and algorithm sites a try. But I think you should try to build out a few small projects that interest you.

For example, 'talk about a time when you found yourself running out of time to complete a project'. Each behavior question should be treated as an opportunity to send a signal about yourself - You are smart, work well with others, take ownership, think deeply when solving problems, etc. Review the Amazon Leadership principles (there are 14 of them), and try to include at least one in every single behavior answer. * Technical interviews are a learned skill.

msypakq,"I was classified as learning disabled in school. This was back when home computers where just starting to be a thing. 1. I had issues with fine motor control, basically it hurts to write. The biggest issues with this is that my penmanship sucks, and I trained myself to get to the point quickly. I would write just enough to get the point across. This didn't help my English grade when I need to write a three page paper. So I had to constantly go back and be more descriptive. My family got a home PC and this helped, but I still needed to write out all my answers for tests.2. My short term memory was found to be lacking. This frustrated my parents because if I wasn't actively listening to them when they told me to do something I would literally not remember what they said, or often not even remember we had a conversation. Of course the way around this was they had to make sure they had my full attention before telling me to do something.3. There might have been other stuff, but I don't remember. Looking back on school, I did well in Math and Science where I would understand the concepts and apply them. I did poorly in History and English where there is a lot of memorization.I am now the lead programming architect at my company. If people have bugs they can't solve, they come to me. If people don't know how to write something, they come to me. If there is a bug anywhere in our code base, I can fix it, not because I remember exactly what that code does, but I understand how that code should work.When programming people start off learning the language, which is needed. The only way you are going to remember the language is by using it, by writing programs. I ""know"" many many languages, I will learn a new one for fun to see if I like it better than whatever is currently my favorite, but if I don't program in a language for a month, I have to use google to refresh my memory.Truthfully, anyone can learn a programming language, but to really program you need to be able to think logically, you need to be able to break big problems down into smaller tasks, then break those smaller tasks into even smaller tasks. You keep doing that until those tasks are small enough that you can logically perform them in a programming language....any programming language. The language is just a way to tell the computer what it needs to do and there are many ways to do that.

msyotb0,"Learning programming shouldn’t be about memorization. Programming is the one discipline where it’s actually encouraged to rely on the internet as much as you want since it would be impractical for us to remember every little detail about every language and library we use, and most programming languages and libraries have extensive documentation online.Once you are past learning the fundamental structures of code (data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.) everything you want to do with code is just a few well-constructed google searches away. Learning to code is as much about learning how to do efficient research as it is about learning actual coding.I will say, having short term memory just emphasizes the need for good coding practices even more, which many beginners tend to neglect. Good coding is all about foresight, and sacrificing time in the present to save you work in the future. Make sure you take the time to write yourself clear and helpful comments at every step of the way while coding and whenever you see multiple ways of writing some code, choose the way that is easiest to read; this will save you so much mental strain down the road. You should be able to tell generally what a piece of code does just by looking at it for a few seconds, even if it’s like you’ve never seen it before.You’ll also learn there are ways of structuring your code such that you don’t have to remember how the whole system works all at once in order to understand one piece of it.

That can lead to code that's inefficient, or it can lead to not being able to understand why your code isn't working.Note that CS programs tend to teach very little about tools, frameworks, and libraries that are currently used in industry.

Schools focus on the fundamentals that are universal and timeless.But yeah, there's nothing different about the programming. It doesn't matter whether you're a CS major or not.

mtfkp21,"There are a lot of different engineering disciplines, all of them have their own ""take"" on programming.Of course the basics that you mention are shared: data structures, algorithms, stats, linear algebra, discrete math, etc are pretty much university year 1 and 2 kind of stuff for almost all technical disciplines. You need all that as a basis for advanced learning.However, where it differs is in how programming is used. I come from the angle of a computer engineering and robotics/mechatronics dropout.In CS you have a lot of focus on how to think about computation and the nature of the algorithm. Stuff like Big O / algorithmic efficiency, memory efficiency, information theory, a lot of Claude Shannon's foundational works, also cryptography. And of course, in the 4th year, operating systems, compilers, databases, consensus algorithms, network programming (which is a totally different kind of beast).In contrast, in Engineering, you will not need any of those things I mentioned in the CS paragraph.Computation in engineering, from a mechanical engineering perspective, is more about modeling, simulating physical properties/materials, extremely large scale numerical simulations (I think only the theoretical and experimental physicists deal with larger numbers) (aside: IEEE floating point is a mind bender!). Almost all of mechanical engineering programming challenges are safety related, as in if the program crashes or miscalculates, people die and processes explode or buildings come down or bridges collapse. So there is a lot of focus on ""tried-and-true"" methods of programming - no ""seat of the pants"" stuff there.The best C programming teacher I ever had was a mechanical engineer, and almost all of his programming experience comes from programming the feedback loop that controls a large scale blast furnace at smelters - the program uses measurements from various sensors, and then controls the smelting process. He drilled safety issues (error check, bounds check, input sanitisation, improper casting, huge possibility of improper pointer usage, saturation vs wraparound on overflow, pair programming, code review, using static analysis tools, etc) into every single lecture, because if the program crashes or miscalculates, thousands of litres of molten metal would spill and destroy the plant.Some of our homework assignments in C contain a magnitude more error checking and recovery code than actual executable code - of course this is not realistic for programming in the workforce, but his point of view is that no one else will teach defensive programming after we get out of his class, so might as well make us do it over and over again as homework until it's drilled into our brains. The evaluation criteria for this kind of assignment is him and the TA trying to hack/crash/exploit the program (for example, one easy trick is for them to give some unexpected inputs and seeing how your program deals with that, which is a basic form of fuzzing). They write up their report for you, and if you fix the issues they give the mark back.Mechatronics folks usually deal with real-time circuitry and need to complete evaluation loops within a pre-determined amount of time. Think bipedal robots that need to respond when it is about to fall - how does a robot recover from that situation? Things like aerospace engineering also fall into this category: how does a programmer create a ""fly-by-wire"" airplane program so it can correct and adjust pitch/yaw/roll, etc. within time and physical limits.In these use cases, recursion and dynamic memory allocation, both mainstays of CS oriented programming, is forbidden.Some Electrical Engineers programming to do DSP (digital signal processing) - where you take in a massive amount of data and you filter stuff out - DSP programming is kind of like creating filters and sieves out of computer programs - it sounds glamorous but it's actually quite a bit of grunt work. I think one of the exercises is like - take this huge sample of RF random noise and filter it until you can hear the satellite transmission downlink. It's like using programming to find needle in a haystack.I don't know what the chemical engineers need from their programmers, but I'd assume it's also about simulation, chaotic/stochastic processes.As you can tell, Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of computing, and engineers use programming to work with the real world.The real world is incredibly messy and our math doesn't always work. That, added to the incredibly strict safety tolerances makes engineering programming a really niche job - I personally don't think you can be a great aeronautics real-time programmer and a good database programmer at the same time.As for your last question: are you into physical processes (blowing things up, making lights turn on and off, melting aluminum and using a mold to cast wheels, etc) or are you into computing, calculating, storing and searching information?It's perfectly ok to be into both - just keep in mind that there are these 2 ""ways of thinking"" when it comes to programming.The last bit of info is that in the real workforce, we work in teams: everyone brings a bit of their own ""special sauce"" to the team and that's how everything in the world is built/done.Even though the ""lone programmer"" is a trope in TV/media, that almost never happens in real life.If you become a programmer, you *will be working within a team* - so one of the most vital skills over everything else, is learning how to work with people who are different from you: they have different skillsets, different communication methods, may speak different languages, etc. That's probably the most critical skill out of everything: learning to work with other people.Hope this little overview helps and good luck!",barkingcat,2025-05-21 06:38:06,3,learnprogramming,t3_1krouk0,False,

I am unfamiliar with the word ""placement"", but it would probably help others if you mentioned you're from India so you get replies from those in India, otherwise, you tend to get an American or European perspective.I think it all depends on how well you know a programming language and DSA. There are two kinds of people (more than that, of course). There are those who want to learn a few key skills and be done with it, with a guarantee they won't have to learn anything more. I call this the ""barista"" type. You can't learn to make lattes and cappuccinos right away, but once you do, you're set. There's not a whole lot more to learn.Then, there are those that like to learn new things. It's this type that tends to do better as a programmer. I'm sure there are some jobs that don't require you to get past a certain point, e.g., there are still Cobol jobs and Cobol programmers, and that isn't changing so rapidly. But for the most part, you'll likely have to learn something new. For example, I was programming in Java a lot, but if I were to do AI programming, I'd likely have to switch to Python.Sorry there aren't any clear cut answers. If you ask ""If I do X, will Y happen"", the answer is, it depends on how you do X. That is, it depends on how much you master a programming language.To delve into this just a bit deeper, there are two aspects to mastering a programming language.The first has to do with learning the language, which means syntax/semantics of stuff like assignment statements, arrays, functions, classes, etc. It also means getting familiar with popular libraries. You may also have to learn a build tool. More recent languages tend to assume you're building a bigger program with multiple files.The other part--and some would argue the more important part is to learn to think algorithmically. That is, how do you solve a problem. That part can depend on skills outside of programming. For example, if you are trying to trying to simulate gravity for a physics engine to be used in a video game, then you need to know some physics. You have to express the physics as code.Just because you program, you may lack the expertise in what the program is about. Then, there is a kind of vague goal of trying to organize your code well.

Yes, they can't handle load, but you'll only have one client.) You'd use the localhost loopback to put the client and server on the same device. If it's OK to do everything in-browser, you could write everything in Brython and use standard HTML forms and JavaScript APIs. Making the client and server communicate is not that much harder. You'd do custom handlers. GUIs usually have at least two threads anyway, so you'll have to do something like this regardless. It might be slightly easier to install Bottle at that point, but the standard library can do it.There's Gooey which automatically converts command-line applications into GUIs. It's pretty easy to use. That still has to be the workflow you want though.Since you're doing you a budget tracker, you could customize [PySpread](https://pyspread.gitlab.io/).

In the late 90s everyone talked about programming being replaced by drawing UML-diagrams and then emailing them to India or other countries with cheaper labour, and they would then do the actual programming.Then languages like Python began to become popular, and everyone talked about programming not being just for programmers anymore, because now everyone could learn to program, and there would be no more need for dedicated programmers.Then a lot of low-code and no-code tools became popular, and everyone talked about that soon there wouldn't be more need for programmers.In the late 2010s everyone began talking about how everything was already built, and in the future there wouldn't be more need for programmers, since most of the jobs would be simple adjustments to existing frameworks.And now, in the mid 2020s, everyone is talking about how in the future there won't be need for programmers, because some tool will handle everything for us. The problem with those tools, as amazing as they all are, is that they can only solve ""yesterdays problems"". As soon as some new technology, or a new business-problem, or a new oppertunity comes along, they aren't up to the job, and programmers have to step in.So go ahead and focus on your interests - if you enjoy learning, programming, robotics, AI or whatever, you'll become good at it, and it will help you learn more stuff! Programming is always a good thing to learn - most of us won't work with the technologies we began learning on, but getting into the mindset of solving problems and building software, will always be a good thing! Even when the tech changes - only specific tech-knowledge becomes obsolete, but usually you use it to make learning the next thing easier!",peterlinddk,2025-05-20 10:26:12,31,learnprogramming,t3_1kr0ku2,False,

Recently there has been an economic shrinking and quite a lot of software developers were laid off in 2023 as AI was emerging, but AI is not replacing ALL developers, it's making them a little more efficient, so companies may need fewer but that's still not as settled as some may think.

As each file was moved, its CRC was noted, the files was tar compressed, uncompressed at the other end and CRC verified and result logged. This went on for years and there was never a file integrity error. A side benefit is that the Unigraphics modeling team lead had a privileged process to retrieve a file from the other end of someone messed up a model.

mtkoz0x,"Some people have suggested a compressed file system. That’s an option, but I think your approach is still better due to portability and forwards compatibility given your use case and the business intent I’m assuming from your post. A compressed file system is typically linked to its OS family and soft linked to its specific filesystem version. Every OS maintainer starts out with the intent to honor the contract of every feature of every filesystem they ever made, but they typically get sketchier and sketchier as the specific filesystem gets older and older. Meanwhile, zip and a few of its brethren have been portable across all operating systems for years and you can simply move a file from one machine on one os to another generally without any functionality issue. Zip also contains built in CRC protection in the file which although not the most modern has been sufficient since its creation. The standard open source ‘zip/unzip’ available on Linux and macOS have long contained the same ‘test’ command that pkzip first introduced. Ie - unzip -t file.zip verifies all the CRCs of the files and the redundant copies of the metadata. In actuality it’s probably just checking the metadata, decompressing all the files in memory and comparing them with the CRCs. That verifies the files without taking any additional file storage. See if you can figure out how to directly trigger the ‘-t’ functionality via your library. Or alternatively just decompress them into the null device which accomplishes about the same. There are still some theoretical gaps in the integrity of this system though. If the original zip run received bad data or the data was corrupted while in memory than the files in the zip will be corrupt even though they verify. You should definitely be doing this if you care enough on a machine with ECC ram. Disk errors at just the wrong time could also cause problems in the chain that go unnoticed. In the ideal case you would have your own verifiable CRC produced at the very start of the chain where the source files were. Then you have something to check against anywhere in the chain without needing to go back and compare against the original files. For example if you produced a sha256 hash of each file at the source machine you could then check against that hash anywhere in the chain.",xilvar,2025-05-22 00:46:27,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ks61v4,False,
mtkqihe,"For your first question, just create a checksum before compressing the folder. Then decompress it and check the decompressed file against the checksum. If it's good, you can be sure the file compressed correctly.You should also create a checksum for the compressed file as well. That way you can verify the integrity of the compressed file whenever it's transferred somewhere.Ideally your system works like this.1. System identifies project file to be archived on the working server2. System generates checksum for project file/folder4. System verifies the checksum against the project file (redundant check, just to be sure)5. System compresses project file into archive file6. System decompresses archive file into decompressed file7. System checks the decompressed file against the checksum to verify compression worked properly. (This checksum can be discarded now, since most compression algorithms have internal checksums. You could keep it if you want, just don't confuse it with the checksum for the archive file.)8. System generates checksum for the archive file9. System verifies the checksum against the archive file (again, redundant check)10. System transfers the archive file to the archive server along with the checksum11. System verifies the transferred archive file against the checksum12. System deletes project file and archive file on the working serverIf a verification check fails at any point, you just repeat the steps after the previous successful verification.As for other compression tools, gzip and bzip have better compression ratios that zip. They're standard tools that are widely supported, so you shouldn't have any issues working with them.There are other compression tools that offer minor improvements to compression ratio or speed, but are less popular, so unless you really *need* that extra file space they're probably not worth using.Finally, I see that you mention the archive is on a raid disk which is good, but I just want to encourage following the 3-2-1 rule for backups if you aren't already. If these files are critical enough to warrant all this work, the least you can do is pay a bit extra for offsite storage to ensure you can recover if the archive server blows up.

Learning to segregate side effects is a skill that takes a lifetime to learn, but it really helps if you don't have to use @Transcational 8 times during a HTTP request's execution.

Bounded-everything. To know how much scale you need, know how many resources you need. That's easy when you write code that needs a fixed amount of RAM, or that runs in a fixed amount of time.

First, there's those that are being forced to get a tutor because they are struggling. Maybe parents are pushing them. This can also work the other way where parents are trying to get their kids ahead. Second would be an older learner who just wants to get started. They are likely more motivated.The difficulty in tutoring is whether students want you to do their homework for them, or do their projects for them. This is cheating. If you don't want to facilitate that, you should indicate that ahead of time.For example, you can explain a scenario to the student where you say ""If you say to me 'I have to turn in this programming assignment by tomorrow, or I'll get a zero, and I've barely started!', I'm going to tell you, no, I don't do that.

There's always been a bottleneck at juniors as juniors don't make money for companies, they cost money. Companies train juniors so that they can become seniors later and the number of seniors wont go down (causing senior salaries to spike), but now lots of companies are betting on AI becoming the new Seniors of the future so many have stopped investing in creating seniors out of juniors. I""d say this is incredily short sighted, especially considering the limitations AI is still showing with complex architecture and languages/frameworks/libraries/etc that change more often then the AI models are updated. But I may be naive on that.>Will this subside, and is a CS degree becoming less worth it?Depends what happens with AI. Either it will wipe out most development jobs and we'll all be screwed, or it wont and we'll all keep working. There's no way to know because there's no way to know what the AI will be capable of next year, let alone five years down the road.If I had to bet, I'd bet on it taking 5-10 years and then AI will be wiping out most jobs, and either societies will have some form of UBI, or societies will be devolving into violence and anger at the rich.CS degrees are already becoming worth less (not worthless) as our salaries are dropping over the past 3 years, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't learn CS, it's still a good job and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Plus if you like programming, it's a great hobby that you can use to build things you want/like, or create entrepreneurial ventures with. If AI takes over, there wont be money in it, but there wont be money in almost anything at that point, so you're best off still learning what you enjoy and hoping those in positions of power are smart enough to see the violence coming and giving people a basic living wage paid for by the AI and the rich, then we can spend our free time coding whatever we want for fun.",floopsyDoodle,2025-05-20 23:26:14,61,cscareerquestions,t3_1krj6jc,False,

One thing I can say, from having worked on large creative projects is that organizing people is a *very* big challenge. Every ten or so people you add to an organization, the dynamic will change rapidly and you'll need to retune the operations. This is before the complexity of market strategy and building an MVP to sell.Do try organizing! But keep it small and sustainable. As an independent founder coming from layoffs, you probably don't have *any* meaningful ""runway"" to fail and bleed out money until the core business solidifies. In the mean time, while you're getting that set up, make sure you take on a boring job that pays the bills.

Imagine all the time you spend coding is instead spent reading tax documents and crunching numbers in Excel.

Just like with software engineering, this really depends on your company, team, and role. Furthermore, work hours are consistently brutal across the entire industry during tax season; expect 80-100 hours a week in the first quarter and 60+ during the extension period. My WLB as a SWE is significantly better than all the accountants I know.Lastly, accounting is just as vulnerable to being replaced by AI as our own, which you probably don’t realize because you don’t spend time in those circles and/or they don’t complain about it as much as we do.

mu21g2q,"Speaking from a meta perspective, as someone who’s been working as an MLE for 3-4 years now. Companies want the perceived benefits of ML without investing into it. Their expectation vs reality is different. Obviously all executives think that throwing an LLM backend into a clean UI is sufficient for an AI-powered product, but it’s not. Even a “GPT wrapper” requires significant amount of information retrieval, validation, logging and operational signal collection, etc to not have generic AI slop polluting their product, data, and their image. Even if you don’t train an LLM from scratch (which is what most uninformed executives think ML is), there is significant overhead in solely serving the LLM for your specific use cases. That’s why AI startups, despite being ridiculous and “just a GPT wrapper” still have a legitimate case for a product. Those “other processes” are extremely nontrivial. Most companies are not even willing to invest into a “GPT wrapper”.Now consider something one step further upstream. Let’s say you want to train custom models (not necessarily LLM’s, but SSD’s, classifiers, methods of statistical inference, etc). Maybe you want to power a recommendation system or intelligent search, or you want to automate classification of support issues, etc. This requires ETL pipelines to take raw data and transform them. But this requires your web infrastructure to have instrumentation for real-time analytics and collection of usage behaviors. My point is, delivering machine learning into product is an organizational effort. Starts from the top-down. That’s why the golden data trio of titles: machine learning engineer, data scientist, data engineer, will never be as prevalent as a SWE or analysts in numbers. You could have VERY knowledgeable and talented MLE, DS, DE, but if your org isn’t willing to be data driven from the top-down, these functions will not drive any value, to no fault of these people. A company not collecting data and expecting these functions to succeed is like telling a SWE to build software for a company, but not giving them any servers to deploy on or having no critical infrastructure: CI/CD, networking, security, etc. TLDR; The number of openings for MLE, DS, DE are low because most companies are unwilling to invest into data, and even less willing to invest into ML infra and the upkeep required for industry-specific R&D.",ToastandSpaceJam,2025-05-24 19:24:39,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kscroh,False,

If these are Leetcode questions no matter how difficult or a simple “code an example class for this type of system” they should realistically take max an hour to hour and a half with maybe some extra time for testing and verification. The 4 hours is just a generous amount of time to complete it. At least that has been my experience with take home interview assignments. It’s not like 4 hours is enough to actually put together a system of any real significance.

The fact that you are getting on-sites makes me think it's going better for you than you may feel. A lot of people aren't getting call backs or past a first interview. I imagine the big issues is that you are probably going to be in a junior, or at best, a mid level development position and those are already rare nowadays. I can imagine it would be hard to land a senior position when you don't have proper dev experience. Is there a reason why you haven't tried to pivot to a team lead/management role already? I know that doesn't get you into development, but it could potentially be a smart career move for someone at your level of expertise. From the development side, I do work with someone who switched from sales to dev later in life ( like maybe mid 40s ). He did a bootcamp, but the thing that helped him start getting interviews was contributing to open source projects. They helped him have a commit history he could point to in github and show he was able to work with other developers and follow a bit of a process on a large scale project. He's great and brings a lot to our team and also has a lot of work experience that most of the team doesn't, which is a plus. I think the biggest issue is finding a team that matches your skillset.Starting out the best position is the one you can get, but you might be at a place in life where you can't take on just any job. You are probably making bigger considerations around time commitments, location, pay, ect.. which might be limiting you a bit. If you have flexibility on any of those, you might be able to expand your search and find something. Another option could be to lean harder into your support experience. I'm in the process of transitioning a more support heavy development position. We will have a dedicated support team that will be fully focused on development support. I don't have any hiring capacity for this year unfortunately since it's a very new thing, but I'd be interested in candidates with a heavier support background. Most developers are not interested in doing support, especially when it's something they have to do with some frequency. They want to build and refine features. So, being the person who is both good and support and happy to do it could set you apart if you find the right position/company. Wish I had even better advise.

Self learning is always a skill to keep as strong as possible, too.But everything has an opportunity cost. What field do you want to work in? What stacks (if any)? I know you previously mentioned Java/Kotlin and Android dev. Something to consider is whether you want to work in that field, or if you are applying only because you feel strongest in it.Game dev is an entirely different beast. Personally, I'm into game dev myself because I learn almost exclusively from doing. I don't work in game dev. I don't publish games. I build them (and plenty of other things) to scratch that curiosity itch to learn while keeping it interesting (for example, I couldn't care less about yet another fucking library that's going viral that everyone is raving about in X language for Y framework--I'm not on the bleeding edge and it is not my niche).TL;DR: do it, if you're interested. The only downside is opportunity cost. Honestly ask yourself: what else would you be doing if not learning some game dev? Everything has an opportunity cost. Grinding leetcode has it.

Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.I also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.If you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important. Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes.

mtw4tp4,"OP, listen to this advice. Don’t ask chat gpt how to write something for you. Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.Technology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.Take time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. I will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",ladidadi82,2025-05-23 19:48:32,2,cscareerquestions,t1_mtubap3,False,

After all the big comapnies got rid of wfh, I've never had a friend struggle for a tech job in Seattle, atlanta, or the bay in the past year even with the recession or they were new grads. ##what does that mean for you?QA, Dev ops, web dev ( just be a freelancer at first to build your portfolio ) all of these can be found at entry level. The issue people don't wanna accept is that entry level **requires past experience** the same way an junior level doctor or lawyer requries past experience. ##ExamplesLike for web dev, just do freelance contracts or programs like Dev for good. Not that hard to make a portfolio if you really liked it. For ML, just work in a univeresity research lab; many of them are paid for every student they take on and your work gets published and used in industry. A lot will even take non-students (helping Columbia with their research actually landed me at Microsoft without an application)Wanna do QA? Go to utest.com, get a few tests done and get paid for it and after 2 years you'd be overqualified for Jr roles. Don't even gotta apply just start and get paid like uber. ##Bottom lineIt's very doable, it's just not as ""easy"" as it was before.

That'd be the better of the two options.Honestly, if you just want to maximize your chances of getting a job:1. Pick one major and do it really well. CS is ideal, but Data Science is totally fine.2. Do projects, go beyond what's required in class. Be curious. Try to really understand things.3. Apply for internships every summer. Do everything you can to get an internship. Use your career center, reach out to alums who graduated from your school recently, make friends with pros via open-source projects.Ultimately those things matter more than a double-major or master's.Do the master's if you really want to learn some of the material that goes beyond undergraduate CS or DS, and you really want to learn it in an academic environment.

If anything you should want to transfer to computer engineering.You should note that certificates are not certifications. Certificates are what you get when you finish random online tutorials. Certifications are from (paid) accredited institutions that (thanks to marketing) signal to employers you have a baseline knowledge of what you're applying for. As a college student, your best chance is through an internship. Cybersecurity jobs, at least the fun ones, are harder and much more scarce than SWE roles. Most companies do not need in-house cybersecurity roles, let alone of the offensive kind. It's definitely not something you'd do instead of SWE if you just want money. The ROI is much less.Also, for a lot of certifications, they are priced with the intention that people's employers will pay for them. I've done an internship in a company that would spend >$2500 per course, per person, not even counting travel to workshops/conferences and in-person exams.

Which data structures should you use and what algorithm will you use to process your data? Think of the space and time complexity and consider if you can improve that. It helps to write little notes. Only start coding *after* you have your entire solution mapped out. This process can help you identify any utility functions that you can stub out which will help prevent getting confused in a deeply nested loop. This is how I practiced with LC, and I was able to finish all of my technicals with time to spare. I even had time to walk through the solution while writing down and updating the values for my variables and catch some bugs.

mthlera,"I make sure I leave a confident, yet very self-aware impression on the interviewers.When I am thinking, I prefer to think in silence. However, as I have been an interviewer myself, I know how unproductive this is and the impression this gives. I will therefore tell the interviewer directly: ""I prefer thinking in silence, but I will still do my best to give you an insight into my thought process"". This helps me because I can now take a silence break whenever I feel like it without feeling bad about it. It helps the interviewer know what's going on because I have explicitly communicated it. Other than that, I believe a mindset shift is due here. Let me offer it: interviewer usually wants you to succeed. We want to get a new colleague and stop the interviews and just get back to our day to day job. Very rarely people will use the interview process to bully you and nitpick. And if they do, this is not a place I want to work at. I mean this. I have experienced this, laughed back at the interviewer and hung up the conversation after saying ""thanks, this was enough information for me"". So, the more you communicate with the interviewer (who wants you to succeed), the more they will be able to help you out, throw you a bone here and there if you're struggling or outright tell you ""this is not what I am looking for"". When you start believing this person wants to help you, you'll naturally want to use this leverage. Definitely use it. A final piece of advice would be to ask a lot of questions yourself. Intelligent, directional, intentional questions. This gives you a lot more information to work with, which makes you more confident in what you're doing, which makes you calm down and be able to communicate. It additionally allows you to showcase your maturity while being on the ""offense"", so even if you have some hiccups during the coding, you give yourself better chances.

Not all jobs will be good fits to your specific slice of skills and throwing the kitchen sink at the wall doesn't necessarily help when you're stacked against other candidates that have more depth in the required area.",lhorie,2025-05-24 15:13:27,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kuaf9q,False,
mu1yso1,"You can’t really “specialize” until you get your first role. Or at least build something of significant value. As a 2025 grad who actually has a job I can tell you this: Students who thought, “If I learn how to code through my classes I will get a Job,” didn’t get a job. You need to build things outside of class, you need to apply yourself, and you need to work hard. Software companies and companies in general are no longer reaching out to talent. The industry has become extremely cut throat and the only way to survive is to beat out your competition. Don’t settle being mediocre. If I could do it again I would spend 50% less time in my classes and 100% more time building things and looking for opportunities.",21_12user,2025-05-24 19:09:34,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kuaf9q,False,

mtwjk1o,"Backend engineer, easily. You love the stack so you'll absorb the knowledge, the value you gain during the time will more than make up for a lower pay during, and if you love the team you may end up with a job offer at a better rate anyways.

mtwa4cj,"Data science is hard to break into without a masters or PhD and several years of experience in a data science role, so an offer for a data science role early in your career offers to jump start that process and makes future options easier and salary negotiations easier. If you’re at all interested in Data Science I would strongly consider that offer. If not then I would generally just focus elsewhere - Data Science doesn’t really work as a fallback plan or a 2nd option without a lot of school or a lot of experience. I wouldn’t consider internships unless they build significant skills or significant inroads at a company you want connections with. You’re trying to establish your career at this point so an internship is just a lower paid lower commitment job - it needs to offer enough to balance that out. That leaves the 2 backend offers and the SRE job in consideration if you discard the Data Science role. SRE is a bit more specialized - you won’t build those skills incidentally, it needs to be intentional. It pays well and is in demand, so if you enjoy it it’s not a bad place to focus your efforts. Backend Engineering roles are good general roles and hard to fault, but they don’t build a specific specialty either. Nothing wrong with just building general experience to start though. Id consider the SRE or DS roles if those fields specifically interest you. If a specific niche or field doesn’t feel right then just take a backend role and take the XP for a pivot later. I wouldn’t take the internship unless there’s a serious upside on the other side of it. Don’t take the opportunity for SRE or DS experience for granted though - it’s easier to get it early in your career. Later on you might have to contemplate a salary cut if you’re weighing mid / senior level vs having to step backwards to DS I. It’s hard to apply for DS II / Sr roles without experience in those roles, especially on a Bachelors, so the opportunity to get that experience is valuable if you have it (same for SRE).",Imoa,2025-05-23 20:15:18,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1ktrop2,False,
