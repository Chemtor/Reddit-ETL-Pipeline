I spend 75% of my time writing 1000 line python scripts that are either complex one-off multisystem data pulls or building custom pipelines for merging data from those systems in a deployable way. 10% of my time is spent providing guidance on data systems, admin on our business applications and dev on functions internal to those. 10% is spent doing huge data cleaning jobs (our data is a complete shitshow). And the remaining 5% is basic analyst stuff like dashboards, live reports, and light analysis. Hell one of my current 6 main projects is building a Data Lakehouse on AWS for serving business data and reporting.The difference for me is we are a global SaaS company, but even one of our data scientists has come to me for pipeline dev and recommendations for data arch for a function in a chatbot they are developing.Fortunately my direct superior is on the same page and helping advocate for a title change (which would get a raise with it per company policy). But what I did was took the job description, broke the tasks in the job description down into 'typical role of task' (ie dashboarding and light analysis is typically a data analyst, building and maintaining pipelines via script and platform engineering is data engineer, but more fleshed out than that), I then added in any tasks I do that are not in my job description. I then gave a percentage of my time spent on each domain to illustrate that 90% of my time goes to tasks that are firmly in the domain of a Data Engineer. Fortunately my boss is chill and an advocate and he took that and actually added supporting examples of tasks I have completed that are outside of my job description and is taking it to the C-Suite person he reports to so we can get me a title that reflects my work.

n83iumi,"I think you are using ""surrogate"" in a different sense than I would consider conventional.If you are constructing your primary key determjnistically from one or more columns, then that is effectively a natural key, you're just doing some of the databases work manually.Surrogate keys are keys which are not derived from the data of the entity. The idea is that they identify the row as a first-class thing in its own right. This is useful if the data model (or your understanding of the data) changes. For example, many things which _should_ be natural keys can end up being non-unique in practice due to dirty data, particularly at a large enough scale.Surrogate primary keys have to be unique, but can't rely on the data from the row to provide that uniqueness, so the guarantee that no two rows have the same key had to come from somewhere else. The basic options to guarantee uniqueness are:- Generate keys randomly and check for duplicates- Generate keys randomly from such a large keyspace that collisions are ""unlikely enough""- Generate keys in some way that is mathematically guaranteed never to generate the same key twiceJust about simplest mathematical approach that is guaranteed never to generate the same output twice is an incrementing integer sequence. It's also easy to implement, and produces an output (a smallish integer) that is very efficient to work with and which often has relatively nice properties for things like database indexes.",qlkzy,2025-08-11 12:08:28,18,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,
n83v18q,"I'll take MSSQL as the example hereYour question is more related on what makes a clustered index. Per default, the primary key is used as the clustered index, but it does not have to be. Anyway, when I say clustered index, you pretty much can think ""primary key"".I won't go to deep here, but essentially, the clustered index is the physical sorting of the table. If the clustered index is sequential, you add a new row, it gets appended at ""the end"". The number sequence is irrelevant, nobody cares, its only used to ensure the sorting order. If your clustered index is not sequential, the new row needs to get added ""in the middle""That will cause something called page splits. With a page split, the data can not be written where it should be, since the 8kb page at that position is full, so instead a pointer to a new page is written there. When querying the data for that row, the page where it should be is read, pointer to other page is found, other page gets read as well. So it is not good for performance.That's why you quite often see maintainance jobs, that rebuild / reorganize the clustered indexes of the entire database, running during some weekend night or something like that.The reason it is common to have that sequence as an integer is, the size. Int32 is 4 byte. Every non clustered index will reference the clustered index, so having a larger field for the clustered index, will bloat the size of all non clustered indexes, which is again bad for performance, since more data gets written / read / cached.That's the gist of why you often read about and see identity columns as clustered index.Why would you not use that:Now here it gets a bit harder, to not write a small book. The clustered index is your physical data on disk. The more efficient you can look up a value given your data access paths, the faster your queries will execute. On a typical OLTP database, you will see 90%+ read traffic, so read access is very important.Lets say you have 100 million rows in your table, that contains a lets say zip code. Lets also say, you usually query by a filter on that zip code. Something along the lines of WHERE zipCode = @@param1 AND .... In that case, for read access, it would likely be a good idea to create a clustered index, with zip code as the first field (you can create a clustered index containing more than one column). Since the search trough the B+ tree can be more efficient that way.If you had an identity as the clustered index, you would create a non clustered index on the zipCode, which works, but after the relevant data is found in the non clustered index, it will have to be looked up in the clustered index to get the actual data. As long as it was not a covering non clustered index. It also depends on data distribution an the statistics on the table, an index is useless if in that example your data is split between two zip codes.You see what I mean by saying, ""hard to not write a small book"" ?Random Guids should only be used in special cases. Massive concurrent users, where you run into hot spots on the ""last page"" data needs to get written to for example (would be called latch contention on mssql), or distributed systems.The reason for that is, that the data ends up essentially unsorted, which is not good, while also causing the page split problem, which creates the need for regular maintenance tasks.I'll try to give a bit of a TLDR on how you should choose your clustered index :* It should be chosen with intent, it is the most powerful tool for performance optimizing on the data modeling level* It should be narrow (small data size)* it should be selective. Think along the lines of a hash table, you don't benefit from a hashtable much, if you end up with two hash buckets, containing 50 million rows. Still a hash table... but you are far from O(1) in such a case.* sequential ID's can work but don't have to. They are rarely ideal, but are better than nothing* Think about how your data gets accessed, and choose the index to best support most of your workload* At least as a health check, keep an eye on your index fragmentation (there are system views for that on mssql, I'm sure there is something like that on any serious database)* The clustered index does not have to be unique! Sql Server, will append a small row identifier if needed behind the scene. It is not a good idea to append a guid in the datamodel* As a default when creating a table, the primary key gets used as the clustered index, that does not have to be done. It is usually a better idea to have a thought out clustered index, instead of just defaulting to the PK. In cases where the PK is not the clustered index, a non clustered index gets created, to ensure uniqueness of said key.Edit: Jesus Christ that ended up as a blog post pretty much, and I tried to be brief...",svtr,2025-08-11 13:23:26,7,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,
n83lghv,"History: initially the database in the late 80's & early 90's, we only had string or int, and the application had to manage PK & FK keys. So often the PK & FK were text based, and this was slow.Some vendors in the DBase III+ era, Foxpro, started copying the popular Informix & SQL-92 ansi standard, to have a database ""engine"" assign the PK key with an auto increment column of type INT. These early DB engines were only 32 bit of course.They allowed the DB engine to lock the table, assign a PK automatically on INSERT based on last value used, write the record, unlock the table. This was seen as a more secure way, since the engine was assigning the key, not the application. Because of course in a network, you get network errors, and the application would often hang or use an incorrect PK causing duplicates.My early DBA days mid-90's was handling duplicates on micro computers and mini computers (like the VAX). A mini computer used ASCII terminals, so everything ran inside 1 computer with a multi-threaded CPU, why they were huge & expensive.Micro computer decentralized the expensive mini computer, and you could use Wordperfect & Lotus 1-2-3, not just a homegrown ERP/WMS/MES application. So all the micro-computer vendors mid-90's offered auto increment with their SQL db engine because the demand was there, CPUs were only 32 bit, and the GUID() or MD5() functions didn't exist yet.Some companies had to use datetime strings instead, like Wall Street, or the UK-France tunnel car tracking system, because auto increment had reached its limit in transactions count.Was still used for lookup tables, like a string PK for a product table, but category, sub-category, color tables used auto inc for PK.Merging data from various systems was a major PITA (duplicate ID #'s with different data) and by the late 90's the auto inc was being abandonned globally for GUID instead, or a datetime string down to the milisecond 5 digits, I've seen both.Then Lo' & Behold, 64 bit CPUs, and now we have BIGINT with MSSQL 2000 in the year 2000, and auto inc came back with a vengeance because who ever hits the 2\^64-1 limit?I blame Microsoft for bringing Auto Inc back to life when it should have died out in 1999 and the Y2K bug.",SirGreybush,2025-08-11 12:25:32,6,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,

However, you can do a couple things here: 1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed. 2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).Fivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors).

It doesn't even need to be an etl pipeline, it could be a one off script that helps restart a server. Ask questions and be curious. You have to tread the fine line between asking questions and being annoying. Too much or too little of either makes you look bad; juniors are not immune to the stupid games of office politics. You will probably have a lot of open time where you have 0 assigned work but everybody else is busy.

Mongo uses journaling and indexes (just appending lines to a file and updating the index).Mongo writes to the disk in intervals (like 100ms). So, there's always a small (nonzero) risk of losing data if the system instantly crashes. Postgres doesn't really have this problem, because it doesn't complete the transaction until the data is safely on disk.Because Mongo just appends to a file, you may have to deal with compaction, which is when old entries get garbage collected (more or less). This isn't a problem if you're always creating new entries, but if you update or delete entries often, compaction can take time.Postgres also has compaction, but it's called vacuum and is done differently.It's supposed to be easier to use partitions/sharding in Mongo. You can distribute your data across multiple clusters.You can partition data in postgres, and that data can be queried in parallel, but I'm not sure if you can actually split partitions across clusters.",nfigo,2025-08-12 04:48:30,12,dataengineering,t3_1mnyo1z,False,

They have Iceberg compatibility which means you get some level of ACID compliance. Delta Lake is for OLAP use cases no matter how you look at it. So if you are sure that your use case is purely OLAP, then you are good to go with Databricks. You will have the same challenge of porting your DynamoDB queries though to Databricks SQL. Postgres is the most compliant SQL database where you can express your queries from very simple to very complex. It's origins is in OLTP but a lot of organizations are using them now for OLAP too. It's now even powering Vector Search use cases for AI workloads. Because of its multi-modal storage, it becomes really flexible in terms of supporting many use cases that requires certain formats - JSON, JSONB, Free Form Text, Binary, etc. You'll have to dig deeper in terms of what those users are doing with your data.

I used Looker Studio at my previous company (small company and also used AWS RDS just like yours) and it works fine with the MySQL connector but it’s obvious how well integrated the BigQuery connectors are. One way to possibly improve performance on the RDS is to create separate schema for a makeshift data warehouse. Populate this schema once a day using stored procedures from your transactional tables. You can put all the complicated joins and stuff in these stored procedures. Then only connect Looker to this dedicated schema with a simple select * from datawarehouse.cleanTable.

If the business unit you work in brings in more money than it costs, you are a profit centre. There are no second order effects. When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. If your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it’s deemed essential. You’re absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. To reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it’s an unavoidable necessity. The trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics.

It’s not that he doesn’t matter, but on the books, he doesn’t get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. Transactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent. So when doing financial analysis we can say that one product, while worth the same end sale price, might cost differently when produced in different factories.",waitwuh,2025-08-15 17:32:16,1,dataengineering,t1_n8tizkw,False,

n8oahgw,"Sorry, contract with employer doesn't allow me to, and she sql produced is snowflake-specific (uses as-of joins) I can describe the steps of the algo, though. you start with a collection of events. To make examples simpler we will assume you only have one entity that produces the events, and all rows (events) represent states of that one entity. If the terminology is confusing, just think that event can be pressing a lever to open a door, and the door being open or cloded is a state. let's say event a (little a) causes state A (big a) to begin. If the entity (e.g. door) already was in state A, then it continues to be in that state. Event b causes state B, etc. For further simplification, we will count time in integer numbers 1,2,5,...,8,12,... . In reality time is usually a date, or timestamp, but anything that is orderable can be used here. So assuming our times and events look like this: \`\`\` 1, a 3, a 4, b 5, b 7, a 9, c \`\`\` We have contiguous repetitions of events a and b, and we have non-contiguous repetition of a (at time 7) What we want to get is a table representing the states and their durations state, start-time, end-time \`\`\` A, 1, 4 B, 4, 7 A, 7, 9 C, 9, Null \`\`\` We kept the non-contiguous repetitions, but ignored the contiguous ones.This is close to our real end-result, so how can we get from there to here?First find all consecutive pairs. More formally - pair each row with the row that has smallest time which is still bigger than this row's time. This can be done with a self-join (or two), join + window functions or as-of join.Get rid of all result rows, where the event is the same, we only want transitions.We'll call this data set Transitions. \`\`\` 3, a, 4, b 5, b, 7, a 7, a, 9, c \`\`\`From transitions we can take the earlier time + event in a separate CTE - these will be our state endings.Yes, endings, even though we thought of them as the earlier ones. Since we listed state transitions - then it follows that the last event representing some state will happen BEFORE the first event in the next state.Also, from transitions, we take the later time + event and call them Beginnings, due to the same reasoning.Eagle eyed reader will have noticed that we are missing the first event of the first state. We should add that to Beginnings (e.g. with a union all)Now that we have beginning and endings of each state we join each beginning with the next consecutive ending (again, smallest time, that is larger / later than that if a particular beginning)the time of beginning is the island start time, time of ending is the island end time. the state, that corresponds to the beginning event is the state of the island.Of course that was a simplified example. In reality, the state is an ensemble of various fields, but these can be hashed into one, or compared one to one.Usually we also deal with more than one entity (think many doors and their corresponding levers), but to accommodate that, you just group your CTEs by the columns that constitute the entity identifier.",Dry-Aioli-6138,2025-08-14 16:15:21,3,dataengineering,t1_n8lcn6x,True,

They might not like that you are not using an LLM, but it's easy to show why the LLM is a bad idea.Second, focus on cases where the user can validate the output and iterate with the LLM. The one I am trying to avoid until AI gets more reliable is cases where you need a deterministic output. So text to SQL, customer facing applications, etc. Thinks that work are things like document lookup with links to the original documents so that the user can verify the information. Also just applications with RAG to bring company knowledge into the conversation with the LLM.We are seeing success with stuff like software development tools and document-based knowledge bases.

I personally reviewed a few Synapse specific PRs this week, actually :D. And it's still Generally Available with no deprecation date set. And I wholeheartedly would agree new development should go to Fabric instead.I also think most customers of Synapse would benefit from migrating to Fabric when they feel ready to do so; it has many major improvements, both to performance and to the architecture. One of the big ones is that Fabric Warehouse uses Parquet as it's on disk format accessible in OneLake - no more ""best performance or least duplication"" tradeoff.Why wouldn't I blame Fabric for Synapse not seeing much feature development?Well, designs of Synapse Dedicated and Synapse Serverless respectively had limitations that weren't practical to address without a major rearchitecting under the hood. Synapse Dedicated, for example, is the result of over a decade of incremental improvements that did not change its fundamental architecture (APS/PDW was released in 2012); we basically took it as far as it could go. So we had to do some fairly major rearchitecting to make something fundamentally better than that; the result is Fabric. Could we have called it Synapse v2 or something? Maybe. But it still would have been a migration to move to it, so I'm not sure that would have been any better. And marketing isn't my area :D.

You can hold the data in a single place and, in theory, any engine can query it. There is at least 1 caveat - you can only have one catalog and all engines have to be capable of working with that catalog2. To avoid vendor lock-in to proprietary formats. IMO this has a significant downside in that iceberg is the “lowest common denominator” so you lose all the benefits of the proprietary format. It also seems unlikely that many companies migrate between platforms where having data in an open format would significantly benefit this migration",NW1969,2025-08-09 20:35:21,3,dataengineering,t3_1mlzcv6,False,

Bear in mind that the iceberg standard doesn’t support defined length text datatypes - so everything may end up as varchar(max). While snowflake can handle this, many systems (e.g. BI tools) have severe performance issues with varchar(max) columns.My view is that you need good reasons to move to iceberg, not good reasons to stick with snowflake native - which should be the default option.Also, if you are looking at having multiple engines querying iceberg, the catalog is not going to support enterprise-grade features. For example, if you tag columns for tag-based masking policies in snowflake those tags are not in the catalog available to other engines - so you would still need a separate masking solution in every system.",NW1969,2025-08-09 21:03:02,3,dataengineering,t3_1mlzcv6,False,

Which means that you don’t have to actually load data in Snowflake you just have to query your iceberg table which probably live in your S3 buckets and you pay Snowflake for compute.And as you grow, you might want to do some more transformation in the lake yourself with your own engine and only load final product into snowflake.In the end it depends on what you wanna build and who you want to pay.Snowflake is an amazing tool, but you pay for the amazing features.If you build your lake and transformations yourself that’s a lot of engineering salary to make that happen.I think those question start to make sense when you start getting big, but not before.You can also create your Iceberg tables directly on your Kafka topics to simplify querying data.

If my butt is in the chair I am here to work. Anything else I want to do in my life is free to do, but NOT in this chair.

At my university this is offered as several lower-division classes, but due to the course content and lack of connection to higher abstractions already learned, students often fail to appreciate how important these concepts are to understanding programming intuitively.What made it click for me was simply internalizing that programs are really just two things - data, and transformations on data.

If you were to re-write this, I would phrase it as a question, and not assume you know more about how to teach students than the CS Department of your University. It's good to be curious, it's good to question things, but remember they've likely been doing this a lot longer, and they likely have an answer as to why they choose XYZ first. I have a few thoughts for why they might teach Syntax first. **Easy Victories lead to greater motivation -** Almost invariably, everyone's first program is 'Hello World'. This is a very easy first step that teaches you some basic syntax, the basics of how your IDE work, and the basics of runtime/compiling. If your code doesn't compile, you have a syntax error, that's likely your first bug! And it's easy to solve. This will quickly become trivially easy, but you had to learn it at some point, and if you can see that the basics of coding is no harder than installing a few programs and writing a sentence with good grammar, that might be enough to get a few students who were on the fence to stay in the game. **Most people learn what to do, and then how to do it, then why you do it -** You likely don't have kids, but my daughter is learning to walk and talk right now. She knows 'danger hot' and that the trash cans & toilets are 'Ew'. As she gets older we'll start filling in the gaps of why these things are dangerous & yucky, but it doesn't do us a whole lot of good to tell a one and a half year old about germs because even if she could learn the word, she doesn't know what it means.Bringing this concept back to programming, One of the first apps taught outside of CS degrees is building an API with CRUD operations. The REST routing concepts are pretty much set in stone at this point, and don't require a lot of creativity, so it's pretty easy to give newbies a tutorial and help them through the concepts as they work up the project. **Yes this is eventually going to cause a learning plateau -** So yes when you get into algorithmic thinking, assignment operators, functions that pass a value, etc. you're going to hit a wall. This is not easy stuff and you are going to struggle with this as you rewire your brain. But as you practice, you are going to hit a point where it clicks, and when that happens you're going to be glad you have all of your syntax memorized because it will fall into place easier, rather than having to go back and learn it all at that point.",JanitorOPplznerf,2025-08-09 18:39:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mlnc7i,False,

The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and ""something"" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.In your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say ""hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x"" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says ""ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database"". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.This, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve.

One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.It contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms.

(Young folks: Silverlight was an unsuccessful competitor to Macromedia / Adobe Flash. At the time I was working on it, VB6 was already ancient. ClearCase is what big companies used before git.)To tie all this random crap together, I wrote a Ruby script that applied labels, downloaded snapshots of the code, then either pushed the code to a Linux box to be built there, or built it locally on the server. It was an insane, janky, Rube Goldberg setup. And to drive it all, I wrote a DSL in Ruby to tell it what I wanted it to build. As horrible as the whole thing was in retrospect, the DSL was incredibly easy to understand. Nobody working on the project would have any difficulty understanding what it did, even if they didn’t know precisely how it was doing it. I could have made that whole thing just take a JSON file, but it would probably have been just a little more confusing for users. Also, at the time, JSON was only three years old.

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.To create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.For creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.Writing good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation.

Once code (for short) goes in a specific pipeline, it ends up to the desired location. A pipeline could be created to provide new versions to a test environment, or to a beta version, or to prod. There is no fixed recipe but its frequent to see test/staging/beta/production.The role of the devops is to try and automatise that. So, for instance, when devs deliver a new version of the code, the magic behind happens and the cogs spin until the new version of the application is delivered to the clients.The job is highly technical and highly complex. Depending on the needs, the team can require high technical expertises in multiple different domains (security, kubernetes/dockers, azure/aws/… cloud vendors, …). It can be as simple as being a ""clickops"" (the devops guy goes on a cloud vendor like azure or aws website and clicks/fills forms manually) up to a more fully automated process (also possible with cloud vendors, terraform,…).So, if you wanted to learn visually something about how your devops team functions, you gotta be more precise.But I think management 101 would tell you to learn directly from your team, if good communication is possible.",Merry-Lane,2025-08-11 12:41:55,9,learnprogramming,t3_1mnate2,False,

(You can find tutorials for all of that in this sub's FAQ.) Watching is not the same as coding, and you will get a lot more if you are following along while you watch.Longer Answer:Coding is not 'Learn one language and fight about why yours is better for the rest of time'. There's a very good chance you're going to learn 3+ languages at a basic level and a couple dozen technologies including an IDE or two, as well as multiple frameworks & runtimes over your career. As a Junior, you probably won't get a job unless you can navigate a terminal, use a debugger, write unit tests, do error handling, test APIs through something like Postman, manage an environment through NPM or Docker or the like. Honestly there's probably three things I'm forgetting.I've watched the Harvard video and the professor is very good. He makes the class easy and fun. But he's also fast, he assumes his students are Ivy League level and have read the source materials, so he may lose you if you aren't pausing regularly and checking documentation and course materials.As for Python or C++; if this is pre-university, I think Python is PERFECT for you. It'll be much easier and it will set you up well to learn another language and follow along better at Uni. You'll have plenty of time to switch languages over the next four years. Keep in mind C++ may not even be the language your game will be built in. C++ would be for something like Unreal Engine, while C# would be for Unity, and Minecraft was originally in Java.

I took Codefinity after dabbling in Python on free platforms like freeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials, and for me, the biggest value was its structured, hands-on approach. A lot of online courses dump all the theory up front, but Codefinity mixes in small, interactive projects from the start, which kept me engaged and actually helped me remember the concepts better.One thing I noticed compared to something like CS50 is that Codefinity feels more guided and less overwhelming. CS50 is amazing, but it can be intense for beginners because it covers a lot of computer science theory. Codefinity, on the other hand, is more focused on practical Python skills — working with data, building mini-apps, and slowly introducing libraries like Pandas or NumPy in context.It’s true some lessons can feel repetitive if you already know the basics, but for absolute beginners, that repetition actually builds confidence. The quizzes and small coding tasks at the end of each section made it easier for me to track progress. I also liked that they emphasize applying what you learn — I built a simple web scraper and a basic text-based game during the course, which were huge confidence boosters.Price-wise, it’s not the cheapest, but if you compare it to some coding bootcamps or other subscription-based platforms, it’s reasonable — especially if you grab a discount. The key is to actually follow through; no course is “worth it” if you just skim it.If your goal is to move from understanding Python syntax to building your own projects, Codefinity can absolutely help bridge that gap.

n7z6xqx,"I went through Codefinity after completing a couple of beginner Python courses and found it to be a solid option for building practical skills. The lessons are laid out in a way that makes them easy to follow, and the gradual progression from basic concepts to small projects helped me feel more comfortable applying what I learned. I appreciated how each topic had examples that connected to real use cases instead of staying purely theoretical. Some sections did feel slow, especially if you already know the basics, but I think that pace works well for reinforcing ideas. For me, it helped to go over familiar topics because it meant I didn’t have to constantly look things up when working on my own projects. The mini projects were one of the highlights since they gave a sense of accomplishment without being overwhelming. They also made it easier to remember concepts because I could connect them to something I had actually built. I wouldn’t say Codefinity is perfect the interface is simple and the pace might be too slow for advanced learners but for someone who wants structure and consistent practice, it’s effective. I also think combining it with something hands-on, like Raspberry Pi projects, can make a big difference.

You can’t contribute meaningfully to something you have never used.After using it for a bit, start looking through the codebase. Get a feel for the main language and all the supporting technologies (frameworks, libraries, build system, etc). If you’re new expect this to take a few weeks. Then download the project and try to get it running locally. Make a tiny change (change a text) and see if you can get it to show up.Then try setting a debug point. Now go and trace a specific feature and see how it works.If you want a cheat sheet look at recent PRs that got merged and see what changes were required.

Probably the best way to do it is to read the docs (if they exist), then copy and paste everything you see that is of relevance into an AI chat, which will take time and you will have to worry about context awareness. But, once that is done, ask the AI to explain the concepts that dont make sense. Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it. Each step sounds awful, because it lowkey is, that is the pain of dev onboarding. You also will need to be patient with yourself in the beginning as you try to figure out where to even make code changes given an issue to resolve and how to actually resolve it properly without over engineering.Good luck, though, working on intense projects helped me get a job at amazon, so hopefully it helps you out with ur financial goals too.",Aperswal,2025-08-12 06:25:34,5,learnprogramming,t3_1mnv74w,False,

Sometimes you can gain the domain knowledge simply by being a user of the software, but other times you will have to do research and/or read documentation. A personal anecdote is that I recently fixed a bug on Ffmpeg without being very knowledgeable about media encoding but only because I encountered the bug while using the software, so I knew what the issue and expected outcome was, and since it was a simple fix in an isolated portion of the code I didn’t have to be an expert on the code base.

See how people raise issues, how they get assigned, what a PR looks like, how the discussion looks and what PRs are getting approved. 2. Create your own small project and structure it the same way. Add basic tests, use basic GitHub actions, create a CONTRIBUTING.md. Then create an issue, assign it to yourself. Complete the issue and submit a PR like it's someone else's project. 3. Review your own PR like you're a maintainer and approve it when it looks good. At this point you at least understand the process of contributing to open source, now it's about finding issues you can actually handle.4. Find a small project that has some good first issue tags. Usually this is someone just trying to do what I outlined above for themself. The codebase and issue should be simple. Work on getting assigned some easy issues and getting your PRs merged. 5. Then just repeat with slightly larger and more complex tasks as you feel more and more comfortable. When learning to swim you wouldn't jump into the middle of the ocean, so don't do it with open source.

Big corporations in the US, Germany, Japan, etc. may indeed have strict degree requirements for SWE roles, especially entry-level. Highly competitive graduate schemes and certain government and defense jobs do require accredited degrees. In these contexts, projects and open-source contributions can help, but HR filters simply will block applications without formal education.In contrast, startups, scale-ups and smaller companies often prioritize skills, portfolio projects and interview performance over formal credentials.Many US tech companies (see Google, IBM, Apple) do have officially dropped strict degree requirements, though competition means degrees still give an advantage. Also countries with high demand for developers will sometimes hire based on bootcamp training or self-taught experience.If you look globally, there’s a shift toward skills-based hiring in tech. Portfolios, GitHub contributions and competitive programming results (from LeetCode, HackerRank) can open doors. Networking and referrals indeed do often bypass degree filters.Without a degree, you will need a strong portfolio, relevant certifications, and networking to compete. In markets with “degree fever” (as one commenter called it), getting past automated HR filters is harder. In more flexible markets, you can get hired without a degree, with proof of skills and good interview performance.But even with a degree and relevant certifications, you will still have to prove that you have been able to apply the knowledge and expertise you acquired, combined with quantifying the use and profit your work has.

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. - Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are. This helps searchability and makes it clear for people who do not know what a whale with boxes on it or an elephant mean.- 2/3 of your listed projets require login (or something adjacent), no one is gonna do it.

Now its a mix of udemy, YT, documentation, building stuff, and recently AI.You can try the following:Learn HTML and get comfy building static single page websites. Use the official documentation, W3 schools and MDN Docs to find what you need. You can watch web dev simplified or other tutorials if you need. Theres alot of content so dont get stuck looking for the best. Just find something and start then you can look for better when yiu can identify issues. Html is pretty easy so it shouldn't take too long. Dont worry about mastering it. Just be comfortable with it.Apply the same to CSS, also learn how websites work, i.e. If you google W3 schools... So what happens for you to be able to see the site (http requests, servers). Again juat a working understanding, you dont need to do a phd in this. When you can build and style a site with relative comfort. Dip into Javascript (no frameworks yet), learn the syntax, data types, primary and secondary data types, loops, if statements, JS objects. After that then start going into frameworks. I learnt Jquery, node, express and EJS, as part of my udemy course and im currently building a CRUD app (create, read, update, delete) with this. From here I'm going to learn about APIs, SQL, React, And finish my python course that i set aside initially. Dont just watch videos and tutorials. Code along. Code by youreself. When you get stuck and search and try to figure out and understand whats going wrong is when you will make tons of progress. My recommendation wrt AI. Dont use it initially. Try to get to a point where you know the basics, that way you can ask it smarter questions and you will know when it says something sketchy or something you dont understand, that way you can interrogate it better. You can also explicitly tell it to not give you code but 'go socrates mode' . It will ask YOU questions that you have to go and research. I use AI in a collaborative manner where it acts in a mentorship role to guide me to the info i need to put stuff together. I did this so i dont become reliant on it. At the end if the day, just start with the basics, build something, learn intermediate topics, build intermediate stuff, learn advanced topics, build advanced stuff. Itll take time.

I just simply don't have money to go back to varsity so im reliant on my courses i bought when i still had money, free online content and my ability to read and understand documentation.",TheBlegh,2025-08-15 14:13:13,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqxptw,False,

n8npzr9,"To answer your question, I don't remember when the switch happened for me. There were a few milestones I do remember, though: First, when I learned to focus on projects over practice, programming started to come much more naturally to me. Second, when I learned the concepts of software engineering, I started to view programming as an end rather than some thing on its own (when it became a medium for a story like English in your analogy).It was a continuous process, but I can't really quantify how skilled I was at the time, because I wasn't doing the same thing enough to compare over time.To go into domains a little:The process will be different for every domain, as programming is just means to an end. This means learning how to learn is a step in its own. You're probably best just looking for an online community of software engineers with experience and asking there (forums, discords, etc), or just Googling it and hoping you find results. Examples:Banking and financial processing are extremely heavy on the security, regulations, and infrastructure side of things, so that's where most of your research/investment goes- under the hood I'd imagine most banks etc use very similar software, all just making secure API calls to one-another. Your learning resources are going to be regulations and industry insights to the current norms. Your only hope to breaking into the market is probably innovation (doing something known, just cheaper or higher quality).Comparatively, something like game development would be the opposite. You're creating a lot of unique systems; usually without significant regard for standards/security. I.e. outside of specific cases, there's not really one preferred solution. Your learning resources are gonna be more subjective and decentralized, as the requirements are much fuzzier and the market isn't ""solved.""

You'll build familiarity and comfort with this over time. For example, I used to TA an operating system lab where everything was written in C. It was PAINFUL for most students to internalize that all file IO would be handled by system calls, or that the computer knows what folder it should be referring to by referencing the file system relative to the folder the console or executable was launched from.

In fact they're probably a good idea!When you start to work with other people, the rule is ""Good code is self-documenting,"" meaning it should be obvious what the code does without needing explanatory comments.Use variable names, data structures and encapsulation to minimise the amount of thinking that a reader has to do. For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:```class Card: def __init__(self, cardString): self.name = self._getName(cardString[0]) self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0]) self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1]) def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter] elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 'Ace' else: return cardFirstCharacter def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return 10 elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 11 else: return int(cardFirstCharacter) def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter): suits = [""Hearts"", ""Diamonds"", ""Clubs"", ""Spades""] return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)```Then `hit()` becomes easy:```def hit(): drawnCard = drawCard() v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard) card = Card(drawnCard) return card.name, card.value```**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it.

I'm not trying to sound like a smartass or anything, but sometimes the most simple route can be the best! You can learn stuff like design patterns and algorithms and stuff, but if you feel like you are too heavily reliant on AI I'd suggest trying to make a simple project (like a sudoku or a simple calculator ) and just turn off copilot or anything of the likes and just start googling (the AI from Google also doesn't count) learning to use documentation and efficient research helps a lot for becoming a better programmer especially if you try to dissect your problem in smaller bites and start to get hang of how you could figure out problems by pure logic it will then only make you stronger in coding when you do allow yourself to use AI. But practising is the best medicine imo. You seem like a smart individual but don't get yourself twisted over achieving stuff like becoming a 10x developer, I'm guessing a part of having that amount of skill is also part of just loving to code and doing it a lot (of course there are cases of people who just inhale knowledge and have such a robust logical mind that it comes easy to them but that is besides the point) and if you can think of the logic how to tackle problems during coding before even touching your keyboard then you're on the right track (not a must but is nice) coding is just logical thinking.

If someone just wanted to vibe code their way into software that's going to be riddled with problems that's probably a different story.Assuming AI is going to reach the point where it's actually useful at scale then you'll want to be in a position where you can still read, debug, and modify whatever code the various models you use will output.At the moment AI isn't really a net benefit for a lot of companies or projects that are rather large, but realistically with the amount of investment they've seen they likely will be. To clarify a bit, they're decent at writing a number of things, but I've also seen them do a number of dumb things that cost more time than they've saved.The other rather significant problem is that while you can use them to build a number of things by piecing things together it starts to fail when you have to debug even relatively small programs. Even if you've all the features enabled to have it try to analyze, run, and test a program it will still often fail somewhere. Though it will completely confidently proclaim that what it wrote it works properly when it definitely doesn't. I've seen this just trying to get it write unit tests for things that are only mildly complicated. Other times the project is just too big to fit in the context window. A bit of an anecdote here, but I still find it humorous seeing certain models try to run code (not written using Python) in a Python interpreter even when you explicitly told it not to.I expect we'll see a shift from monolithic to more microservice based programs to help meet AI in the middle, but we're not there across the industry today.",Serenity867,2025-08-14 21:17:17,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqda0b,False,

That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. Then it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, ""I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code."" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.So at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought ""Maybe if I SEND these people my code..."" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.So after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, ""Hey, I found a bug in the code."" And he literally said, ""Well, fix it."" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support.

It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.However, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).The issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.My point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. My general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying.

It would be responsible for coordinating all the various single-action service methods and minor logic required. It would then convert that into the DTO at the end, based upon one or more of the data models Service - Single-action methods, often using DB models from our SQL DB via EntityThat way, if another piece of business logic required the individual actions, they could call their own series of service methods without having to worry about the DTOs of another API",mrwishart,2025-08-15 22:12:47,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mr96w0,False,
n8wrimc,"I think I have to make it more clear what I meant.It makes sense, since the database resides in a database layer. To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.Then we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.Somehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. I read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:If we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view. For example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.But sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.Do you know what I mean?",NearbyOriginals,2025-08-15 22:04:20,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wcaxr,True,

n8wwyoy,"Yes, that is what I told you.Entity (DAOs) are used to map your entire entity to a database table. You do not want to return this from a service. You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary). While controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.In spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:example() { var stuff = repo.getStuff(); ...business logic... return stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;)This is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.When you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.All these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",disposepriority,2025-08-15 22:35:18,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wrimc,False,
n8x0gms,"Okay, in Java terms, let say we use Hibernate in a Spring Boot application and that returns an entity POJO. You then create a service class, which is just a simplified DAO with CRUD operations and the output of each operation maps to whatever DTO that belongs to the entity.You call the service operation in the controller and the DTO that is returned from this service will be serialized to JSON in the response to the client.So you default the return of each service operation in the CRUD DAO to a DTO and when you want the full entity POJO instead to reuse in whatever class, you use the defined method in your service CRUD DAO. Let's call the method \`getFullServiceEntityDTO\`.This is your approach if I read it correctly.",NearbyOriginals,2025-08-15 22:55:20,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wwyoy,True,
n8x5mz3,"The DAO is your repository, not your service. Hibernate isn't returning anything, you are defining an Entity class, denoted by an annotation, to either generate your database schema or match it.The reason the entity class is not usable outside the repository class and some select service methods is that you do not want to couple your schema and anything your API returns.Example: You're in the process of migrating your hashing algorithm, this requires users to reset their passwords, you have millions of users - this will take a lot of time. You add a hash\_version field to your user class, so you know which hashing algorithm to use to verify their passwords. This new column in your database has no business being in absolutely any of your controllers, but obviously you want to retrieve the value when getting a user since the service needs to know what to do). This applies to any entity derivatives like projections or manual mappings with native query.Service calls one or more repositories requesting data from the database that it needs, this can be returned as an entity class, projection, manually created class mapped by a jdbc handler, it doesn't matter - this is the class that will store the data you request from the database. This class will change if you ever change your database query.

If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.SICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.On that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall.

n8t4ah5,"I find for this kind of exercise brute force is always my first approach. Once I have something working I take a break then a second look. Is there something I could do better, a simplification I could make, a loop or repetition I could simplify or remove? Once I've done that I'll see if there are recommended solutions, or just google similar things. I think I first learnt of python list comprehension by looking at how other people solved issues, being completely baffled by this \[f(x) for x in something\] I kept seeing, and then just playing around to see how it worked. The whole process made some exercises take a lot longer than they could have done, but as I learnt not only how I could do things better, but also how other people do, I found things easier and quicker. Sometimes I'd go and look at my 'good' solutions and see how bad they really are. And on occasion I realised the brute force approach may have actually been better as it was so much easier to understand and re-use. I think, personally, brute force isn't so bad on small scripts with small data sets that I only use for simple things. As long as I'm not loading files when I don't need to, then even looping over data sets more than I need isn't always bad. As soon as I have a nested loop I pay far more attention, likewise when I suddenly have a far larger data set than expected. (Case in point, I have a script I'm using right now where I'm sorting through a text file for some specific identifiers and false positives. My first run through the input was a couple of hundred lines. I didn't pay much attention to how I was scanning through the text. Yesterday I started looking at a file with \~1M lines. Suddenly I paid a lot more attention to what my script was doing, and, for example, filtering out inputs early.)",SnooMacarons9618,2025-08-15 10:33:17,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqr4ud,False,
n8t5wnu,"> I guess my ultimate question for you guys is: is a janky solution that still works good enough, even if that solution feels like you're cheating?If it gets the work done with a reasonable amount of resources, then sure. But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.Often also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)I still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.---I'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.But if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): …`I don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",syklemil,2025-08-15 10:46:47,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqr4ud,False,

n8jes53,"Two communities on Reddit to check out:- r/programminglanguages- r/compilers (I just saw you also posted there)Regarding languages, someone asked a similar question on another forum I frequent recently and my answer there is the same here:The language mostly doesn't matter. You can build a compiler in pretty much any language. The advantage *some* languages have are with respect to:1. Parsing libraries or tools like parser generators.2. Backend support if you don't want to implement code generation yourself. LLVM is a pretty popular one to use, and you'll want language bindings to it in whatever language you use so that may limit you.But, if you're building the full compiler, just use a language you know, or a language you want to learn. I've written compilers and interpreters in C, Java, SML, Scheme (Racket, but 99% the Scheme subset), C++, Python, and toyed with it in Rust.A feature that is very helpful is good support for pattern matching (present in Rust, Swift, SML, OCaml, Haskell, and a number of others). But it's not strictly *required*, your code will just be more verbose without it.For a beginner friendly path, I haven't worked all the way through it but I like the premise and what I've read in Nora Sandler's _Writing a C Compiler_. But it's not the only path out there. The reason I like it for beginners is it breaks up a common pattern in compilers courses and other textbooks.Compilers have a natural structure: parser -> analyzer -> optimizers -> code generationA lot of books and courses have you focus on the parser, then the analyzer, then the optimizers (possibly skipped), and then code generation. If your parser doesn't handle the full language, your analyzer will be wrong, and your code generation will be wrong. Sandler's book (inspired by a paper by Ghuloum) takes an iterative approach which starts with essentially the simplest C program and then grows both what's parsed and what can be generated with each chapter. The first compiler can only compile this: int main() { return 42; }Then with each chapter the parser, analyzer, and code generator gets increasingly complex and supports more and more C features.Jeremy Siek has a pair of books, both called _Essentials of Compilation_, that, depending on which you read, uses Python to compile a Python-like language or Racket for a Scheme/Racket-like language. Both his books are free, but they do tie you more to the specific language the book covers which is why I Sandler's book comes out ahead for me as a recommendation. Sandler's book is roughly the same structure but your implementation language is up to you. Use JS if you want, the tests are all C programs and whether they execute correctly.If you want to build an interpreter, *Crafting Interpreters* by Nystrom is a pretty popular recommendation and free. A book I like, but isn't free (legally) is *Essentials of Programming Languages* but it also uses Scheme or Racket, though you could follow along in a language of your choice with some effort.",rabuf,2025-08-13 21:12:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mp7qe5,False,

n7u8i1p,"My bet is on small, specialized LLMs that can run locally.The big cloud stuff left the awful phantasies behind (GPT3 made the suggestion to buy an Audi A3 for towing a big trailer, LOL), but still has problems in many areas. My go to test is to let ChatGPT generate an image of a sailing catamaran using Dall-E and although the result looks nice at first, the generated image still shows a badly functioning yacht.Things are different when you start using local LLMs. Due to hardware restrictions, my currently best running LLM ist mistral:7b, a downsized version with usable coding knowledge, language support and overall world knowledge. I can use it to improve code and get help when I am looking for what I need to change to achieve a specific behavior (take THAT, CSS!). It is not perfect, but so far it was useful in my work with Angular and NestJS.This is also supported by the availability of systems with a lot of shared memory. Although it is slower than real VRAM, it makes it possible to run larger models on a MacBook or something powered by AMDs Ryzen AI series. A medium sized LLM (20-30 billion parameters) can have very good world knowledge and if it is optimized for a specific purpose (reading documents, helping to code, looking for abnormalities in log files) has the potential to safe a lot of time and work.All that said, the use of LLMs can lead to catastrophic misinterpretations of the data given, so the models have to be tuned to give info on their thought process so you can manage and fine tune them. The way of Google to dumb down search and try to shove down Gemini as the next big thing is an example of what not to do - the results are sometimes funny at best, but can be deadly. (Maybe we, as humans, have the wrong perspective of what AI should replace?)There are a lot of areas where AI hasn't even begun to get traction, although it has the potential. Just today I was taking measurements of my trailer and scribbling it down - a well trained LLM could put all those notes right into CAD and make suggestions of how and what to measure.

n8a0yqq,"As someone who is a Director - large companies need to stop trying to get all of their ideas, priorities, direction, etc. from leadership. We've gotten to this point where leaders think that they are the supermegaminds that are the only ones who could possible know what the company needs to focus on, and the reality is that figuring out what a company needs should be much more bottom up than top down - because it always needs to go to the bottom and come back up anyway.Right now the model - especially for internal work, but I'm sure also for external work - is:1. Executive comes up with ""great idea"" that is neither great nor feasible2. Executive hands idea down to VP, who loves the idea3. Executive hands project down to Director with timelines and super aggressive goals. Director already starts getting nervous because this idea sounds unreasonable, and so do the timelines. Also, maybe not that great of an idea once you layer reality on it4. Executive breaks into smaller projects, hands to Managers. Managers shitting bricks because they *know* this shit is unreasonable and they start pushing back while simultaneously getting ICs lined up on how to get things moving in a direction that is most likely to be palatable to leadership when it inevitbaly becomes clear the original idea wasn't possible.5. Manager pushes on Director, Director pushes on VP, VP punches Director in face, Director pushes back again on VP, VP starts softening language with executive, executive punches VP in face, VP pushes back a bit harder, executive punches again, VP remembers that executive doesn't know shit so he starts redifining things so that they sound like what the executive wanted while banking on the possibility that the executive doesn't even really know what they want. It works6. Manager gets go ahead to build the thing they've been building already. It is not what executive wanted, but executive doesn't care as long as he can sell it, so everyone - executive, vp, director, manager, ICs - now have to make a bunch of powerpoint slides to convince everyone else that the bullshit they built - which was good and useful - is actually the greates development ever.",dfphd,2025-08-12 12:31:33,314,cscareerquestions,t3_1mo7072,False,

n7sfi04,"I agree with some of your points, but I'll slightly disagree with you on a few things.AI is a factor in the job market, but not what is being pushed. AI isn't replacing entire industries, but companies are so worried about missing out, they are throwing tons of money at it (and likely getting very little return). So, AI is a distraction, but it's drawing lots of investment that could be spent elsewhere like employee salary and investment in non-AI projects. A lot of professional services companies are trying to become AI gurus, because that's what clients are currently looking for. That's part of why I think it's a bubble that has to pop eventually. I've seen lots of non-technical consultants opening up small AI consulting companies, becoming heads of AI practices (mostly sales and management roles), and so many people going nuts on LinkedIn. One or two people who I've worked with in the past, I trust some of what they are posting. Most of the people are just trying to become business world influencers. There are certainly other factors contributing to the poor job market.One thing that feels unique is the current US administration. It seems to be actively trying to destroy the job market. I'll be blunt, I think there are a lot of unqualified people in the current administration, and I'm not sure what their main motivators outside of personal wealth are. They want to lower interest rates. Well, a weak job market will help with that. And they are actively firing thousands of federal employees, killing grants, and all sorts of other actions putting people out of work. But they don't want people to think the job market is weak, because ""Republicans are supposed to be good for the economy."" We'll have to see what long-term impact it has and how long it takes to recover. Other countries are also dealing with inflation, but it feels like the US is dealing with inflation and a bunch of other things. I'm no economist, but I've read a few people argue the tariff policy reminds them of the time before the Great Depression. So, things might get really bad and ""it's different this time."" Or, this is a spot where I can be in the camp that predicted things incorrectly, which has happened plenty of times. I was originally in the camp that the job market would turn around in a year or two in 2022. Thinking back to working during the dotcom bubble, it might have taken 4 years or so for a recovery. But the government was trying to improve things. Now, it feels like the exact opposite.

Pair that with the huge cultural changes affecting large parts of the industry and this is definitely a pivot point for tech, if not totally unprecedented.The more important point is that the number of junior roles in the tech industry has crashed in a way that, historically, it never has, and that specifically may be due to (misplaced) confidence that AI can improve the productivity of mid- and senior-level workers to a degree that means junior employees are no longer necessary.

n8fad81,"Companies will always make the bold claims that will sell their product. Having worked in tech for my entire career since 2009 (banks, big tech, startups, scale-ups), I can see why a lot of businesses really want it to be true:\- Many regular non-tech businesses (think banks, insurance companies, etc) really suck at delivering software projects, most of their initiatives either outright fail, or go massively over-budget. They also have big consultancies (like Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, E&Y, etc) charging them massive fees for embedded software development squads - mainly because they themselves can't properly deliver.\- Many business people still think in the mindset of build vs run for how the world works. i.e I spend time and money to build something (with a team specialising in building), then I get to run it (without the builders). Think of something like building a house or an apartment block - after the house is complete you don't need structural engineers, electricians and carpenters hanging around on full-time salaries - they leave, you don't need them anymore. This is how a lot of people expect the world to work for most things, but its not really the case with software products / platforms. There is a real desire from many businesses to have it become this way. For example, if I'm a successful apparel retailer like Nike / Adidas - my business would be way more profitable if I only had to really fork out software development costs during major projects / uplifts.

Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience.

Keep a lookout in the next month and all these new industry panels should be on the ai4 website and you can see for yourself how these companies are using LLM properly https://ai4.io/videos/.

The accuracy is based on the transformer model and it seems we might be nearing the end of that architecture's accuracy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large\_language\_model. The reason why LLMs are notoriously bad with logical or math calculation is because it doesn't actually do deterministic calculations but just probabilistic ""what is the most likely words it should output is"" based on your token input, aka prompt.Also, a large majority of these companies still need software developers as they are the final guard rails of these LLM outputs.

Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)Outside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)My facebook, which back then was young cool social media, could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.This is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)Now for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the ""ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$"". People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.Futhermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get. Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.I think one thing to realize when talking about job markets is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012 are all 33 to 40. This means you have an entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus. That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)Like this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021 over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.There is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies.

This is after a week of working overtime to keep up by the way.I could immediately see my team eyeing up my jobs, just ready to get one over on me to be above me on the pile.Month after month, I would be bottom of the pile despite 70 hour weeks. After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.My check ins and ""performance"" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.I had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.OK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!Despite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.I didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.Eventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. It took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there. One day, HR called up and on a conference call, asked me if we could come to an agreement.

n888yi7,"Despite what it may say on a job posting, most of the requirements aren’t actually requirements. Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.That said, yeah, if you’re self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There’s still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.Right now there’s a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don’t have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.As someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that’s just where the market is at right now.The best advice I can give you is:- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it’s a long shot and don’t get your hopes up, but it doesn’t hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren’t “tech” companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says “developer”, “software engineer”, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you’re probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",Drugba,2025-08-12 03:28:09,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1mnx0jd,False,

Maybe the goals aren't to get to ""the next levels"", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.Companies that do career ladders well will have a concept of ""career role"" or ""terminal"" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.That means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.Once you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say ""I'll be a senior my entire life"". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. Why? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same ""level"" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward.

But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.The goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.But if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home...

Technically I also only need to be in for 50% of my time, so some days I'll head home for lunch and work remote the rest of the day. My boss' general stance is as long as it doesn't become an issue for him, he doesn't care how we handle ourselves with regards to how much were in the office.I very much preferred to work remote, but this place also has a very generous PTO policy, sick time that's separate from the PTO, other forms of leave that I may find useful, and they actually have a pension, so it's worth putting up with the in-office requirement for me. I too am generally pretty introverted, but you sort of build a tolerance for it after a bit and learn when you need to compartmentalize. I also do feel like I know more folks here than other places I started and was fully remote, which can be nice.If anything, be thankful it's not a full five days in the office.",ModernTenshi04,2025-08-12 11:51:28,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1mnqwc8,False,

Two reasons for this:1 - After 1 year, the $80k/yr earned you $80k. After waiting 3 months to land a $100k/yr job, you'll earn 9 months of the $100k/yr job with is $67k.

n8x8zzs,"I don't live in the US (thank god) but I was close to when I got an offer from a company to go to the US to work as an H1B migrant worker. I can tell you this.The fault is not on the H1B visa workers, nor on the offshore engineers who earn 1/10th of the salary of an american doing the same role.The fault is in the capitalist system under which most western countries operate, where profit is the one and only thing that matters for companies and for the government.When the industrial revolution came, thousands of factory workers were replaced by machines to increase profits. Even though this was a catastrophe for the workers who were laid off, it is seen as a net positive in history because working conditions at that time were just awfil in factory. This was the first example of such a situation happening in large scale.Then later, with the advent of automation and advanced manufacturing, a large part of the remaining people working in factories has been automated by smart machines and robotics. This time we shrug it off and said ""yeah it sucks, but you should have learned how to code"". They sold people the idea that the boring, factory jobs would simply be replaced by automation, so people would just all become engineers instead. Then the entire factories were offshored to developing countries to cut cost. But since you bought into this idea, it is ok because everyone in the first world will be engineers and the low level factory work will be done by the third world.More or less by the time I was in university it was already becoming a well known fact that engineering jobs were also starting to become offshored. I guess US and Europe were once again sold the idea that it was ok, because now the third world would provide the manufacturing and engineering, and the first world would be only designing the products (why do you think so many products nowadays say ""designed in France/ designed in California/ designed in Flanders""?).But the greed of the capitalist system knows no limits. It has no concept of loyalty for its citizens. If allowed, companies will offshore every single job that can be done remotely to cut costs. And for the rest that need to be done manually, they will probably deploy robots autonomously or teleoperated (by people in the third wolrd of course).Yes, eventually companies will consist only of the owners, who will own all of the capital and be an elite iltra-rich minority in society. The rest of the population will be a very thin middle class, and a majority of lower class, who will be kept alive by providing them with the minimal necessities just so they can keep consuming, but they will probably own nothing since most of the wealth like businesses and houses will be owned by huge corporations.You might think this is all some insane idea but if you look in the news, with recent massive layoffs, amazon warehouse workers, ai replacing desk receptionists at hotels, it seems this is not just a dystopian future, but a reality that day by day gets closer to us.What is the solution then? Well, for me I don't have enough sympathy for society to even fight for a change or an improvement. I believe it's going in a downward spiral and eventually I too will be laid off because AI will make my job easily replaced by an offshore engineer with an ai tool.

If you can't get an internship, which is usually the case, you spend the first year working on projects for the resume, and then use that for internships the next two years, and try to get a return offer after grad from one of those. When you're a sophomore, set yourself a fixed (# of apps) daily goal, even if small, and start.As for the projects themselves, I can't tell you what to make, but I'd started with a website with three.js. It was fun to write thanks to Three, it lightly dabbled in the process of hosting it etc., and it resulted in something permanent online, which imo is more satisfying than a local terminal program unless that serves a real use. Even better if you do something with even a small amount of users, so you can get started on databases.If you want to go more hardware/embedded CS, look into making an RC with as many functional systems you can put into it.

Expand on uni projects, especially those you find interesting. You're already doing them, you can work on them further and put 'em on GitHub.2. Think of whatever CS topic you enjoy or think you might enjoy (gaming, data analysis, web development) and/or real-life topic (history, finance, music, medical) and make something related. Doesn't matter if it's overdone (web shop, library record keeping) or novel, do something you'll like :)3. Don't go too big, you'll burn yourself out.4. On a similar note as 3, don't worry about perfection. Make something perfectable first.5. Use Git with all of your projects (publishable or not), get in the habit of writing good commit messages, and push everything to GitHub (and/or GitLab, if you want). These are greay habits for later. I think only 20% of my repos are public.Don't worry about publishing a project. Play around, take tutorials, make dumb scripts, and write whatever code comes to mind. Maybe some of it will be interesting enough for you to work on it further and take public.You can also try Advent of Code for code challenges similar to what you know (algorithms, data structures), with more flexibility than LeetCode/CodeWars. You can make your solutions public too (not the inputs!).You're very young and have tons of time to find your niche(s), so experiment early and cheaply.Things to keep in mind:- Try learning testing (unit testing especially) early, it's insanely useful and highly required in industry.- As mentioned, use Git with all of your projects.- Don't let LLMs like ChatGPT write for you. Especially this early, your skills will stagnate. This includes BOTH code and regular text (comments, commit messages, README files).- Do use ChatGPT to learn what you don't know, but also read documentation. Both are very useful skills.- Write a Readme for all of your projects (not right away, but over time). Markdown and documentation are both very useful in industry, and for those repositories you make public, READMEs are super important (arguably more so than the code).Don't overwork yourself into early burnout. Work on what you enjoy (and obviously your actual uni work), and if something is good enough, feel free to make it public.

You could say something like, I think I work slower then other people in the organization because I close an average of 5 tickets each day or hour or whatever.

Tell your manager what you do to make sure your work is done to a high standard (you double check your work before you close them or maybe you spend additional time with clients,etc).

Why would the previous manager expect you to be awake or even wake up for his call? I never had this issue before but this time I work remotely for an APAC team and there are many cultural differences in terms of working hours etc. I could handle it the first two years as I usually don't mind working extra hours and the people were generally nice, even though there were a lot of issues like cultural differences, no other woman in the whole department etc. Last year my ex manager got promoted so another guy took his place and I ve been reporting to this new guy. The situation is exactly like yours. Continuously moving targets to always make me feel inadequate, never praising any kind of work I do even though the previous manager and my manager 's manager were giving me very good reviews etc. He is exactly like your current manager, giving no clear expectations, no clear communication and always saying that I should have thought of XYZ from the start. I don't mind feedback and I actually implement a lot of his technical feedback. It's the continuous subtle accusation about lack of professionalism, carelessness etc. there were many times that I was the only one looking at prod issues, I would resolve them, put a summary in public channels of what was the issue and how i resolved it, and then instead of getting a "" good job for figuring this out"", I would have to explain to him why did it take me 2 hours to resolve for example instead of 1. But what REALLY pisses me off is that he doesn't practice what he preaches about professionalism. He will release stuff without testing, release stuff without updating the database to be on the same version etc. But no one tells him anything because the rest of them are nice people. Anyway there is not much we can do. I actually did go to my previous manager and asked him if I could report back to him. I didn't go into details about my current manager though, I tried to avoid all the extra drama. I just want to get out of this situation. He said yes and he would request for the change. So I guess it helped having someone higher up that I had worked with in the past and he knows me already. But it's been a few weeks and nothing has happened. Maybe he didn't think it was urgent. I think we are hiring now and he might want to give him new direct reports from the new hire before changing me back to him, I don't know. I will ask again and probably this time I will be more specific about what the issue is, because I can't keep asking without giving concrete reasons. It's hard though to do it without making yourself looking like the one who is just complaining or the problematic one. So I am also looking for a new job, but the job market sucks.

I graduated in CS this year and I've felt like my degree (even before I got it) opened doors for me, but then again, I didn't go the SWE route. I intended to be a programmer when I first enrolled in CS back in 2019, but after my freshman year I realized that coding for a living wasn't for me- just as a hobby. I stayed in school because I was more than halfway done with my bachelor's and I didn't want all of that money to go to waste. In my junior year, I applied to an IT internship and I ended up getting it. I continued to work in IT for 2 years, got my bachelors (with my minor being in IT), and now I'm a Network Engineer making $60,000. Even before I got promoted to engineer, I got offers to do tech sales and even got to do some traveling for it. I would've not gotten those opportunities if my anticipated degree wasn't listed in my resume.However, someone else's experience may be different from mine- maybe they've worked unpaid internships and now they can't get hired anywhere. I don't want to invalidate anyone's experiences, but please understand that there's a whole set of variables that impact the job market for everyone- as it is different in every city, and country especially.

I think that the companies that hyper-fixate on not hiring junior engineers and using AI as a quick fix will die. I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.What I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.Ultimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed.

When I actually spoke with people at the company, thats not the vibe I got at all, so I joined despite those reviews. I'm extremely glad I did. I bet those reviews were just from salty employees bad at their job, because I'm the last person to be ""buddy buddy"" with anyone at work, especially the CEO, but I got amazing raises and several promotions.

The market was probably better when I got the job, but regardless, pursuing a career in tech is not automatically a lifetime sentence of unemployment.

If so, you’ll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. “Expectations are premeditated resentments” - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything. If you go into it determined to get something specific out of it, you’re probably going to be disappointed. But if you go into it knowing more about what challenges you are likely to face (exposed by the discouraging articles and posts), you’ll be able to spend more time preparing to face them instead of just trying to hit arbitrary benchmarks you think should get you a job (such as leetcode grinding for x hours every day/week, knowing certain languages/frameworks, which degree you get, etc)Modal of the story - do you WANT to pursue this career path?
