n4in6mg,">Anyone else been through this transition?Yeah, but not in DE. I was a chemist before and basically had this problem. I had experience on paper although over time I never really improved. It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.One of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in. I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper. In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.Lost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.I thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated. In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best. Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.Offering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.Paraphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting. Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on ""hard mode"" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style. Life is similar - people try and obtain success or financial freedom by copying others and wonder why they have to work so hard to achieve so little compared to the person they're trying to emulate, essentially being on hard mode by their own design.We are all designed to do something well and it is up to us to find what that is.>How did you push through?

For a long time, it was impossible to have a primary key in a data lake (which is the main storage strategy in DE right now) because data was stored in files, within a file system. Most files structures / tables probably (hopefully) had some kind of unique identifier but no primary keys.Regarding DRY, this is a not really a database or data modeling concept, it is a development concept. In data modeling, the concept you are looking for is data normalization. A ""dry"" schema is in third normal form or 3NF of higher. Which is 100% related with having a unique identifier.

n5ahdh4,"Most Data Warehouse don’t support the concept of primary key. I think the only reason is the size of the data. You don’t want to make sure your 300 billions records are unique every time you add a new row.But the concept of unique identifier should be introduced into almost all tables. That unique identifier is normally a surrogate key. Surrogate key are unique identifier derives from other fields. For example a md5 hash of the concatenation of 4 columns. This give you a unique identifier.What’s great about surrogate keys is that they are not random. You get consistency in any systems, if you migrate to another platform your surrogate keys are still valid and that’s very powerful. Also you can reproduce the same results over and over again, which is not possible if you use a UUID generated by another system for example.Then depending on the tool you use you can validate the uniqueness of the fields yourself. There’s some reason you might want to do this yourself and not the system like you would have in a normal db and is that because you can have multiple time the same records or a different version of what you consider the same records.Since the DW is for analytics you might want to analyze those different records which are not unique in your raw layer but could be in your marts.So it’s a powerful thing to let you control de uniqueness of the fields yourself.Obviously if you don’t manage it you’ll probably end up with a lot of duplicates. But since the DW store all your data it’s better to avoid having the constraint on inserts and give the users more flexibility.

Especially when you work with things that are closer to ML, that have testable behaviours that only manifest when working on a huge dataset with specific patterns. This is not an intractable problem, though. You still can factor your code correctly and cover with unit tests as much as you can, and write queries for ongoing data quality monitoring (a good data analyst will be a very important ally in this activity). For more complex stuff, talk to your platform/infra/governance people about having a ""sandbox"" environment - prod data but all the sensitive parts masked. Nobody understands the complexity? That sounds like your org needs more ""less technical"" people like analysts, not less. And yes, you as a DE need to be in touch with them, because they will be able to tell you what to expect of your data.People questioning numbers when they don't match vibes?

I think the will to do git appears after one or two incidents when someone does a breaking change that nobody had a chance to review, or accidentally deletes some script on some server somewhere. If your data team is subsidary to technical leaders in the org chart, I think they're usually sympathetic to the idea, and you can go through them to push git adoption. You can also smooth things along by writing a ""git for dummies"" document for your DS/DA.

That's pretty straight forward. A data warehouse is just a very, very large database. There are two different database areas, operational and analytic. They are characterised by the SLAs you have on the data. Smaller databases are normally used for operational because you need fast response times. In analytic, the response times aren't normally as critical but they handle quite a bit more data; much of it historic. In a perfect world, if you could do both with the same system, you would. The problem is the cost to do them all in one. Of course, these are gross oversimplifications but it gets the idea across. In addition to the database component, the surrounding data ecosystems are different but they have many commonalities.Data Lake and Lakehouse are both marketing BS. Nothing more. The same is true of ""medalion architecture."" It is an attemp to make the standard three tier (staging, core, semantic) into to something different by giving it a new coat of paint. Someone noticed that you can store quite a bit of extra ""stuff"" in the staging layer beyond what the database needs. Of course, the marketing folks thought that needed a new name. I think we are at the point now where we just keep adding buzzwords to the names. It's like a technical pin the tail on the donkey. The latest is ""now with more AI!.""

The Star Schema model was originally created during an age with storage was the scarce resource so it was important never to store duplicate data. Nowadays, storage is so cheap it's practically free so it's compute that we must optimize for. Having to do dozens of `join`s to gain context on every record certainly doesn't support that. Usually, I practice some form of what you might call ""Star Schema Light"" in the silver layer where I create tables around business entities. So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables.

Another way to reword this is that the UserTag entity is a fact table. You could add a date / calendar dimension to this fact and this would allow you to see how many users one tag have, which users have which tags... It also depends on how ""fast"" these tags are attributed. Could they be considered an attribute to the fact? It is hard to decide without having a closer look at your use case and the data.Regarding the surrogate keys. You don't need them on all dimensions.

I don't know how to vet them besides just talking to people in similar roles. When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag.

That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important.

This is because just copying the whole table every day is too expensive, and the changes are expected to be small, so could instead use a smaller machine.

n4s63t6,"Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!"". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s.

For incremental loads, we only update records that actually appear in the batch - never delete based on absence.The trick is tracking what constitutes a ""complete picture"" at the source level. We usually maintain a separate metadata table that tracks when each source last did a full refresh, so we know our baseline.**Storage and history management:** Bronze is the wrong place for long term history imo. We keep maybe 30-90 days in Bronze for reprocessing, then archive to cheaper storage. The real historical tracking happens in Silver where you can be more selective about what actually needs versioning.For cost control, consider:* Partition by load date so you can easily drop old data* Use Delta's time travel for short term history, separate archive for long term* Not everything needs full history - focus on business critical entities**Quick pattern that works:*** Bronze: Current state + recent changes (30-90 days)* Silver: SCD Type 2 for entities that need history* Archive layer: Compressed parquet in cold storage for compliancea reference of 3 tier architecture: Bronze, Silver, Gold layers: [https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png](https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png)What kind of data volumes are you dealing with?

That pedantic message aside, we can take the concept of unit tests and apply to data engineering. We need three things. 1. Known input state (What data are we reading)2. Work (Query, task, function, something that transforms data)3. Know expected output stateDbt and SQLMesh do this with their own concept of unit tests. I'm sure other platforms have their own solutions. If you want to roll your own it is fairly simple in theory.... 1. Create known data that shows the characteristics of what you want to test.2. Run the portion of your pipeline that you want to test.3. Compare the output to the expected output. If it matches you are good.

This makes it easy to write unit tests where you pass mock inputs into transform functions and compare output to expectation. From there you just get better at breaking down these transform functions to make it easier to write unit tests for. You can also write your runtime data validations as functions in the same way and write unit tests for those to make sure they catch bad data.This separation of transform code and connecting/reading/writing code makes it easier to abstract and consolidate the latter and write integration tests for those.So in your hypothetical “process_data_to_silver.py”, assuming that’s an etl task will likely not need much unit tests of its own. It’s simply importing a dataset processing function, passing it inputs, and then publishing the output.

One technical project manager I worked with was pursuing one, but he left before he finished it.The reality is CFA is an extremely difficult certification, each level has a sub 50% pass rate and the only reason you should pursue one is if you want to become a person who professionally is allowed to give investment advice or directly manage a portfolio.The technical problems we solve don’t require that intimate knowledge of investment vehicles and financial planning, so anyone hiring for technical positions would far value technical aptitude over whatever CFA would bring to the table. Even people who worked closer to the business side (product management, business systems analysis) didn’t have CFAs. Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.Imo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby.

n4vudje,"Great question. A lot of folks in data look to deepen their finance knowledge, but the CFA might not be the most direct route if your goal is to stay in data engineering.CFA is a serious time and energy investment. It’s incredibly valuable if you’re aiming to become a portfolio manager or financial analyst who makes investment decisions—but for a data engineer, the overlap is limited. Most technical roles at places like Citi, JPMorgan, or Bain don’t require or expect a CFA. What they *do* value is domain familiarity: understanding how financial data works, how to build pipelines for it, and how to surface insights that support the business.A more practical route might be building out your finance knowledge in parallel with your engineering work. Things like:* Learning how to wrangle financial data (from market feeds, statements, or transactions)* Building dashboards for KPIs like revenue, risk, or portfolio performance* Working with time-series forecasting or valuation modelsThere’s strong demand for data engineers with finance context—it’s just more about hands-on skills than credentials. If you're interested, we’ve got some finance-focused tracks that lean technical: Python for Finance, Financial Modeling in Excel, and Financial Analysis in Power BI. They can give you the right foundation without going all-in on CFA.That said, if you’re considering a career shift toward investment roles or product strategy, the CFA might be worth it—but it’s rarely a game-changer on the engineering side.",DataCamp,2025-07-24 11:54:10,1,dataengineering,t3_1m73v8c,False,

n4pn6zs,"I've done between 150 and 200 of these animals. The process is very similar regardless of the tools. Let me give you the high points. The goal here is to make sure you accomplish something, have a defined finish line and don't just resell them back the same used car they were driving with a new coat of paint.1. Make sure there is total agreement as to WHY you are doing this. You need this before you use any brain cells on the technical or tools side of the house. This needs to be in writing and preferably signed off by all stakeholders. None of these reasons will be technical. They will all be business oriented. This step needs to be very well documented and agreed on. Don't let anyone push you to rush this one. I usually take 3-4 weeks for this. Sometimes it takes longer. These are all of your project success criteria. Why was a decision to replicate what you already have made? The longest path to anywhere is a shortcut.2. Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. ""Because we've always had them"" is not a reason. Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect. This stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.Nothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company. Throw away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you. A traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down. Generate regular deliverables to the business and be able to show how they address the business needs you identified in step one. If they can't be tied back, ask yourself why you are building them. This is a VERY high description of how you refactor or initially design a data warehouse. It may seem overwhelming but just break it down into chunks and always be thinking about the future.

Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.- make sure your view definitions are under version control. Look into dbt to make this easier to manage.- on data viz, sure you can use tableau but I personally have found it a bit clunky when I've used it in the past and it can get very expensive.

Not sure how big the team is but it sounds like a lot of stuff to glue together and maintain.I have quite a bit of experience working with multi-tenant data architecture, and almost always they benefitted significantly from shared larger data warehouses rather than per-customer instance, so I suggest centralizing. Down the line some new usecases will require cross-client insights, some new developments will benefit all the customers at once, and you'll thank yourself.In terms of the architecture, it sounds like SQL-only stuff might not fit the bill here. I would suggest:- land the data in your dwh somehow- run transformations in SQL as much as possible, go with python where needed.- stay off of Spark, I don't see any benefit here for you, it is a complicated piece of software that is not even modern at this point.For individual pieces, you can either go bit by bit, e.g. one tool for ingestion, another for transformation, orchestration, etc. There are quite a lot of good alternatives, e.g. Fivetran + dbt + airflow. I suggest taking a look at [ingestr](https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr) for ingestion stuff.[Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin) could also fit the bill here since it is like dbt, but does ingestion, transformation with SQL and Python, orchestration, quality, and governance.

Our tech is oversaturated with buzzwords and abbreviations for no good reason.So I've read the article and I find it very interesting. I agree with many points, especially about idempotency. And I also have a few questions:1. From my experience, layered data platforms aren't made only for the sake of business. Materializing intermediate datasets with pieces of business logic can be necessary to maintain good cost/performance ratio. Especially when the data is big, and your ETL system can only handle data increments in a timely manner. At the same time, proper naming convention and an appropriate architecture (Kimball, DV) makes the data easier to navigate. Does this align with your vision, and if not, why is your way of doing things better? Or is it?2. Implement all transformations as pure functions - it makes me think you're advocating for ETL process instead of ELT (aka using compute engines like Spark for data transformations). I make this assumption, because implementing pure transformations using sql is much more tricky, and people with expertise in sql, but no expertise in OOP may struggle to do it consistently. Even tools like DBT require careful model design to achieve real idempotency.

n5oaab6,"Yes, there is a lot of misinformation in the data world. Does it need another acronym? Probably not. Especially with two 'TT' together! But to answer your questions. 1. We do create intermediate tables. Sometimes, with QA results, we just store intermediate transforms (we do almost all work in SQL). We tend not to keep those intermediate tables around unless necessary. The key idea is that a single end-to-end process governs the flow from raw data to final output. That’s the critical point. While this process may technically generate multiple intermediate layers, each additional customer-exposed layer incurs overhead in terms of time, governance, documentation, and support questions. And they are rarely used. So the real question becomes: why maintain extra layers at all? 2. We mostly do SQL, with occasional Python when we have to ingest some strange format. It's mostly ELT. So are all our functions pure? No. We tend to group code together to perform tasks such as creating a dimension. If we create intermediate tables, we clean them up immediately at the end (and the start, checking to see if they are already present before deleting them). So it 'pure' without using SQL language, supported but replaced with a culture and code review.

Talking about your example, I would split them up, keeping one change per changeset. Also, createTable and createIndex should not be considered a single operation. It is very common to create indexes sometime after the table is created. e.g.. Create the table, ingest the data, then create the indexes.2. Again, I would not keep them in the same changeset. Having the CREATE OR REPLACE clause helps make the change idempotent, but the function and the trigger are still two different objects.3. I believe in this case, you should add a rollback for the trigger.Again, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Liquibase, and I'm aware that following the guidelines strictly can make everything more laborious, so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't think you should be so strict if you are creating the database from scratch, for example. In that case, I would develop changesets to create multiple foreign keys and indexes, for example.

And there's different philosophies of design (""in memory"" or not, distributed or not, etc, etc).Some (many) algorithms degrade poorly when the amount of data is larger than the system's available memory. It's not just about the size of data; it's also about whether there's a performance cliff (or a point where you outright start failing).You're not wrong, a single machine can do a lot.

n5bj6it,"For operational use cases - take the data, do something to it, send output to some downstream system - your instinct is correct in that trying to shoehorn the “medallion” concept into this sort of flow can be counterintuitive. My team and I went through a lot of back-and-forth on whether we wanted to support such use cases in our Databricks environment, or wanted to keep them separate. There were arguments to be made for separate - the data volume of these use cases is lower than our analytical workloads, and so Azure Functions/Logic Apps could be sufficient. However, then we would need to use a non-Databricks orchestrator, which would be a bit annoying for some of the multi-step operational workflows. Doing it in Databricks meant that all of our data jobs live in one place and are orchestrated through one set of tools, regardless of whether they’re operational or analytical in nature. Databricks Asset Bundles have been great for us in this regard, in terms of allowing us to define our job configurations as code. Once we got past that, we came back to the medallion. We landed the operational data in its own schema in our bronze catalog, but rather than moving it to “silver”, we created an operations catalog that serves as the use-case layer for all of these operational pipelines. They’re still sourced from bronze, and in the future, we might source analytical “silver” tables from either the bronze or operational catalogs, but this approach has been working well for us.We leverage Databricks secrets (backed by Azure Key Vault) for all of our connection secrets, and give our service principals READ access to the scope in each environment. We have also modularized our code for SFTP/FTP into a helper library so we don’t have to maintain the same logic in each pipeline. We try to stick to asynchronous patterns for our downstream writes (e.g. we drop off a file somewhere and some downstream system picks it up), but if we had to, we could also make a direct API connection and write our data that way. We just haven’t really had to do that for our use cases thus far.",worseshitonthenews,2025-07-26 20:10:05,3,dataengineering,t3_1ma19ck,False,

Do you have any pointers there?Also curious what your SFTP code does.

Especially when you’re working in a multi-environment space (dev > test > prod) this simplifies your life by alleviating the need to deploy jobs manually via the UI in each environment. Our SFTP helper library is basically just a wrapper around paramiko (a library that offers a Python implementation of SSHv2). By passing a few secrets to our helper class, the helper handles the rest and supports both key and credential-based auth. It saves us from having to write the same 30-40 lines of code in each pipeline, since we can instantiate our connection object with a single line of code.

Cheap storage lets you keep whole history for replay.Each night run a compact job with Spark or any lake engine. It reads yesterday’s tiny files, writes a handful of big Parquet or Delta files, then deletes the fragments. Big files mean faster scans and less metadata load. Create a lake table on top of those compact files and partition by the field you filter most, usually `check_in_date`. Too many partitions slow things instead of helping.Flatten and enrich data in a second pass, then load it into a serving database like Postgres and put indexes on hotel\_id, date, guests.

You can always add more complexity and redundancy but if you're prototyping a mvp choose what's worth it. Also remember writing *into* cloud storage is generally free, bandwidth wise.

So if I'm at a point that I want to productionize my prototype the codebase is mostly ready. Two other points would be metadata. I almost always want to record when the record was fetched, as the time series makes it easier to observe patterns or know when a job wasn't performing correctly so I can disregard it's responses. Like maybe the hotel returns cheaper prices for future reservations on Mondays than on Saturdays. Or if my request was made with an apple device identifier vs a windows one. Lastly performing any updates to data is easier in a DB. Plucking attributes from inside the json to it's own column for filtering/indexing is simple. Or while processing each new batch of data I can perform a ranking to generate an SCD2 type table of differences with lags can help reduce storage over time (ie have a record for each change rather than a record for every request).

What you do is make a list of tasks. If you can't think of how to solve the task, you split it up again. If you can't solve the individual parts, you split those up again. And again.You wanted a way to 'describe it in English', and this is possible. You distill the core of the problem by focusing on what you want to do and the nouns in the problem description. You must first clearly state your problem. For example:- Problem: ""I want to know how often a word appears in an array of words and write this to the screen.""Distill the core:- array of words- count how often- word- write to screenTo do this, I need:- An array of words (so I must define this).- A way to keep count (so I must define some data structure for this).- A way to look at each word in the array. (Thus I need a loop to pass by each word in the array.)- A way to decide if I already counted the word before (if yes: increase counter; else add word and set counter to 1)- To Write the result to the screenSimple code (pseudo; language is not important yet):```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana]define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {decide if you counted the word before}print_result(keep_count)```Now you have the array of words, and a way to keep count. The thing you didn't work out yet was ""decide if you counted a word before"", so that's what you do next:```if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}```So now you put that solution into the previous block of code:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```Then refine it a bit:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {keep_count for word: increase by 1} else {keep_count add word: set to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```And you're done.

The above is programming; ""javascript bootcamp"" is writing code in Javascript. That's trivial compared to actually thinking up the solution.You always start with a problem, which you'll break down in smaller and smaller parts (where each part can be a function, which is also broken down into smaller parts), and in the end you'll be left with a (very long) list of tasks to do.",Xatraxalian,2025-07-24 22:04:24,107,learnprogramming,t3_1m8gz7l,False,

They can blame it on AI, watch their stock price shoot up. Save a ton of money on paying humans, and make their minimum corporate loan payments.Meanwhile your classmates are drinking the AI kool aid that startups have been pumping out for decades.If an LLM can code better than a fresh graduate, there will be no reason to hire young computer scientists. I doubt your friends are thinking this far in advance.That said, there are tons of papers on how LLMs and ML are close to the limit on how effective they can be. I think all large AI companies summed together are taking about 1 Great Britains worth of power to run. That's an insane amount of energy. Elon is using coal to power Grok which is mind blowingly stupid. It's causing health problems in the surrounding community near his data centers.I think every time you want a significant improvement you need an order of magnitude training data increase, as in add another 0. 1b > 10b > 100b > 1t. One trillion is 1 thousand billions. It's not just a big number. It's a number so big that there may arguably not be enough data to train it at a certain point.When AI trains on data that AI generated it fucks itself and starts outputting shit. This is a theory as to why so many giant LLMs like claude and chatgpt are getting worse. One reason might be that the nicer version is behind a paywall, but the other is that these llms might be consuming so much AI generated text that it's degrading them permanently and there's no real way to separate human from AI generated content on a platform that has billions of users.You may actually get to watch an entire industry enshittify in under 5 years, which is pretty cool IMO. It might be a once in a lifetime event.Advances tend to be S curved in the sense that you logarithmically increase a plateau of improvement, and then you get a material advance in conditions or approaches that allow you to exponentially increase towards another limit. Vaclav Smil's book on growth is basically like reading the back of a screwdriver but it's great at illustrating this point. It's almost a law of progress given enough resources.Realistically AI will increase, but it's largest limitation is energy consumption and training data requirements. These two things are kind of inherent in ML from what I understand and a lot of what people are doing to improve ML is incrementally improving it.My theory is that there will be a new AI paradigm that will be cheaper and require less input. Remember your brain can pitch a baseball, play chopin, cook a 5 star dinner, drive a racecar, and fuck elons mom and it only runs on the amount of power it takes to run a lightbulb.My recommendation would be to recognize that your friends are idiots, the hype is a smokescreen, and to just get good at coding and pass your classes. You will more than likely struggle more than your peers in school. As the problems get harder, you will struggle less and they will struggle more. And when it comes time to get a job you will be extremely rare in that you can actually code and your peers cannot. It will probably be easier for you to get a job.",nova-new-chorus,2025-07-23 04:39:37,12,learnprogramming,t3_1m6rm7s,False,

n4tf4j7,"I've tutored coding for almost 10 years (both as main job and as side gig). Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).I saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\- I would center my approach around the concept of ""how computers work and how to think systematically"". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around ""how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?"" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be ""How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't ""programming"" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to ""Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps"". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \*argv\[\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(""Hello World"");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world. \- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(""Hello World""), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",MagicHatJo,2025-07-24 00:46:36,29,learnprogramming,t3_1m7okmf,False,

The C++ solution, using an output stream for which `<<` has been defined as a ""put to"" operator, looks like this: cerr << ""x = "" << x << ""\n"";> [...] The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy by analogy with the I/O redirection operators in the UNIX shell (`>`, `>>`, `|`, etc.). This requires operators that return their left-hand operand for use by further operations.So basically, the stream operators exist to allow a convenient and concise way to output multiple values.In modern C++ you could accomplish the same goal with a variable-argument function using templates, but early versions of C++ didn't have the advanced template features needed to make that work.",teraflop,2025-07-23 15:24:31,57,learnprogramming,t3_1m7bu98,False,

I’ve also been using Codefinity, and I totally agree it’s a solid platform for beginners, especially if you're starting from scratch or looking for a structured way to learn Python and other programming skills. What I appreciate most is that it's very hands-on. You can write and test your code in-browser without needing to install anything, which makes it super convenient for people who don’t want to mess around with IDEs right away.In terms of beginner-friendly platforms, Codefinity definitely ranks up there. The lessons are bite-sized, which helps with consistency and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. I also found the AI assistant to be surprisingly helpful. It’s great for quick explanations when you're stuck or just need something reworded. That kind of interactive support is something a lot of other platforms don’t offer, especially not at this level of integration.However, the pricing model is a bit of a downside. Like you mentioned, it’s not very transparent upfront. You get into the lessons and then suddenly find out about a subscription. I think they could do better there. And yes, some of the early Python lessons are very basic, which might not be ideal for those with prior experience. But if you push through the first few modules, the content does become more challenging and engaging.What I’d love to see from Codefinity is more intermediate and project-based learning paths especially for things like data analysis, web development with Python, or real-world app building. That would make the platform not just a good starting point but a long-term learning tool too.For anyone searching for a Codefinity review, wondering if Codefinity is good for beginners, or looking for online platforms to learn Python, I’d say give it a shot just go in knowing the pros and cons.

You’ll probably get into the learning groove and then be hit with a subscription prompt, which can be frustrating.* The early lessons might feel *too* simple if you already know the basics. It starts very slow, but it does pick up and get more practical.:bullseye: **Why I’m using Codefinity**:My goal is to learn Python for data analysis and later move into web development.

n4gr972,">my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going onThis sounds like what people call a ""mental block"", and I think learning to defuse that involves a lot more learning *how to learn* than it does learning how to do computer science. Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.I'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.The struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of ""my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on"" - what's *actually* going on there?What's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. ""It's better to stop trying than to risk failure"", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.We beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that ""I don't get it"" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work? Break it down even further. Take a break the moment you feel like you're making negative progress, because that is a real threat in these kinds of situations.**Step 3:** The real outcome we're looking for here is a mindset change, because (as much as it sucks) coming up against frustrating or overwhelming problems is just a part of doing programming. It's tempting to think ""how do I avoid this?"" but it's more productive to instead think ""how do I process this and learn from it?"" - because it is gonna keep happening.When your brain wants to say ""I don't get it"", try to reframe: you don't understand *yet,* you're still in the process of learning.

Learn the wrong way to do things too, it'll help you figure out the right way to do things. Write shitty spaghetti code. You'll improve over time.Try something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.Take what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.There's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc.

I'm from Germany, and here many young people start paid trainee/apprenticeship programs for around 3 years to learn a profession. Maybe something like that exists where you are too?If university isn't an option for you - especially if it's expensive or forces you into debt for something you're not passionate about - then yeah, don't rush into it. It could become a trap.Given your situation, there's no guaranteed path. But if I were you, I'd try to find a mentor - even if it costs money. Good guidance can save you a lot of wasted time and effort.Also: besides programming and avoiding university in your city, what else interests you? Maybe you can find some creative crossover - tech isn't just web apps and games. There's a lot of space to combine different passions.Whatever you decide, don't just think about the next year.

Spending an afternoon learning how to use your IDE's debugger will save you hundreds of hours later.* Trace the execution path systematically - step through your code in the order it actually runs, not just how you think it should run. Use the debugger's ""step over/into"" functions or add print statements to follow the flow and catch where logic diverges from your expectations.* Use 'Rubber duck debugging': explain your code line by line to someone (or a rubber duck).

You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.Do you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.In a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.Because I've taught beginners, I've seen this ""I do random stuff and hope to fix it"" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.It's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.OK, so some steps.**Determine why you think your program is broken**I've had students who tell me their program doesn't work.

Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? This is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?**Try a smaller input**The next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).The first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).**Test your functions**A smaller version is to test functions. Determine* what are the input parameters* given certain input values, what are the output values**Write more small functions**Instead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.Write a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.**Test as you go along**Don't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code.

At the time these words were coined, Fortran and COBOL were the dominant programming languages, and they were extremely barebones compared to the modern versions of those languages. It's hard to fathom just how much we take for granted with modern programming languages today.In terms of encapsulation, folks were mostly just proposing what we now think of as modules or classes. Basically, the idea boils down to creating public facing APIs that do not expose their inner variables. I like [this source](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/01-objects/02-encapsulation/) which quotes from some of the originators of OOP-- Dave Parnas and Alan Kay. > Parnas and his peers pushed for not just hiding the data, but also how the data was manipulated. By hiding these implementation details, they could prevent programmers who were used to the globally accessible variables of early programming languages from looking into our code and using a variable that we might change in the future.Barbara Liskov is another big name in the OOP world, and [she covers encapsulation in this fantastic paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf)> For abstraction to work, implementations must be encapsulated. If an implementation is encapsulated, then no other module can depend on its implementation details. Encapsulation guarantees that modules can be implemented and reimplemented independently; it is related to the principle of “information hiding” advocated by Parnas [15].Those three formed the basis of all modern OOP concepts. They are the definitive sources. I think much of the confusion comes from the second wave of folks who implemented the popular languages and who each definitely went their own way. Because their languages are so popular, their opinions are almost equally valid despite the fact that they all disagree with each other on minor things.- Bjarne Stroustrup- James Gosling- Brad Cox- Bertrand MeyerAs a side note, when discussing design patterns, there are a few definitive sources:- [Design Patterns](https://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf) by the Gang of Four- Pattern Oriented Software Architecture, most notably volumes [one](https://daneshjavaji.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sznikak_jegyzet_pattern-oriented-sa_vol1.pdf) and [two](https://archive.org/details/patternorienteds0000unse_u5t3)- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoranLi/Books1/master/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture.pdf)However, most of those were written over twenty years ago, so [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is a good resource for putting these concepts into a modern context.",jessepence,2025-07-28 18:28:05,6,learnprogramming,t3_1mbmoz8,False,

I haven't really heard about people extracting data and editing the code though, just playing the games with the ROMs..In some cases, it sounds like you can save (AKA ""dump"") game cartridge ROMs directly on a console and save them to an SD card. For instance, for a Nintendo 3DS, I found [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges.html). For older systems,To look at the code though, you could use a disassembler and load the ROM into it - but it would only show you the assembly language instructions; you can't extract the original higher level code (i.e., C) from that. Reading assembly code and understanding what it's trying to do takes significant effort, as it's about as low-level as you can get. And if you want to make changes, you'd modify the instructions and re-assemble it (it doesn't get re-compiled like a higher-level language does).",RolandMT32,2025-07-25 23:18:00,2,learnprogramming,t3_1m9drkq,False,

You have no basis on what you have to learn and how well you need to know it, or even why you have to learn it. It sounds like you're going to basically be behind a single semester, which to be honest, isnt TOO bad, even though at the moment it sounds like the end of the world, trust me, its not that much time. My honest advice for you is to try and calm your anxieties for now and build a good relationship with programming. Go and pick a youtube tutorial Playlist you like, familiarize yourself with compilers/code editors, and just practice the basics like variables and loops. Don't try and make it into homework or work, just have fun with it, make it low stakes. If you like podcasts or lofi play some in the background while messing with some loops to familiarize yourself with them. Write a loop, change the variables. Add stuff, if it breaks, oh well, start over, delete the whole loop and write it again and start testing new stuff out. Go into leetcode and try out some of the easier prompts, if its too hard, its fine, just make a point to try it out and get used to the way the syntax works.",Error-7-0-7-,2025-07-28 14:31:38,7,learnprogramming,t3_1mbh2uv,False,

My degree was in IT with a focus in programming and software engineering. To me the hardest thing in my program was understanding the ""thought"" process behind solving problems with code. A great way to practice this for me was actually playing the game Human Resource Machine on Steam. It forces you to ""think"" and ""problem solve"" in a way that is really beneficial to coding.

In particular, naming a value just to immediately return it doesn't tend to provide much useful information to readers.* No comments like ""get input"". Comments are useful for providing information that's not visible in the code. If an `input()` function is called, I can already see that we're obtaining input.

Find a process that works for you and hammer it in with repetition. This way, when time comes for you to perform it's automatic and requires little thought. Second, create a cheat sheet for you to easily reference hard to remember concepts. I would suggest you physically create this sheet to help solidify terms and concepts and/or but it in a spreadsheet for quick referencing. Once you feel you have a concept, command, and/or process down, remove or archive. Third, pace yourself. This is your race. Your race is different from mine and everyone else's.

n4x76y8,"There's just two elements crucial for recursion: \- reliable and deterministic stop condition (VERY important): a way for the function to stop using self and return a plain value, based on a condition (which you seem to have) \- calling itself in a useful way if the stop condition is not metThat's about all you need to know to implement recursion, and you seem to understand that. Now, it depends greatly on what your project is, but in a typical project there's just a few scenarios where you'd use recursion. The fundamental one is when you're working with a hierarchical data, especially with arbitrary number of levels (so a tree topography basically). This can happen with stuff like tables (where row can have sub-rows) or file system.I would personally try implementing a flattening function (i.e. turning a list structure where there's a few top level elements to begin with, but each can have some children, of which each can have some children..) and the output should be a flat list of elements (flat list of all parents and all children, of all levels). When you're done you can move on and you'll probably forget about recursion for a long time. Also, keep in mind that most conventional (i.e. not purely functional, like Haskell) languages are not necessarily built to deal with recursion natively, and using recursion can cause stack overflow (due to every call being put on stack, instead of simplified/ignored, like a language natively supporting tail-call recursion would).

n524z95,"Making mistakes when faced with a number of choices is all part of learning to write code - as long as you learn from your mistakes. :) Sometimes you just have to try things out and see how the code looks. I have written code and felt ""that's not working"" (from a ""I'm happy with this"" point of view) and then either refactored it or rewritten it. Sometimes you have to write code that doesn't work to point you to the code that does. You get better at your initial stabs as you gain experience. But that is a crucial part of software development - you will often face having to choose from a number of different possible ways to do things, and having more experience helps to whittle down the possibilities. But it takes time to gain the experience, and making mistakes is part of it.And sometimes, the different possibilities don't really favor one over the other. Or which one you choose is dependent on the context more than the specifics of the code itself. There are no simplistic answers.In terms of recursion, I rarely use it. There are problems that are naturally recursive, and then there are those you could try to force recursion onto. But it rarely makes sense in the latter case, especially if you run the risk of blowing up your stack when the problem gets too large.With recursion, each time you recurse, you get a new context. Every time you make a call into the function, that function has a new ""environment"" that can differ from the caller's one. Recursion really works well when each of those contexts is different, and you need to return to a previous context at some point - and if you weren't using recursion, you'd have to track the state yourself, often as a queue or manual stack.Traversing a tree, for example, is a good case for recursion, since as you're processing the children, you need to remember where you were, so that you can go back up when you reach a leaf. A recursive solution handles that for you automatically, as exiting the function takes you back to the previous context. The recursive process automatically tracks the different transitions down and back up the tree.In the case you have above, though, where you're just building a list, you don't gain much from recursion over iteration, as you don't really have anything to ""remember"" at each step. The context changes, but you're not really *coming back* to anything after that can't be handled by simple variables (no stack necessary).I'd say: hang in there and keep working through problems. It will get easier, as you'll develop instincts for when to apply different techniques. And the best way to know which techniques to use is by having tried the wrong ones - making mistake. It's part of the process, so don't be afraid of goofing things up. Right now, writing software is your own sandbox. Experiment. Play. See what works and what doesn't. Fortunately, there's no harm in smashing a sand castle design that didn't work out and trying a different one.",jaynabonne,2025-07-25 09:56:19,2,learnprogramming,t3_1m87lnx,False,

I know plenty of people in the field who did CS and SWE, and similar. It's barely a specialisation really. You will most probably discover that Software Engineering and Cloud Computing undergrad degrees share some kind of ""common first year"" with straight Computer Science degrees and about 10 other ""degree pathways"" at your university, to ensure everyone has the basic knowledge required to move on. After that period, at the beginning of each year, you'll get asked to choose some modules in addition to the core modules totalling the credits for the year. This is the ""specialisation"" aspect. Different degree pathways are just different module choices each subsequent year, which is why many universities allow you to switch between degrees before you get to modules that are only available on certain pathways (essentially change your degree title and pick other modules).Whether or not you will be ahead or behind your peers depends not solely on your degree pathway, but also on how well the *contents* (what you study) aligns with what you would like to do for work. You don't mention this (even though it should be the biggest factor in your decision) but assuming you want to be a Software Engineer, neither CS nor SWE will give you a large advantage over the other, and the module choices available are likely to be very similar. I've never personally met a Software Engineer with a Cloud Computing degree, but this doesn't mean much, as much of the content is likely to be very relevant.You won't save any time, they're the same length. Feel free to skip any work experience years if you're confident in your ability to land a job. Use your best judgement.Note also that employers rarely care deeply about the exact degree title. ""Computer Science or similar relevant degree"" is common to see on job ads. They do often (not always) care that you get a 2:1/2:2 or above. Nobody regards 3rd well.

You don't know what the future holds so make the most of it. I'm glad I did and richer for it. If you look at how your university calculates your final classification there's often an alternative formula that counts your first year marks (they award you the best mark using all formulas typically), so don't believe any nonsense like ""first year doesn't count"" etc. It might, depending on specifics.Edit to add: **A-levels are not 'instead of' a degree.** **No employer is going to pay much attention to your A-levels alone, and having an undergrad degree is preferred but not a hard requirement, to directly answer the title question.** You just need to take the A-levels that meet the requirements for university courses you're looking at.

If you store those books in a list, though, you have to check every single book to see if you have `Harry Potter` in your collection. Instead, you can put those books in a `set`. Books in a set are stored in piles. Each pile contains all the books starting with the same first two letters. So, to check if you have `Harry Potter`, you go directly to the `Ha` section. You don't have to go through the entire library.Now, let's say you only want one copy of each book, and you are given another copy of `Harry Potter`. You go to the `Ha` section and check for `Harry Potter`, if it is there, you just toss your new copy.

We call hash(""Hello World"") and it returns the hash for that string (lets just say it is number like 66457). Then, we use that hash to determine the index the string belongs in, in the list. An easy way to do this for this example is to use the modulo operator. So say, our set implementation has 10 ""buckets"" (each bucket is an element in the underlying list), we can do 66457 % 10 = 7 so we place the string ""Hello world"" in index 7 of the underlying list(i.e. we place it in bucket 7).The core idea here is that we never had to iterate through the list of buckets, we derived the index from the value ""Hello world"" itself. We dont have to look at any index other than index 7 for duplicates because (assuming our hash function is deterministic), ""Hello world"" *always* maps to index 7.However, there is a problem. Say there are 10 buckets, but we input 20 elements. Since there are more elements than there are buckets, its inevitable that some buckets will have multiple elements in them. Because of this, it is actually true that we have to do some iteration to find duplicates. If there are multiple elements in bucket 7, then we have to search the bucket to check if ""Hello world"" already exists. I'm not completely sure datastructure python uses to represent buckets though, if its lists then yeah there would be iteration but technically it could be any data structure.",greenspotj,2025-07-26 23:05:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ma5kqi,False,
n5cnih9,"Others have answered the question of *approximately* how Python's sets are implemented using hash tables, as a high-level overview.If you want to see how they are *exactly* implemented, the source code is all there for you to read, but it's in C rather than Python.When you call `set.add()` in Python, the corresponding chain of C functions is [`set_add`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/clinic/setobject.c.h#L435-L445) → [`set_add_impl`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L2144-L2151) → [`set_add_key`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L365-L373) → [`set_add_entry`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L122-L208). And `set_add_entry` is where the actual work happens to find the object's slot in the hash table and insert it. Python's hash tables use [open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), so the function needs to try multiple slots until it finds either an empty one or an existing object that's equal to the one being inserted. Sets are fast because on average, this loop will terminate after a small number of iterations, *if* the hash function gives random-looking output *and* the fraction of occupied slots in the table is not too large. In order to make sure that second condition holds, the code calls [`set_table_resize`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L253-L330) to rebuild the table with a larger number of slots whenever the table gets too full.",teraflop,2025-07-27 00:03:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ma5kqi,False,

A TTF contains curves representing the *outlines* of characters, [like in this example.](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/101761/the-description-and-interpretations-of-truetype-font-points-and-curves) If you click that link and look at the diagram of a lowercase letter `a`, you'll see that it consists of two closed curves: one defining the outer boundary of the letter, and another one for the ""hole"" inside the loop. There's no straightforward correspondence between those outlines and the pen strokes a human might use to draw a letter that looks similar. (For instance, a lowercase `t` consists of a single outline but would be drawn with two strokes. A capital `H` has one outline and is drawn with three strokes. An `O` has two outlines, and is drawn with only one stroke.)For the kanji diagrams you're talking about, somebody had to manually draw each character's strokes in a vector graphics program. This data was released for free by the [KanjiVG project](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/kanjivg.html) and now lots of other websites and apps use it.A bit of googling turned up [this project](https://github.com/brownvc/decoupled-style-descriptors) for the Latin alphabet. It includes a dataset with letter strokes from a bunch of actual people's handwriting, plus a data-driven algorithm to generate new variants by interpolating between them. You might find it useful as a starting point.Once you have the strokes, animating them is fairly straightforward e.g. by varying the SVG `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties over time.P.S. In principle, you could imagine using various computational geometry algorithms to extract the [""skeleton""](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html) of a letter in a TTF font, and then try to reconstruct a set of strokes from that.

There are likely other libraries out there that have an implementation of a similar API.If you're interested in how this works, typically the input Bezier spline is chopped up into a bunch of tiny linear segments, which have very simple closed-form length and interpolation computations.

Including here. **This sub has learned nothing from history.**When oil prices are high relative to extraction costs for extended periods of time, petroleum engineering ranks SWELL. When prices sit at commodity levels above extraction costs, petroleum engineering ranks dwindle fast within 2 years. The median petroleum engineering graduate becomes UNEMPLOYED.In the boom times in the 21st century, petroleum engineering grads were walking out of school to 20 offers in the 195k-225k range with a large bonus potential. They'd go bust their ass many many hours a week out in some rustic environment somewhere. There was all kinds of ""what should I specialize in"" conversations like should I do wireline, or logging, or MWD, or be reservoir side, or whatever.And then POOF. Prices fall... extraction costs rise, and that project you were paying the PE 225k to babysit no longer makes money and STOPS. STOPS.Petroleum engineering had 2600 +/- BS grads (and don't forget several hundred MS students too) in 2017. Less than 600 now, and what looks to be about 600 in 2024. 7 years to fall.

In cases where I can't, you probably didn't need the tool anyway because you would've got it eventually. It's also very telling because you don't see it in any other job role. I interviewed a set of executive assistant candidates for a GM, and even in role-skill exercises, the cadence of answer, the breaking down of a problem, all is very similar. If it's a SWE and they're cheating, they're getting it right immediately, are unable to describe a solution (and then immediately turn into a CS professor), or they can explain something perfect, but cannot tell you any other way to do it - even when another approach is taught hand-in-hand and is basically a pair with a given algorithm.You would be shocked at how common cheating is. I'd say maybe 5-10%, with more new grads cheating than experienced hires.

A really successful small firm could die in a month if they were to lose two contracts back-to-back. For the huge companies, any sign of work slowing will often result in teams being let go. They're usually done silently, but in this case it's likely to be more noteworthy because layoffs and offshoring are popular right now. From a business perspective it's good, because it makes you look efficient. After all, if everyone else is doing it, it's fine, right...It's also worth noting that in contracting firms, a LOT of people might be classed as technical/service staff when their job is essentially a PM or AM role, basically tracking work, making sure the client is happy, etc.Finally, this is my own personal perspective on contracting, but the idea that a contracting firm will have any advancements in AI is utterly laughable. It's not even a skill issue, but one where work will need to be billed to a client, and there's no fucking way that TCS is billing someone for the time taken to mess around with AI issues. Contracting firms often believe that they're at the forefront of technology, but my experience of subcontracting for TCS was arguing with a PM because I had written unit tests and they viewed it as ""unnecessary work we will not pay for"". When I pushed back, their response was ""well, it should work first time"".

Then things would ramp up, and you’d start getting the real work done. Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.You’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.Sounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline.

How do you justify your level then?

n4pwxm2,"Your understanding of ""networking"" is wrong.Networking is not connecting with randoms on LinkedIn. It's not having a song/dance with a stranger. It's not walking into a tech conference, exchanging business cards, and aggressively shaking hands. It's not cold messaging people asking for some awkward ""coffee chat"" even though you both know you're just trying to milk them for a job.That feels fake as hell because *it is* fake as hell. But it's also not networking.Our network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.That's it. So in order to ""network"" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.The ""friends"" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.The reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.The bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time. We're not disposable one-time use napkins that you toss in the bin as soon as you get what you want from us. If you form a *genuine* connection with us, over the course of months, we'll refer each other because we want to, and we're doing so becaues we're friends, not because we're using each other.",SouredRamen,2025-07-23 14:33:18,42,cscareerquestions,t3_1m74q9x,False,

You can apply for Graduate level internships which can help you get that resume experience and will have a smaller competitive pool compared to undergrad internships. You can and should get involved in research because that’s such a low bar to get involved in and will immediately add experience to resume and will be a good bonus if you get published and graduate level internships will like this. There is a lot of good paying science based computer science jobs (especially in defense since you are domestic) that will see that as a big plus. Also I think finance also likes people with a more academic background since they do a lot of advanced mathematical analysis for trading strategies. So if you just want to be building apps then maybe drop it? If you want to do something that requires at least a masters like ML/AI, data science or something more math focused then it could be worth it.

That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.I've had companies ""tighten the belt"" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.Toxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.So whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane.

They're in it now, they have to make it work.

Even if it did, new jobs came from that. There wa s time where companies hired engineers to maintain the pipelines. There were teams of people whose job it was to run other people's code and give them the results. THen pipelines became more automated and now you dont need a 10 person team to do that, you barely need 1 person to be knowledgable in it. Im sure those jobs got replaced, but the engineers who worked on it, got transferred to other teams. Im sure some got laid off, but they adapted and found a new job and place to work at.

The biggest mistake would be positioning yourself as a career changer when you're actually a seasoned developer expanding your skill set. Your deep understanding of how applications work from the client side gives you a massive advantage in backend development because you understand the full picture of how data flows and what the frontend actually needs. Companies should see you as someone who can build APIs that actually make sense for the consuming applications, not just someone learning Java from scratch.The interview struggle you're facing is real and frustrating, but there are ways around the traditional leetcode gauntlet. Target smaller companies and startups where you can often get in front of actual engineering managers who care more about your ability to solve real problems than your ability to reverse a binary tree under pressure. Focus on companies that do practical coding exercises or take-home projects instead of whiteboard sessions. Your strength in systems design and high-level thinking is incredibly valuable, especially for backend roles where understanding architecture matters more than memorizing algorithms. Some companies do hire based on these skills alone, particularly in more senior positions where they expect you to learn the specific technical details on the job.I actually work on [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to showcase your transferable skills and handle technical questions that might be outside your current wheelhouse.",akornato,2025-07-28 09:58:07,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mb4vsr,False,

Because they were small they didn’t have specific recruiters, it was the head of development usually interviewing me. I did have a personal project I had been working on and was excited about it.

The second job I'm at is better in some ways and worse in others. We're very understaffed and are on a hiring freeze with a lot of technical debt that is overdue by years. Like a lot of organizations we want to be proactive by reacting to the latest trends in IT-- if you guessed AI, you'd be correct. We have a Github that's there more or less for some kind of version control, but it's used kind of rarely. Yes, the technical debt is to that degree. However, I'm lucky to have someone that's at least willing to work with me, and help me out and provides me some advice of things I should be doing-- that's when I buy a book on that topic and read it. I try to do a book a month when I have the time. My advice would be to do that, talk with someone you trust or who is willing to help a little and research on your own. People will take notice and be happy you cared. If there's other IT departments you work with, I'd also ask some questions what they do, their responsibilities and at least understand them from a cursory glance so if you know of something is their responsibility you can articulate yourself in a manner where people will at least see you're taking yourself seriously as a professional.",travelwithtbone,2025-07-24 01:29:18,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1m74ctp,False,

It does help to make your resume look a bit nicer and might get you a slightly higher role and pay off the bat, but to me it's not worth 2 years of missing out on experience to do for an extra 5k-10k in pay you would've just likely had if you started to work. The key really is if you can get a job to pay for your masters degree. So in summary, it's not worth the MSCS unless you get someone to pay it for you or if you can escape paying minimal and not having to get loans. I had my job pay it for me and I grinded for 2 years as a part-time student and only had to pay 5k out of pocket those 2 years. But I also did summer courses as well to finish on time. As for your leetcode grind. I am not someone who really thinks you need to ""grind"" leetcode to get a job. You can and might be good at it to land the job, the problem is that many people think they can just grind it and dont care to learn the ins and outs of what they are doing. So they basically are hoping to get a similar question where they can think ""omg that's leetcode question #100 or similar to it, i just need a map"". But they dont care to learn why they need the map, or if there's a slightly different approach they could take. I have been in the job market twice in my career, never had to grind leetcode and I got into two big tech companies (one of them a Mag7 company) by just following a google DSA guide I will link below. It has videos from cracking the coding interview author that explain DSA very well. Also links free leetcode study guides with example questions to practice on. Companies dont care if you get the questions right, they only care if you know what you are doing and explain your thought process well in the questions. I got both those jobs and didnt do 100% well on the questions. A few times I got stuck but because I explained my thought process well they liked my approach. They know you wont get it 100% off the bat, they just want to know where your heads at. So for me i like to say ""hey i think I can possibly use a map here because of XYZ possibly a set"" and then I try it. I also go step by step. So usually the first thing I tackle is the return cases. I.e. if I am doing a array traversal the first thing I write is the return case if array is empty. It sounds dumb, but they appreciate when you tackle the small things first that could easily be forgotten. Also it's one of those things of once you start coding your nerves go down even if it's a simple lin. Then at the end I write test cases and try to go through multiple different cases (empty array, edge cases, etc). If any of them come out wrong, then I quickly refactor.Google DSA link is: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-07-28 18:19:39,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mbmvot,False,

With today's market, you got to be pretty competitive (4-5 years ago, you had a better chance of ""getting lucky""). Working full-time is a pain, and even putting just 10 hours a week into transitioning into SWE can be hard. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it took you over a year to line up your first job.I will say though, as a self taught dev with no degree, you got some strengths here: You have a CS degree and you've been working a job that will generally look respectable on a resume. I do think you have a pretty healthy shot at transitioning into SWE, but the market is bad and it's pretty rough out there.I'll assume you have some rough experience with programming (how to reasonably use classes, functions, if statements, for loops), or at the very least, all that will come back to you pretty quickly.If you want to get into fullstack, I would start off by focusing on Java / Springboot for backend, JavaScript / React for frontend, and use Git. I would ***probably*** recommend taking a Udemy course (I never personally tried Udemy, but I often hear good things) for both React and Springboot. You can just watch a YouTube tutorial for Git. Try to get to a point where you can work on a project pretty consistently. Just have one project you're pretty committed to.After that, there's interview prep. Go through the roadmap on https://neetcode.io (mainly focus on the video explanations, don't waste a ton of time trying to solve questions yourself at this stage). After the roadmap, do some random questions LeetCode, and try to get to a spot where you have like an 80% chance of solving an unfamiliar medium-level problem in under 60 minutes (if you haven't solved it after 2 hours, just look up the answer and try to think where you went wrong).More than anything else though ***talk through the problems***. You wanna be good at ""solving"" problems because sometimes you get ""assessments"" (basically you have to solve a LeetCode problem before getting to interview anybody), but for ""interviews"" you need to be good at talking technical. You should look up ""mock coding interviews"" on YouTube interviews to see what mean here.You should start applying before you're 100% confident with anything though (you're never going to be 100% ready to start applying). In fact, I would honestly recommend you just start sending out like 3 applications a week ***right now***. Just half ass it, get it out of the way, and get used to it. Don't waste too much time ""waiting to feel ready"" (I wasted a lot of time on this back in 2021).For your resume, skim through the wiki on r/EngineeringResumes. You'll have to adjust a bit though because of your background, but do what you can to leverage your current work experience (be detailed), and mainly try to sell yourself as ""an important team member that holds some key responsibilities and/or accomplishments"". I know that can be really awkward, but again, I think you got quite a respectable role.And finally, as far as applying goes, apply to any role that looks reasonably relevant, doesn't look too ""specialized"", and asks for less than 5 years of experience.

So imo masters won’t be a good bet. Would highly recommend reading technical books to work on your fundamentals and get them strong and in parallel work on your soft skills (this is a game changer that most engineers don’t focus on and allows one to stand out). Doing this catapulted my career to senior from new grad in under 2 years over other engineers with 3-4x the amount of experience.The books you read will depend on what you want to focus on. For eg, my area of work was distributed systems so the main books I read were around that but the general ones I recommend are the following 2: DDIA, philosophy of software design. Then also diving into design patterns, pragmatic programmer, etcBased on what you are curious to learn and specialize in (FE, BE, DE, DS etc) you pick up relevant books there and start diving in. Also you don't have to read books cover to cover (though the previous 2 I mentioned, do read cover to cover) unless they excite you or you think you are learning from them. I usually use books as a frame of reference so when I get stuck I know where to look (tbh AI like ChatGPT has made that much easier now).For soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well.

n56an96,">It's become clear that getting a solid industry job, is a lot harder these days without a CS degree. The bootcamp/self-taught path (even if it's associate degree) rarely works anymore unless you're exceptional.It's almost impossible without a CS or Computer Engineering degree. Every entry level job gets over 100 applications so HR filters by degree for a sanity check. I like your plan.>as eventually staff/principal SWEI don't think that's what most people really want. At Team Lead, I was working 50 hours per week with 15-20 hours of meetings. I had responsibility to my team and the whole business unit such as tracking work intake and discussing if defects could impact other departments. For 10% more pay. Then it's a pyramid, rank in Top 10% of employees at your grade for a chance of making Principal. You made it that far? Now get 5 DMs per day of people asking you for help who will blame you if you don't. Be married to the job.>That said, I enjoy the field (I genuinely like math, I like coding (just not obsessed)) Me too. Coding isn't my hobby. I like it but it's just a job.

n5my4rs,"For embedded Id recommend defense/aerospace industry. I worked there for 4 years and I know each company and project is different but in general pros and cons are:Pros:\- Chill and relaxed. Deadlines aren't a big thing in this industry and most of the time past 5 pm you dont hasve to think about work. THe office is ghost town after like 6pm. \- Easy to coast - i knew people who worked 4 hour days and coasted the rest of the day. Some older people would leave after 4-6 hours and charge 8. \- Work life balance is amazing. \- Good benefits.\- 9/80 - you set your own time but you can't work more than 80s hours in a pay period. So what a lot of people like to do is work 9/80s. Basically it's working 8 days of 9 hours (monday-thursday of both weeks), then work an 8 hour day on one friday to get the 2nd friday off. Some companies allow you to put extra hours in a OT bank hours. Since you can't charge OT, you put it in that bank and can use it to leave a bit early on a different week. What most people di dwas use it to save on vacation hours. So theyd work enough to have a week worth of OT hours and then use those hours instead of their PTO when they were on vacation.\- Job security - I cant speak now (especially with some of tracking of government jobs) but befroe that, the defense industry was a great place to have job security. Because you needed securty clearance and that's expensive to get. So even in years where the companies didnt do too good, theyd avoid trying to layoff engineers becauset ehy knew once things got back on track theyd need as much as they could get. \- The projects are really cool and working with real hardware makes it worthwhile.Cons:\- Lack of learning. It's very easy to coast and because of it, unless you really try you wont really learn much and going to a bigger company you may feel behind on how to work in big code systems with huge deadlines. \- You can get stuck in maintenance hell. If the company is running out of projects, they may keep you in maintenance in one of their legacy projects. Lack of developing there. \- Pay isnt that great compared to other CS industries. It's still better than most careers but dont expect big tech pay and you may need to jump around your first 10 years to get a good check. I made 75k off of college and with a promotion and few raises was at 90k after 4 years.
