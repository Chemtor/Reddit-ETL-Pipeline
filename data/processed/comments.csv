The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. The decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. More recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse.

Despite their desire and rhetoric it is not a tech company. The people in charge of technology have no idea what they are doing and because it is a bank they get to mandate their will without requiring buy in from engineering. I remember reading a blog post from Uber about their CICD initiative and how they couldn't just force their colleagues to use it. At Capital One you can roll out the biggest piece of shit and then mandate it's adoption across the company to the detriment of everyone.Second, their absolutely insane performance management system completely cripples the company. I don't think I can return until they fix it and they never will until Rich retires.Having to continuously fire the bottom fifteen percent performers is insane. I'm all for firing non performers but it requires the ability to identify who is performing. I've been in performance management meetings where I was the only other person who could open GitHub. If you're going to do extreme performance management then you need to have the ability to actually know who is getting work done. Instead, it's completely based on narrative. People who cannot code, do not know you or your product, will decide your merit. It is insane and stupid and many good engineers flee the company for the reasons mentioned above.That said, there are very good people who for either spite or stubbornness (like myself) stick it out and try to make it a better place.

nifbquk,"I don't think it's either a good or bad practice to unnest the tables. It's just a preference. I personally don't like having them unnested automatically, because sometimes the tables have too many arrays / dicts, and unnesting all of them creates a lot of tables. I like to control the fields, so if there is a need for unnesting, I like to do it myself. If a column will never be used, it doesn't make sense to unnest it at all.Another reason I dislike it is that, in modern DWHs, you can store JSON, as well as arrays/structs. So if you can store an array in a table, why should you unnest it?

If you do not care to, for example, be notified of schema changes like type changes or field additions, or you have a limited nr of fields and you want to type manually, then maybe you do not care. If you do care, the discussion ends here - let dlt discover schema and accept the limitation that comes along. That being said, there is also also a benefit to using json in db - the data is pre-joined so retrieval of nested data is faster than re-joining tables. For this reason we are working to add typed complex data support to give you nested with schema discovery option where supported by the destination.If you do not care to manage schema then let's talk about the raw data - there is a benefit to storing json for debugging. My personal preference is to use a mounted drive and persist the extract and normalize packages (raw and normalised pre-loading) data in a bucket with <30d deletion (serves debugging and implies with gdpr without extra management), or to load via a staging bucket. IMO json does not belong in SQL because once it's there you havw to take it out to be able to use proper tooling to handle it. regarding raw data - dlt doesn't change the data, so if you want to just debug the data, you can debug it in db. dlt does change metadata such as column names, adds types, or removes null-only columns (they have no data, cannot be typed)",Thinker_Assignment,2025-10-09 15:35:27,2,dataengineering,t3_1o1b94r,False,

In Temporal, run per-document workflows with chunking/embedding as children; batch Qdrant upserts and use idempotency keys like hash(docid|chunkidx|embedversion).

The first occurs during ingestion and ensures that the data actually meets the schema requirements in terms of file names, column names and types, and column constraints (like NOT NULL). If this doesn't pass, the data doesn't leave the raw layer. The second is more of a comprehensive data quality check (summary statistics and drift), which is usually performed further downstream and is business-logic dependent. Something like Great expectations or dbt expectations are open-source packages that can be used to handle this.

It sucks because you could be a perfectly competent data engineer who builds solid pipelines without knowing every detail of the DAG scheduler or executor memory management, but some companies use these deep theory questions as a filtering mechanism. The frustrating part is there's no universal standard - one company wants you to explain catalyst optimizer stages, another just wants to see you write a working transformation. Your best bet is to have a baseline understanding of the theory (what happens when you call an action vs transformation, basic execution model, why shuffles are expensive) but don't kill yourself memorizing every architectural detail unless you're targeting companies known for this style of interviewing.The shift in how you prepare should really depend on the signals you're getting from your interviews. If you're consistently hitting walls on theory questions, then yeah, dedicate more time to understanding the ""why"" and ""how"" beneath the surface. But if you're getting through technical rounds and failing elsewhere, your time might be better spent on system design, communication skills, or just doing more practice problems.

When we look back on things like early Unix, or DOOM, or HyperCard, it's easy to notice all the advancements that were made compared to the state of the art at the time. But there were also lots of limitations and missing features, because either the hardware wasn't powerful enough, or people just hadn't thought of them yet.And it's not like every developer back in the 80s and 90s was some hot-shot genius.

nizgmvq,"A system call is basically just a fancy kind of function call. The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.The kernel can ""receive"" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.In terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the ""list of running processes"" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.Similarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to ""print"" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.On the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly.

The gap isn't about raw coding skill - its about how ""professional"" code is shaped - it doesnt simply \*work\*, but is architected to survive years of changes, changing requirements, multiple contributors and weird edge cases. What seperates a Jr. SWE from Sr. SWE is more about instinct, rather than pure DSA knowledge. 1. Read the classics. Reading literature is a great way to learn theory of things and new patterns. Stuff like *Design Patterns*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, *Anti-Patterns*, *A Philosophy of Software Design*, *Clean Code -* not saying you gotta drop everything and read them \*right now\*, but imo those are some of the books that kinda live on the must-read list for devs at some point.2. Rewrite your own old code. Grab a project you wrote quite a time ago and try to read it like you weren't the one who made it. Start asking yourself questions. Bonus: refactoring is way easier and faster now, because your ""thinking level"" has leveled up since then. You would be seeing it more as a system and not just a bunch of code glued together.3. Try contributing to large OSS projects. Tips: \- Dont just read the code - look at the directory structure, the test layout, how errors propagate. \- Look into how they are documenting it, how they introduce breaking changes, logging and observability. \- Notice how they isolate I/O, how they handle state across the application, how they make things testable. The feedback you are going to receive in your PRs is going to be invaluable (even if sometimes served cold). Soft skills become more and more important the further you go in your career. You may write the cleanest code in the world, but if you can't explain your thinking, review someone else's PR and give them feedback or advocate for better design - it is going to hold you back. Communication is \*key\*.**TL;DR:** Real-world code is about making it last. The instinct you will develop from experience, mistakes and seeing how big systems fail and evolve is going to shape how you design, develop and debug .

Godot is easier to start with (simpler, no setup), Unity has more jobs/resources. Both are great choices.Either way, I'd take one of many online programming courses in Python or C\# before jumping into an engine, or perhaps dig into the CS50 course for more structured learning. A game engine adds a bunch of concepts on top of programming that are specific to the engine. If you want to jump in with both feet, that's fine, but you may struggle with information overload.

You'll often see names like NASA, MAXAR, Airbus, and the name of the local Government.I'm terms of the roads and such, I don't actually know where that data originally came from.

niiuk8n,"This is an entire field called GIS. The short of it is that you have two basic types of GeoSpatial data, vector and raster. Vector data is basically a table of attributes, but one of the fields has a geometry. Think Latitude and Longitude for points, and then just an array of those for Lines / Polygons. Raster Data is an image that you drape over your canvas, but it has embeded or an extra file with information saying where and how to place the image, like a tiff world ‘.tfw’ file.Any geospatial data will have a spatial reference for the coordinates, like WGS84 for your typical lat longs in decimal degrees or degree, minutes, seconds. Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.Anyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.Now you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map. You could make static maps (pdfs or images) using desktop software like QGIS or ArcGIS, or you could make the data available through a Map Server or WMS/WFS service and then have a web map the requests the data from those servers. The web server is usually something like QGIS Server or ArcGIS server, and then you consume it using a map library like leaflet, open layers, or ArcGIS JavaScript API. Of course, over the internet, this can be slow depending on the size of the data, so then you start getting into tiling your data. So for rasters, you’ve pre-tiled your data (vector and raster can do this) at different zoom levels, so as a user pans around a map, they’re only calling the specific tiles they need to display on the map instead of asking for the server to constantly clip and send the data they need for their extent.

The cartographers' term for these imagery maps is ""orthophotomap"". They aren't satellite maps, but they play them on TV. Web servers spit out those images as ""tiles"". The web map viewers have all sorts of fancy Javascript to retrieve, scale, and rotate those tiles so they look seamless. If you watch your map app you can see it retrieving and displaying tile-by-tile.You can see, especially in more remote areas, the swaths of imagery. Maybe one swath was taken in the spring, and another in the fall. So they look a bit different.The features, I think Google has their own streets-and-borders-and-rivers data.

nj4vr6c,"**TL;DR: Good code is code that delivers the desired functionality and is as easy to maintain as possible.****Why our profession is culty on this question**One thing you need to understand about our profession is that most practices have the following pattern:* Some smart people devise an approach that fit their needs and allowed them to produce some exceptional value.* Some non- or less technical people saw the money and started either selling this approach as ""the right way to do things"" for money or telling their engineers to start doing it because they think it will make more money.* The purpose behind the practice is lost, but people nevertheless dogmatically follow the practice since it's ""the right way to do things"" and some smart people said to do it.You can see this with agile, OOP, functional programming, every framework you've ever used, etc.**What you actually need to do**Writing quality, maintainable code is about minimizing complexity, and there are multiple kinds of complexity.* Computer efficiency - How efficiently your machine can execute your code.* Local complexity - How easy it is to understand a file you're looking at on the screen.* System complexity - How easy it is to understand how all your files interact with one another across your entire application.Generally speaking you need to sacrifice one or two of these in order to achieve the other. Rarely can you get all three at once.Object-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as ""objects"" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.With functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.I have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.If you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is ""A Philosophy of Software Design"" by John Ousterhout.

They're not mutually exclusive.There are products that are open-source, but they charge money for it. The motivations can range here - maybe the source is open to promote trust, maybe it's open so that hobbyists can access it for free while business users can pay for support.There are also products that are closed-source, but free to consumers. I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.So in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.If your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.A really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the ""top"" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.As an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They ""lose"" money on the free users but gain community.On the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you.

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.Most open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.Quick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",EliSka93,2025-10-08 19:28:29,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1jwxj,False,

ni6s1kb,"The first thing to learn, especially for someone with ADHD, isn't actually a programming thing, but rather an organisational problem-solving thing; it's ""divide and conquer"": you need to learn how to split big tasks into small enough sub tasks that they're trivial. You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.Focusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.This is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.The second thing to learn is ""make skeletons"" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.For your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.At any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (""Agile"" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).There are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",GetContented,2025-10-07 03:26:54,4,learnprogramming,t3_1o038m7,False,
ni6p6q9,"I can share some advice from a self-taught dev with 14 years of professional experience, who also looks fondly back at starting out by dabbling in html and css in the 90s on geocities and angelfire.First piece of advice: ""I don't want handouts. I like the struggle (masochist >,>)"" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.Second piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think ""Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break"" I write that down in this list. 2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like ""Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week"".3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.By keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. Also, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project.

I also have terminal ADHD.I firmly believe that almost anyone, including those of us with ADHD, can learn almost anything with the right resources and learning strategies. Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.Random notes in no particular order from what you've said:* You're ""supposed"" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often ""get"" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to ""just keep trying"". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax!

First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation.

We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really.

And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)And as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.For *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.If the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be ""good"" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data.

One of the best ways to keep motivation in my opinion is building something that solves a problem you have, because the drive to solve a problem is what makes programming so insanely addictive and fun. Solving a problem you have is the most rewarding and motivational thing I've ever experienced programming. So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution. For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.Stay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you. And when learning and problem solving becomes addictive that's when you start building the software you dream of building, because you start to realize that nothing is too difficult you just have to put in more work.",W_lFF,2025-10-12 13:58:24,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o4ocgp,False,

Than this other game they didn't develop where they didn't have that loading screen constraint? How can you compare the two? How can anyone not in bad faith be affirmative that the current game is better than this other game they didn't develop without constraints? I know you didn't come up with these examples, that they come from people looking for stuff to analyze and make content out of. But they are just bad generalizations. In any projects, you have constraints, and your goal is do the best thing possible despoite those constraints. And sometimes, being creative with those constraints helps a lot in doing that. but people don't intentionally self-inflict contraints when they want to do a product. It can however be a nice way to spark creativity or to develop one's skill by forcing oneself to do something differnetly than how they were doing it. I'm thinking of game jams (to stay in the realm of video games examples), where the goal is specifically to add two massive constraints (time and a custom directive) in order to force developers to be creative.

nj6g1ar,">Why is OOP such a crazy thing to try to define in your own words, with it making sense?Because it's a very nebulous term that over the course of its history has been used to mean different things by different people. Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.Typically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of ""objects""; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.In a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like ""hungry"", ""happy"" or ""dead"". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.Many people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; ""encapsulation"" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), ""inheritance"" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and ""polymorphism"" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",DTux5249,2025-10-12 22:28:17,8,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,

An object ""pet"" would have birthdate, name, breed, color, father, mother, gender, medical notes, temperament notes, etc. That's just data. An object ""dog"" based on ""pet"" would add on siblings (list), photo (BLOB), and maybe functions bark(), dotrick() and so on. But you can also create object ""cat"" based on ""pet"", add color notes, color pattern, photo (BLOB), siblings (list), preferred toy, etc.What are some things only cat would do?

nj369zq,"Oh brother, lets break this down, and I'm going to explain this in a high level, so I don't have any Java-specific tips to give. Maybe just general ones.So in this 2 weeks, you would have to create:- mechanics (movement, AI/automatons, pass/fail conditions, etc.)- look (UI, aesthetics, animations, etc.)- other utils that can be optional (save/load system, settings system, the extra stuff that can help with accessibility)There can be more things here and there depending on complexity, but as a bare minimum, you would make all of these and combine them all together.You're now probably thinking ""oh boi this is a lot of work"" and I don't know how many you are in the team, so my first suggestion is to make it as simple as possible, and only add features if it's possible within the timeframe. Don't try to make too much features that just ends up delaying the release. We call that ""feature creep"". Write a TODO list and gauge the complexity of certain features or aspects so that your team can prioritize on ones that are critical. Don't try to deliver a car without an engine. That's what happened to my team in my game development course in university and we used Unity3D, which has less boilerplate setup than Java Swing (or at least, we don't code the UI from scratch), and we're given a longer time to make the game. Feature creep fucked us over.Next suggestion is learning git and GitHub. Host your project there, and you all can collaborate wherever you are and you can revert changes if stuff did not work right. Creating branches is useful so that everyone's works can be isolated. And you can do peer reviews. This helps with code quality and engages collaboration with each other.Last suggestion: always test. If possible, reserve a few days for playtesting and bugfixing after playtest. That's why we have alpha and beta tests. Alpha test is your whole team testing the game, and beta test is other people playing your game. This will give you a fresh perspective on people interacting with your game. Like as simple as a certain hitbox not working right. Or a critical bug that can happen when conditions are met that your whole team has not encountered in your internal playtesting.And that's it from me. I'm not a professional game developer by any means, and I'm not specialized in Java Swing or Java in general (although it's my main programming language), but my game development course and my current job gave me a lot of insight and workflows on how to tackle potentially large projects like these. And I've realized that the difficulty is not necessarily on the programming, but planning and managing the project altogether. So I guess the first step now is to setup all the things. GitHub, the initial Java project and needed external libraries. Then plan it all out, so that you can assign tasks to yourselves. Feel free to chat in DM. Just don't show weird sht or send a virus that destroys my PC.Oh right before I forget that this post exists, my other advice is to not make AI do your work. Sometimes, they're just doing random sht. Other times, it collides with something. AI relies on your foundation code to become a good asset (which can still screw up, but it may screw up less). So assuming you are allowed to use AI coding agents (because this question will come up at some point), always verify what it types out. Again, this is where peer reviews come into play. Either do it in school or via GitHub PRs.And NEVER EVER USE GENERATIVE AI FOR ANY CREATIVE ASSETS LIKE ART OR MUSIC. We have free assets to use on the Internet if you have to.

nipypy0,"Programming is an extension of technology, or you can also think of it as a microcosm of technology. The main purpose of technology is to **improve the way we do something**, either with a tool or otherwise. Instead of calculating numbers by hand, we use a calculator to automate the process. Instead of converting a lot of numbers using a calculator, we use a spreadsheet program to do it in bulk. A lot of the constructs of programming serve the same purpose.At its very basic, most programs can be written with if-conditions and variables alone. However, we don't do that, and we use lists, loops, functions and classes instead, **not** because we have to (exceptions apply), but because we want to. Most of them serve the same purpose: **to shorten and simplify code at the cost of more complex and intricate logic**.For example, instead of writing: cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl;You can instead write: for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; }Classes serve a similar purpose: instead of having loose, disconnected variables and functions all over the place, you ""group"" them into objects. This gives you many benefits, making it much simpler to code certain algorithms, keeping your code organized so that you don't confuse yourself and others as your code base expands, and in some languages, it provides a layer of ""code safety"" as well.But to emphasize, you do **not** have to necessarily write code this way, in most cases. A lot of different syntax ""oddities"" exist to be **shortcuts**, such as how `i++` is mostly just `i = i + 1`. The same is true of a while-loop versus a for-loop, the former of which is more fundamental. This is why it seems there are so many solutions to the same problem, but they all do the same thing in varying levels of efficiency, in terms of logic and/or syntax.",Joewoof,2025-10-10 04:33:44,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o21qmk,False,

nike9it,"printf(""%zu, sizeof(1L)); printf(""%ld, 1L << 31);If long's are 32-bit on your platform (e.g. ARM), then this code is technically undefined behaviour (or maybe implementation defined -- I would have to look it up). 1L means it is a signed quantity, which in C, platforms must support at least the values `-2**31+1` .. `+2**31-1` inclusive. In practice, all platforms I've seen would support `-2**31` as well. I.e. the values -2147483648 up to and including 2147483647 should fit in a 32-bit signed integer. But the C Standard (at least all C Standards before C23) only requires platforms to support from -2147483647 to 2147483647 in order to accomodate storing the integer in non 2's complement form. However it seems that C23 requires 2's complement, so maybe that is different in C23. In practice, though, all platforms you're likely to use are using 2's complement. However, 1L << 31 results in 2147483648, a value that does not fit in a 32-bit signed integer, so you are invoking integer overflow (which is formally undefined behaviour, but since you're doing at ""at compile time"" maybe it's really implementation defined). In any case, we surely can't expect that the result will be the same in this case between platforms (32-bit long vs. 64-bit long).If you want the same behaviour, you should suffix ul on your integer constant (some people prefer writing uL or UL for readability). That way, you'll be working with 32-bit unsigned long vs. 64-bit unsigned long. The sizes are different but since you're still within the 32-bit unsigned range in your example, you'll get the same behaviour in this case. Since 1ul << 31 is unsigned long, you should also update the printf format from %ld to %lu to ensure the correct integer interpretation when printing it out.",chaotic_thought,2025-10-09 08:54:19,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1z9m5,False,
niln3xl,"> but declaring a literal's type as long, long long etc. seems to kill the whole point of using uint32_t in the first place.Correct. You see the contradiction. Literals are implicitly cast to the assigned type because this pedantic redundancy is a wholly unnecessary distraction that has no benefit in any sense of the word.So I've played with it, and wrote the variations: int x = 5; int x = 5L; int x = 5LL; int x = 5ULL;And I compiled them under GCC for ARM and x86_64. This is what I got: mov w0, 5 //ARM mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 5 //x86_64The compiler didn't care what my literal was suffixed. The type is determined by the type declaration of the variable being assigned, and the literal is implicitly converted at compile-time.Now as for your code: printf(""%zu %ld"", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);Yeah, the type is deduced from the literal itself, so of course you're going to get a non-portable result.---I think it's important to understand how to use primitive types.C defines a whole family of type aliases. They are guaranteed to alias the built-in types. First are the fixed width types: int8_tEtc. The fixed width types ARE NOT guaranteed to be defined in the first place - they are only defined on platforms that actually have native hardware support for those exact widths. If there is no 16 bit type support on that hardware, there is no `int16_t`. This comes up on DSPs and ASICs the most, though you'll also see it on FPGAs, in some old or really tiny embedded architectures, like old 4-bit machines, or some exotic or esoteric hardware few have ever heard of.The fixed width types are for implementing protocols. These could be file formats, hardware interfaces, or network/transport protocols. You will use these for defining types that are going to be serialized or mapped to hardware. You'll use these in data buffers.Then there are the `least` types: uint_least32_tEtc. These types are the smallest widths available with at least as many bits, and these types are ALWAYS defined. For platforms that support fixed width types, they're 1:1. They may contain more bits, but you cannot portably rely on that, nor should you, because that defeats the point.Use these types in your in-memory data structures to maximize system and cache memory density and bus transfer efficiency.Continued...",mredding,2025-10-09 14:21:26,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1z9m5,False,
nikgas6,"Okay, the example is unfortunate but consider the following: 1LU << 48 would still be integer overflow if long is represented by a 32-bit wide integer. On a different platform (where long would be 64-bits wide) this would not do integer overflow. My question is: which option is best for keeping literal constants typed and yet ensure portability between platforms.",Ssingleaspringle,2025-10-09 09:16:06,1,learnprogramming,t1_nike9it,True,
niln53s,"Finally, there are the `fast` types: int_fast16_tEtc. You should use these as function parameters, iterators, and locals. These are the most computationally efficient use of hardware registers on your platform with at least as many bits. Very often these will be larger than the bit size specified. Registers tend to be laid out in powers of two word sizes - word, double word, quad word... And so will these. Ideally, what you'll get is these values will be optimized and either never see cache or system memory - your code should be small enough that they exist only in registers - for sufficiently large hardware platforms.C has a weak type system, because C is a negotiation between the standard, the hardware, and you. This flexibility inherent to the primitive types is also a form of portability in its own right. This is how you can port Unix from one architecture to another, because you write code in terms of `int`, and you get whatever size and extent that hardware can handle, whatever hardware you go to. You get internal consistency. It's when you start working with external data that you need to accommodate data protocols and their data.Most of the time you don't need fixed width types - and it's actually not desirable for computation. They're either too big for memory, or too small for registers. Besides - if you're not defining a protocol, who cares how many bits you have exactly? All you care about is that you have enough - which is something you need to figure out at design time. What are you doing? How many bits do you need? Once you know, you want the fewest to store in memory, and then you don't care how many are used for actual computation, so long as it's fast and efficient.So the `least` and `fast` end up being the types you use the most. They're completely inappropriate and not portable for protocols, and you want to get away from the fixed width types as soon as possible - at the fringes, where IO happens.So this code: printf(""%zu %ld"", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);It's completely asinine. You're not outputting the size and extent of a type, but of a value, and the type of the value is up to the compiler's discretion - the implementation just PICKED SOMETHING, because it doesn't matter; in all other code, this would be narrowed or widened implicitly and correctly. This is fine for writing debug, but as you're writing to the `stdout` file descriptor and presuming you were trying to do something REAL, you'd be wanting to write in terms of a protocol, which means the correct thing to do is write this in terms of a fixed width type to make it portable.---The other thing is about the C type system - an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. You are not expected to use the primitive types directly - you're expected to make your own types in terms of primitives, and then describe your solution in terms of that. If you didn't care what the type was - then you'd write your implementation as a macro, and practice the Generic Programming paradigm.Your `int` is always something more specific, a quantity, a range, a unit of something. Make your types and control your semantics. An `int` can perform all arithmetic and bitwise operations, but a `weight` can only add to other `weight`s, and can only multiply against scalars. A `weight` can't be negative. So: typedef struct weight weight; weight *create(int_least32_t); weight *dup(const weight *); weight *copy(weight *, const weight *); void destroy(weight *); weight *add(weight *, const weight *); weight *multiply(weight *, int); int_least32_t weight_to_int(const weight *); int print(const weight *);Notice it's an opaque pointer. `print` returns an `int` because `printf` returns an `int`. `multiply` accepts an `int` because its an arbitrary value - unless in your design you know something better. An `int` is going to be the native word size, so efficient. Then you implement: struct weight { int_least32_t value; }; weight *create(const int_least32_t value) { weight *w = NULL; if(value >= 0) { weight *w = (weight *)malloc(sizeof(weight)); w.value = value; } return w; } //... weight *add(weight *res, const weight *w) { if(res && w) { res.value += w.value; return res; } return NULL; } weight *multiply(weight *res, const int v) { if(res && v >= 0) { res.value *= v; return res; } return NULL; }",mredding,2025-10-09 14:21:35,2,learnprogramming,t1_niln3xl,False,
nikm2yx,"> consider the following: 1LU << 48 would still be integer overflow if long is represented by a 32-bit wide integerYes, you're right. This may be why the Standard says you are only allowed to left-shift up to 31 bits for a 32-bit unsigned type. If the type of unsigned long is a 32-bit type on a particular platform (e.g. ARM), then indeed shifting it left by 48 is undefined behaviour.More on this can be found discussed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper)Also, I'm not really sure you can avoid implicit integer promotion in a single expression like 1ul << 48. Even if you write UINT32_C(1) as suggested in the other reply on the thread, the type produced by that expression is actually uint_least32_t (i.e. it could be 32-bit or it could be bigger).So in my view, an expression like 1ul << 48 is just not portable. I would hope that my compiler would give me a warning if I were compiling that code on a platform where unsigned long is 32-bit, but it's conceivable that on other platforms (where unsigned long is 64-bit), that it would compile with no warning but still be non-portable, as you seem to have discovered.If you're really in a bind and need to do something like the above in a portable way, you could consider computing it at runtime. Though in this case it seems a bit like a waste of time, since it seems like we want the final value 0 in this case: uint64_t tmp = 1ul; tmp <<= 48; uint32_t value = (uint32_t)tmp; printf(""%zu\n"", sizeof(value)); printf(""%lu\n"", value);This should give the same result regardless of what size long's are on the platform. And the result should be 0 on all platforms that support uint32_t (for all possible starting values of value), since vacated bits get filled in with 0 -- unless I'm misunderstanding something that could happen differently on some platform (seems unlikely though).",chaotic_thought,2025-10-09 10:14:19,2,learnprogramming,t1_nikgas6,False,

It has some of the poorest random characteristics - it won't cycle through the entire range of an `int`, and it will repeat itself very quickly. It's also not portable - ever C standard library implements it differently, so for the same seed, two different implementations will generate different sequences.C++ has the `` header in the standard library.

There aren't many RNGs defined within it, you don't know the size of the initialization space for any of them - so you don't know how many bits of entropy is enough for sufficient randomness, and once again, every implementation is different, so the outcomes are not portable.The thing to do is use an independent portable library for reproducibility and consistency. Boost.Random is an excellent library, and the origins of what the standard committee fucked up.

In my case, computer sciences was my passion and my hobby and I eventually went for a degree in it and started working as a software developer. If your passion is art, then yeah, artists are not making much, as I have heard. Do not pick software development just because of its salary. When I did my university studies I saw people picking computer sciences for all the wrong reasons: salary, a friend recommended, a mother wanted, a wish to escape an army service (it is compulsory here), etc. And they dropped out. I saw students burning out, being depressed, etc. because they realized they picked a wrong field. Do you need the same?Pick software development when you have an interest towards it. When you are good problem solver. When you have a mathematical mind. Because software development is all about analyzing different real life problems, coming up with ideas for solutions to these problems, and then implementing and delivering these solutions. If you are not a creative person, if you are unable to figure out solutions to random problems, if you are not interested in sitting behind a computer for 8 hours a day, then this field is not for you.The next step, pick a field that is in demand in place where you plan to start working. And for time being, that place will be Sudan. You are less likely to find a remote job as a beginner or even as a Junior software developer. Which means, you should set your current goal to find a job in your local market. Check job offers in cities around you. From there you can find the technologies and job positions that are in demand. For example you can be interested in blockchains, and it is a valid interest, but when there are exactly ZERO jobs for it, then should you pick it as your main specialty? You can pick it as a side hobby then, but not as something you will be doing for a job.And about machine learning, AI, web development (frontend, backend, full stack), applied cryptography, cyber security, etc. What about trying out these things? The same way how you'd try these out while doing your Bachelor studies in Computer Sciences and having these introduced to you during your courses. When I did my degree studies I learnt some embedded programming, web application development, telecom technologies, system administration, cyber security, different maths, etc. Did I specialize in all of these? No. I specialized in web application development (mainly backend) and in cyber security (did Master studies in it). If you are considering becoming a web application developer then better go for full stack. Which stack? Depends on your local job market. In some places they want PHP developers. Where I live they want Java developers. Pick the technology based on job offers. And the same goes for choosing the front end framework. May it be React, Angular, Vue or something else. Also, then you have to learn some web application security and also some DevOps (enough to deal with Docker, setting up Kafka or some message queuing tool, working with logs, setting up CI/CD pipeline, and perhaps even trying out Kubernetes). Because writing code is not enough. What if your stuff gets hacked? What if the application stops working when 100 people start using it?

nisbel5,"BP is a general purpose register, you shouldn't expect it to change ""automatically"" any more than, say, BX. You don't *have* to use BP for keeping track of the current function's stack frame; that's just what C compilers typically do.The only stack instruction that changes the contents of the BP register is POP BP.C typically sets up stack frames based on BP like this. The assembly code for a C function called `myfunc` probably looks like this, regardless of what `myfunc` actually does: myfunc: PUSH BP MOV BP,SP ; ... function goes here ... POP BP RETBut again, that's just what C compilers [1] do. Your own assembly programs don't have to do things this way; you could use BP to hold a number used in a calculation instead.That being said, there are several reasons to set up a stack frame the same way a C compiler would:- It's a standard practice that makes your code easier to understand- BP can index the stack without a segment prefix override [2]- You must index the stack to access arguments from high-level languages- You can use stack as a convenient way to quickly allocate memory in your function (this is how high-level languages allocate memory for local variables if you have too many to fit in registers)I agree with another poster's recommendation to figure out a way to get assembly listings produced by a compiler. For all the popular modern C compilers, [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) is an easy way to do this, but it only seems to support 32-bit or 64-bit x86 targets. (The most visible difference between 16-bit assembly is 32-bit register names start with E, for example ECX; and 64-bit register names start with R, for example RCX.)[1] Different programming languages use different calling conventions, especially in the previous millenium. Meaning the arguments might be laid out in a different order, or there might be some extra information. For example if you're interfacing with, say, the QBASIC programming language instead of C, you will need a FAR return (to a different segment) that pops the caller's arguments off the stack, [like this](http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/tutorials/tuts/doorknob/asm_appendix1.html), and the arguments are also passed in reverse order compared to C.[2] Segments are important for 16-bit assembly, which I assume you're working with as you say ""BP"" (16-bit) not ""EBP"" (32-bit) or ""RBP"" (64-bit). But segments aren't relevant to 32-bit or 64-bit programs; the popular modern OS's all use flat memory models, and manage memory with paging rather than segments.",white_nerdy,2025-10-10 15:18:19,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o2e342,False,

The progression is natural, but you can carve your career a bit based on your own goals.

Part of this may in fact be figuring out ways to trim down meetings but still maintain same output and quality. This may mean you decline meetings that aren't useful.Alternatively you can also drive impact by being very technical and the expert on one technology.

It does a lot of our trivial crap, for sure, just as DreamWeaver allowed us to sigh and get more work from fixing sites created in WYSIWGs editors (which honestly, has become my ""new normal"" of fixing AI slop bullshit from people who aren't FEEs; it grinds my gears, but whatever - I get a paycheck, and my team trusts that I know what I'm doing).But it's not going to be able to handle complex code bases. It's not going to adapt to new design patterns or libraries. It's a tool.I see it the way things evolved over the last 15 years; it means we can focus on other things. We started out just slicing crap from photoshop or whatever, now we can build entire web ecosystems. Our field has always been about being flexible, willing to learn, and embracing new tools.On the other hand, I also see FEE as the 2nd most underestimated portion of engineering; QA/testing is the other one companies will underestimate and underfund.

The meme that FE development is vastly easier than BE is propagated by people who are skilled at neither. Those who claim AI can replace them probably can be. I personally am sick of PRs where people slammed prompts into Cursor until shit stuck on the wall convincingly enough.

First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.Second, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to ""know the moves"" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.The above is for ICs who are still hands on.

The way to crush this interview is to fully understand the ins and outs of a sufficiently complex codebase, or at least, section of codebase, AND the languages, frameworks and tools they'd use. Practicing for my interview would be exactly like practicing for the job. And our conversation is basically the same as I would have with a coworker who wrote XYZ in our codebase, except, ya know, I'd be less interested and ask fewer questions, but it's really really close. I've personally watched people who aced our technical problem _because they had seen it before_ get hired and be mediocre.

Big fat waste of time for everyone involved because you can't code something you're unprepared for within less than an hour window, even though you could do it within 3 hours and a bunch of Googling. If you're going to build a Wordle game, tell them before. If they're going to fetch data, manipulate data, filter data, and display a list, tell them beforehand. These are two very different things and you could be super sharp at one and not the other.\- Live technical test with AI. The key here is to check whether or not they are blindly accepting prompts from AI. Take the time to ask questions around what the code they just accepted is doing and why they think that is a good solution.\- Timed test (take home/alone). Give them a quite complicated technical test and 3-4 hours to complete it with a submission deadline. They will have to use AI to solve it in that time. Then you follow up in another meeting to discuss the solution and why they did what they did.\- Take home test. Make it complicated as above. They will use AI but how do they handle state management?

I think anything is marketable with the right verbiage, personally. You could be a mainframe developer and as long as you demonstrate the ability to learn, manage complex systems, and build out feature services I think most places would be happy with it. Also, ETL is probably still very much relevant in the modern age. It's not like data pipelines are suddenly agnostic and all-encompassing.

I've been applying to those roles and it's been a lot better since they don't ask ridiculous questions and demand regurgitation of syntax immediately.

It'd be odd if my tech lead sat me down and explained what he wants me to do after I quit the company we're at.But technical-wise, I had a great tech lead at my new grad company. His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.Maybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.That's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.That creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often. If you're giving significant mentorship, then a good manager/PM will make sure you have a reduced sprint load, or even give you dedicated consulting tickets with points on them.I'm really thankful for my new grad tech lead, because I was able to take those very healthy practices, and carry them with me throughout my career.

The company I worked for the longest time had three employees and does not exist anymore (this was *fun* to explain to Japanese immigration for my work visa), and the largest company I ever worked for had 8000 employees worldwide. I have never had a problem getting interviews.2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.3. AI will have a massive shift soon. Pretty much everyone noticed by now that there have been several trillion dollars invested into AI by now, so there will now have to be a few trillion dollars in revenue, soon, or investors will pull the plug. It won't be entirely dead, but completely different.4. Employment laws and expectations in Japan and Europe are different. My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.So basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the ""leave now"" option is likely better.

nipn7r9,"If you’re working as a repair tech, you definitely don’t have zero experience. That’s hands-on hardware and troubleshooting work. The question is how to leverage that experience to get interviews. If you can't get interviews your probably falling short at the application stage (missing some keywords in your resume, or languages/tools that are needed for the job). If you ever get a denial reach out to the hiring manager and see what was missing from your experience and work on getting that experience even if it's solo work. Worse case the hiring person doesn't respond, best case they give you some pointers. (This is assuming it isn't a fake posting) If you are you're getting interviews but not moving forward, then the HR or panel stage is the crux to get over. The HR round is your chance to show passion and explain how your background can benefit the **company**. The panel round is where you prove your technical knowledge and problem solving skills. Use your HR round to figure out what projects are currently being worked on by the company and figure out if they're interesting to you. You will burn out if you find the work boring, and then you're back to square 1. You mentioned companies hiring people with more experience, sure that will happen, but I have worked with people who have 10+ years of experience and they still got laid off with me. They are struggling to get past the HR round because they got too comfortable, they lost their passion, ability to adapt, and put less effort into what a company needs and is hiring for. Effort and curiosity counts more than people think. the only thing better is experience. Focusing on projects is the best idea to open you up to getting experience. Even better than that is trying to contribute to open source of projects you're truly interested in. You'll be working with other developers, getting real world coding experience, and getting feedback on your code. This is a HUGE advantage when getting through the panel round with other engineers reviewing your work live. Keep building and publishing your work, and make sure recruiters can actually *see* what you’ve been working on. That visibility can make a huge difference.Again this field is beyond tough right now, but keep applying, there are so many of us with experience looking for a job, but we are still working with other engineers to continue growing out knowledge an experience.

I think in most cases management does not even know what ""quality code"" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job. Now SWE ""talent"" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.I've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career. These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.Most of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base. They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary. SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project. They did the best they could with the skills they had. Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.The SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies. They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it. These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.They try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that: (off the top of my head)* don't know the value of their talent* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a jobSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed. I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. I'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor.

nimmtiv,"Not kidding but based on the way you describe your situation -- I would sincerely suggest using either ChatGPT study mode, or Claude learning mode, to ask questions and have it explain what's going on. You can also ask it to do web searches or research for you, if you tell it to find learning resources or videos for you (based on topics or styles that you tell it that you prefer).For example, if you have an enterprise approved AI LLM you can use, then when one of your AI/ML peers publishes a document or a slide deck, you can just upload the doc and give it a prompt like this ""I am a software engineer, trying to learn more about AI/ML. One of my coworkers shared this doc recently, can you help break it down and explain what it means? Assume I know basic software and technology concepts, but that I have no advanced statistics or data science training."" Of course, if you don't have a safe enterprise AI to use, then you can't be uploading sensitive documents to your personal subscription. But you can still take certain key phrases or concepts that are generic, and ask Claude or ChatGPT to explain then (e.g. what is XGBoost? how do you run an A/B test? what does stat sig mean? how does deep learning work? etc.).Using an AI LLM is no substitute for real education or reading and studying textbooks, and it won't make you transform into a full ML engineer overnight or something... but it can actually be a very useful starting point for someone who is a beginner. Eventually you can use it to help you generate sample projects, build your own ML model as a tutorial, etc. Also, once you feel like you've got a basic grasp, then you should graduate from asking your initially dumb questions to your AI LLM only, to asking (slightly?) less dumb questions to your actual coworkers. Don't pester them and don't make them responsible for teaching you, but generally speaking if you show serious interest in learning and put in work yourself, most people are happy to talk about their work with you (especially if, as an engineer, you might sometimes be able to help unblock them in various ways, then you can trade knowledge sharing and favors with them).",strugglingcomic,2025-10-09 17:18:01,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1o2b34k,False,

Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. Another challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years. It was actually three 1-year options, so they had to be renewed each year. Try to get an idea if they're really doing consulting work or they are more staffing/contracting.

But 1 engineer with AI can complete 6 tasks a month. Some companies may just fire half but i think most companies will keep the 10 like the fact that they can get more tasks done, meet deadlines easier, etc. Now that creates better bonuses and profit for everybody and the following year there may be enough money to hire more people.Now if you are struggling in your classes and are stressed out, id recommend going into EE or even CE.

Managers will manually review the 100 applicants down to 20 they are interesting in doing phone screens with. The phone screens are ~15 minute conversations where the manager asks some very basic questions.* **Interview Stage**: 4 - 6. Managers will conduct phone screens with the 20 applicants and from that pick around 5 +/- a one or two that they want to interview* **Interview Rounds**: In my group we usually do two rounds of interviews. First one is typically remote unless the applicant lives nearby but the second one is always mandatory in person. Each round is pretty similar but with different groups of engineers. The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.So if we use 2K as the total number of applicants.

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions3.

At this point, the company has managed to convince a venture capitalist to part with a small amount of money. Don't take this as a sign of confidence though - to you and me it's the equivalent of lending a friend $5 to play the slots and promise us 20% of whatever they win.If they *are* successful (again - super rare) it can be an awesome pay day for you... but that pay day also can take a *long long* time. I joined one startup back in 2015 that *still* hasn't had an exit event - the $880 worth of stock I got back then is now worth about $110k (back of the envelope) but I can't (reasonably) actually do anything with it because it's still private equity.I joined another startup \~2 years ago though, which had a more typical liquidation exit - I got a fat offer from the next company that hired me and more career advancement in the year of working there than in the 5 preceding years in FAANG combined, but my $160k of equity earned me a total of $0 because there wasn't anything left over after the debts and preferred stock was paid out. Even *that* was a pretty lucky case - I was working for *way* less than I was worth and really stretching myself to do so, if my next (current) employer hadn't taken notice of me I would have just found myself sitting around putting my heart and soul into something with nothing to show for it.**Startups are FANTASTIC for learning a lot of things ""in the trenches"" though**. **This is NOT appropriate for everybody.** If you're really ambitious and love being part of the rat race (especially early career where this is especially helpful!) it can be an awesome thing. It means late days, doing things *way* outside your comfort zone, learning skills that you should never have to deal with as an engineer... but that also means getting a broad skill set and great experience in a short time.In my experience, judge the founders *very critically*.
