The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. The decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. More recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse.

The application logic and authz is also in some cases deferred to the DB in Stored Procedures - a horrendous design driven by a data engineer who didn't/couldn't consider the whole application requirementsThe best skill you can learn is to be commercial, understanding and improving the data task requirements and how to communicate and refine broad tasks from the business.Learn how to understand the domain/problem, application/software/data architecture and understand the tools you have/are available. Then communicate improvements to the plan in planning, spikes, reviews, retros etc. And ensure you know your data modelling fundamentals - you should know when to normalise/denormalise data, implement appropriate SCDs, and the different industry 'best' practices for updating and tracking pipeline tables batch updates. So many engineers in general just do the task without understanding the why or taking ownership. Have opinions and be collaborative, that's what I look for in a good DE.Also expect (depending on your org and management) to hear heaps of no's - but realise that having opinions is a good thing.",bin_chickens,2025-10-05 23:52:03,2,dataengineering,t3_1nyujeq,False,

nid3r6h,"I spent half a decade at Capital One. Finished as a technical lead. There's a lot of good people there, but the enterprise is is fucked for two very immutable reasons. First, it's a bank. Despite their desire and rhetoric it is not a tech company. The people in charge of technology have no idea what they are doing and because it is a bank they get to mandate their will without requiring buy in from engineering. I remember reading a blog post from Uber about their CICD initiative and how they couldn't just force their colleagues to use it. At Capital One you can roll out the biggest piece of shit and then mandate it's adoption across the company to the detriment of everyone.Second, their absolutely insane performance management system completely cripples the company. I don't think I can return until they fix it and they never will until Rich retires.Having to continuously fire the bottom fifteen percent performers is insane. I'm all for firing non performers but it requires the ability to identify who is performing. I've been in performance management meetings where I was the only other person who could open GitHub. If you're going to do extreme performance management then you need to have the ability to actually know who is getting work done. Instead, it's completely based on narrative. People who cannot code, do not know you or your product, will decide your merit. It is insane and stupid and many good engineers flee the company for the reasons mentioned above.That said, there are very good people who for either spite or stubbornness (like myself) stick it out and try to make it a better place. They really are doing shit no other bank can. There are very good teams doing interesting work and very toxic teams where you will get fucked.Just like life it's a mixed bag.

That makes it possible to handle massive historical datasets without expensive SSD clusters or rebalancing.From a performance standpoint, we’ve benchmarked Arc using ClickBench, the industry-standard analytical test suite.On identical hardware (AWS c6a.4xlarge), Arc outperforms TimescaleDB and InfluxDB by a wide margin.Without cache: Arc ranks #8 out of 60+ systems.With cache: it climbs to #3 overall, just behind DuckDB and ClickHouse.Benchmarks and details here: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-), here too: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results)In short, DuckDB gives Arc its analytics speed, but Arc extends that into a scalable, long-term time-series warehouse that can economically retain and query billions of records using Parquet and object storage.",Icy_Addition_3974,2025-10-09 09:46:26,6,dataengineering,t1_nik5hvt,True,

But make sure you understand the 3 different S3 related configs and their usage. You may want to setup lifecycle rules outside (in terraform or similar tools) for some of those directories to manage S3 costs. We also ran into heavy S3 throttling due to the number of parallel requests so that is something you will have to be mindful of.

It is mainly the amount of data scanned I think $5 per TB data scanned. So make sure you are using storage formats that are more compact like parquet vs csv. Ensure you are using compressed parquet files. Ensure good partitioning that can drastically reduce the scanned data amount. And if you have very big data sets and want to avoid surprises get familiar with the EXPLAIN feature that can tell you how much data will be scanned and the shows you the execution plan.,Hofi2010,2025-10-10 14:46:52,1,dataengineering,t3_1o2n6cc,False,

If you do not care to, for example, be notified of schema changes like type changes or field additions, or you have a limited nr of fields and you want to type manually, then maybe you do not care. If you do care, the discussion ends here - let dlt discover schema and accept the limitation that comes along. That being said, there is also also a benefit to using json in db - the data is pre-joined so retrieval of nested data is faster than re-joining tables. For this reason we are working to add typed complex data support to give you nested with schema discovery option where supported by the destination.If you do not care to manage schema then let's talk about the raw data - there is a benefit to storing json for debugging. My personal preference is to use a mounted drive and persist the extract and normalize packages (raw and normalised pre-loading) data in a bucket with <30d deletion (serves debugging and implies with gdpr without extra management), or to load via a staging bucket. IMO json does not belong in SQL because once it's there you havw to take it out to be able to use proper tooling to handle it. regarding raw data - dlt doesn't change the data, so if you want to just debug the data, you can debug it in db. dlt does change metadata such as column names, adds types, or removes null-only columns (they have no data, cannot be typed)",Thinker_Assignment,2025-10-09 15:35:27,2,dataengineering,t3_1o1b94r,False,

It sucks because you could be a perfectly competent data engineer who builds solid pipelines without knowing every detail of the DAG scheduler or executor memory management, but some companies use these deep theory questions as a filtering mechanism. The frustrating part is there's no universal standard - one company wants you to explain catalyst optimizer stages, another just wants to see you write a working transformation. Your best bet is to have a baseline understanding of the theory (what happens when you call an action vs transformation, basic execution model, why shuffles are expensive) but don't kill yourself memorizing every architectural detail unless you're targeting companies known for this style of interviewing.The shift in how you prepare should really depend on the signals you're getting from your interviews. If you're consistently hitting walls on theory questions, then yeah, dedicate more time to understanding the ""why"" and ""how"" beneath the surface. But if you're getting through technical rounds and failing elsewhere, your time might be better spent on system design, communication skills, or just doing more practice problems. The truth is most associate-level work doesn't require you to debug Spark's physical plan daily, but being able to speak intelligently about it shows depth of knowledge that some interviewers value highly.If you want help for these unpredictable theory questions when they come up, I built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of curveball interview scenarios.",akornato,2025-10-11 11:31:47,1,dataengineering,t3_1o37lnr,False,

At deploy time, read the registry and build assets with consistent keys like source.table; new tables mean a small config change, not new code.

Sensors: file sensors for landing zones, plus a “schema drift” sensor that diffs metadata and opens a PR to update the registry so assets get generated on the next deploy.

nhwq5r2,"Yes.This isn't really a programming problem, however. It gets into an ""operations"" problem.The short answer: just make a file on a Local Area Network (LAN), (usually just on your home network somewhere), and then access it by that local network's IP address.Long answer: By _default_, nothing has a domain name on the internet. You have to apply to get one of those if you want it to be public, and it's a whole process.By _default_, everything on the internet has an IP address. This address allows the computer to figure out what other computer to talk to.Most (home network) LANs have an NAT (network address translator), which takes all the requests sent to it that are destined for the WWW, and translates them so the data gets sent back to said NAT, and translates it back to the LAN address. This NAT is usually in a Router (a connection between two different networks.)Without this router, you cannot connect to the LAN from the internet, so it is not public.With this router, the stuff on your network is only public if you change the router settings to allow incoming connections (usually with Port Forwarding/Triggering)Thus, routers have two different IP addresses. One for ""the internet"" to communicate with it, and one for the LAN, to communicate with the LAN.Any computer connected to the LAN can talk to any other device on the LAN with its IP address. This LAN address usually starts with 10., or 192.168., depending on how the router is set up.So if you save the website on a local computer, then use the computers LAN IP as the URL on any other computer in that LAN, you get what you want.",Nerketur,2025-10-05 15:47:28,7,learnprogramming,t3_1nyr14w,False,

Nobody's going to accidentally discover that, but copying IPv6 addresses around is kind of a pain and the people you're sharing it with may not even have IPv6 access.The easiest thing to do is just to not worry about any of that. Get a domain name, run a server to serve your web page, and put a password on it.

Why are there 3 layers of indirection? Wat is this ;-; ?? "". The gap isn't about raw coding skill - its about how ""professional"" code is shaped - it doesnt simply \*work\*, but is architected to survive years of changes, changing requirements, multiple contributors and weird edge cases. What seperates a Jr. SWE from Sr. SWE is more about instinct, rather than pure DSA knowledge. 1. Read the classics. Reading literature is a great way to learn theory of things and new patterns. Stuff like *Design Patterns*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, *Anti-Patterns*, *A Philosophy of Software Design*, *Clean Code -* not saying you gotta drop everything and read them \*right now\*, but imo those are some of the books that kinda live on the must-read list for devs at some point.2. Rewrite your own old code. Grab a project you wrote quite a time ago and try to read it like you weren't the one who made it. Start asking yourself questions. Bonus: refactoring is way easier and faster now, because your ""thinking level"" has leveled up since then. You would be seeing it more as a system and not just a bunch of code glued together.3. Try contributing to large OSS projects. Tips: \- Dont just read the code - look at the directory structure, the test layout, how errors propagate. \- Look into how they are documenting it, how they introduce breaking changes, logging and observability. \- Notice how they isolate I/O, how they handle state across the application, how they make things testable. The feedback you are going to receive in your PRs is going to be invaluable (even if sometimes served cold). Soft skills become more and more important the further you go in your career. You may write the cleanest code in the world, but if you can't explain your thinking, review someone else's PR and give them feedback or advocate for better design - it is going to hold you back. Communication is \*key\*.**TL;DR:** Real-world code is about making it last. The instinct you will develop from experience, mistakes and seeing how big systems fail and evolve is going to shape how you design, develop and debug . Read literature to get the theory, revisit (and refactor) your own old code and see your growth, study bit open-source projects.

Evaluate your toolchain periodically, using a good IDE, updated compiler versions, linters, static analysis, continuous integration, etc. and treat compiler warnings as hard errors.2. Production code has what will probably look to you like an insane amount of error-handling code and error/debug logging. It's there for a reason.

Former me was focused on ""getting the code to work"", but if it only works for the happy-path cases, that's not nearly good enough.4. Once it's working and tested, resist the urge to go changing things willy-nilly. When you change something, anything at all, you run the risk of introducing errors. Don't change things unless you have a good reason.5. If you observe something about your code that you don't understand, any kind of unexplained behavior... don't stop working until you DO understand it. It's very often an error lurking.

So yes, I would argue you can definitely do it!The key thing is to start small. Take things one step at a time. Don't add a game engine before you know what a variable or condition is. You don't need to finish the whole [Harvard CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/cs50) before you open a game engine, but at least a few intro videos can be a big help.For game engines, both Unity and Godot are popular for beginners. Godot is easier to start with (simpler, no setup), Unity has more jobs/resources. Both are great choices.Either way, I'd take one of many online programming courses in Python or C\# before jumping into an engine, or perhaps dig into the CS50 course for more structured learning. A game engine adds a bunch of concepts on top of programming that are specific to the engine. If you want to jump in with both feet, that's fine, but you may struggle with information overload. If that happens, I recommend taking a break from the game engine and going back to programming basics, then trying the engine again when you feel more comfortable.Good luck!",HunterIV4,2025-10-07 00:15:52,4,learnprogramming,t3_1nzyu9s,False,

nizgmvq,"A system call is basically just a fancy kind of function call. The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.The kernel can ""receive"" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.In terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the ""list of running processes"" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.Similarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to ""print"" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.On the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly.

Raster Data is an image that you drape over your canvas, but it has embeded or an extra file with information saying where and how to place the image, like a tiff world ‘.tfw’ file.Any geospatial data will have a spatial reference for the coordinates, like WGS84 for your typical lat longs in decimal degrees or degree, minutes, seconds. Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.Anyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.Now you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map.

Take 2 equations: f(x) = 100x + 10, g(x) = x (the simplest function we can represent with the same degree as f(x)).The largest exponent for both of these equations is 1, so we can apply the above rule. Let's choose a constant of 105 for c.For some values of x, f(x) > c * g(x). Take x == 1 for example. F would be 110 and g would be 1. 110 > 105 (1 * C). However, at larger values of x, this doesn't stay true. At x == 10 we get f is 1,010 and g is 10. So, for these values, f(x) 1,010.Basically, this just sums down to the idea that a functions growth is capped to its largest exponent, which is why Big O notation always ignores constants (except for O(1)). So, even something like f(x) = 1,000,000,000x, the Big O notation would be O(x), because there exists a constant C and a value of x X0 that f(x) < c * g(x).",Alarming_Chip_5729,2025-10-05 04:46:36,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nyeko4,False,

They're not mutually exclusive.There are products that are open-source, but they charge money for it. The motivations can range here - maybe the source is open to promote trust, maybe it's open so that hobbyists can access it for free while business users can pay for support.There are also products that are closed-source, but free to consumers. I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.So in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.If your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.A really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the ""top"" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.As an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They ""lose"" money on the free users but gain community.On the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you.

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.Most open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.Quick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",EliSka93,2025-10-08 19:28:29,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1jwxj,False,

ni6s1kb,"The first thing to learn, especially for someone with ADHD, isn't actually a programming thing, but rather an organisational problem-solving thing; it's ""divide and conquer"": you need to learn how to split big tasks into small enough sub tasks that they're trivial. You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.Focusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.This is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.The second thing to learn is ""make skeletons"" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.For your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.At any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (""Agile"" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).There are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",GetContented,2025-10-07 03:26:54,4,learnprogramming,t3_1o038m7,False,
ni6p6q9,"I can share some advice from a self-taught dev with 14 years of professional experience, who also looks fondly back at starting out by dabbling in html and css in the 90s on geocities and angelfire.First piece of advice: ""I don't want handouts. I like the struggle (masochist >,>)"" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.Second piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think ""Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break"" I write that down in this list. 2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like ""Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week"".3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.By keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. Also, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project.

ni583eg,"I'm a senior dev + data scientist, working with Python among many other languages. I also have terminal ADHD.I firmly believe that almost anyone, including those of us with ADHD, can learn almost anything with the right resources and learning strategies. Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.Random notes in no particular order from what you've said:* You're ""supposed"" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often ""get"" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to ""just keep trying"". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax!

I often worked after hours on related stuff to improve myself.After just a few months, I cleared interview for another good job, not only better in terms of pay, but also because of the senior developers I got to work with. Being around skilled people and working on the same projects as they do gives you a huge jump. I even managed to handle the responsibilities of a senior with 5 years of experience who had resigned.So in your case, I can see that you’re passionate but you just need the right environment. I realized that about myself too: I’m passionate, and I need a place that helps me grow. Even though I received another higher-paying offer, I didn’t leave, because I want to focus on building my skillset in these early years.When you work with brilliant people, you grow much faster , no tutorial or course can give you that.

ni344no,"Yes, scan metadata once into a DB (path, size, timestamp, codec info), then in future runs only query for files that changed (delta). Use that DB as your source of truth so encoding jobs don’t re-scan everything every time",False-Egg-1386,2025-10-06 15:44:50,3,learnprogramming,t3_1nzmgm9,False,
ni37at5,"This sounds like a situation where a bit of profiling and measurement will help with your system design.My guess is that the time taken to scan a file's header and figure out what codecs it uses is a tiny fraction of the time taken to actually re-encode it. And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)And as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.For *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.If the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be ""good"" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data. If it gets lost, or stale, or corrupted, it's extremely unlikely to cause any kind of inconsistency or bad behavior; the worst that will happen is redoing unnecessary work.",teraflop,2025-10-06 15:59:59,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nzmgm9,False,

I know you didn't come up with these examples, that they come from people looking for stuff to analyze and make content out of. But they are just bad generalizations. In any projects, you have constraints, and your goal is do the best thing possible despoite those constraints.

It can however be a nice way to spark creativity or to develop one's skill by forcing oneself to do something differnetly than how they were doing it. I'm thinking of game jams (to stay in the realm of video games examples), where the goal is specifically to add two massive constraints (time and a custom directive) in order to force developers to be creative.

This means that zero through nine were required to be placed in the code contiguously with the zero at a code point multiple of 16.

First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation. Even if we eliminate all of the control characters and limit ourselves to printable characters included in ASCII encoding, you still need at least 7 bits to cover those 95 characters with values from 0 (`b0000000`) to 94 (`b1011110`). We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really.

nipypy0,"Programming is an extension of technology, or you can also think of it as a microcosm of technology. The main purpose of technology is to **improve the way we do something**, either with a tool or otherwise. Instead of calculating numbers by hand, we use a calculator to automate the process. Instead of converting a lot of numbers using a calculator, we use a spreadsheet program to do it in bulk. A lot of the constructs of programming serve the same purpose.At its very basic, most programs can be written with if-conditions and variables alone. However, we don't do that, and we use lists, loops, functions and classes instead, **not** because we have to (exceptions apply), but because we want to. Most of them serve the same purpose: **to shorten and simplify code at the cost of more complex and intricate logic**.For example, instead of writing: cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; cout << ""Hello World"" << endl;You can instead write: for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { cout << ""Hello World"" << endl; }Classes serve a similar purpose: instead of having loose, disconnected variables and functions all over the place, you ""group"" them into objects. This gives you many benefits, making it much simpler to code certain algorithms, keeping your code organized so that you don't confuse yourself and others as your code base expands, and in some languages, it provides a layer of ""code safety"" as well.But to emphasize, you do **not** have to necessarily write code this way, in most cases. A lot of different syntax ""oddities"" exist to be **shortcuts**, such as how `i++` is mostly just `i = i + 1`. The same is true of a while-loop versus a for-loop, the former of which is more fundamental. This is why it seems there are so many solutions to the same problem, but they all do the same thing in varying levels of efficiency, in terms of logic and/or syntax.",Joewoof,2025-10-10 04:33:44,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o21qmk,False,

nike9it,"printf(""%zu, sizeof(1L)); printf(""%ld, 1L << 31);If long's are 32-bit on your platform (e.g. ARM), then this code is technically undefined behaviour (or maybe implementation defined -- I would have to look it up). 1L means it is a signed quantity, which in C, platforms must support at least the values `-2**31+1` .. `+2**31-1` inclusive. In practice, all platforms I've seen would support `-2**31` as well. I.e. the values -2147483648 up to and including 2147483647 should fit in a 32-bit signed integer. But the C Standard (at least all C Standards before C23) only requires platforms to support from -2147483647 to 2147483647 in order to accomodate storing the integer in non 2's complement form. However it seems that C23 requires 2's complement, so maybe that is different in C23. In practice, though, all platforms you're likely to use are using 2's complement. However, 1L << 31 results in 2147483648, a value that does not fit in a 32-bit signed integer, so you are invoking integer overflow (which is formally undefined behaviour, but since you're doing at ""at compile time"" maybe it's really implementation defined). In any case, we surely can't expect that the result will be the same in this case between platforms (32-bit long vs. 64-bit long).If you want the same behaviour, you should suffix ul on your integer constant (some people prefer writing uL or UL for readability). That way, you'll be working with 32-bit unsigned long vs. 64-bit unsigned long. The sizes are different but since you're still within the 32-bit unsigned range in your example, you'll get the same behaviour in this case. Since 1ul << 31 is unsigned long, you should also update the printf format from %ld to %lu to ensure the correct integer interpretation when printing it out.",chaotic_thought,2025-10-09 08:54:19,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1z9m5,False,
niln3xl,"> but declaring a literal's type as long, long long etc. seems to kill the whole point of using uint32_t in the first place.Correct. You see the contradiction. Literals are implicitly cast to the assigned type because this pedantic redundancy is a wholly unnecessary distraction that has no benefit in any sense of the word.So I've played with it, and wrote the variations: int x = 5; int x = 5L; int x = 5LL; int x = 5ULL;And I compiled them under GCC for ARM and x86_64. This is what I got: mov w0, 5 //ARM mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 5 //x86_64The compiler didn't care what my literal was suffixed. The type is determined by the type declaration of the variable being assigned, and the literal is implicitly converted at compile-time.Now as for your code: printf(""%zu %ld"", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);Yeah, the type is deduced from the literal itself, so of course you're going to get a non-portable result.---I think it's important to understand how to use primitive types.C defines a whole family of type aliases. They are guaranteed to alias the built-in types. First are the fixed width types: int8_tEtc. The fixed width types ARE NOT guaranteed to be defined in the first place - they are only defined on platforms that actually have native hardware support for those exact widths. If there is no 16 bit type support on that hardware, there is no `int16_t`. This comes up on DSPs and ASICs the most, though you'll also see it on FPGAs, in some old or really tiny embedded architectures, like old 4-bit machines, or some exotic or esoteric hardware few have ever heard of.The fixed width types are for implementing protocols. These could be file formats, hardware interfaces, or network/transport protocols. You will use these for defining types that are going to be serialized or mapped to hardware. You'll use these in data buffers.Then there are the `least` types: uint_least32_tEtc. These types are the smallest widths available with at least as many bits, and these types are ALWAYS defined. For platforms that support fixed width types, they're 1:1. They may contain more bits, but you cannot portably rely on that, nor should you, because that defeats the point.Use these types in your in-memory data structures to maximize system and cache memory density and bus transfer efficiency.Continued...",mredding,2025-10-09 14:21:26,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o1z9m5,False,
nikgas6,"Okay, the example is unfortunate but consider the following: 1LU << 48 would still be integer overflow if long is represented by a 32-bit wide integer. On a different platform (where long would be 64-bits wide) this would not do integer overflow. My question is: which option is best for keeping literal constants typed and yet ensure portability between platforms.",Ssingleaspringle,2025-10-09 09:16:06,1,learnprogramming,t1_nike9it,True,
niln53s,"Finally, there are the `fast` types: int_fast16_tEtc. You should use these as function parameters, iterators, and locals. These are the most computationally efficient use of hardware registers on your platform with at least as many bits. Very often these will be larger than the bit size specified. Registers tend to be laid out in powers of two word sizes - word, double word, quad word... And so will these. Ideally, what you'll get is these values will be optimized and either never see cache or system memory - your code should be small enough that they exist only in registers - for sufficiently large hardware platforms.C has a weak type system, because C is a negotiation between the standard, the hardware, and you. This flexibility inherent to the primitive types is also a form of portability in its own right. This is how you can port Unix from one architecture to another, because you write code in terms of `int`, and you get whatever size and extent that hardware can handle, whatever hardware you go to. You get internal consistency. It's when you start working with external data that you need to accommodate data protocols and their data.Most of the time you don't need fixed width types - and it's actually not desirable for computation. They're either too big for memory, or too small for registers. Besides - if you're not defining a protocol, who cares how many bits you have exactly? All you care about is that you have enough - which is something you need to figure out at design time. What are you doing? How many bits do you need? Once you know, you want the fewest to store in memory, and then you don't care how many are used for actual computation, so long as it's fast and efficient.So the `least` and `fast` end up being the types you use the most. They're completely inappropriate and not portable for protocols, and you want to get away from the fixed width types as soon as possible - at the fringes, where IO happens.So this code: printf(""%zu %ld"", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);It's completely asinine. You're not outputting the size and extent of a type, but of a value, and the type of the value is up to the compiler's discretion - the implementation just PICKED SOMETHING, because it doesn't matter; in all other code, this would be narrowed or widened implicitly and correctly. This is fine for writing debug, but as you're writing to the `stdout` file descriptor and presuming you were trying to do something REAL, you'd be wanting to write in terms of a protocol, which means the correct thing to do is write this in terms of a fixed width type to make it portable.---The other thing is about the C type system - an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. You are not expected to use the primitive types directly - you're expected to make your own types in terms of primitives, and then describe your solution in terms of that. If you didn't care what the type was - then you'd write your implementation as a macro, and practice the Generic Programming paradigm.Your `int` is always something more specific, a quantity, a range, a unit of something. Make your types and control your semantics. An `int` can perform all arithmetic and bitwise operations, but a `weight` can only add to other `weight`s, and can only multiply against scalars. A `weight` can't be negative. So: typedef struct weight weight; weight *create(int_least32_t); weight *dup(const weight *); weight *copy(weight *, const weight *); void destroy(weight *); weight *add(weight *, const weight *); weight *multiply(weight *, int); int_least32_t weight_to_int(const weight *); int print(const weight *);Notice it's an opaque pointer. `print` returns an `int` because `printf` returns an `int`. `multiply` accepts an `int` because its an arbitrary value - unless in your design you know something better. An `int` is going to be the native word size, so efficient. Then you implement: struct weight { int_least32_t value; }; weight *create(const int_least32_t value) { weight *w = NULL; if(value >= 0) { weight *w = (weight *)malloc(sizeof(weight)); w.value = value; } return w; } //... weight *add(weight *res, const weight *w) { if(res && w) { res.value += w.value; return res; } return NULL; } weight *multiply(weight *res, const int v) { if(res && v >= 0) { res.value *= v; return res; } return NULL; }",mredding,2025-10-09 14:21:35,2,learnprogramming,t1_niln3xl,False,
nikm2yx,"> consider the following: 1LU << 48 would still be integer overflow if long is represented by a 32-bit wide integerYes, you're right. This may be why the Standard says you are only allowed to left-shift up to 31 bits for a 32-bit unsigned type. If the type of unsigned long is a 32-bit type on a particular platform (e.g. ARM), then indeed shifting it left by 48 is undefined behaviour.More on this can be found discussed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper)Also, I'm not really sure you can avoid implicit integer promotion in a single expression like 1ul << 48. Even if you write UINT32_C(1) as suggested in the other reply on the thread, the type produced by that expression is actually uint_least32_t (i.e. it could be 32-bit or it could be bigger).So in my view, an expression like 1ul << 48 is just not portable. I would hope that my compiler would give me a warning if I were compiling that code on a platform where unsigned long is 32-bit, but it's conceivable that on other platforms (where unsigned long is 64-bit), that it would compile with no warning but still be non-portable, as you seem to have discovered.If you're really in a bind and need to do something like the above in a portable way, you could consider computing it at runtime. Though in this case it seems a bit like a waste of time, since it seems like we want the final value 0 in this case: uint64_t tmp = 1ul; tmp <<= 48; uint32_t value = (uint32_t)tmp; printf(""%zu\n"", sizeof(value)); printf(""%lu\n"", value);This should give the same result regardless of what size long's are on the platform. And the result should be 0 on all platforms that support uint32_t (for all possible starting values of value), since vacated bits get filled in with 0 -- unless I'm misunderstanding something that could happen differently on some platform (seems unlikely though).",chaotic_thought,2025-10-09 10:14:19,2,learnprogramming,t1_nikgas6,False,

nisbel5,"BP is a general purpose register, you shouldn't expect it to change ""automatically"" any more than, say, BX. You don't *have* to use BP for keeping track of the current function's stack frame; that's just what C compilers typically do.The only stack instruction that changes the contents of the BP register is POP BP.C typically sets up stack frames based on BP like this. The assembly code for a C function called `myfunc` probably looks like this, regardless of what `myfunc` actually does: myfunc: PUSH BP MOV BP,SP ; ... function goes here ... POP BP RETBut again, that's just what C compilers [1] do. Your own assembly programs don't have to do things this way; you could use BP to hold a number used in a calculation instead.That being said, there are several reasons to set up a stack frame the same way a C compiler would:- It's a standard practice that makes your code easier to understand- BP can index the stack without a segment prefix override [2]- You must index the stack to access arguments from high-level languages- You can use stack as a convenient way to quickly allocate memory in your function (this is how high-level languages allocate memory for local variables if you have too many to fit in registers)I agree with another poster's recommendation to figure out a way to get assembly listings produced by a compiler. For all the popular modern C compilers, [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) is an easy way to do this, but it only seems to support 32-bit or 64-bit x86 targets. (The most visible difference between 16-bit assembly is 32-bit register names start with E, for example ECX; and 64-bit register names start with R, for example RCX.)[1] Different programming languages use different calling conventions, especially in the previous millenium. Meaning the arguments might be laid out in a different order, or there might be some extra information. For example if you're interfacing with, say, the QBASIC programming language instead of C, you will need a FAR return (to a different segment) that pops the caller's arguments off the stack, [like this](http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/tutorials/tuts/doorknob/asm_appendix1.html), and the arguments are also passed in reverse order compared to C.[2] Segments are important for 16-bit assembly, which I assume you're working with as you say ""BP"" (16-bit) not ""EBP"" (32-bit) or ""RBP"" (64-bit). But segments aren't relevant to 32-bit or 64-bit programs; the popular modern OS's all use flat memory models, and manage memory with paging rather than segments.",white_nerdy,2025-10-10 15:18:19,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o2e342,False,

nibxlm3,"I mean it sounds like you already have a query language which is capable of expressing the complex queries you want to do, namely SQL. But for some reason, the external system is rejecting the **valid** SQL queries that you want to do, because of unexplained ""security concerns"".I don't think inventing a new domain-specific query language, instead of just using SQL, is going to address your real problem. The real problem is how to **efficiently** extract only the subset of the data that you need from your underlying database, when you're being forced to go through a layer that is trying to prevent you from doing that. If you did come up with a custom query language, then you would just have to translate it to SQL anyway in order to actually execute it, right? (Since Lucene's query language is nowhere near sophisticated enough to express what you want.)So I think the answer is going to depend on the specific details of the restrictions that the system is imposing on your SQL queries.For instance:> Pick this one if its status is ""open"" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.It's fairly straightforward to express this with a SQL query involving nested joins. When you pass a query containing joins to the DB, the DB can optimize based on the details of what you're querying and the available indexes, so that it doesn't fetch more data than necessary. This is crucial for efficiency.What is the specific limitation you're running into when you try to write such a query? When you say the system rejects ""complex queries"", what is the actual definition of ""complex"" that's being used?For instance: Suppose the system doesn't allow joins at all. Then you would have to implement your own query engine which queries tables individually and then joins them together (e.g. using a hash join). This will almost certainly be much slower than letting the DB perform the join itself. In order to mitigate the performance cost as much as possible, your query engine needs to decide what order to perform the joins in, and it needs to ""push down"" the join criteria to become filters on the individual table queries. (Of course, you will be limited in your ability to do this because you don't have access to all the low-level data that the underlying DB engine does, such as index statistics.)If the actual restrictions you're facing are different from ""no joins allowed"", then you would have to design around those other restrictions instead.But the *implementation* of this join engine doesn't really depend much on how you *express* the queries that you want to perform. So for expressing the queries, you might as well stick with SQL, or at least a limited subset of SQL.",teraflop,2025-10-07 23:08:36,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o0syuu,False,
nicehoo,"Main point: don’t invent a new DSL-use a standard filter syntax (OData $filter or RSQL/FIQL) and back it with a graph-aware read model.For expressiveness, OData’s any/all and $expand handle “exists” and nested relations well; where that hits limits, compile your filters to a graph query (Cypher/Gremlin) or Datalog. Define a small JSON AST with and/or/not, cmp ops, exists(relation, where), and count(relation, depth, op, value).

You need people who can guide other engineers, break down hard problems in a way that are tangible to less experienced engineers, and mostly when you’re building a piece of software, it’s rarely greenfield, but more about building a piece of the jigsaw puzzle in a larger ecosystem, so you need to talk to other people (who own the other neighbouring pieces of your jigsaw puzzle) to make sure you design the piece in a good way, and these skills are hard to come by, a combination of tech competence, understanding the system well enough to be able to decide the direction you want to take it in, is a harder skill than people understand.

ni5rqul,"There's some meme somewhere about junior devs wanting to be invited to more meetings and senior devs wanting to not. The progression is natural, but you can carve your career a bit based on your own goals. If you want to maximize career growth, you have to align yourself with business goals and impact, and the way to do this is rarely to output more code but instead be a multiplier- train up other devs, lead initiatives, set up processes to streamline things. Part of this may in fact be figuring out ways to trim down meetings but still maintain same output and quality. This may mean you decline meetings that aren't useful.Alternatively you can also drive impact by being very technical and the expert on one technology. At my internship (circa 2017) Docker was still somewhat new and some guy named Sheldon learned about it at a meetup and introduced it to the company and he was the ""Docker guy"" who people would go to get help.Or you can choose to just focus on doing what you want to do and not min-max career development. My first job out of college was low 6 figures, and feasibly that was enough to never ""career develop"" again from financial aspect.

They work for WITCH companies, insurance companies, oil companies, etc. They are modern-day indentured servants. In this case, if their employer can’t easily replace them by sponsoring someone else, it would stand to reason their wages would rise, not fall. They already couldn’t get sponsored by other companies. Not how it works for this caste. On the other hand, there are H1B recipients who already worked for Big Tech directly overseas. They get sponsored. They insource their job with them. They were never begging for table scraps. They’ll just self deport and outsource their job with them if they get a $100k paycut. Moreover, people like that create other jobs. We’re outsourcing an entire team’s worth of jobs with them. You’re also ignoring the consensus amongst economists as to why SF became the tech capital of the world. Why it outcompeted the hub around MIT in MA. Because non compete agreements are illegal in CA. You presume competition is a bad thing. Maybe it is for entrenched, enshittifying monopolies in isolation. But even those monopolies had been paying a premium to bring the world’s top talent to the place where they weren’t a big fish in a small pond. If they wanted to entrap their higher tier H1Bs, they would’ve done what all the employers of lower tier H1Bs did: moved them out to some godforsaken shithole in TX or NC, refused to sponsor applications for green cards, paid them below market rate, etc. At some level, even the monopolies realize competition is good.We issue under 100k H1Bs per year. That’s it. And they don’t all go to IT/CS jobs either. India and China have nearly 3 billion people between the two of them. Do the math… We’re only getting the top 0.01% of them, for the most part. There are some serial abusers. The WITCH companies in particular ought to be permanently barred from H1B. But really, the problem with H1B is how abusive it is to the recipients. We should be more like Canada and just give them green cards when they arrive. Unironically. Why do we make it so fucking hard for talented people to come here and pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in taxes, while some barely literate economic migrant from Venezuela just says the magic word “asylum” and they can come stay for years in a free hotel, no questions asked?

Big fat waste of time for everyone involved because you can't code something you're unprepared for within less than an hour window, even though you could do it within 3 hours and a bunch of Googling. If you're going to build a Wordle game, tell them before. If they're going to fetch data, manipulate data, filter data, and display a list, tell them beforehand. These are two very different things and you could be super sharp at one and not the other.\- Live technical test with AI. The key here is to check whether or not they are blindly accepting prompts from AI. Take the time to ask questions around what the code they just accepted is doing and why they think that is a good solution.\- Timed test (take home/alone). Give them a quite complicated technical test and 3-4 hours to complete it with a submission deadline. They will have to use AI to solve it in that time. Then you follow up in another meeting to discuss the solution and why they did what they did.\- Take home test. Make it complicated as above. They will use AI but how do they handle state management? How do they fetch data? How do they handle errors? Is it scalable? Etc. You can ask for more if you're permitting AI.You can effectively assess someone's ability even when they use AI.

First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.Second, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to ""know the moves"" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.The above is for ICs who are still hands on.

Obviously the work you did won't be a tit-for-tat match with a backend engineer working on some Java WebLogic crap or something but at the end of the day what's more important is that you clearly have the background skills to build complex data pipelines.I'd say focus on selling your FAAS and AWS cloud skillset, those are pretty important in modern infra. >How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field?

I think anything is marketable with the right verbiage, personally. You could be a mainframe developer and as long as you demonstrate the ability to learn, manage complex systems, and build out feature services I think most places would be happy with it. Also, ETL is probably still very much relevant in the modern age. It's not like data pipelines are suddenly agnostic and all-encompassing. I don't have the personal experience with the BIG data boys though, as my only experience with ETL was with a financial firm myself doing similar work as yours but I can't imagine the practice is somehow deprecated and forgotten to time already. >And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again?

I also picked up courses in System Design using [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com) and educative.io. I use ChatGPT a lot to create study guides for myself when I interview at companies, I try to get a refresher on their tech stack so I can speak their language. I also started doing Leetcode religiously, completed Neetcode's 150 and have about 170 problems on Leetcode.com. It's been a rough journey where I've been passing DSA interviews and System design interviews, but now companies are starting to ask on the job syntax questions to really filter down candidates. There's just too many of us, the market is overly saturated. So now I'm on the grind, building apps from scratch and iterating on it over and over again until I have the syntax down to a T as well. We'll see how my next interviews go. I've had friends in the same boat and I had one friend that studied LC for 6 months straight to get into Meta, but ended up failing the System Design. The other thing is they're super picky about languages now, if you say you know Java, they want you to do their stupid LC in Java. As if knowing syntax is going to make you a good engineer....I've been unemployed for a year and still looking, so you're not alone.People that are employed will never understand what we're going through. In fact, they wouldn't even pass their own interviews today. I can guarantee you that I have more skill than any of them in any system design interview or leetcode question. All they know is how to interview people and of course when you have all the answers in front of you it's easy to do that.Stay strong my brother, I've also considered other roles that are closely related like Customer Support Engineer, DevOps, IT Support, and wait until the economy gets better. I've been applying to those roles and it's been a lot better since they don't ask ridiculous questions and demand regurgitation of syntax immediately.

What I do with my career is really on me, and is based on my personal goals and priorities. It'd be odd if my tech lead sat me down and explained what he wants me to do after I quit the company we're at.But technical-wise, I had a great tech lead at my new grad company. His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.Maybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.That's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.That creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often. If you're giving significant mentorship, then a good manager/PM will make sure you have a reduced sprint load, or even give you dedicated consulting tickets with points on them.I'm really thankful for my new grad tech lead, because I was able to take those very healthy practices, and carry them with me throughout my career. I cultivate that kind of a healthy culture wherever I go now.That being said, after I left that new grad job with about 3.5 YOE, I didn't really receive mentorship anymore.

Even if you aren't writing code, you are probably weighing in on design choices, diving deep into high-profile operational issues, or helping teams with disagreements, all of which require understanding technical areas - someone without that understanding usually does not do well. The other thing I've seen in my own career is that while I have gotten more senior, things have mostly shifted from depth to breadth. There was a time where I knew everything about my area: if you had a question about how to build a Java app using Spring storing data in Postgres, MySQL, DynamoDB or Mongo, that used Maven as a build script - I probably knew the answer (and still might, at least for whatever old version I used back in the day). Now, the set of things I weigh in spans a very broad set.

The question is how to leverage that experience to get interviews. If you can't get interviews your probably falling short at the application stage (missing some keywords in your resume, or languages/tools that are needed for the job). If you ever get a denial reach out to the hiring manager and see what was missing from your experience and work on getting that experience even if it's solo work. Worse case the hiring person doesn't respond, best case they give you some pointers. (This is assuming it isn't a fake posting) If you are you're getting interviews but not moving forward, then the HR or panel stage is the crux to get over. The HR round is your chance to show passion and explain how your background can benefit the **company**. The panel round is where you prove your technical knowledge and problem solving skills. Use your HR round to figure out what projects are currently being worked on by the company and figure out if they're interesting to you. You will burn out if you find the work boring, and then you're back to square 1. You mentioned companies hiring people with more experience, sure that will happen, but I have worked with people who have 10+ years of experience and they still got laid off with me. They are struggling to get past the HR round because they got too comfortable, they lost their passion, ability to adapt, and put less effort into what a company needs and is hiring for. Effort and curiosity counts more than people think. the only thing better is experience. Focusing on projects is the best idea to open you up to getting experience. Even better than that is trying to contribute to open source of projects you're truly interested in. You'll be working with other developers, getting real world coding experience, and getting feedback on your code. This is a HUGE advantage when getting through the panel round with other engineers reviewing your work live. Keep building and publishing your work, and make sure recruiters can actually *see* what you’ve been working on. That visibility can make a huge difference.Again this field is beyond tough right now, but keep applying, there are so many of us with experience looking for a job, but we are still working with other engineers to continue growing out knowledge an experience.

So you provide them with optionality.So my professional opinion is that you should focus your learning on what interests you most, and explore various domains. As you know, the field is also evolving extremely quickly, so it's nearly impossible to predict what will be in demand.

You can also ask it to do web searches or research for you, if you tell it to find learning resources or videos for you (based on topics or styles that you tell it that you prefer).For example, if you have an enterprise approved AI LLM you can use, then when one of your AI/ML peers publishes a document or a slide deck, you can just upload the doc and give it a prompt like this ""I am a software engineer, trying to learn more about AI/ML. One of my coworkers shared this doc recently, can you help break it down and explain what it means? Assume I know basic software and technology concepts, but that I have no advanced statistics or data science training."" Of course, if you don't have a safe enterprise AI to use, then you can't be uploading sensitive documents to your personal subscription. But you can still take certain key phrases or concepts that are generic, and ask Claude or ChatGPT to explain then (e.g. what is XGBoost? how do you run an A/B test? what does stat sig mean? how does deep learning work? etc.).Using an AI LLM is no substitute for real education or reading and studying textbooks, and it won't make you transform into a full ML engineer overnight or something... but it can actually be a very useful starting point for someone who is a beginner. Eventually you can use it to help you generate sample projects, build your own ML model as a tutorial, etc. Also, once you feel like you've got a basic grasp, then you should graduate from asking your initially dumb questions to your AI LLM only, to asking (slightly?) less dumb questions to your actual coworkers. Don't pester them and don't make them responsible for teaching you, but generally speaking if you show serious interest in learning and put in work yourself, most people are happy to talk about their work with you (especially if, as an engineer, you might sometimes be able to help unblock them in various ways, then you can trade knowledge sharing and favors with them).",strugglingcomic,2025-10-09 17:18:01,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1o2b34k,False,

Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. Another challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years. It was actually three 1-year options, so they had to be renewed each year. Try to get an idea if they're really doing consulting work or they are more staffing/contracting.

But 1 engineer with AI can complete 6 tasks a month. Some companies may just fire half but i think most companies will keep the 10 like the fact that they can get more tasks done, meet deadlines easier, etc. Now that creates better bonuses and profit for everybody and the following year there may be enough money to hire more people.Now if you are struggling in your classes and are stressed out, id recommend going into EE or even CE. I knew many kids who dropped out of CS and CE because they couldnt handle the coidng classes. Coding was much harder than they expected.

Managers will manually review the 100 applicants down to 20 they are interesting in doing phone screens with. The phone screens are ~15 minute conversations where the manager asks some very basic questions.* **Interview Stage**: 4 - 6. Managers will conduct phone screens with the 20 applicants and from that pick around 5 +/- a one or two that they want to interview* **Interview Rounds**: In my group we usually do two rounds of interviews. First one is typically remote unless the applicant lives nearby but the second one is always mandatory in person. Each round is pretty similar but with different groups of engineers. The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.So if we use 2K as the total number of applicants. Then ~5% of resumes are actually looked at by a person. ~1% make it to phone screens. ~0.25% make it to interview stage.

How good your manager is at calibrations (and how much they and leadership likes you).2. The amount of opportunities for ""new"" or impactful work.Most people don't have 1 or 2, so if you're middle of the pack it's very possible you get stuck with the short end of the stick just because the opportunities aren't there or you get stuck doing grunt work for a few months.If your peers have slightly better results or you make one mistake that others didn't then you may find yourself behind the curve without the opportunities to make up ground.On the other hand, you will probably never need to worry about stack ranking if your manager knows the game and you are trusted within your org to deliver results. If you're liked and trusted to deliver you will almost always have your pick of opportunities, meaning you will almost always have good results to show for performance management. Most people don't have the required mix of soft and technical skills to pull this off, so that's probably why most of what you read is negative.",SwitchOrganic,2025-10-11 02:44:36,6,cscareerquestions,t1_nivjizo,False,

At this point, the company has managed to convince a venture capitalist to part with a small amount of money. Don't take this as a sign of confidence though - to you and me it's the equivalent of lending a friend $5 to play the slots and promise us 20% of whatever they win.If they *are* successful (again - super rare) it can be an awesome pay day for you... but that pay day also can take a *long long* time. I joined one startup back in 2015 that *still* hasn't had an exit event - the $880 worth of stock I got back then is now worth about $110k (back of the envelope) but I can't (reasonably) actually do anything with it because it's still private equity.I joined another startup \~2 years ago though, which had a more typical liquidation exit - I got a fat offer from the next company that hired me and more career advancement in the year of working there than in the 5 preceding years in FAANG combined, but my $160k of equity earned me a total of $0 because there wasn't anything left over after the debts and preferred stock was paid out. Even *that* was a pretty lucky case - I was working for *way* less than I was worth and really stretching myself to do so, if my next (current) employer hadn't taken notice of me I would have just found myself sitting around putting my heart and soul into something with nothing to show for it.**Startups are FANTASTIC for learning a lot of things ""in the trenches"" though**. **This is NOT appropriate for everybody.** If you're really ambitious and love being part of the rat race (especially early career where this is especially helpful!) it can be an awesome thing. It means late days, doing things *way* outside your comfort zone, learning skills that you should never have to deal with as an engineer... but that also means getting a broad skill set and great experience in a short time.In my experience, judge the founders *very critically*. I like to ask founders hard questions to see how they react. It takes experience in business and industry to get a feel for what's good / not good, what you like / don't, I can't really give great advice here - but if you're interested in young companies and startups, the best way to get that experience is the hard way!If you're happy with the base pay and want to hustle for a bit, it could be a good opportunity.

You may see people post LinkedIn premium stats where X% of people applying to an entry level role have a masters... but that doesn't mean they're *getting the role*.When a company is hiring for a regular SWE position that requires no specialized knowledge outside of a bachelors, if they see someone with a masters applying, all they see is a flight risk. They're not stupid. They know someone with a masters degree is just going to use that ""normal"" position as a stepping stone, and leave the moment they have a job lined up that has work utilizing their degree, and more importantly, pay reflecting the advanced degree.You can claim that this is the job you want, and you're in it for the long term all you want.... but no sane company is going to believe you.None of this is a problem if you're getting a masters/PhD in order to chase jobs that require a masters/PhD. It becomes a problem when you're using those degrees just to delay your entry into the market.Stick it out with applying. Getting an internship sophomore year is pretty difficult. You'll likely have better luck after your Junior year. And even if you don't.... in my opinion your time is better spent in the market, applying until you get something lined up.

Declined the offer and they actually sent me a second offer that included a much higher signing bonus and RSU grant. I still declined. The second time was more recent for a similar role as before on the same team with the same manager who remembered me and still wanted me on their team. I was interviewing as an E6 this time but I was told the initial screening was pretty much identical. I crushed the first problem and had tons of time for the second but the screener didn't understand my solution and kept interrupting me questioning my approach. I understood the approach they were suggesting and even explained it to them and why mine was actually superior and closer to real-world implementations for the specific problem presented. I tried my best to educate, and when it was clear that they just weren't going to get there I tried to power through and get my implementation in at least pseudocode hoping that either someone else would review it or the interviewer would research offline and get there eventually. That didn't happen and I was rejected. I reached out to the HM but their hands were tied by policy so I was screwed.

nifthvr,"Switching is worth it if you can show real ops skills and you’re fine with on-call; do it via internal projects and a tight home lab.Pick one cloud (AWS is safest). Containerize a small Java service, push to ECR, deploy to ECS Fargate or EKS. Provision with Terraform (VPC, IAM, RDS), wire CI/CD with GitHub Actions, add canary/blue‑green, alerts in CloudWatch/Prometheus, and cost alarms. Practice runbooks, rollbacks, backup/restore, and least‑privilege IAM. At work, volunteer to own the pipeline, infra modules, or a lift‑and‑shift of a legacy service; that experience counts more than certs, but AWS SAA then Developer or DevOps Pro will help you get callbacks.Day to day is less feature coding and more incidents, reliability, and cost/security reviews. Market’s decent for platform/SRE, but entry is noisy; real deployments and on-call stories beat toy labs.

nhyskab,"If you’re just starting, I’d say begin with data analysis. It’s one of the easiest entry points into tech because it builds directly on what you already know with organizing data, spotting trends, and presenting insights. You can start by learning tools like Excel (advanced level), SQL, and Power BI or Tableau. Once you’re comfortable, you can move to Python and basic statistics. Yes, data analysis includes some stats, but you don’t need to be a math genius. You just need to understand basic ideas like averages, percentages, and trends.For courses, check out Google Data Analytics on Coursera, IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, or freeCodeCamp’s Python and SQL tutorials. They're beginner friendly and look great on a resume.
