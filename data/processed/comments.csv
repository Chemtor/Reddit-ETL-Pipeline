Yet, none of them really solve the core data issues like nulls, duplicates, redundancy and many more. The simple and old school style of sql, bash scripts and crontab jobs can do much more than fancy tools. It makes feel like we all should go back to roots using pure sql for most part for pipelines processing and maybe little bit of Python here and there.

What that means is that it can actually connect to a in memory pandas or polars dataframe and run queries on it as if the df was a table and it can write the results back to pandas df.

I knew I needed a repo for the IaC (AWS and Snowflake), pipelines (Meltano plus custom code pipelines), data models (dbt), orchestration (airflow), and some custom applications, I had different people working in different areas, and we didn't have a lot of time to agree on best practices for collaborative development - instead, I chose to have one, max two people work in each area (and thus repo), and we did ship fast. We were less dependent on each other, and if something blew up on our face, the repo separation contained the blast radius.At the same time, we actually had some monorepo happening too. For the sake of fast shipping we opted to use Meltano to run Airflow and dbt. This meant those three ran off a monorepo, and it was indeed good at moving fast, but it also hit a scaling wall within 6 months of going production, since airflow had to run with only a single worker in this mode. We took Airflow and dbt out of the repo and into their own, and man, we paid a bit of a price - but it was worth the initial velocity.Looking back, it's almost like making the Conway's law work for you: we had a poor, immature organization communication structure in the data engineering team, so mirror that structure in multiple repos. If your team is collocated and cohesive, go reap the benefits of a monorepo. In this world of AI-augmented coding where context is everything, having a monorepo seems to enable that well: our dbt repo is monorepo, and it has such a rich context that many people in the company write analytic queries in Cursor with that repo open.",figshot,2025-08-08 23:53:00,2,dataengineering,t3_1ml6i3p,False,

Actual data is written to data pages. So EXPANING the length, should not cause a full page rewrite of a given page, since nothing needs to get rewritten. Already existing page splits, are not effected either, its already a pointer to another page.So, it should be rather harmless, to change the variable length, as long as it gets increased. Decreasing the length, I'd be a bit more careful, but should functionally behave the same. Not having a clustered index... it should not affect that change, since if I know how mssql works internally, it will check every row, if it complies with ""new column meta data"", so a full read trough of the entire table. It doesn't matter in reality, if that table is a heap or a clustered index for a full scan.I'd say, plan for a couple of minutes of outage, and go for it. Take a full backup to a testing stage, run the change, to get a good idea of how long you got an outage. You will have a short outage, since you will have a full table lock, and any application trying to write to the table, will wait for that lock to be released.

Skip putting a lot of time into specific tools. If you want to ""learn Airflow"", you're much better off understanding orchestration and building something with some kind of orchestration in it. This is the equivalent of building a table instead of learning how to use a hammer. If you can understand common problems and patterns with orchestration, all orchestrators have tons of overlap. On the flip side, Airflow will have features not in ADF which may, or may not have features listed in \[insert name of wanky orchestrator here\].Build projects and ignore everybody who says they don't matter because projects are a lot more about getting you in the right mindset and having something to talk about during the interview.Get off the internet and write code.

n7ib8sb,"I really fall into the camp that DE isn't really an entry level position. Not everyone sees it this way. You are doing a Masters in CS - honestly you can pick up a lot of good skills towards DE by working first as a software engineer and working around data systems. People tend to get into DE either down a software engineering route and specialising in software or as a data analyst/scientist transitioning into more pipeline and modelling work.The main obstacle I see to a new entrant into DE is just the breadth of technologies and tools out there, for mid level roles we can find candidates who have worked on our tech stack and junior jobs are incredibly competitive as its a hot job title right now. We are in the middle of hiring a DE and we had over 250 applications for one open position. I've been doing DE for just over 3 years, after 5 years as a software eng after doing a PhD in Engineering. To answer your questions:How early to start applying? If you are doing something super data based then maybe a year or two after starting your first position. This would allow you to get in and really get to know a specific database and understand how to operate in a development environment. If you're also doing personal development and learning on what you're interested in then it could work.Are certs worth it? I believe they can be useful for getting your baseline but they aren't something I have chased. I would very much do it on a case by case basis. If you start at an employer they might require you to get certain certifications and they would pay for them.What helped the most? I joined a team which was pretty small, mostly focused around data science. My programming skills were really solid but my database skills were not great. I was able to learn enough database work to get through the door and focused my effort on using software experience to really push standards in the team and improve confidence.What would I not waste time on? I don't know. I don't think doing the PhD was the best use of my time but I can't go back and change that so I'm happy enough with the result. DE wise, as I've specialised into data I already had a solid foundation.

n6xog97,"ETL vs ELT is a form of shorthand.Rather than neatly dividing data processing into two types; it encourages you to think about the steps.Extraction, is typically ""given"". You're generally bound by the transfer rates of the source and they provide the data in whatever format they choose. It's always going to come first.Loading, is a more variable step. You're still bound by the properties of the target storage. But since you choose what you're writing you have some more control of the process.Transformation is extremely variable. You usually have a lot of freedom in deciding how you transform the source data into target data. That includes breaking up the transformation into multiple steps.Moving from ETL to ELT is more about breaking up the T than it is about actually saving it to the end. The actual process is typically more like ET1L1T2L2T3L3...T1 is often limited to very simple transformations; de-duping and some light error checking is common. Then it gets written to disk in ""raw form"". We keep this work light so it can be fast and reliable. Since real systems have errors, we want to keep this simple so we minimize the chance of dropping data.T2 typically cleans the data. That typically takes more work since we're looking at the data more carefully and changing it more. We then write that to disk too since there are many different things we might do next.T3+ are typically curation steps that answer specific business questions. They can be very expensive to calculate (there are often dozens of JOINS going many layers deep) and they often drop data (often for speed or security) so we want to keep those older versions too. These final versions also get stored so the business users can access them quickly.None of this makes much sense in small systems. They're techniques that are used in ""big data"". I would practice the basic tools (SQL, Spark, Python, etc) and supplement that by reading case studies on data deployments.

You have some DAG running hourly and some running daily. Do you rerefresh the client id DAG on each run ?

Either meet with a department head or manager who wants something done, or meet with an individual who's been asking for something to be fixed for months.

If you're very strong in all aspects of SQL (Joins, CTE's, order of execution, etc), then you're solid for a DE role. Now focus on data modeling which is very hard skill to get good at even after years of experience and many fail interviews even at senior levels, it's unfortunate truth but it is what it is. Take some Udemy courses, watch YT videos on dimensional modeling. There are plenty of free project YT videos on building pipelines. Since you're good with Oracle, start there for a valid certificate that you think can relate to DE role, even a data or solution architect certificate would be good on resume but experience always precedes certificates. Learn distributed compute and storage (Snowflake, Databricks), one is fine. Databricks has uphill learning curve compare to snowflake. Pickup little bit of cloud (AWS or Azure), one is fine since the concepts can be applied across.

n7g9nd3,"A ""data perspective"" btw - another guy wrote about the messaging part, also valid.SCD is slowly changing dimension, and there are type 1, 2 & 3 - then hybrid variations depending on how old the design was.In modern times, we simply use SCD2 or SCD Type 2, which is row-based tracking of the business key - what makes a row unique and never changes, and tracking changes to the data portion, what does change over time.A good example is a credit score, ship to address, customer address.Some ERP systems have SCD2 tables labeled as \_HIST or \_History, but for DW purposes, we break down information from top-down, then bottom-up, then build what is missing in the middle as layers of transformations.So if you tie sales to geography and your customers are the general public, they move a lot, so you need to track at-that-point-in-time where they lived. A transformation would be calculating longitude & latitude for that address, that the X & Y coordinates don't exist in the source system.So the world of DW is easily a year full-time university course, of course lots of courses online too.So... At least once... A relationship between to tables, inner join or left join. In DW world you avoid left joins like the plague, unknown data will actually have a pre-defined value.This is domain / entity specific, like when you specify 1-to-1, 1-to-many, 1-to-0. So at least once would be 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.If you load a product table and a sub-table is color, another is category and sub-category, depending on the (various) sources you can have a product with no color, no category or sub-categ, you must assign a value for the missing data, so that INNER JOIN always works.So you'd have a DIM\_PRODUCT\_CATEGORY with a surrogate key and business value 'UNKNOWN' or 'NOT DEFINED' even though in the source system that category doesn't exist.You have to remember that DWs are report orientated and tools like PowerBI and the analysts using them will not appreciate having to render NULLs and won't be happy with missing sales numbers.",SirGreybush,2025-08-07 17:18:14,3,dataengineering,t1_n7g2iif,False,

You may find yourself really enjoying the work AND the company. In this case you'd want to make sure you're building relationships there and ask about a potential conversion to FTE after graduation, or at the very least an extension on your internship.If you find yourself enjoying data-related work but don't necessarily see yourself staying with the company, you'll want to start researching about different data-related roles (Data Engineer, DBA, BI/Analytics Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.) and continue building applicable skills.

If you are solid in DSA and coding fundamentals, even if you don't know the quicksort algorithm, you will probably be able to look at it and realize that allocating a bunch of new memory each recursive iteration is very inefficient. Almost all sorting algorithms implementations are done in place since speed is very important.That said I think AI has huge potential value in acting as a teacher and mentor if prompted the right way. My recommendation would be to turn off copilot, don't use cursor or any codegen, and prompt it to not give any code examples. A prompt like 'I want to study binary search as if I'm reading a textbook, from first principles and with theory, without many real code samples, in order to learn it through and through. Be as verbose and long form as possible' . The output of that prompt is actually pretty good stuff, it was trained on textbooks so get that level of information from it like you're taking a class on it.A soft skill I would add to that is to learn how to learn. Ask probing questions. Seek to understand at a deep and innate level. Ask for explanations in different ways and analogies that help you understand better. It should be difficult and hurt your brain when you're learning and growing. You don't build muscle without pushing the limits of your body, and its the same with your brain.

If you were to re-write this, I would phrase it as a question, and not assume you know more about how to teach students than the CS Department of your University. It's good to be curious, it's good to question things, but remember they've likely been doing this a lot longer, and they likely have an answer as to why they choose XYZ first. I have a few thoughts for why they might teach Syntax first. **Easy Victories lead to greater motivation -** Almost invariably, everyone's first program is 'Hello World'. This is a very easy first step that teaches you some basic syntax, the basics of how your IDE work, and the basics of runtime/compiling. If your code doesn't compile, you have a syntax error, that's likely your first bug! And it's easy to solve. This will quickly become trivially easy, but you had to learn it at some point, and if you can see that the basics of coding is no harder than installing a few programs and writing a sentence with good grammar, that might be enough to get a few students who were on the fence to stay in the game. **Most people learn what to do, and then how to do it, then why you do it -** You likely don't have kids, but my daughter is learning to walk and talk right now. She knows 'danger hot' and that the trash cans & toilets are 'Ew'. As she gets older we'll start filling in the gaps of why these things are dangerous & yucky, but it doesn't do us a whole lot of good to tell a one and a half year old about germs because even if she could learn the word, she doesn't know what it means.Bringing this concept back to programming, One of the first apps taught outside of CS degrees is building an API with CRUD operations. The REST routing concepts are pretty much set in stone at this point, and don't require a lot of creativity, so it's pretty easy to give newbies a tutorial and help them through the concepts as they work up the project. **Yes this is eventually going to cause a learning plateau -** So yes when you get into algorithmic thinking, assignment operators, functions that pass a value, etc. you're going to hit a wall. This is not easy stuff and you are going to struggle with this as you rewire your brain.

n761xf8,"One of the reasons Python is more difficult for you is that a lot of things are built into the syntax of the language that would be function calls in C++. Also, since Python is not typed, it's a ""layer"" above C++. You sort of have to imagine what is contained in each object without seeing it written in the source file you are working on.The best way to approach Python is to realize that every identifier is actually a pointer. The type of object it points to is the last thing assigned to it.Once you get used to it, you will find it really natural. Python has very regular syntax which will start to make sense with some additional effort.",Majestic-Finger3131,2025-08-06 03:16:34,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mismzw,False,
n78rvhh,"I actually think that this highlights a fundamental tension around Python that lots of people either don't recognize, or don't engage with.On the one hand: Python is a great language for teaching, for a couple of reasons. The whitespace handling enforces good practices, the simple syntax is really great, the robust libraries available make it easy to not-worry-about parts of the code that aren't the focus of the current lesson.On the other hand: Python is a great language for Getting Shit Done, because generally speaking people are in agreement about what's ""the Pythonic approach"" to a problem. Lots of libraries already exist, and also, most of them have easy-to-pick-up interfaces because they're generally developed ""Pythonically"".Now - when you're learning ""programming"", you're learning several things at once: the fundamentals of programming (data structures, algorithms, what a variable is), and also a specific programming language (do statements end in a semicolon? how do I import something from another file?), and also a particular development context (how should my project be structured? How do I invoke build tools?).**Python is very good at simplifying some of this**. The ""learning a specific programming language"" part of it is pretty simple, and the development context is easily simplifiable (it can get complicated in real-life deployment situations, needing to navigate pyenv etc - but that's not anything a beginner needs to worry about in order to get started).**The tension is this:** Because Python has an active community of senior developers, who have coalesced on specific ways of working (canonized and blessed particular by the BDFL), there are some corners of Python that don't feel right if you've been exposed to other kinds of programming - some of which might actually be ""harder"" than the level of abstraction that Python works at!For a long time, this manifested for me as: *every time I try to learn Python, I pick a simple project and implement it - but feel like I haven't gained any knowledge about the language*. It was like it was too easy - like there was so little friction that nothing stuck in my brain.What made it click for me was to fully synthesize the idea that ""programming Pythonically"" is a distinct skill, and that ""knowing how to program"" *in general* was helpful for it but by no means sufficient for it. Similar to learning piano after learning guitar - there are definitely some conceptual overlaps and transferable skills, but some things that ""should be"" easy are suddenly hard, and other things that ""should be"" hard feel weirdly easy.",autophage,2025-08-06 15:04:40,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mismzw,False,

n761ae2,"So when you move from C-like languages to Python you have to avoid ""thinking in C."" It is kinda hard to explain but every language has a ""mental model"" you have to adhere to. If you use a ""mental model"" that is incompatible with your current language, it creates a sort of mental fog and you will get stuck. I can tell you have a C model because you used words like ""iterate"" and ""insert."" I know Python programmers use them too but these words don't mean quite the same thing as what you have in mind. The mental model for C is ""memory"" like little pieces of boxes of data that you manipulate. This data has an address and a type. Variables in C are really pointers (of specific type) pointing at memory boxes. The mental model for Python is more complicated because it has multiple fundamental types. I will just use colloquial naem since a lot of higher languages all share these types. They are scalar, array/vector, hash-table/named-array, and pair/dict. Note they are not interchangeable. When you program them you have to keep track of which type you are dealing with. This may seem trivial but it is a big difference especially with the issue you have. You see, an array in Python is not the same as an array in C. An array in Python is ***a type of object*** while in C it is just ***an array (a continuous line) of memory boxes.***This means you cannot think of insert as ***iterating*** to the right spot of the memory and ***insert a box*** and move the rest of the box over to the right (assuming going from left to right). In object oriented languages like Python, you just simply use the object's method to insert. Doing it any other way is just creating trouble for yourself. In some sense this gives Python its ease of use but it also creates a strange weakness. Python programmers often have trouble adjusting to lower level languages like C. It is your problem in reverse, except it is a lot harder to overcome. I do not understand it completely but I feel it is like learning a manual clutch car versus automatic. It is easy to learn automatics because you do not need to understand much to start much. On the other hand, you need to understand the gear boxes to have that mental picture of the gear switching process when you drive to feel the gears switching into the right positions to get it. If you are already accustomed to something easy why would you ever bother and want to struggle with something hard. You will just quit. So, congrats for learning a C based language first.e: a big weakness of higher level languages, most but not all, is that you cannot create new fundamental types. You might be asking what other types could there be? A lot actually, pretty much everything you find in the standard C/C++ library.",kcl97,2025-08-06 03:12:25,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mismzw,False,

Focus on having a problem, analyzing the problem, breaking it down into smaller and smaller parts, then solve each of the parts individually and finally implement the solutions in code.I totally side with people saying that building stuff is the key as that is how entire generations of programmers learnt to program, even before the internet with its countless tutorials existed. Yet, only trying to implement already existing solutions is not the best way to get there.My recommendation would be that if you see an interesting project somewhere try to replicate it *without* looking at the code first. This is the real way to learn. Figure out how things work. Try things. Experiment. Fail. Fix. Succeed.Do not be afraid of failure. Every failure is teaching you something. It is gained experience.

No one here can tell you if your approach is good FOR YOU.In principle, your approach seems not bad. You should keep in mind as you go through these exercises that no matter how many repositories you comb through, you will only ever be touching the tip of the iceberg. The world of software development has more ways of doing absolutely everything than you can shake your fist at, and you will never become an expert by just looking at other people's work.I suggest as you go through these exercises, instead of trying to rebuild the same thing you just observed from scratch, establish a cadence of identifying problems that can be solved or improvements that can be made with code. While reviewing repositories, take notes. Then, when using the concepts you discovered in these repositories in your own solutions, do not allow yourself to look at the repositories at all. Instead, look at your notes.And remember as you go through this that it is not recreating other people's solutions that makes a great developer. I understand you're just trying to get started, and that's fine. But be aware that at some point you will want to detach completely from the example repositories and make an effort to implement a novel idea without any example to guide you. Programmer talent really shines when you find a gap and fix it. And the best developers are the ones who can think outside the box and identify solutions where one is not readily available.

n72ludf,"Guided projects or starting simple makes far more sense. You want to learn the skill of WHY you're coding something, not HOW to code. How to code comes out of having a need that prevents you from attaining or achieving something that you want. Figure out the why, and the how will come with experience. With your approach, you don't know why code is written in a certain way, or why code is written at all in a project to some extent. It's a lot easier to learn when you know what the end objective is, and what success looks like. It's a measurable, achievable milestone, rather than aiming at some amorphous end point that isn't anchored to the amount of experience and know-how you have.An analogy; if you play chess for the first time, you may think that a good approach to play is to just capture as many pieces as possible. Unfortunately, chess isn't so simple. An 1800 ELO player is going to make moves that a 400 ELO player simply cannot even begin to understand the justification for, even if they understand the how, which was simply to move a piece legally. So you might be able to go into a mature code base that people acknowledge as being well-written. But you have no idea why it was written in that way, the intentions, the problems faced, the historical context. And if you can't figure out the why, then I might as well hire an LLM over you, because they at least know the HOW even better than a human, even if they have no idea WHY they're writing code in a certain way for a certain purpose.",HotDribblingDewDew,2025-08-05 15:50:19,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mia1yc,False,

There could be all sorts of fuckery going on under the hood, things held together with spit and a prayer, and the next time the program gets updated, the author's best choice is to just start over from scratch - this happens a LOT in the real world.So unless you're at the level of being able to determine if their code is good or bad (in which case reading their code is probably going to be pointless), copy the program by using it, learning it, and then recreating it - but better, of course.

This will give you a solid baseline to work from. I suggested Python, because you mentioned *Godot* for Game Dev and Python is closest to GDScript (which is basically a specialized Python).The fundamental data types are easily explained:+ *boolean* - a ""yes/no"", ""true/false"", ""on/off"" value+ *int* - a whole number+ *float* - a decimal number---*Class* is a bit more difficult: it is a scheme, a blueprint for data (fields) together with behavior (methods) - it is a generic description of what can be stored and done with something. Think of e.g. a *Poker Card*+ it has a *suit*+ it has a *rank*+ it may have a *numeric value* (mostly for sorting, or similar, or for a point value)+ it has a *face* (image)+ it has a *backside* (image)+ it can be *face up* or *face down* (which decides what the card will report when asked) all the above are *data* - they are *fields*, *attributes*. Then, there is *behavior*, the *methods* - for a Poker Card these are fairly simple: + It can report its rank (provided that it is face up) + It can report its suit (provided that it is face up) + it can be *flipped* (toggled between face up and face down) + it can *draw* itself Now, you have a *concept* of a *Poker Card* - a full description of the data and behavior - this is a *class*.As such, this doesn't say anything about a *specific* card yet. That's where *objects* come into play - they are the *concrete* implementations, like the ""Queen of Hearts"", the ""Ace of Spades"", etc. Each card in a Poker Deck is a concrete *object*, an *instance* of our *Card* class, of our *blueprint*.----When to use what is a different story. This comes with practical experience. The more programs you write, the better you will understand what to use when.Note that in my description I did not (apart from ""class"" and ""object"", ""boolean"", ""int"", ""float"") use *any* programming language specific terminology as these *concepts* are common to most programming languages.Exactly here is where good *courses* (like the aforementioned course), not just *tutorials*, shine. They explain everything from the ground up and give you ample practical exercises so that *you* have to do the work and understand the subjects.You will need to sit down and start from zero with a proper course. That's the way to go.Most of the tutorials around assume some pre-existing knowledge or fall short on explaining the fundamentals.",aqua_regis,2025-08-04 08:29:49,9,learnprogramming,t3_1mh797b,False,

Its the standard reply I've seen when people ask ""how do I learn"" and other people respond ""just learn by doing projects from documentation and tutorials and such""Personally, I think that's incredibly stupid. It is migraine inducing cuz you're just flailing about randomly, and your foundations will be non-existent cuz your learning methodology involves ""monkey try thing, monkey see if thing work or not work, but either way monkey not know why thing work or not work"".Find a long detailed tutorial which suits your tastes that covers the fundamentals. The typical data-types (float vs double vs array vs list vs dict vs Godzilla's ballsack), the typical loops and the differences between them (while do vs do while, for vs while), indexing (most programming languages have 0 indexing), etc.It may not be as sexy, and where Joe schmoe has a fully fledged game you may only have theoretical knowledge, but the difference is when you design a game, you will actually know how & why it works and you'll be able to account for why you chose a double instead of an integer and why you needed to use X instead of Y.Personally I liked this tutorial [https://youtu.be/\_uQrJ0TkZlc](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc) when I was beginning, but feel free to find one which suits your tastes.

Github is basically just a place where people can upload code to the internet, but taking advantage of git it allows members of a group to work on different parts of the same code in a structured way. The idea is this: you first set up a base project with a main ""branch"". Each user can then branch off of the main branch, essentially making a copy of the code in the main branch, that they can edit on their computer. When one person has made good progress on some feature or part of the code, they can then ""merge"" their code into the main branch. The other users can then ""pull"" that code while working on their branches to make sure everything works well together.This is a really high level description that misses some of the main features of git, but it's definitely the tool you want to be using for this sort of thing.As for designing a game, as with any moderately sized project, the MOST, and I mean MOST, important part is planning. Don't just have each person writing their own bit of code without knowing how the pieces will connect. Literally draw diagrams on paper detailing how different classes will interact, what functions each class will implement, etc. before diving into the code.

n7svd34,"Short answer: Yes, but first get an IDE like VS Code set up, learn the basics of navigating a terminal, and then watch the Harvard video AND FOLLOW ALONG. (You can find tutorials for all of that in this sub's FAQ.) Watching is not the same as coding, and you will get a lot more if you are following along while you watch.Longer Answer:Coding is not 'Learn one language and fight about why yours is better for the rest of time'. There's a very good chance you're going to learn 3+ languages at a basic level and a couple dozen technologies including an IDE or two, as well as multiple frameworks & runtimes over your career. As a Junior, you probably won't get a job unless you can navigate a terminal, use a debugger, write unit tests, do error handling, test APIs through something like Postman, manage an environment through NPM or Docker or the like. Honestly there's probably three things I'm forgetting.I've watched the Harvard video and the professor is very good. He makes the class easy and fun. But he's also fast, he assumes his students are Ivy League level and have read the source materials, so he may lose you if you aren't pausing regularly and checking documentation and course materials.As for Python or C++; if this is pre-university, I think Python is PERFECT for you. It'll be much easier and it will set you up well to learn another language and follow along better at Uni. You'll have plenty of time to switch languages over the next four years. Keep in mind C++ may not even be the language your game will be built in. C++ would be for something like Unreal Engine, while C# would be for Unity, and Minecraft was originally in Java. So it's not like you can make any game ever with C++, well you could, but it's not necessarily the best choice.And yes as others have said, make sure you're WRITING code, not just watching videos.",JanitorOPplznerf,2025-08-09 16:52:18,9,learnprogramming,t3_1mltl8b,False,

n7tsz6t,"I think whether Codefinity is worth it really depends on your starting point and learning style. I took Codefinity after dabbling in Python on free platforms like freeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials, and for me, the biggest value was its structured, hands-on approach. A lot of online courses dump all the theory up front, but Codefinity mixes in small, interactive projects from the start, which kept me engaged and actually helped me remember the concepts better.One thing I noticed compared to something like CS50 is that Codefinity feels more guided and less overwhelming. CS50 is amazing, but it can be intense for beginners because it covers a lot of computer science theory. Codefinity, on the other hand, is more focused on practical Python skills — working with data, building mini-apps, and slowly introducing libraries like Pandas or NumPy in context.It’s true some lessons can feel repetitive if you already know the basics, but for absolute beginners, that repetition actually builds confidence. The quizzes and small coding tasks at the end of each section made it easier for me to track progress. I also liked that they emphasize applying what you learn — I built a simple web scraper and a basic text-based game during the course, which were huge confidence boosters.Price-wise, it’s not the cheapest, but if you compare it to some coding bootcamps or other subscription-based platforms, it’s reasonable — especially if you grab a discount. The key is to actually follow through; no course is “worth it” if you just skim it.If your goal is to move from understanding Python syntax to building your own projects, Codefinity can absolutely help bridge that gap. If you’re already at an intermediate level, you might outgrow it quickly, but you could still benefit from its more advanced project modules.For me, pairing Codefinity with side projects (like Raspberry Pi experiments in robotics) made it much more valuable. If anyone’s wondering “Is Codefinity legit?” — I’d say yes, it’s a solid, beginner-friendly platform for learning Python in a structured, project-focused way.",potty__mouth,2025-08-09 19:57:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mlmu16,False,

The lessons are laid out in a way that makes them easy to follow, and the gradual progression from basic concepts to small projects helped me feel more comfortable applying what I learned. I appreciated how each topic had examples that connected to real use cases instead of staying purely theoretical. Some sections did feel slow, especially if you already know the basics, but I think that pace works well for reinforcing ideas. For me, it helped to go over familiar topics because it meant I didn’t have to constantly look things up when working on my own projects. The mini projects were one of the highlights since they gave a sense of accomplishment without being overwhelming. They also made it easier to remember concepts because I could connect them to something I had actually built. I wouldn’t say Codefinity is perfect the interface is simple and the pace might be too slow for advanced learners but for someone who wants structure and consistent practice, it’s effective.

n7ebxgi,"There's a common misconception among those new to the software industry that all code is brand new. Most code is legacy code, that is, code that's been around a while, maybe years and years, and you're fixing bugs or adding features. It's rare for a company to ditch their code, find the next new language, and rewrite the entire codebase. One big reason is lack of documentation.I worked on software where the customer would want various features added. It had grown over the nearly two decades it existed until no one really knew the full extent of what the code did because, surprise, surprise, it was never documented. But even if it was, rewriting is only nice for the programmer. The end user generally doesn't see much. Rewrites often introduce bugs and leaves out key features because the developers never knew what all the features were.This is why certain languages hang around. Many newcomers think the industry is quick to jump on languages like Rust and abandon Java, but it's not just the language, it's the massive amount of code that runs and works. More than that, it's the data. If you switch platforms, is your legacy data compatible with the kind of data the new platform expects? In electrical engineering terms, this is called an *impedance mismatch* (which causes inefficiencies in power flow).For PHP, what I heard was it was easy to write, but hard to maintain. That is, people wrote bad code. It was blamed on PHP, more than the coders. It also came when the web was young, so there were still chances for other web frameworks. I'd say the 2010s were the era of these web frameworks. React, for whatever reason, won out over Angular. Vue and Svelte came later, but when a community heads to one framework/library, it creates a critical mass which forces others to join.For example, most web devs need to know Javascript. They could use Dart, but Javascript seems more essential, and so Dart (other than through Flutter) didn't come to replace Javascript.Often, there aren't exactly technical advantages. For example, most people agree Python is a pretty slow language. Despite that, it's become the language used in numerical methods, data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and AI. How did it do that? The main attraction was its simplicity (ish). But also, it allowed for code written in C to look like Python functions. If it were written in native Python, it would be very slow, but because it was optimized in C, a compiled language, these libraries run fast.Python has a huge set of libraries that do all sorts of things. After Java, Python may be the second most popular language taught in US colleges. It's become the language to use for AI coding, so everyone jumps on that bandwagon.But, it could have been Ruby. It could have been Clojure. It could have been a brand new language (unlikely).

You gotta learn C# for unity.Go to youtube and type something like: ""C# full course"". You'll get tons of lengthy courses. Pick one and start. Initially, you're gonna learn the following basics which are important:1. Variables & Data Types2. Input / Output3. Conditional Statements (If-else & switch) 3.1. Logical & Arithmetic Operators4. Loops5. Arrays / Advanced Data Types (Dictionary, etc.)6. Functions & Function Concepts (Overloading, etc.)7. OOPAbove concepts are pretty much language-agnostic i.e. you can apply the same concepts to other languages depending on their syntax. What you'll be trynna learn at this stage is logical building, and not just programming. After you've learned till ""2"", try making a program that prompts the user to enter their name, and print that with a sort of ""Hello, . How are you?"" message. Make small programs like that after each point. While you're learning coding, you can look into game asset development depending on if you wanna build 3D or 2D games or both. Remember that you don't need to learn this initially. There are free marketplaces where you can download assets from. They'd be great to practice and build up familiarity with game dev projects until you wanna release something completely original.After you've learned programming, you can start with unity. Do the same and look up a full course on unity. Generally, you won't learn everything from these courses, but that's not the point. The point is you'll learn everything you need to make a game. After that, you gotta keep working on projects. Your ambitions will eventually lead you into learning lots of new stuff.Since you mentioned college, I'll drop some advice for when you're there as well. However, before getting into college, you need to be consistent. Do something every day even if its small. It's not about taking big steps, it's about taking several small ones. This will help you in college as well.If you're adept at making games by the time you get into college. Start applying for internships in your 1st year.

If you live in a 3rd world country, don't let your grades dip below 3.7 for 4-scale. Trust me, scholarships are competitive if you wanna get out of your country. Try getting a part-time job in game dev, so it counts towards your experience. Different universities have different rules, so you gotta look into it if they allow part-time or full-time work. Also, before you graduate, have multiple offers or jobs lined up for yourself.P.S: If you want any motivation or clarity on the programming part, don't hesitate to DM me. All of this advice comes from a place of experience through suffering, so I understand it can get pretty difficult. If you love this, hang in there and don't give up.

Companies are expecting a lot more experience now than before. The self learning path is still possible, but doing it while having a child and needing to work another job while learning?

Now, if you are really really interested in it and not just doing it for the money then I would still say without a doubt go for it.

I learned through codecademy for basics then in my sales role out of college I built a tool for myself to automate some of my role. That became surprisingly successful despite being simple as hell (literally my first project ever). It was just a webscraper with beautiful soup 4. My point is more so that the problem here is about hiring and understanding the market data. If you study it in depth (this is actually my educational background ie HR) yes there are less jobs and that has directly led to waaaaaaaay more applicants per posting which means a waaaaay smaller chance of your resume ever being seen by a human and its ultimately just making it clear how awful the entire hiring process always has been ... imo the worst process in the world by far and so companies are often relying on referrals from employees as they tend to work better given that the employees can typically be more trustworthy than a resume and team cohesion and ability to get along with the team is one of the most important things any typical hiring manager is gonna care about (not saying that this should be the case). So why i bring up my case is that getting a job is just sales and referrals are a great way to do sales. If they know you and like you they will hire you. Especially at places that aren't truly NASA or OpenAI or FAANG. I personally feel that most job advice in this subreddit feels like its skewed towards those companies because they did truly use to hire 1000s of juniors but there's still millions of 20-50 person companies in non tech intensive industries that cant tell good from bad skill level to begin with and are hiring.I'll also add that no one told me about the functional programming job route and how surprisingly little competition there is for some of these companies. While some typical job postings will have over 1000 applicants these functional jobs will have less than 50 and even then its not hard to beat out the other 50 Lastly the other nuance to share here is that alllll industries right now to the best of my knowledge are crap for hiring.

Often at the beginning it's not clear what should be spelled out explicitly, vs what's built into the OS, vs what's built into the language, vs what you should import a package for. You'll build familiarity and comfort with this over time. For example, I used to TA an operating system lab where everything was written in C. It was PAINFUL for most students to internalize that all file IO would be handled by system calls, or that the computer knows what folder it should be referring to by referencing the file system relative to the folder the console or executable was launched from. This is, in some sense, the point of hello world. ""Oh wow, I wrote 4 lines of code and computer somehow knew to interface with my keyboard and monitor (not to mention the hardware of the computer itself). How is that even possible?"" If you spend long enough writing code, you will internalize the reasons why this is possible in a way that will have made it seem obvious in retrospect. But it wasn't, and it isn't, and you could spend an arbitrary amount of time learning more details if you really wanted to. Your goal for now should at least be to get to the point where you build up an expectation for what will be abstracted away for you and what you need to explicitly write into your code.You also mentioned some discomfort with dictionaries.

With time, as you do this repeatedly, more things tend to stick in memory.Personally, context switching is something I regularly talk with my manager about (I mostly prefer working with only one project at a time, but there are usually 2-3 projects active during a week; I try to focus the work on separate days). Getting questions about different projects also requires some context switching and disrupts the ""flow."" I try to keep a ""developer diary"" about what I have been working on each day; it helps me to quickly remember what I was working on previously when I need to switch between projects (it's really helpful to read on Monday mornings and before going to different meetings).",joranstark018,2025-08-06 06:29:34,3,learnprogramming,t3_1miwj9e,False,

n7acxlr,"Let's start by noting that not everyone understands the language of a problem description. Sometimes, things written in English still require translation into their native language. This is the first thing you can try.Then you can try solving the problem from two perspectives. Let's call them top-down and bottom-up.When solving from the top, you try to understand the highest layer of the problem, the business layer, from the solution's perspective, and then break it down into smaller problems, abstraction layer by abstraction layer.When solving from the bottom, you usually find some lowest problem to solve that you know you'll have to solve, and you build on it with successive steps upward. Sometimes you can create more such starting points and combine them into a single whole.I think solving from the top is easier and clearer, but I've also met people who solve from the bottom-up and were able to write code effectively.It's also worth trying to find solutions by analogy to already known solutions and the source code written for them. Here, you can use two sources, provided you can describe and connect the dots to the problem. One is the internet and its resources, and the trick is finding similar solutions. The second is looking at the code and finding similar implementations. For example, if you need to create a button with a message, and you already have another one somewhere in your application, you can see how it can be done, and that's a starting point for your own solutions.A final, but quite helpful, step is to write the documentation for the problem or function yourself. Not necessarily for the sake of maintaining it, but to understand the essence, clear your mind, and describe the problem. If you can't describe the problem, it's possible that what you're trying to do is intertwined with something else, insufficiently thought out, known, or documented. An example would be writing the documentation for a function before implementing it. If you can't write it, it's likely that you don't fully understand what you want to do. You might not be trying to implement one function, but two (or more) at once, and the problem isn't broken down into manageable components. Writing documentation, if successful, will force you to clarify what needs to be done, and implementation is then more of a detail.Some solutions also involve trial and error, retrospection, and retry. This happens, and don't be discouraged.

We saw this to varying degrees with VR, 3D screens, blockchain, etc. Dangling the prospect of being able to hire fewer employees and save piles of money to produce the same results had VCs and CEOs rock hard and tossing irresponsible sums of money around, but the use case will settle itself like those other technologies once the high wears off. Yeah, the vibe seems to have shifted. OpenAI is going into optimization mode, where they try to find the correct balance that turns all that spending into a profit margin before the funding dries up.

My go to test is to let ChatGPT generate an image of a sailing catamaran using Dall-E and although the result looks nice at first, the generated image still shows a badly functioning yacht.Things are different when you start using local LLMs. Due to hardware restrictions, my currently best running LLM ist mistral:7b, a downsized version with usable coding knowledge, language support and overall world knowledge. I can use it to improve code and get help when I am looking for what I need to change to achieve a specific behavior (take THAT, CSS!). It is not perfect, but so far it was useful in my work with Angular and NestJS.This is also supported by the availability of systems with a lot of shared memory. Although it is slower than real VRAM, it makes it possible to run larger models on a MacBook or something powered by AMDs Ryzen AI series. A medium sized LLM (20-30 billion parameters) can have very good world knowledge and if it is optimized for a specific purpose (reading documents, helping to code, looking for abnormalities in log files) has the potential to safe a lot of time and work.All that said, the use of LLMs can lead to catastrophic misinterpretations of the data given, so the models have to be tuned to give info on their thought process so you can manage and fine tune them. The way of Google to dumb down search and try to shove down Gemini as the next big thing is an example of what not to do - the results are sometimes funny at best, but can be deadly.

n7sfi04,"I agree with some of your points, but I'll slightly disagree with you on a few things.AI is a factor in the job market, but not what is being pushed. AI isn't replacing entire industries, but companies are so worried about missing out, they are throwing tons of money at it (and likely getting very little return). So, AI is a distraction, but it's drawing lots of investment that could be spent elsewhere like employee salary and investment in non-AI projects. A lot of professional services companies are trying to become AI gurus, because that's what clients are currently looking for. That's part of why I think it's a bubble that has to pop eventually. I've seen lots of non-technical consultants opening up small AI consulting companies, becoming heads of AI practices (mostly sales and management roles), and so many people going nuts on LinkedIn. One or two people who I've worked with in the past, I trust some of what they are posting. Most of the people are just trying to become business world influencers. There are certainly other factors contributing to the poor job market.One thing that feels unique is the current US administration. It seems to be actively trying to destroy the job market. I'll be blunt, I think there are a lot of unqualified people in the current administration, and I'm not sure what their main motivators outside of personal wealth are. They want to lower interest rates. Well, a weak job market will help with that. And they are actively firing thousands of federal employees, killing grants, and all sorts of other actions putting people out of work. But they don't want people to think the job market is weak, because ""Republicans are supposed to be good for the economy."" We'll have to see what long-term impact it has and how long it takes to recover. Other countries are also dealing with inflation, but it feels like the US is dealing with inflation and a bunch of other things. I'm no economist, but I've read a few people argue the tariff policy reminds them of the time before the Great Depression. So, things might get really bad and ""it's different this time."" Or, this is a spot where I can be in the camp that predicted things incorrectly, which has happened plenty of times. I was originally in the camp that the job market would turn around in a year or two in 2022. Thinking back to working during the dotcom bubble, it might have taken 4 years or so for a recovery.

n7sc0pt,"> And now we're at the point where companies are where they need to be employment wise.Then why are they still making layoffs?I don't totally disagree with the point of your post as a whole, but the reason people think this is because this is what companies are telling the world. They're justifying layoffs as cost-cutting due to AI as they don't want to admit they overhired. Pair that with the huge cultural changes affecting large parts of the industry and this is definitely a pivot point for tech, if not totally unprecedented.The more important point is that the number of junior roles in the tech industry has crashed in a way that, historically, it never has, and that specifically may be due to (misplaced) confidence that AI can improve the productivity of mid- and senior-level workers to a degree that means junior employees are no longer necessary.

n72gyzw,"It sounds like you are in front of a fork in the road for your career. Ultimately, you gotta decide what is it that you want to do. I recommend that you don’t prioritize what you love or are passionate about. Obviously it is amazing if you love/are passionate about your career, but that does not give you much flexibility. It’s fine if you don’t stay in CS/SWE, but I think the answer for leaving should be more nuanced than “it’s not my passion”.So to dig into that a bit deeper, why did you get into software development 6 years ago? Have the reasons back then changed? You mentioned that sometimes you wish you never had to look at code again, is there a specific reason why? Are those reasons innate to coding itself or the conditions of your workplace? One way you can test that question is by trying to learn some fundamental computer science theory. TBF this is an assumption, but I strongly suspect your bootcamp set you up to learn programming languages and frameworks and it didn’t teach you the fundamentals and theory of computer science. I think that’s important to learn in order to develop some passion since it makes the field an actual study, not a traded skill.I’ll use history as an example since that was your major. A lot of people don’t like history because they see it as just the practice of accounting of the events that happened in the past. To them, it feels like there’s “history” and there’s “current events” and the two aren’t connected much in their view. But a historian will understand how history is both a representation of the past and current events. They understand how history gives us a critical basis for evaluating human sociology, economics, politics, etc.There’s an analogous experience that a SWE can have with coding and computer science. It’s obviously not going to get nearly into humanities studies like history, but its conceptualizations extend in their own ways in surprising ways.If you read this and think “I really don’t care about any of that and I have no will to invest my time in that”, that’s totally fair and it would give you important feedback for your dilemma. At the end of the day, whether you are passionate about it or not, you gotta have a mind that is curious to explore your professional field. If your mindset is similar to that as a cashier who doesn’t wish to expand their skillset in retail, then you’ll remain stagnant just as a cashier will. It may feel like you shouldn’t be stagnant since you obviously work in a field that requires more skills than being a cashier. But stagnation isn’t about where you are currently. It’s about how you are growing. TL;DR: Try to invest more time in learning CS fundamentals and theory to see if it will give you a new perspective for finding interests in this field. If it doesn’t or you do not want to do that, then you’ll remain stagnant should consider what would you be willing to do that for and how can you make a career with that.",Doub1eVision,2025-08-05 15:27:36,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1mibizp,False,

By the time I had vested 1/4 of my options and could sell anything, the stock price fell 35-40%. And it kept on falling and falling and falling. Layoffs started happening, and by the time my number was called, about 7/8 months later, about 60% of employees had been let go. Stock price was in the toilet. But my strike price was really low, so it was still something. From my several millions on paper, I ended up getting about $75K out of it. Not horrible. That would be worth about $150-160K today. Not life changing money, but enough to put a downpayment on a couple of houses. Which in turn appreciated to where it is life changing money. So indirectly I guess I did get those millions.Once I was laid off, I chilled out for about 2 months, I played a lot of golf.

I’ll warn that to someone with my level of experience it’s obvious that this sub is full of people who are barely into their career, and people who have done very little research into other careers.I can get another job easily even in this economy. It would be hard to get a job that pays as much as my current job does, but I’d still be making at least $180k. There’s very, very few other careers that can say something similar short of becoming a doctor. The reality is that becoming a software engineer is still one of your best options.Breaking into this career is hard. But so is breaking into most careers worth pursuing, and at the end other options will generally offer lower rewards than this one. If you network well, apply seriously and broadly, and do proper interview prep, eventually you’ll land something. I started out in a QA role that paid me less then my pizza delivery job, now I make nearly $300k.Far too many people in this sub preach about how you have to be passionate about software. That’s bull. The majority of the highly successful engineers I know, I’m talking people making over $300k, are very transparent they are only in it for the money. Passion isn’t a requirement. Being willing to work hard is. If anything the passionate people were the ones who tend to get suckered into longer hours and lower pay.The only career people can even try to compare with the perks of software engineering is the trades, and that’s largely coming from people who don’t know much about the trades and are parroting what they’ve heard. The trades, on average, don’t pay nearly as much as software engineering. There are some exceptions, but even those tend to only pay the level of highly skilled senior software engineers, if we compare them to the exceptions for software engineers then engineering pay still generally blows the trades out of the water.Trade jobs that pay well are also highly competitive, trade jobs are limited to in person job opportunities, they’re incredibly hard on your body, they often require long hours, and they are rampant with sexism such that it’s hardly even a real option for women. Depending on where you live your race might also be a problem for the trades. If it were as easy to make a ton of money in the trades as some people pretend it is then everyone would do it. Yeah things are hard for software engineers now, but things are hard for everyone now. Computer science is still likely the best career for people willing to do the work.

n72rfde,"I’m a software engineer with 19 years work experience. There will always be a need for software engineers as technology progresses. Here are the things you need to know, not immediately but keep them in mind:1. New tech is always coming out, so you have to be comfortable constantly learning. For example, you should absolutely be taking classes about AI, ML, and LLMs in college. 10 years from now, there will be something else. You can’t just sit on knowledge in this field like in other fields, you have to keep learning or you get left behind. 2. Microsoft tech stack isn’t used many places outside of government. Focus on Python and/or Java, as they are the two most popular in the real world. Learn fullstack eventually so you understand how the systems interact. 3. Learn system design. You will learn more about the components in college, the earlier you learn this the better. Hellointerview is really good for this. 4. Obviously DSA is critical. You need to be very comfortable with this. You will learn it in college, but getting started early can’t hurt. Lots of resources online. 5. Learn cloud. Again, Microsoft tech isn’t used much. AWS is king, followed by google cloud. I would recommend learning AWS. You don’t have to be an expert but learn how to use it and what the different parts do. 6. Make a GitHub account and work on projects. Especially anything cloud related and/or AI related. 7. Don’t buy CS books (except school books). Everything you need can be found online, for free. 8. I would recommend taking computer engineering instead of computer science, if you can. It’s half CS and half electrical engineering. You will learn how both the software and hardware work together, and if you decide you like hardware better, you can easily pivot to EE.9. Learn CI/CD fundamentals. Again, you don’t have to be an expert, but understanding how real releases to production work will help you be a more mature software engineer. Be comfortable setting up a build in something like Jenkins or Azure DevOps, for example. 10. Learn version control. Git is by far the most popular. ——Maybe I’ll add more if I think of anything else. But yeah, don’t get discouraged. There are definitely lots of people looking for jobs but it’s a great field and pays very well.

I don’t need to schedule anything. I legit could have gone out Monday but now I was wondering what they wanted to tell me. Completely wasted my day to “be polite”, Amazon if you’re listening call people and leave a message if you want to be polite or send a rejection email with the option to talk to the recruiter. Seriously worst interview process by recruiters I’ve ever seen. It’s like their recruiters are as over worked as the rest of the company.

Basically end to end terrible experience - the study links were nice but the system design links were bad - like those weren’t great answers honestly and in general system design with a mouse is bs. If I ever do system design in the future I’m buying a touch screen laptop or a touch pad. Even the Amazon leadership principals just scream terrible place to work - “Amazon devs are right most of the time”, and some stuff about challenging everything. These are toxic traits IMO.

n7lrdn9,"Having interviewed with them three times, the answer is an unequivocal and resounding **yes**.First, there is little to no communication between recruiters, much less between departments. The first time I interviewed, I got the OA from two different recruiters and the one who had actually reached out had to send the other one an email letting them know I was already working with him. It's absurd that they don't have a system to take care of these issues.Second, they have way too many ""leadership principles,"" and they contradict each other - you can't ""dive deep"" and ""insist on the highest standards"" while also having a ""bias for action."" Their methodology for evaluating them is also extremely flawed, as they ask a question per LP and that is the only data they use to determine how you did. I told a story in one interview about being asked to lead a technical presentation for one of the biggest banks in the world after being with the company 90 days. I then learned (shout out to my recruiter for giving me any feedback) that I scored poorly in ""earns trust."" Yeah, okay.Third, they basically abandon the whole ""data-driven"" methodology with their myopic ""raising the bar"" principle. Who decides how good the ""average Amazonian"" is? Through what process? Twice I was told I was ""at the bar but not raising it."" Another way to say this is that they acknowledged I was better than about half the people there but they will continue to be employed by Amazon but I'm not good enough. Never mind that one of their LPs is ""hire **and develop** the best"" - if you're not one of the best already, you're not ""raising the bar"" and they're not interested.There are some things they do well. They leave the qualifications intentionally vague to cast a wide net, and it's not just for show; they do genuinely give interview opportunities to a lot of engineers (like me) who wouldn't get them from someone like Apple or Netflix. They move quickly compared to other big companies and usually give you a definitive answer within a month of applying.

I used to lose my train of thought mid-sentence all the time, especially around senior folks because I was afriad of sounding ""stupid"" or ""not as smart"".I also realized that I had a habit of speaking very fast a lot of times which led to me losing train of thought and then further using more filler words.

If you feel you are losing track of thought, just slow down, recollect your thoughts and then speak. Most people think you need to keep talking and in such cases use weird filler words which end up sounding less authoritative.Use these documents that I spoke about in the post.

And what i think that kinda means is, forget about work and the requirements of the task for a moment, and just use the app like you would any normal mobile app or like you would visit any website in your leisure time. What things do you notice? Or maybe you aren't thinking about these things when you're browsing the internet because you don't want your experience to feel like work.This is how I got better at form UX and really tightening up my code before review. In my casual use of the internet I come across forms all the time, and i think about how annoying ABC is because its clunky, or why XYZ is so frustrating to use because it doesn't respond how i would expect a modern form should. I take those real human feelings and use that when I code forms. A great real-life example is how annoying government web forms are because if you mess up you have to start over; how dated the UX feels and functions when you have to fill out all your HR paperwork online for a new job.

n7n486w,"First, stop worrying about wasting time. Time invested up-front trying to figure out what you like will unlock a lifetime of enjoyment. Second, feel lost but don’t stay lost. I don’t know a single person who made it anywhere worthwhile who hasn’t felt absolutely and hopelessly lost at some point in their life. But if you sit in your own mess you’ll get nowhere so don’t underestimate the power of starting small to try and figure stuff out.Third, who cares? And I don’t mean this in a condescending way. But more like, so there’s other students who do better, so there’s people ahead of you, so there are millions of calculator apps or whatever, but frankly who cares? Unless you’re trying to become a billionaire with your first app (which is a wild delusion for most folks at some point) your thought process is wrong on this. You need to crawl, then walk, then run. Which means build the things others have made, at least you have guides. Build off of those if you want, I promise you some guy on stack overflow 9 years ago has answers for what you’re stuck on. Personal projects are about learning what you enjoy doing. To that effect who cares what others have done, if you enjoy doing it go for it. I promise doing what you enjoy will push you that 10-20% above based on motivation alone.Fourth, just start. Whatever it is, just start. Internships, coffee chats, mock interviews, career counseling through your college. Just start. Analysis paralysis is very real. The only way past it is to make some decision even if it end up being suboptimal. You need to break the tie.Fifth, discipline. I hate it, most people hate it. But the phrase “hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard” still rings true. Whatever you choose to do, stick through it. If you’re an international student I’m sure that alone comes with a fair amount of discipline. Being thousands of miles away and still doing what you’re supposed to do everyday. It doesn’t matter if you join leadership or be an IC. You need consistency and discipline to see results.Lastly, I’ll say is, while learning to keep going is important, learning when to pivot is even more important. Note I didn’t say quit. Pivoting is just redirecting your energy to what makes more sense for you and your interests. You have limited time and limited energy, you can’t do everything heck even Superman can’t. So you need to learn to prioritize and pivot.For right now, rest assured that 2 years is a drop in the ocean for a potential pivot to a rewarding 40-45 year career. You’re not a lost cause, you’re just young. I promise you everyone is as confused as you are. Just start something small even if everyone has done it and stay out of your head so you can keep marching forwards with whatever pivot you choose in your life.",styada,2025-08-08 18:03:12,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1ml0zcj,False,

I recommend you start trying to think of simple project ideas as you go about your life. You will start to notice little things that are a little annoying and can be simplified, or think ""What if I had a tool to help me do \_\_\_?"" The best projects, imo, are ones that solve an actual problem or serve an actual purpose in your day-to-day life. It shows that you're always thinking about how you can harness CS to improve some pain point, and you take action to do so. You can start off with something really simple, since you're pretty new to the field. Maybe kind of overdone, but a pomodoro timer is an example of a potential project - someone thought, ""I wish there was a way I could time my study sessions to maximize productivity,"" and then took action and coded something up to do it. The more unique and personal this idea is to you, the better. Lastly, something important to note is that you likely won't get all the knowledge you need in your classes.

n80r2of,"You got some morale advice already but concretely speaking, you're on the right track with projects. You do need them. Priority should be internships, however. When you're a freshman it's harder, they mostly go for sophomores and juniors since they're closer to grad and thus return the company's investment quicker.If you're a freshman now, it sets a pretty good schedule for you. If you can't get an internship, which is usually the case, you spend the first year working on projects for the resume, and then use that for internships the next two years, and try to get a return offer after grad from one of those. When you're a sophomore, set yourself a fixed (# of apps) daily goal, even if small, and start.As for the projects themselves, I can't tell you what to make, but I'd started with a website with three.js. It was fun to write thanks to Three, it lightly dabbled in the process of hosting it etc., and it resulted in something permanent online, which imo is more satisfying than a local terminal program unless that serves a real use. Even better if you do something with even a small amount of users, so you can get started on databases.If you want to go more hardware/embedded CS, look into making an RC with as many functional systems you can put into it.

But it made me get to know many people and boomed my enthusiasm, and you really need that.TLDR don't care about my experiences: For your projects I'd recommend trying to solve a real problem but realistically, people usually fail to find something like that, you just need to start with anything to fill the resume and get the habit going.",2016KiaRio,2025-08-10 23:06:03,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,
n80rdo6,"Welcome to an awesome field! I also did C++ in high school xDAs for projects, there are a few things you can do now that you're comfortable with the basics:1. Expand on uni projects, especially those you find interesting. You're already doing them, you can work on them further and put 'em on GitHub.2. Think of whatever CS topic you enjoy or think you might enjoy (gaming, data analysis, web development) and/or real-life topic (history, finance, music, medical) and make something related. Doesn't matter if it's overdone (web shop, library record keeping) or novel, do something you'll like :)3. Don't go too big, you'll burn yourself out.4. On a similar note as 3, don't worry about perfection. Make something perfectable first.5. Use Git with all of your projects (publishable or not), get in the habit of writing good commit messages, and push everything to GitHub (and/or GitLab, if you want). These are greay habits for later. I think only 20% of my repos are public.Don't worry about publishing a project. Play around, take tutorials, make dumb scripts, and write whatever code comes to mind. Maybe some of it will be interesting enough for you to work on it further and take public.You can also try Advent of Code for code challenges similar to what you know (algorithms, data structures), with more flexibility than LeetCode/CodeWars. You can make your solutions public too (not the inputs!).You're very young and have tons of time to find your niche(s), so experiment early and cheaply.Things to keep in mind:- Try learning testing (unit testing especially) early, it's insanely useful and highly required in industry.- As mentioned, use Git with all of your projects.- Don't let LLMs like ChatGPT write for you. Especially this early, your skills will stagnate. This includes BOTH code and regular text (comments, commit messages, README files).- Do use ChatGPT to learn what you don't know, but also read documentation. Both are very useful skills.- Write a Readme for all of your projects (not right away, but over time). Markdown and documentation are both very useful in industry, and for those repositories you make public, READMEs are super important (arguably more so than the code).Don't overwork yourself into early burnout. Work on what you enjoy (and obviously your actual uni work), and if something is good enough, feel free to make it public. But until then, explore as many areas of CS as you can (embedded, low-level, programming language theory, AI (many subfields here), web development (front and back), operations/devops & Cloud (maybe a bit later), desktop applications (like your console apps), etc.).There's no deadline for this, do it in your own time :)",CaporalDxl,2025-08-10 23:07:52,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,

You didn't do bad, its just the unfortunate need to filter down the candidates. And generally that's because interviewing is a costly process for companies. But, it's not always the case that you get filtered out after that call - but generally the sign I look for from the recruiter is they'll go into: telling you about the interview process, and telling you that their scheduling assistant will be emailing you to get your interview availabilityI've had good calls that I just don't understand what might have went wrong, and what I've picked up on is when the recruiter goes into that spiel, then I've def made it to the first technical, I can relax. That wasn't the case when I was interviewing Jan 2023.One thing I adjusted in my phone screen approach with the recuiter is I try not to go into deep or prolonged detail which sorta invites them in and gives space for an actual normal convo. They have your resume in front of them anyway so you dont' need to go deep into it, and in fact, letting them prompt you for that info is good. But other than that, I think you're doing the right preparation - and if anything I don't think this call requires any rehearsed or extensive preparation.

Once you were showing that consistency, you would get the promotion. It is a bit lame from the perspective that you basically have to do the job before you get the title, but it is what I've seen across multiple companies if you get promoted in-place (stay on the same team, take on additional responsibility).I have 18 years of experience with .NET and have no idea what sort of questions they would ask you. The difference in being mid level and a senior feels more to me about working independently, being able to interface with other stakeholders (PM, internal customers, etc.) directly without management being heavily involved, and increasingly taking a lead on defining the technical work items from the business requirements. It is very little about direct coding skill (though obviously you should be at least passable) and more about your ability to see the big picture and make smart decisions.",marsman57,2025-08-06 23:53:13,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mjg2z3,False,
