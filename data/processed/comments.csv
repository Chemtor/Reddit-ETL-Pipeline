I spend 75% of my time writing 1000 line python scripts that are either complex one-off multisystem data pulls or building custom pipelines for merging data from those systems in a deployable way. 10% of my time is spent providing guidance on data systems, admin on our business applications and dev on functions internal to those. 10% is spent doing huge data cleaning jobs (our data is a complete shitshow). And the remaining 5% is basic analyst stuff like dashboards, live reports, and light analysis.

But what I did was took the job description, broke the tasks in the job description down into 'typical role of task' (ie dashboarding and light analysis is typically a data analyst, building and maintaining pipelines via script and platform engineering is data engineer, but more fleshed out than that), I then added in any tasks I do that are not in my job description. I then gave a percentage of my time spent on each domain to illustrate that 90% of my time goes to tasks that are firmly in the domain of a Data Engineer. Fortunately my boss is chill and an advocate and he took that and actually added supporting examples of tasks I have completed that are outside of my job description and is taking it to the C-Suite person he reports to so we can get me a title that reflects my work.

I know it sounds boring but I’ll rather hire a junior which return me a take home test without spelling errors, with a ok code but that’s structure and well explain than someone with awesome code but that’s all over the place that didn’t have description on topics and that did way more than expected.In terms of stack focus on SQL.

n9200po,"Well, best case scenario this is a ""make lemonade out of lemons"" scenario, where you take a bad environment with very few factors in your favor (in terms of growing your skills or actually making some impactful changes), and see what you can make of it. On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).If you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and ""probably"" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary...

Understand basic data quality concepts4. Get familiar with cloud-based distributed computing (e.g., BigQuery)5. Build a simple end-to-end projectThe key is to start small and build incrementally. Don't get overwhelmed by the expanding landscape. I've seen many successful data engineers start with these basics and learn specialized tools on the job.BTW, if you're interested in the analytics side, I write about career paths in data on my Experimentation Career Blog on Substack. It might give you some ideas on how to approach your learning journey.

Moose as an ""ORM"" is one approach (I know of at least one smallish company using it, they seem happy)We've done something ""similar"" at Tinybird (similar in the sense that it's a CH abstraction designed to make it easier to integrate into the application), but our approach is more API-centric. Basically make it dead simple to turn a SQL query into an API, and then integration really becomes a question of how you handle your API routes in your backend code and doesn't really require you to ""think"" about the database.I'm genuinely curious to know how people would compare Moose vs. Tinybird - do people like the ORM approach?

No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, 4.

Bonus is no maintaining connectors or DAGs.Quick q's: How often do schemas actually change in Salesforce for you? And are the PII fields always in fixed locations or could they appear in custom fields too?I work at Estuary, so naturally I'm biased, but it's built exactly for this kind of setup where off-the-shelf tools either fall short on compliance or require too much engineering lift.

However, our account is allocated a very large quota for this.You can setup a new Fivetran replication to Snowflake in 15min as long as you have setup the requisite security in SFDC and in Snowflake.in terms of SLA. Fivetran offers various plans. We use the 'standard' plan and it provides for a 15min sync time. Any lower than that you you need the 'enterprise' plan (I think).Fivetran will not directly help with building SCD Type 2. However, you can do a couple things here: 1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed. 2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).Fivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors). You can control it so that FT will add new columns but not new tables (unless you want that). It also handles cases where column datatypes change (although that can still break downstream etl).

Randomly inserting 500 fields (no joke had 15 columns called custom_param_001, custom_param_002... and it just added columns until 500). I have enough trouble vetting query logic of humans to trust that AI's advanced autocomplete will not present C Suite random sales report numbers. AI does great on structured text modification. Have documentation for a new ERP platform, want to convert it to the datatypes your warehouse supports. Super useful. It's also good at large scale refactoring even in agent mode... 'In this DBT folder introduce a project level variable called 'lookback_days' add a condition to include lookback days in non-prod target environments'... works very well.",FridayPush,2025-08-13 15:27:16,23,dataengineering,t3_1mp757f,False,

This works good enough when users understand that they can ask only things that are relevant to the concrete dataset. Some users trying to ask questions that only, maybe, deus ex machina can answer ever. In general, this function is good for non-experienced users and helps them to build their first reports. For advanced report options it seems a classic UI (report builder) is still more useful and less painful that typing prompts.- Report-specific prompts: when prompt's context is a report data itself (tabular data) and users can ask their own questions to this concrete report. Typical prompts like ""discover insights"" or ""find anomalies"" are available via menu items so this is just a one click and doesn't require any efforts from end users. These predefined prompts may be specific to the concrete dataset or usage of concrete dimensions/measures - for instance, when report uses ""Sales"" values and ""Year"" dimension, admin-configured prompt may compare values according to company's specific analysis.

Notice I didn't mention the LLM yet, we'll circle back to it later.Ok, so you have a few chunks from man pages and pointers to various tools.

That's a middle term between option A and B.Now going back to the LLM call in step one. Why do you need that? You need it to generate good questions, not good answers. The vector store will bring you the answers, but if you only send the last line the user types, it can be something like ""What flags can I use to format the output?"" It's lacking content. The LLM is there to read this, along with all the conversation, and turn it into something like, ""What tool do I use to run health checks, and what flags can I use to format its output?""

With Python, I had complete control of the data via dataframes (rows to skip, columns format, range…) before committing it into a raw/landing schema in Snowflake (using the Snowpark library).For transformations, I used dbt to build the data warehouse.

I used Looker Studio at my previous company (small company and also used AWS RDS just like yours) and it works fine with the MySQL connector but it’s obvious how well integrated the BigQuery connectors are. One way to possibly improve performance on the RDS is to create separate schema for a makeshift data warehouse. Populate this schema once a day using stored procedures from your transactional tables. You can put all the complicated joins and stuff in these stored procedures. Then only connect Looker to this dedicated schema with a simple select * from datawarehouse.cleanTable.

If the business unit you work in brings in more money than it costs, you are a profit centre. There are no second order effects. When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. If your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it’s deemed essential. You’re absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. To reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on.

Jeff probably isn’t a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it’s possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what’s being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he’s not the product. It’s not that he doesn’t matter, but on the books, he doesn’t get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. Transactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent. So when doing financial analysis we can say that one product, while worth the same end sale price, might cost differently when produced in different factories.",waitwuh,2025-08-15 17:32:16,1,dataengineering,t1_n8tizkw,False,

As for the actual scraping, of course the site will try and prevent scraping or overloading of their infrastructure, so try these things (somewhat in order)- fetch and save just the html of the url with curl, curl_cffi, httpx or similar. This could work fine if you stay under any rate limits. You can then extract the text from the html later on. - adjust your user agent and cookies, for example by copying the request headers from an actual browser session- Try and figure out if they have a front-end API that serves one or multiple articles at the same time.

n8oahgw,"Sorry, contract with employer doesn't allow me to, and she sql produced is snowflake-specific (uses as-of joins) I can describe the steps of the algo, though. you start with a collection of events. To make examples simpler we will assume you only have one entity that produces the events, and all rows (events) represent states of that one entity. If the terminology is confusing, just think that event can be pressing a lever to open a door, and the door being open or cloded is a state. let's say event a (little a) causes state A (big a) to begin. If the entity (e.g. door) already was in state A, then it continues to be in that state. Event b causes state B, etc. For further simplification, we will count time in integer numbers 1,2,5,...,8,12,... . In reality time is usually a date, or timestamp, but anything that is orderable can be used here. So assuming our times and events look like this: \`\`\` 1, a 3, a 4, b 5, b 7, a 9, c \`\`\` We have contiguous repetitions of events a and b, and we have non-contiguous repetition of a (at time 7) What we want to get is a table representing the states and their durations state, start-time, end-time \`\`\` A, 1, 4 B, 4, 7 A, 7, 9 C, 9, Null \`\`\` We kept the non-contiguous repetitions, but ignored the contiguous ones.This is close to our real end-result, so how can we get from there to here?First find all consecutive pairs. More formally - pair each row with the row that has smallest time which is still bigger than this row's time. This can be done with a self-join (or two), join + window functions or as-of join.Get rid of all result rows, where the event is the same, we only want transitions.We'll call this data set Transitions. \`\`\` 3, a, 4, b 5, b, 7, a 7, a, 9, c \`\`\`From transitions we can take the earlier time + event in a separate CTE - these will be our state endings.Yes, endings, even though we thought of them as the earlier ones. Since we listed state transitions - then it follows that the last event representing some state will happen BEFORE the first event in the next state.Also, from transitions, we take the later time + event and call them Beginnings, due to the same reasoning.Eagle eyed reader will have noticed that we are missing the first event of the first state. We should add that to Beginnings (e.g. with a union all)Now that we have beginning and endings of each state we join each beginning with the next consecutive ending (again, smallest time, that is larger / later than that if a particular beginning)the time of beginning is the island start time, time of ending is the island end time. the state, that corresponds to the beginning event is the state of the island.Of course that was a simplified example. In reality, the state is an ensemble of various fields, but these can be hashed into one, or compared one to one.Usually we also deal with more than one entity (think many doors and their corresponding levers), but to accommodate that, you just group your CTEs by the columns that constitute the entity identifier.",Dry-Aioli-6138,2025-08-14 16:15:21,3,dataengineering,t1_n8lcn6x,True,

Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors) Pinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors) If your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.Personally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.I don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.Since you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.What kind of log volumes are you looking at?

I personally reviewed a few Synapse specific PRs this week, actually :D. And it's still Generally Available with no deprecation date set. And I wholeheartedly would agree new development should go to Fabric instead.I also think most customers of Synapse would benefit from migrating to Fabric when they feel ready to do so; it has many major improvements, both to performance and to the architecture. One of the big ones is that Fabric Warehouse uses Parquet as it's on disk format accessible in OneLake - no more ""best performance or least duplication"" tradeoff.Why wouldn't I blame Fabric for Synapse not seeing much feature development?Well, designs of Synapse Dedicated and Synapse Serverless respectively had limitations that weren't practical to address without a major rearchitecting under the hood. Synapse Dedicated, for example, is the result of over a decade of incremental improvements that did not change its fundamental architecture (APS/PDW was released in 2012); we basically took it as far as it could go. So we had to do some fairly major rearchitecting to make something fundamentally better than that; the result is Fabric. Could we have called it Synapse v2 or something? Maybe. But it still would have been a migration to move to it, so I'm not sure that would have been any better. And marketing isn't my area :D.

n95axmg,"I don't really agree with your take on AI, even as a companion tool. It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.People are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.People using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.We might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.At present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.Lastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",Fridux,2025-08-17 08:39:19,7,learnprogramming,t3_1msa43x,False,
n959802,"(I wrote my first program 28 years ago.)I think in society today, everyone should learn to read code, just like everyone should learn local and global geography, how to change a tire, what the scientific method is, how to read books, how to calculate, etc.I say this because digital literacy is too low for how dependent people are on technology. There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.For people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works. But I think it is important for people to realize that the landscape of software development is just as large as any of the other fields I mentioned. Merely understanding code compares to software development as changing a tire compares to being a mechanic, or how being able to calculate compares to being a mathematician. Or even between being able to read (and post on reddit) versus writing a series of fiction books. Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.For the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future. Now that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.But again, ""learning to code"" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people.

I routinely get a laugh out of the “I’m `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?” questions. Just go for it!On AI, I’ve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what’s new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they’re often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It’s nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. Programming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I’ve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.One of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That’s why diving in is the right approach. You’ll answer your “should I” question quickly, and you may love it.

The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and ""something"" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.In your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say ""hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x"" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says ""ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database"". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.This, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve.

One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.It contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms.

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.To create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.For creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.Writing good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation. Writing good docs makes you really think about your API design and software usability on a new level.",allium-dev,2025-08-14 21:46:59,24,learnprogramming,t3_1mqcbkh,False,

The point was indeed to maximise exposure to different languages without expecting students to become experts in any of them. We wanted them to come away with “programming mindsets” where they could solve a given junior-level problem with loops, conditionals and functions, and an awareness that different languages have different “quirks” in the syntax for these concepts. For example, all these languages have for loops, but Python has list comprehensions, JavaScript has array methods that take in callback functions, Java has implementations of the List interface…Going further into back end dev, Ruby on Rails defines endpoints as methods on a Controller class, inheriting from the framework’s built-in ActiveController. Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.When you move to a language you don’t know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you’re gonna have a bad time.

You can’t contribute meaningfully to something you have never used.After using it for a bit, start looking through the codebase. Get a feel for the main language and all the supporting technologies (frameworks, libraries, build system, etc). If you’re new expect this to take a few weeks. Then download the project and try to get it running locally. Make a tiny change (change a text) and see if you can get it to show up.Then try setting a debug point. Now go and trace a specific feature and see how it works.If you want a cheat sheet look at recent PRs that got merged and see what changes were required.

But, once that is done, ask the AI to explain the concepts that dont make sense. Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it. Each step sounds awful, because it lowkey is, that is the pain of dev onboarding. You also will need to be patient with yourself in the beginning as you try to figure out where to even make code changes given an issue to resolve and how to actually resolve it properly without over engineering.Good luck, though, working on intense projects helped me get a job at amazon, so hopefully it helps you out with ur financial goals too.",Aperswal,2025-08-12 06:25:34,4,learnprogramming,t3_1mnv74w,False,

Add basic tests, use basic GitHub actions, create a CONTRIBUTING.md. Then create an issue, assign it to yourself. Complete the issue and submit a PR like it's someone else's project. 3. Review your own PR like you're a maintainer and approve it when it looks good. At this point you at least understand the process of contributing to open source, now it's about finding issues you can actually handle.4. Find a small project that has some good first issue tags.

In these contexts, projects and open-source contributions can help, but HR filters simply will block applications without formal education.In contrast, startups, scale-ups and smaller companies often prioritize skills, portfolio projects and interview performance over formal credentials.Many US tech companies (see Google, IBM, Apple) do have officially dropped strict degree requirements, though competition means degrees still give an advantage. Also countries with high demand for developers will sometimes hire based on bootcamp training or self-taught experience.If you look globally, there’s a shift toward skills-based hiring in tech. Portfolios, GitHub contributions and competitive programming results (from LeetCode, HackerRank) can open doors. Networking and referrals indeed do often bypass degree filters.Without a degree, you will need a strong portfolio, relevant certifications, and networking to compete. In markets with “degree fever” (as one commenter called it), getting past automated HR filters is harder. In more flexible markets, you can get hired without a degree, with proof of skills and good interview performance.But even with a degree and relevant certifications, you will still have to prove that you have been able to apply the knowledge and expertise you acquired, combined with quantifying the use and profit your work has.

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. - Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are. This helps searchability and makes it clear for people who do not know what a whale with boxes on it or an elephant mean.- 2/3 of your listed projets require login (or something adjacent), no one is gonna do it. Either make sure these projects have a landing page, preview, or anything else. Or make a showcase with pictures and videos in your portfolio - For some reason the whole website feels cheap, i cannot quite explain why objectively. I think its the look and the color scheme of the stars in the background. But could also be the overal color scheme and font- Last but not least, i would put maybe a little bit more information about yourself and in general, its kinda emptyAnd one note, whatever the SEO situation is, you probably don't need seo at all for a personal portolio.

In fact they're probably a good idea!When you start to work with other people, the rule is ""Good code is self-documenting,"" meaning it should be obvious what the code does without needing explanatory comments.Use variable names, data structures and encapsulation to minimise the amount of thinking that a reader has to do. For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:```class Card: def __init__(self, cardString): self.name = self._getName(cardString[0]) self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0]) self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1]) def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter] elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 'Ace' else: return cardFirstCharacter def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return 10 elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 11 else: return int(cardFirstCharacter) def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter): suits = [""Hearts"", ""Diamonds"", ""Clubs"", ""Spades""] return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)```Then `hit()` becomes easy:```def hit(): drawnCard = drawCard() v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard) card = Card(drawnCard) return card.name, card.value```**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it. Similarly, `Card._getSuit` contains some _really_ funky code, it's borderline unreadable.

n8wcphv,"There's no one answer here, but if I have to condense it to a single sentence, it would be this: It should be mapped in the layer where it is the most convenient.A DTO isn't inherently an API thing. It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.However, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).The issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.My point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. My general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying.

n8wrimc,"I think I have to make it more clear what I meant.It makes sense, since the database resides in a database layer. To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.Then we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.Somehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. I read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:If we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view. For example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.But sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.Do you know what I mean?",NearbyOriginals,2025-08-15 22:04:20,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wcaxr,True,

n8wwyoy,"Yes, that is what I told you.Entity (DAOs) are used to map your entire entity to a database table. You do not want to return this from a service. You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary). While controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.In spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:example() { var stuff = repo.getStuff(); ...business logic... return stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;)This is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.When you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.All these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",disposepriority,2025-08-15 22:35:18,1,learnprogramming,t1_n8wrimc,False,

You add a hash\_version field to your user class, so you know which hashing algorithm to use to verify their passwords. This new column in your database has no business being in absolutely any of your controllers, but obviously you want to retrieve the value when getting a user since the service needs to know what to do). This applies to any entity derivatives like projections or manual mappings with native query.Service calls one or more repositories requesting data from the database that it needs, this can be returned as an entity class, projection, manually created class mapped by a jdbc handler, it doesn't matter - this is the class that will store the data you request from the database.

n8npzr9,"To answer your question, I don't remember when the switch happened for me. There were a few milestones I do remember, though: First, when I learned to focus on projects over practice, programming started to come much more naturally to me. Second, when I learned the concepts of software engineering, I started to view programming as an end rather than some thing on its own (when it became a medium for a story like English in your analogy).It was a continuous process, but I can't really quantify how skilled I was at the time, because I wasn't doing the same thing enough to compare over time.To go into domains a little:The process will be different for every domain, as programming is just means to an end. This means learning how to learn is a step in its own. You're probably best just looking for an online community of software engineers with experience and asking there (forums, discords, etc), or just Googling it and hoping you find results. Examples:Banking and financial processing are extremely heavy on the security, regulations, and infrastructure side of things, so that's where most of your research/investment goes- under the hood I'd imagine most banks etc use very similar software, all just making secure API calls to one-another. Your learning resources are going to be regulations and industry insights to the current norms. Your only hope to breaking into the market is probably innovation (doing something known, just cheaper or higher quality).Comparatively, something like game development would be the opposite. You're creating a lot of unique systems; usually without significant regard for standards/security. I.e. outside of specific cases, there's not really one preferred solution. Your learning resources are gonna be more subjective and decentralized, as the requirements are much fuzzier and the market isn't ""solved.""

That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. Then it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, ""I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code."" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.So at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought ""Maybe if I SEND these people my code..."" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.So after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, ""Hey, I found a bug in the code."" And he literally said, ""Well, fix it."" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support. So I just kept doing both jobs. After a year or so, they hired somebody for Customer Support and started giving me raises. Really, that company was a terrific place to Be All You Could Be. I just wish I had realized that. Because after 10 years, I quit, looking for something better. I didn't realize that there were WAY worse places I could be. Had to learn the hard way.I doubt that this story can help you. Things are different now. Back then, there was a terrible shortage of programmers. Now it's a glut.

Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm is definitely widely used.It's generally not meaningful to compare things like ""number of iterations"" or ""number of function calls"" between two different algorithms, or two different implementations of the same algorithm (unless they're very similar to each other).If actual practical performance is what matters, then comparing the actual running time is what matters, so that you can fairly compare the effects of things like synchronization overhead.Probably, the most useful comparison would be to draw graphs of the *average* running time for graphs of different sizes, and also with different numbers of threads (or CPU core counts) so that you can see where the break-even point is, i.e. where the benefits of parallelism outweigh the extra overhead. Varying the sparsity of the graphs would also be interesting.If you're interested in the theoretical big-O complexity, then numerical measurements don't really matter at all, and instead you'd need to formally analyze and rigorously prove some kind of upper-bound on the amount of work done by each thread. This is likely to be a lot more difficult than just taking measurements.----An additional note: as you said, the basic form of Dijkstra's algorithm gives the ""single-source shortest paths"" from a source to *all* other nodes. But in practice, we are often only interested in the path from one source to one destination. A simple and obvious optimization is to just stop the algorithm as soon as the destination node is expanded (because at that point its path is guaranteed to be optimal). A less obvious optimization is to do a *bidirectional* search, which works both forwards from the source and backwards from the destination simultaneously, terminating when they meet. This often results in expanding dramatically fewer nodes. (If you imagine the ""frontier"" as being circular, then then two circles with radius d/2 have half the area compared to one circle with radius d.)You might want to see if your parallel algorithm can be adapted to handle one or both of these optimizations.

In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.it’s generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.Simple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.Here’s a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.Edit: Reddit messing up formatting here.def increment(x): return x + 1count = 0count = increment(count) # updates originalnew_count = increment(count) # keeps originalCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.As you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who’s allowed to change it, and how long it will exist. If you are making simple python scripts right now it might seem tempting to do things quick and dirty, after all that is what python is good for, but developing good habits in the beginning pay dividends once you have to start working on more complex systems.",jonermon,2025-08-16 05:25:18,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mqn62e,False,

If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.SICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.On that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall.

n903b3d,"It's not clear, to me, what algorithm you are using. There's one (or more inefficiency) which is the malloc/free which is considered a bit slow. There's a question of what your objective is, that is, do you want to have an array of the factors as a result or just print it out. Printing it out would be much easier, but then it's hard to use the factors afterwards.But the optimization is something rather simple and follows a trick that you use to determine if a number is prime.Instead of going from 1 to n, you go from 1 to ceil(sqrt(n)). Here's why you can stop at the square root of n. Suppose you find a factor that's smaller than the square root of n. Let's call it x. Because it's a factor, there's also another factor y such that `x * y = n`.Now `y` has to be bigger than (or equal to) the square root of n. If it weren't, then you have two numbers smaller than the square root of n which, when multiplied, will be smaller than n.You might wonder, could we miss some factors greater than the square root of n by stopping so soon? The answer is no. Why? For a similar reason. Suppose there is a factor, `y` that's bigger than the square root of n. Then, it must have a corresponding factor, `x`, which is less than the square root. If it didn't, then both `x` and `y` would both be greater than the square root of n, and their product would be greater than n (which would mean they aren't factors).So, you could modify it something like float root= sqrt((float) n); // or however you get the square root // Crude way to get the ceiling of the root int limit = (int) (root + 1); for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) { if (n % i == 0) { // Check if it's a factor // It is printf(""%d is a factor\n"", i); int other = n / i; // Get other factor if (other != i) { // Don't double print if we hit the square root printf(""%d is a also a factor\n"", i); } }If you wanted to save the array allocation cost and do it once, you could run this loop twice. The first time, you'd check for how many factors there were (create a counter before the loop and increment each time you print). Then, you'd malloc the array, then fill in the array again.Hard to say which is more efficient, but the square root trick is pretty useful because square root of n is MUCH smaller than n, so that's the number 1 idea you can use.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-16 13:01:35,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mrslsx,False,

n90u5vw,"Squeezing this kind of optimization (to me) seems silly. You're calling the square root function *once*. On the other hand, you're computing `i * i` each time through the loop. When both are good enough (C programmers from the 1980s and 1990s obsessed over writing the fastest code, but these days, if the code runs fast enough, then clarity of code matters more than efficiency), you opt for the one that is clearer to the reader which could be you or be someone else.This is why some people use Python (with Django or Flask) on the backend or even Node. A Rust backend would be faster, at the expense of being harder to read. Speed isn't everything, and even when it is, guessing what is fast or slow is not an effective way to improve the speed: you need a way to measure your program's execution (this is called instrumenting it). There are tools called *profilers* that can do this, but it's not super easy to set up and differs from language to language.For example, you can call a very expensive function that takes, say, a second once, but if you have a loop that goes a million times, and you can shave a millisecond off each iteration, that matters more.In this case, the square root trick really reduces the number of iterations and has the biggest impact, far more than deciding whether to use square root or i * i. I think it's fine to stick with i * i, because it's pretty close to saying square root. This is where it's useful to have a comment like // Not using square root because i * i is more efficientcan help. Often, when you're trying to speed things up, comments help indicate you're writing less obvious code to help speed it up.However, many beginners obsess over speed without truly knowing how to speed it up (basically, they try a bunch of things). Algorithmic improvements are usually the ones to aim for rather than smaller things like how fast square root runs. Having said that, many years ago I wrote a program using sine and cosine, and because I computed it over and over, it was slow (I had no idea).The solution was to create an array with the results pre-computed. I only had a limited number of values I was running these trig functions on (say, 60), so placing the pre-computed values in the array and looking those values up was far more efficient.So, it *can* matter.

The whole process made some exercises take a lot longer than they could have done, but as I learnt not only how I could do things better, but also how other people do, I found things easier and quicker. Sometimes I'd go and look at my 'good' solutions and see how bad they really are. And on occasion I realised the brute force approach may have actually been better as it was so much easier to understand and re-use. I think, personally, brute force isn't so bad on small scripts with small data sets that I only use for simple things. As long as I'm not loading files when I don't need to, then even looping over data sets more than I need isn't always bad. As soon as I have a nested loop I pay far more attention, likewise when I suddenly have a far larger data set than expected. (Case in point, I have a script I'm using right now where I'm sorting through a text file for some specific identifiers and false positives. My first run through the input was a couple of hundred lines. I didn't pay much attention to how I was scanning through the text. Yesterday I started looking at a file with \~1M lines.

But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.Often also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)I still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.---I'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.But if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): …`I don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",syklemil,2025-08-15 10:46:47,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqr4ud,False,

This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.* Use words like ""We"", ""Us"", & ""As a team"", instead of ""you created this bug on this PR"", ""we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR"", ""what if we need to add X functionality?""* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. * when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say ""this isn't good because X, Y, Z"", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. ""Will this work under this use case?"", ""what if the user does X?"", etc. * ask your manager how other folks are doing, ""how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious"".

We've gotten to this point where leaders think that they are the supermegaminds that are the only ones who could possible know what the company needs to focus on, and the reality is that figuring out what a company needs should be much more bottom up than top down - because it always needs to go to the bottom and come back up anyway.Right now the model - especially for internal work, but I'm sure also for external work - is:1. Executive comes up with ""great idea"" that is neither great nor feasible2. Executive hands idea down to VP, who loves the idea3. Executive hands project down to Director with timelines and super aggressive goals. Director already starts getting nervous because this idea sounds unreasonable, and so do the timelines. Also, maybe not that great of an idea once you layer reality on it4. Executive breaks into smaller projects, hands to Managers. Managers shitting bricks because they *know* this shit is unreasonable and they start pushing back while simultaneously getting ICs lined up on how to get things moving in a direction that is most likely to be palatable to leadership when it inevitbaly becomes clear the original idea wasn't possible.5. Manager pushes on Director, Director pushes on VP, VP punches Director in face, Director pushes back again on VP, VP starts softening language with executive, executive punches VP in face, VP pushes back a bit harder, executive punches again, VP remembers that executive doesn't know shit so he starts redifining things so that they sound like what the executive wanted while banking on the possibility that the executive doesn't even really know what they want. It works6. Manager gets go ahead to build the thing they've been building already. It is not what executive wanted, but executive doesn't care as long as he can sell it, so everyone - executive, vp, director, manager, ICs - now have to make a bunch of powerpoint slides to convince everyone else that the bullshit they built - which was good and useful - is actually the greates development ever.",dfphd,2025-08-12 12:31:33,325,cscareerquestions,t3_1mo7072,False,

n8r5css,"Nah, the theory is wrong, on two fronts. First, AI is just the excuse companies give so you'll blame someone other than them. The reality is companies are trying to squeeze devs harder and invest less in training (especially less junior hires and interns). They're squeezing harder because interest rates are higher and changes in tax policy meant they can't deduct R&D expenses from their income. Profitability is king right now. Second, juniors definitely are getting shafted hard right now (not 2008 level bad, but still rough). But mid/senior roles also getting shafted too, and our jobs are anything BUT safe. We got the benefit of a *little* bit of lube first, but it's still not enough to stop things from being painful. To explain: a ton of mid & senior+ devs got laid off over the last few years. I was one of them. Less than 6 months after hopping to a different Principal job they gutted my new department. Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience. But the job prospects are still not great, even for proven seniors. Companies know this and are using it to squeeze us hard to get more work for the same pay, and they're not afraid to fire people if they can't keep up.In a few years the pendulum will probably swing back for tech. AI isn't the silver bullet clueless executives claim. If the code I'm seeing daily is any indicator, ultimately AI code generation will ALSO generate a lot of maintenance (and scalability and quality) nightmares.

However, the business problems get more complex. When you go from having a few hundred users to a few billion users, how you build a product changes dramatically. You can't just YOLO out code in the same way anymore - everything needs to go through a more rigorous product development process. Also, while the work you're doing may seem simple, you're a small cog in a bigger machine. As you get more senior in your org, you become more and more responsible for figuring out how all of these cogs fit together rather than shipping out code yourself.If you're working on internal tools and infra, those teams have many of the same challenges, but also some of their own. The business problems you deal with at a large enterprise are pretty unique and require you to build bespoke solutions. Senior engineers have to deal directly with stakeholders within the company - product teams, other infra teams, program managers, etc. I work in a security org, and honestly stakeholder management is at least as difficult a problem for us as the engineering itself is.",Independent-End-2443,2025-08-14 23:18:45,171,cscareerquestions,t3_1mqgewe,False,

Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)Outside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)My facebook, which back then was young cool social media, could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.This is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)Now for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the ""ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$"". People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.Futhermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get. Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.I think one thing to realize when talking about job markets is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012 are all 33 to 40. This means you have an entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus. That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)Like this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021 over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.There is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession.

The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.But, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.Then, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now. AI tech, social media showing what little promise, lack of privacy. A lot of it has been learning new things that re-invent the wheel over and over again.And discussing the current market allows for teams to discuss strategy. Being in the know of what's going on, and having experience in new and arising tech puts you ahead of others, and not only that, allows you to better seek talent that align with goals.Back then, there weren't job sites with jobs that will never be filled, there wasn't a massive amount of CS degrees and engineering was what people promoted. Software engineers weren't as prevalent.They weren't good economic times though. Houses where I'm from sold for about the price of a VCR after being gutted.

After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.My check ins and ""performance"" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.I had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.OK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!Despite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.I didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.Eventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. It took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there.

I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.What I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.Ultimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed.

Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.That said, yeah, if you’re self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There’s still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.Right now there’s a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don’t have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.As someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that’s just where the market is at right now.The best advice I can give you is:- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it’s a long shot and don’t get your hopes up, but it doesn’t hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren’t “tech” companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says “developer”, “software engineer”, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you’re probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",Drugba,2025-08-12 03:28:09,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1mnx0jd,False,

Maybe the goals aren't to get to ""the next levels"", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless.

That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.Once you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say ""I'll be a senior my entire life"". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. Why? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020.

You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.But if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home...

n95o4rp,"Happened to me at my last job (not CS). I was a one-man digital marketing/analytics department under my manager. Always got fantastic reviews, sales soared, everything golden. Then after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn’t know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. I had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily. Note that our online sales were better than ever and growing faster than ever too. The hassling got worse and worse until finally I was given an official disciplinary review for my poor performance. Wanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department’s outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. Got called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out. But it’s not all bad. I got a call a year later and they were still trying to fill the position and wanted me to come back. Apparently they couldn’t find anyone who would do 3 jobs for shit pay. That was the perkiest “no” I’ve ever delivered.I don’t know the best solution in your case, but if possible you should try to get them to fire you.

Have a fun getaway with the wife/kids (costs range from ""gas money"" to ""whole ass resort package"")2. Work on a house project to completion (costs range from ""$0"" to a ""whole ass deck"")3. Work on a code project to completion (pretend I'm still a developer for a bit)4. Fuck off into the wilderness for a week or twoThen my battery is fully charged, and I'm good to go for several months.

I don't have a clearance, so I can't speak to the cleared side, but in public trust realm, I have not loved government contracting. There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.One benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.As for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.Driving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. The cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.On the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. TL;DR; NoVa is fine. I can't argue for it over any of the other locations you mentioned.

n9fbu4a,"Unfortunately there probably aren't many options, especially with AI nowadays.There was a study released recently that even said CNC (Computer Numerical Control) programmers will be some of the first automated out of exiatence due to its rote, typical nature. Current AI probably can't automate the entire job, but within 5 years it definitely will. Unfortunately, IT is probably going to have salaries cut massively because of AI as well. More work will go to fewer specialists, and given that VCs and BoDs don't value IT as much as they should up until this point, that problem will get worse. I'd even say IT will probably become an hourly-wage job, with FTE reserved for those heavy hitters that got there before shit hit the fan.My recommendation would be cyber security. You have enough experience to justify FTE and probably know enough details to be able to excel at the role, both from a programmatic and aw technical standpoint. Those jobs simply cannot be automated away by AI anytime soon, as the role focuses on the security risks of code, regardless of where the code comes from. You'd need to complete a number of certifications and maybe reskill a bit for the basics, but that would be what I would say to a new grad or someone entering college right now. Edit: the downvotes represent people who are unwilling to see reality for what it is. AI is coming for all our jobs, by the simple fact that the billionaires (ya know, the people driving industry) are spending collective trillions to make it happen.

But no phones, no emails, no bringing a family member along to make this time about them- this is your time to spend some time with yourself so that you can process your own emotions.Next, I’d focus on the positives of the situation. To me, it looks like things may not be as bad as they seem - to you it feels like everyone is weighing down on you, but in reality everyone is probably as stressed as you are and they are just passing that along to you, as they are to everyone. Second, no matter how bad it seems, it’s a temporary situation and it will change. It feels like the end of the world right now because you are in the eye of the storm, but it will pass. Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.Your employability may also be better than you feel.

The nature of the work makes it easy to just outsource a specific project, get a working design and never talk to the designer again.

Something I did wrong was not asking ""do you mind if I take a minute or two to think?"" And just be quiet and focus. Ask questions and focus. Competitive programmer part. Unfortunately due to the time constraint, it's like a competition. You have to figure out how to make a MVP in a short time, and be able to explain how you would do more given more time. Making it work and covering general edgecadds and showing awareness of stuff you can't cover in 15-30 mins is probably what would of improved my odds. I practiced this by doing LC easies and timing myself for 10 mins.For the other code stuff. That one I couldn't find examples but what you could do is take an open source method that's doing like a REST request and read it over and try to explain what it's doing, then feed it to LLM after and see what they say.",Super-Blackberry19,2025-08-13 22:00:54,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mp0al8,False,

A few have offered to let me talk to them. Overall, I’d agree with you about contacting recruiters being pretty dishonest though. The contracting space is bad. I’ve been lied to about contact renewals before. This was by contacting management. I was told s contact had been renewed for another year, only to learn “it’s pretty much done” after joining. I joined in August. It was supposed to be renewed for January. By February, the client renewed, but they dictated a lot of new terms. It ended up being good for me. I moved to an internal team (still a contractor) rather than being on a contracting team. I was also at a small government contractor that similarly lied about contract state to people.

n8syoge,"Remote all day long.Here’s the problem with onsite for me. Suddenly, not just your output matters. Now your ability to social with the team, appearance, hygiene (for some people), just showing up to business events is called into question. That’s before we get to the studies that show commuting even 40 minutes reduces job satisfaction significantly enough that you’d have to earn nearly double to be just as happy. With other studies from Sean Achors research on happiness that show the happier the staff, the more productive. So, what immediately happens is you’re more likely to fail onsite. Because you have to maintain a lot for your mood.If those things are ok, then you have to deal with those who struggle to socialise outside of work and tend to like the office from the social aspect. By that I mean, they think this is the place to get all their social fill and interrupt, talk about shit I don’t care about, gossip, and generally make the day worse purely for their own benefit. That’s if they’re not disrupting you, there’s equal studies from the nords on the open office plan being cancer for focus. Anyways, that’s how I feel about it. When you’re onsite, suddenly your requirements expand 10 fold. — worked remote for 8 years, also been on site for 8 years prior. That’s just my opinion though.

Good luck), you’re still finding remote roles paying way more than on site roles for people in LCOL, even MCOL areas. The only reasonable thing that I can conclude is that these on site companies are looking for desperate people, or warm bodies.
