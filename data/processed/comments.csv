What that means is that it can actually connect to a in memory pandas or polars dataframe and run queries on it as if the df was a table and it can write the results back to pandas df. So you can do something like this:```df1 = pd.Dataframe(…)df2 = pd.Dataframe(…)df = duckdb.query('''    select a, sum(x) as x    from df1    inner join df2 on …    group by a''').df()```",HNL2NYC,2025-08-07 09:33:12,144,dataengineering,t3_1mjudxc,False,

One client faced challenges when their new CTO advocated for a Snowflake-centric approach.3. **The AI Hype:** The integration of MLflow and LLM is impressive for MLOps, but I've observed several teams paying for features that go unused.",TheTeamBillionaire,2025-08-11 17:02:49,2,dataengineering,t3_1mn6ctn,False,

We were less dependent on each other, and if something blew up on our face, the repo separation contained the blast radius.At the same time, we actually had some monorepo happening too. For the sake of fast shipping we opted to use Meltano to run Airflow and dbt. This meant those three ran off a monorepo, and it was indeed good at moving fast, but it also hit a scaling wall within 6 months of going production, since airflow had to run with only a single worker in this mode. We took Airflow and dbt out of the repo and into their own, and man, we paid a bit of a price - but it was worth the initial velocity.Looking back, it's almost like making the Conway's law work for you: we had a poor, immature organization communication structure in the data engineering team, so mirror that structure in multiple repos. If your team is collocated and cohesive, go reap the benefits of a monorepo.

n83iumi,"I think you are using ""surrogate"" in a different sense than I would consider conventional.If you are constructing your primary key determjnistically from one or more columns, then that is effectively a natural key, you're just doing some of the databases work manually.Surrogate keys are keys which are not derived from the data of the entity. The idea is that they identify the row as a first-class thing in its own right. This is useful if the data model (or your understanding of the data) changes. For example, many things which _should_ be natural keys can end up being non-unique in practice due to dirty data, particularly at a large enough scale.Surrogate primary keys have to be unique, but can't rely on the data from the row to provide that uniqueness, so the guarantee that no two rows have the same key had to come from somewhere else. The basic options to guarantee uniqueness are:- Generate keys randomly and check for duplicates- Generate keys randomly from such a large keyspace that collisions are ""unlikely enough""- Generate keys in some way that is mathematically guaranteed never to generate the same key twiceJust about simplest mathematical approach that is guaranteed never to generate the same output twice is an incrementing integer sequence.

n83v18q,"I'll take MSSQL as the example hereYour question is more related on what makes a clustered index. Per default, the primary key is used as the clustered index, but it does not have to be. Anyway, when I say clustered index, you pretty much can think ""primary key"".I won't go to deep here, but essentially, the clustered index is the physical sorting of the table. If the clustered index is sequential, you add a new row, it gets appended at ""the end"". The number sequence is irrelevant, nobody cares, its only used to ensure the sorting order. If your clustered index is not sequential, the new row needs to get added ""in the middle""That will cause something called page splits. With a page split, the data can not be written where it should be, since the 8kb page at that position is full, so instead a pointer to a new page is written there. When querying the data for that row, the page where it should be is read, pointer to other page is found, other page gets read as well. So it is not good for performance.That's why you quite often see maintainance jobs, that rebuild / reorganize the clustered indexes of the entire database, running during some weekend night or something like that.The reason it is common to have that sequence as an integer is, the size. Int32 is 4 byte. Every non clustered index will reference the clustered index, so having a larger field for the clustered index, will bloat the size of all non clustered indexes, which is again bad for performance, since more data gets written / read / cached.That's the gist of why you often read about and see identity columns as clustered index.Why would you not use that:Now here it gets a bit harder, to not write a small book. The clustered index is your physical data on disk. The more efficient you can look up a value given your data access paths, the faster your queries will execute. On a typical OLTP database, you will see 90%+ read traffic, so read access is very important.Lets say you have 100 million rows in your table, that contains a lets say zip code. Lets also say, you usually query by a filter on that zip code. Something along the lines of WHERE zipCode = @@param1 AND .... In that case, for read access, it would likely be a good idea to create a clustered index, with zip code as the first field (you can create a clustered index containing more than one column). Since the search trough the B+ tree can be more efficient that way.If you had an identity as the clustered index, you would create a non clustered index on the zipCode, which works, but after the relevant data is found in the non clustered index, it will have to be looked up in the clustered index to get the actual data. As long as it was not a covering non clustered index. It also depends on data distribution an the statistics on the table, an index is useless if in that example your data is split between two zip codes.You see what I mean by saying, ""hard to not write a small book"" ?Random Guids should only be used in special cases. Massive concurrent users, where you run into hot spots on the ""last page"" data needs to get written to for example (would be called latch contention on mssql), or distributed systems.The reason for that is, that the data ends up essentially unsorted, which is not good, while also causing the page split problem, which creates the need for regular maintenance tasks.I'll try to give a bit of a TLDR on how you should choose your clustered index :* It should be chosen with intent, it is the most powerful tool for performance optimizing on the data modeling level* It should be narrow (small data size)* it should be selective. Think along the lines of a hash table, you don't benefit from a hashtable much, if you end up with two hash buckets, containing 50 million rows. Still a hash table... but you are far from O(1) in such a case.* sequential ID's can work but don't have to. They are rarely ideal, but are better than nothing* Think about how your data gets accessed, and choose the index to best support most of your workload* At least as a health check, keep an eye on your index fragmentation (there are system views for that on mssql, I'm sure there is something like that on any serious database)* The clustered index does not have to be unique! Sql Server, will append a small row identifier if needed behind the scene. It is not a good idea to append a guid in the datamodel* As a default when creating a table, the primary key gets used as the clustered index, that does not have to be done. It is usually a better idea to have a thought out clustered index, instead of just defaulting to the PK. In cases where the PK is not the clustered index, a non clustered index gets created, to ensure uniqueness of said key.Edit: Jesus Christ that ended up as a blog post pretty much, and I tried to be brief...",svtr,2025-08-11 13:23:26,6,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,
n83lghv,"History: initially the database in the late 80's & early 90's, we only had string or int, and the application had to manage PK & FK keys. So often the PK & FK were text based, and this was slow.Some vendors in the DBase III+ era, Foxpro, started copying the popular Informix & SQL-92 ansi standard, to have a database ""engine"" assign the PK key with an auto increment column of type INT. These early DB engines were only 32 bit of course.They allowed the DB engine to lock the table, assign a PK automatically on INSERT based on last value used, write the record, unlock the table. This was seen as a more secure way, since the engine was assigning the key, not the application. Because of course in a network, you get network errors, and the application would often hang or use an incorrect PK causing duplicates.My early DBA days mid-90's was handling duplicates on micro computers and mini computers (like the VAX). A mini computer used ASCII terminals, so everything ran inside 1 computer with a multi-threaded CPU, why they were huge & expensive.Micro computer decentralized the expensive mini computer, and you could use Wordperfect & Lotus 1-2-3, not just a homegrown ERP/WMS/MES application. So all the micro-computer vendors mid-90's offered auto increment with their SQL db engine because the demand was there, CPUs were only 32 bit, and the GUID() or MD5() functions didn't exist yet.Some companies had to use datetime strings instead, like Wall Street, or the UK-France tunnel car tracking system, because auto increment had reached its limit in transactions count.Was still used for lookup tables, like a string PK for a product table, but category, sub-category, color tables used auto inc for PK.Merging data from various systems was a major PITA (duplicate ID #'s with different data) and by the late 90's the auto inc was being abandonned globally for GUID instead, or a datetime string down to the milisecond 5 digits, I've seen both.Then Lo' & Behold, 64 bit CPUs, and now we have BIGINT with MSSQL 2000 in the year 2000, and auto inc came back with a vengeance because who ever hits the 2\^64-1 limit?I blame Microsoft for bringing Auto Inc back to life when it should have died out in 1999 and the Y2K bug.",SirGreybush,2025-08-11 12:25:32,5,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,

You can now point Sail at existing Delta datasets and run queries with Spark-compatible syntax—without the JVM.To enable this, we integrated directly with the internals of `delta-rs` and `delta-kernel-rs`, bypassing the higher-level APIs. It took considerably more effort, but the result is long-lasting confidence in high read/write performance.Check out our full blog → [https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3-2/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3-2/)# LakeSail MerchWe’re now sending LakeSail merch to anyone currently using Sail!

n7ib8sb,"I really fall into the camp that DE isn't really an entry level position. Not everyone sees it this way. You are doing a Masters in CS - honestly you can pick up a lot of good skills towards DE by working first as a software engineer and working around data systems. People tend to get into DE either down a software engineering route and specialising in software or as a data analyst/scientist transitioning into more pipeline and modelling work.The main obstacle I see to a new entrant into DE is just the breadth of technologies and tools out there, for mid level roles we can find candidates who have worked on our tech stack and junior jobs are incredibly competitive as its a hot job title right now. We are in the middle of hiring a DE and we had over 250 applications for one open position. I've been doing DE for just over 3 years, after 5 years as a software eng after doing a PhD in Engineering. To answer your questions:How early to start applying? If you are doing something super data based then maybe a year or two after starting your first position. This would allow you to get in and really get to know a specific database and understand how to operate in a development environment. If you're also doing personal development and learning on what you're interested in then it could work.Are certs worth it? I believe they can be useful for getting your baseline but they aren't something I have chased. I would very much do it on a case by case basis. If you start at an employer they might require you to get certain certifications and they would pay for them.What helped the most? I joined a team which was pretty small, mostly focused around data science. My programming skills were really solid but my database skills were not great. I was able to learn enough database work to get through the door and focused my effort on using software experience to really push standards in the team and improve confidence.What would I not waste time on? I don't know. I don't think doing the PhD was the best use of my time but I can't go back and change that so I'm happy enough with the result. DE wise, as I've specialised into data I already had a solid foundation. There are technologies and prototypes which were a waste of time but there isn't really anything I would regret.I appreciate this might not be the sort of feedback you were wanting to get, I am only one person and there are different thoughts around how easy it is to break into DE.

I used Looker Studio at my previous company (small company and also used AWS RDS just like yours) and it works fine with the MySQL connector but it’s obvious how well integrated the BigQuery connectors are. One way to possibly improve performance on the RDS is to create separate schema for a makeshift data warehouse. Populate this schema once a day using stored procedures from your transactional tables. You can put all the complicated joins and stuff in these stored procedures. Then only connect Looker to this dedicated schema with a simple select * from datawarehouse.cleanTable.

n7g9nd3,"A ""data perspective"" btw - another guy wrote about the messaging part, also valid.SCD is slowly changing dimension, and there are type 1, 2 & 3 - then hybrid variations depending on how old the design was.In modern times, we simply use SCD2 or SCD Type 2, which is row-based tracking of the business key - what makes a row unique and never changes, and tracking changes to the data portion, what does change over time.A good example is a credit score, ship to address, customer address.Some ERP systems have SCD2 tables labeled as \_HIST or \_History, but for DW purposes, we break down information from top-down, then bottom-up, then build what is missing in the middle as layers of transformations.So if you tie sales to geography and your customers are the general public, they move a lot, so you need to track at-that-point-in-time where they lived. A transformation would be calculating longitude & latitude for that address, that the X & Y coordinates don't exist in the source system.So the world of DW is easily a year full-time university course, of course lots of courses online too.So... At least once... A relationship between to tables, inner join or left join. In DW world you avoid left joins like the plague, unknown data will actually have a pre-defined value.This is domain / entity specific, like when you specify 1-to-1, 1-to-many, 1-to-0. So at least once would be 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.If you load a product table and a sub-table is color, another is category and sub-category, depending on the (various) sources you can have a product with no color, no category or sub-categ, you must assign a value for the missing data, so that INNER JOIN always works.So you'd have a DIM\_PRODUCT\_CATEGORY with a surrogate key and business value 'UNKNOWN' or 'NOT DEFINED' even though in the source system that category doesn't exist.You have to remember that DWs are report orientated and tools like PowerBI and the analysts using them will not appreciate having to render NULLs and won't be happy with missing sales numbers.",SirGreybush,2025-08-07 17:18:14,3,dataengineering,t1_n7g2iif,False,

You may find yourself really enjoying the work AND the company. In this case you'd want to make sure you're building relationships there and ask about a potential conversion to FTE after graduation, or at the very least an extension on your internship.If you find yourself enjoying data-related work but don't necessarily see yourself staying with the company, you'll want to start researching about different data-related roles (Data Engineer, DBA, BI/Analytics Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.) and continue building applicable skills. You'll also want to be aggressively applying for internships for related roles.If you don't have a particular affinity for data related work but still want to stay in CS / tech, then you'll still want to be aggressively looking for internships or junior roles. Again, the market is tough so just get those applications out. Best case you land an offer, worst case you get interview practice which will help you in the future.

IMO this has a significant downside in that iceberg is the “lowest common denominator” so you lose all the benefits of the proprietary format.

While snowflake can handle this, many systems (e.g. BI tools) have severe performance issues with varchar(max) columns.My view is that you need good reasons to move to iceberg, not good reasons to stick with snowflake native - which should be the default option.Also, if you are looking at having multiple engines querying iceberg, the catalog is not going to support enterprise-grade features. For example, if you tag columns for tag-based masking policies in snowflake those tags are not in the catalog available to other engines - so you would still need a separate masking solution in every system.",NW1969,2025-08-09 21:03:02,3,dataengineering,t3_1mlzcv6,False,

Which means that you don’t have to actually load data in Snowflake you just have to query your iceberg table which probably live in your S3 buckets and you pay Snowflake for compute.And as you grow, you might want to do some more transformation in the lake yourself with your own engine and only load final product into snowflake.In the end it depends on what you wanna build and who you want to pay.Snowflake is an amazing tool, but you pay for the amazing features.If you build your lake and transformations yourself that’s a lot of engineering salary to make that happen.I think those question start to make sense when you start getting big, but not before.You can also create your Iceberg tables directly on your Kafka topics to simplify querying data.

As [a blog post about monad tutorials puts it](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/), sometimes you _need_ that week of struggling to get something. That includes staring at clouds, sleeping, taking walks and so on. Part of problem-solving, including programming, is just letting an idea mature in your mind, and taking breaks. Trying to explain it to others, including to rubber ducks (""rubber ducking""), is also a good way of improving understanding.3. Learning more than one programming language, and preferably significantly different programming languages, is good. It's kinda like stereoscopic vision, where you can glimpse a general idea hiding behind two somewhat different implementations. Some things you learn from learning a given programming language is general, some things are just the quirks of that specific programming language.You'll get more lightbulb moments on your journey as long as you keep at it.",syklemil,2025-08-13 08:14:31,6,learnprogramming,t3_1mowebt,False,

It looks like quicksort but its a very inefficient implementation of it. Usually it will create new partition arrays and concatenate at the end which is very slow and not ""quick"" like it implies in the name. The proper implementation is done in-place. If you are solid in DSA and coding fundamentals, even if you don't know the quicksort algorithm, you will probably be able to look at it and realize that allocating a bunch of new memory each recursive iteration is very inefficient. Almost all sorting algorithms implementations are done in place since speed is very important.That said I think AI has huge potential value in acting as a teacher and mentor if prompted the right way. My recommendation would be to turn off copilot, don't use cursor or any codegen, and prompt it to not give any code examples.

The output of that prompt is actually pretty good stuff, it was trained on textbooks so get that level of information from it like you're taking a class on it.A soft skill I would add to that is to learn how to learn. Ask probing questions. Seek to understand at a deep and innate level. Ask for explanations in different ways and analogies that help you understand better.

Now imagine that you want to reuse the session from your API code (for other api calls unrelated to grabbing the previous data), instead of reinitializing a new session for every API call. And now you need to support some new interface for another use case, so you’ll have two interfaces and so on and things get messy.

At my university this is offered as several lower-division classes, but due to the course content and lack of connection to higher abstractions already learned, students often fail to appreciate how important these concepts are to understanding programming intuitively.What made it click for me was simply internalizing that programs are really just two things - data, and transformations on data.

n7tfatc,"I upvoted because I think this is a good discussion, but your post comes off really arrogant. If you were to re-write this, I would phrase it as a question, and not assume you know more about how to teach students than the CS Department of your University. It's good to be curious, it's good to question things, but remember they've likely been doing this a lot longer, and they likely have an answer as to why they choose XYZ first. I have a few thoughts for why they might teach Syntax first. **Easy Victories lead to greater motivation -** Almost invariably, everyone's first program is 'Hello World'. This is a very easy first step that teaches you some basic syntax, the basics of how your IDE work, and the basics of runtime/compiling. If your code doesn't compile, you have a syntax error, that's likely your first bug! And it's easy to solve. This will quickly become trivially easy, but you had to learn it at some point, and if you can see that the basics of coding is no harder than installing a few programs and writing a sentence with good grammar, that might be enough to get a few students who were on the fence to stay in the game. **Most people learn what to do, and then how to do it, then why you do it -** You likely don't have kids, but my daughter is learning to walk and talk right now. She knows 'danger hot' and that the trash cans & toilets are 'Ew'. As she gets older we'll start filling in the gaps of why these things are dangerous & yucky, but it doesn't do us a whole lot of good to tell a one and a half year old about germs because even if she could learn the word, she doesn't know what it means.Bringing this concept back to programming, One of the first apps taught outside of CS degrees is building an API with CRUD operations. The REST routing concepts are pretty much set in stone at this point, and don't require a lot of creativity, so it's pretty easy to give newbies a tutorial and help them through the concepts as they work up the project. **Yes this is eventually going to cause a learning plateau -** So yes when you get into algorithmic thinking, assignment operators, functions that pass a value, etc. you're going to hit a wall. This is not easy stuff and you are going to struggle with this as you rewire your brain. But as you practice, you are going to hit a point where it clicks, and when that happens you're going to be glad you have all of your syntax memorized because it will fall into place easier, rather than having to go back and learn it all at that point.",JanitorOPplznerf,2025-08-09 18:39:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mlnc7i,False,

n8bhswu,"To me the main idea of OOP is about interfaces and swappable components. For instance, in the real world, imagine you have a usb port. The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and ""something"" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.In your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say ""hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x"" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says ""ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database"". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.This, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve. I glossed over some details for sure, but this idea helped it click for me when I was earlier on in my journey.",silly_bet_3454,2025-08-12 17:07:03,30,learnprogramming,t3_1mo7vem,False,

One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.It contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms. Ultimately it's just a way to organise data and code in a program.Maybe looking at the GoF design patterns will give you ideas about how OOP is applied to problems commonly faced building software.

You want the code to become concrete applications/servers/… that your public can use (website visitors, mobile application users, other companies,…).The devops job is made so that the work produced by devs can be made concrete.A code always needs resources (like a server, a domain name, CDNs,… there are many kinds of resources), informations (like username/passwords, ip addresses, urls, …), and we generally setup different processes to fill some needs.Like, for instance, the pipelines you mentioned, are like pipes in a way. Once code (for short) goes in a specific pipeline, it ends up to the desired location. A pipeline could be created to provide new versions to a test environment, or to a beta version, or to prod. There is no fixed recipe but its frequent to see test/staging/beta/production.The role of the devops is to try and automatise that. So, for instance, when devs deliver a new version of the code, the magic behind happens and the cogs spin until the new version of the application is delivered to the clients.The job is highly technical and highly complex. Depending on the needs, the team can require high technical expertises in multiple different domains (security, kubernetes/dockers, azure/aws/… cloud vendors, …). It can be as simple as being a ""clickops"" (the devops guy goes on a cloud vendor like azure or aws website and clicks/fills forms manually) up to a more fully automated process (also possible with cloud vendors, terraform,…).So, if you wanted to learn visually something about how your devops team functions, you gotta be more precise.But I think management 101 would tell you to learn directly from your team, if good communication is possible.",Merry-Lane,2025-08-11 12:41:55,10,learnprogramming,t3_1mnate2,False,

n7svd34,"Short answer: Yes, but first get an IDE like VS Code set up, learn the basics of navigating a terminal, and then watch the Harvard video AND FOLLOW ALONG. (You can find tutorials for all of that in this sub's FAQ.) Watching is not the same as coding, and you will get a lot more if you are following along while you watch.Longer Answer:Coding is not 'Learn one language and fight about why yours is better for the rest of time'. There's a very good chance you're going to learn 3+ languages at a basic level and a couple dozen technologies including an IDE or two, as well as multiple frameworks & runtimes over your career. As a Junior, you probably won't get a job unless you can navigate a terminal, use a debugger, write unit tests, do error handling, test APIs through something like Postman, manage an environment through NPM or Docker or the like. Honestly there's probably three things I'm forgetting.I've watched the Harvard video and the professor is very good. He makes the class easy and fun. But he's also fast, he assumes his students are Ivy League level and have read the source materials, so he may lose you if you aren't pausing regularly and checking documentation and course materials.As for Python or C++; if this is pre-university, I think Python is PERFECT for you. It'll be much easier and it will set you up well to learn another language and follow along better at Uni. You'll have plenty of time to switch languages over the next four years. Keep in mind C++ may not even be the language your game will be built in. C++ would be for something like Unreal Engine, while C# would be for Unity, and Minecraft was originally in Java. So it's not like you can make any game ever with C++, well you could, but it's not necessarily the best choice.And yes as others have said, make sure you're WRITING code, not just watching videos.",JanitorOPplznerf,2025-08-09 16:52:18,11,learnprogramming,t3_1mltl8b,False,

Codefinity, on the other hand, is more focused on practical Python skills — working with data, building mini-apps, and slowly introducing libraries like Pandas or NumPy in context.It’s true some lessons can feel repetitive if you already know the basics, but for absolute beginners, that repetition actually builds confidence. The quizzes and small coding tasks at the end of each section made it easier for me to track progress. I also liked that they emphasize applying what you learn — I built a simple web scraper and a basic text-based game during the course, which were huge confidence boosters.Price-wise, it’s not the cheapest, but if you compare it to some coding bootcamps or other subscription-based platforms, it’s reasonable — especially if you grab a discount. The key is to actually follow through; no course is “worth it” if you just skim it.If your goal is to move from understanding Python syntax to building your own projects, Codefinity can absolutely help bridge that gap. If you’re already at an intermediate level, you might outgrow it quickly, but you could still benefit from its more advanced project modules.For me, pairing Codefinity with side projects (like Raspberry Pi experiments in robotics) made it much more valuable. If anyone’s wondering “Is Codefinity legit?” — I’d say yes, it’s a solid, beginner-friendly platform for learning Python in a structured, project-focused way.",potty__mouth,2025-08-09 19:57:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mlmu16,False,

n7z6xqx,"I went through Codefinity after completing a couple of beginner Python courses and found it to be a solid option for building practical skills. The lessons are laid out in a way that makes them easy to follow, and the gradual progression from basic concepts to small projects helped me feel more comfortable applying what I learned. I appreciated how each topic had examples that connected to real use cases instead of staying purely theoretical. Some sections did feel slow, especially if you already know the basics, but I think that pace works well for reinforcing ideas. For me, it helped to go over familiar topics because it meant I didn’t have to constantly look things up when working on my own projects. The mini projects were one of the highlights since they gave a sense of accomplishment without being overwhelming. They also made it easier to remember concepts because I could connect them to something I had actually built. I wouldn’t say Codefinity is perfect the interface is simple and the pace might be too slow for advanced learners but for someone who wants structure and consistent practice, it’s effective. I also think combining it with something hands-on, like Raspberry Pi projects, can make a big difference. It gives you a chance to immediately apply coding skills in a tangible way, which makes the learning process more engaging and memorable.

You can’t contribute meaningfully to something you have never used.After using it for a bit, start looking through the codebase. Get a feel for the main language and all the supporting technologies (frameworks, libraries, build system, etc). If you’re new expect this to take a few weeks. Then download the project and try to get it running locally. Make a tiny change (change a text) and see if you can get it to show up.Then try setting a debug point. Now go and trace a specific feature and see how it works.If you want a cheat sheet look at recent PRs that got merged and see what changes were required.

Probably the best way to do it is to read the docs (if they exist), then copy and paste everything you see that is of relevance into an AI chat, which will take time and you will have to worry about context awareness. But, once that is done, ask the AI to explain the concepts that dont make sense. Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it. Each step sounds awful, because it lowkey is, that is the pain of dev onboarding. You also will need to be patient with yourself in the beginning as you try to figure out where to even make code changes given an issue to resolve and how to actually resolve it properly without over engineering.Good luck, though, working on intense projects helped me get a job at amazon, so hopefully it helps you out with ur financial goals too.",Aperswal,2025-08-12 06:25:34,5,learnprogramming,t3_1mnv74w,False,

See how people raise issues, how they get assigned, what a PR looks like, how the discussion looks and what PRs are getting approved. 2. Create your own small project and structure it the same way. Add basic tests, use basic GitHub actions, create a CONTRIBUTING.md. Then create an issue, assign it to yourself. Complete the issue and submit a PR like it's someone else's project. 3. Review your own PR like you're a maintainer and approve it when it looks good. At this point you at least understand the process of contributing to open source, now it's about finding issues you can actually handle.4. Find a small project that has some good first issue tags. Usually this is someone just trying to do what I outlined above for themself. The codebase and issue should be simple. Work on getting assigned some easy issues and getting your PRs merged. 5.

Big corporations in the US, Germany, Japan, etc. may indeed have strict degree requirements for SWE roles, especially entry-level. Highly competitive graduate schemes and certain government and defense jobs do require accredited degrees. In these contexts, projects and open-source contributions can help, but HR filters simply will block applications without formal education.In contrast, startups, scale-ups and smaller companies often prioritize skills, portfolio projects and interview performance over formal credentials.Many US tech companies (see Google, IBM, Apple) do have officially dropped strict degree requirements, though competition means degrees still give an advantage. Also countries with high demand for developers will sometimes hire based on bootcamp training or self-taught experience.If you look globally, there’s a shift toward skills-based hiring in tech. Portfolios, GitHub contributions and competitive programming results (from LeetCode, HackerRank) can open doors. Networking and referrals indeed do often bypass degree filters.Without a degree, you will need a strong portfolio, relevant certifications, and networking to compete. In markets with “degree fever” (as one commenter called it), getting past automated HR filters is harder. In more flexible markets, you can get hired without a degree, with proof of skills and good interview performance.But even with a degree and relevant certifications, you will still have to prove that you have been able to apply the knowledge and expertise you acquired, combined with quantifying the use and profit your work has.

n7ebxgi,"There's a common misconception among those new to the software industry that all code is brand new. Most code is legacy code, that is, code that's been around a while, maybe years and years, and you're fixing bugs or adding features. It's rare for a company to ditch their code, find the next new language, and rewrite the entire codebase. One big reason is lack of documentation.I worked on software where the customer would want various features added. It had grown over the nearly two decades it existed until no one really knew the full extent of what the code did because, surprise, surprise, it was never documented. But even if it was, rewriting is only nice for the programmer. The end user generally doesn't see much. Rewrites often introduce bugs and leaves out key features because the developers never knew what all the features were.This is why certain languages hang around. Many newcomers think the industry is quick to jump on languages like Rust and abandon Java, but it's not just the language, it's the massive amount of code that runs and works. More than that, it's the data. If you switch platforms, is your legacy data compatible with the kind of data the new platform expects? In electrical engineering terms, this is called an *impedance mismatch* (which causes inefficiencies in power flow).For PHP, what I heard was it was easy to write, but hard to maintain. That is, people wrote bad code. It was blamed on PHP, more than the coders. It also came when the web was young, so there were still chances for other web frameworks. I'd say the 2010s were the era of these web frameworks. React, for whatever reason, won out over Angular. Vue and Svelte came later, but when a community heads to one framework/library, it creates a critical mass which forces others to join.For example, most web devs need to know Javascript. They could use Dart, but Javascript seems more essential, and so Dart (other than through Flutter) didn't come to replace Javascript.Often, there aren't exactly technical advantages. For example, most people agree Python is a pretty slow language. Despite that, it's become the language used in numerical methods, data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and AI. How did it do that? The main attraction was its simplicity (ish). But also, it allowed for code written in C to look like Python functions. If it were written in native Python, it would be very slow, but because it was optimized in C, a compiled language, these libraries run fast.Python has a huge set of libraries that do all sorts of things. After Java, Python may be the second most popular language taught in US colleges. It's become the language to use for AI coding, so everyone jumps on that bandwagon.But, it could have been Ruby. It could have been Clojure. It could have been a brand new language (unlikely).

Often at the beginning it's not clear what should be spelled out explicitly, vs what's built into the OS, vs what's built into the language, vs what you should import a package for. You'll build familiarity and comfort with this over time. For example, I used to TA an operating system lab where everything was written in C. It was PAINFUL for most students to internalize that all file IO would be handled by system calls, or that the computer knows what folder it should be referring to by referencing the file system relative to the folder the console or executable was launched from. This is, in some sense, the point of hello world. ""Oh wow, I wrote 4 lines of code and computer somehow knew to interface with my keyboard and monitor (not to mention the hardware of the computer itself). How is that even possible?"" If you spend long enough writing code, you will internalize the reasons why this is possible in a way that will have made it seem obvious in retrospect. But it wasn't, and it isn't, and you could spend an arbitrary amount of time learning more details if you really wanted to. Your goal for now should at least be to get to the point where you build up an expectation for what will be abstracted away for you and what you need to explicitly write into your code.You also mentioned some discomfort with dictionaries. It could be worth spending a little time reading into why they are useful, and some common cases where they are the go to data structure.

Still possible but you will hit more frustration on the way there.When people talk about higher level and lower level languages, one of the things they mean is that when you have a thought for what your program needs to do, like “look in all the files in this particular directory”, higher level languages take less typing and fewer lines of code to do that thing.

That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. Then it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, ""I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code."" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.So at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought ""Maybe if I SEND these people my code..."" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.So after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, ""Hey, I found a bug in the code."" And he literally said, ""Well, fix it."" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support. So I just kept doing both jobs. After a year or so, they hired somebody for Customer Support and started giving me raises. Really, that company was a terrific place to Be All You Could Be. I just wish I had realized that. Because after 10 years, I quit, looking for something better. I didn't realize that there were WAY worse places I could be. Had to learn the hard way.I doubt that this story can help you. Things are different now. Back then, there was a terrible shortage of programmers. Now it's a glut.

If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.SICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.On that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall.

You now recognize that bug and that edge case and you can fix it whenever you see it again.

When you're ready to begin a project, start with what kind of project you want to build. Be really, really specific and don't try to do everything at once.

Follow a tutorial on how to build that type of project.

Once you have an empty application working, start adding things, one at a time. Start small, extremely small. Add one button. Now make that one button do something.5.

n8jes53,"Two communities on Reddit to check out:- r/programminglanguages- r/compilers (I just saw you also posted there)Regarding languages, someone asked a similar question on another forum I frequent recently and my answer there is the same here:The language mostly doesn't matter. You can build a compiler in pretty much any language. The advantage *some* languages have are with respect to:1. Parsing libraries or tools like parser generators.2. Backend support if you don't want to implement code generation yourself. LLVM is a pretty popular one to use, and you'll want language bindings to it in whatever language you use so that may limit you.But, if you're building the full compiler, just use a language you know, or a language you want to learn. I've written compilers and interpreters in C, Java, SML, Scheme (Racket, but 99% the Scheme subset), C++, Python, and toyed with it in Rust.A feature that is very helpful is good support for pattern matching (present in Rust, Swift, SML, OCaml, Haskell, and a number of others). But it's not strictly *required*, your code will just be more verbose without it.For a beginner friendly path, I haven't worked all the way through it but I like the premise and what I've read in Nora Sandler's _Writing a C Compiler_. But it's not the only path out there. The reason I like it for beginners is it breaks up a common pattern in compilers courses and other textbooks.Compilers have a natural structure: parser -> analyzer -> optimizers -> code generationA lot of books and courses have you focus on the parser, then the analyzer, then the optimizers (possibly skipped), and then code generation. If your parser doesn't handle the full language, your analyzer will be wrong, and your code generation will be wrong. Sandler's book (inspired by a paper by Ghuloum) takes an iterative approach which starts with essentially the simplest C program and then grows both what's parsed and what can be generated with each chapter. The first compiler can only compile this: int main() { return 42; }Then with each chapter the parser, analyzer, and code generator gets increasingly complex and supports more and more C features.Jeremy Siek has a pair of books, both called _Essentials of Compilation_, that, depending on which you read, uses Python to compile a Python-like language or Racket for a Scheme/Racket-like language. Both his books are free, but they do tie you more to the specific language the book covers which is why I Sandler's book comes out ahead for me as a recommendation. Sandler's book is roughly the same structure but your implementation language is up to you. Use JS if you want, the tests are all C programs and whether they execute correctly.If you want to build an interpreter, *Crafting Interpreters* by Nystrom is a pretty popular recommendation and free. A book I like, but isn't free (legally) is *Essentials of Programming Languages* but it also uses Scheme or Racket, though you could follow along in a language of your choice with some effort.",rabuf,2025-08-13 21:12:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mp7qe5,False,

My go to test is to let ChatGPT generate an image of a sailing catamaran using Dall-E and although the result looks nice at first, the generated image still shows a badly functioning yacht.Things are different when you start using local LLMs. Due to hardware restrictions, my currently best running LLM ist mistral:7b, a downsized version with usable coding knowledge, language support and overall world knowledge. I can use it to improve code and get help when I am looking for what I need to change to achieve a specific behavior (take THAT, CSS!). It is not perfect, but so far it was useful in my work with Angular and NestJS.This is also supported by the availability of systems with a lot of shared memory. Although it is slower than real VRAM, it makes it possible to run larger models on a MacBook or something powered by AMDs Ryzen AI series. A medium sized LLM (20-30 billion parameters) can have very good world knowledge and if it is optimized for a specific purpose (reading documents, helping to code, looking for abnormalities in log files) has the potential to safe a lot of time and work.All that said, the use of LLMs can lead to catastrophic misinterpretations of the data given, so the models have to be tuned to give info on their thought process so you can manage and fine tune them. The way of Google to dumb down search and try to shove down Gemini as the next big thing is an example of what not to do - the results are sometimes funny at best, but can be deadly.

Managers shitting bricks because they *know* this shit is unreasonable and they start pushing back while simultaneously getting ICs lined up on how to get things moving in a direction that is most likely to be palatable to leadership when it inevitbaly becomes clear the original idea wasn't possible.5. Manager pushes on Director, Director pushes on VP, VP punches Director in face, Director pushes back again on VP, VP starts softening language with executive, executive punches VP in face, VP pushes back a bit harder, executive punches again, VP remembers that executive doesn't know shit so he starts redifining things so that they sound like what the executive wanted while banking on the possibility that the executive doesn't even really know what they want. It works6. Manager gets go ahead to build the thing they've been building already. It is not what executive wanted, but executive doesn't care as long as he can sell it, so everyone - executive, vp, director, manager, ICs - now have to make a bunch of powerpoint slides to convince everyone else that the bullshit they built - which was good and useful - is actually the greates development ever.",dfphd,2025-08-12 12:31:33,303,cscareerquestions,t3_1mo7072,False,

n7sfi04,"I agree with some of your points, but I'll slightly disagree with you on a few things.AI is a factor in the job market, but not what is being pushed. AI isn't replacing entire industries, but companies are so worried about missing out, they are throwing tons of money at it (and likely getting very little return). So, AI is a distraction, but it's drawing lots of investment that could be spent elsewhere like employee salary and investment in non-AI projects. A lot of professional services companies are trying to become AI gurus, because that's what clients are currently looking for. That's part of why I think it's a bubble that has to pop eventually. I've seen lots of non-technical consultants opening up small AI consulting companies, becoming heads of AI practices (mostly sales and management roles), and so many people going nuts on LinkedIn. One or two people who I've worked with in the past, I trust some of what they are posting. Most of the people are just trying to become business world influencers. There are certainly other factors contributing to the poor job market.One thing that feels unique is the current US administration. It seems to be actively trying to destroy the job market. I'll be blunt, I think there are a lot of unqualified people in the current administration, and I'm not sure what their main motivators outside of personal wealth are. They want to lower interest rates. Well, a weak job market will help with that. And they are actively firing thousands of federal employees, killing grants, and all sorts of other actions putting people out of work. But they don't want people to think the job market is weak, because ""Republicans are supposed to be good for the economy."" We'll have to see what long-term impact it has and how long it takes to recover. Other countries are also dealing with inflation, but it feels like the US is dealing with inflation and a bunch of other things. I'm no economist, but I've read a few people argue the tariff policy reminds them of the time before the Great Depression. So, things might get really bad and ""it's different this time."" Or, this is a spot where I can be in the camp that predicted things incorrectly, which has happened plenty of times. I was originally in the camp that the job market would turn around in a year or two in 2022. Thinking back to working during the dotcom bubble, it might have taken 4 years or so for a recovery.

n8fad81,"Companies will always make the bold claims that will sell their product. Having worked in tech for my entire career since 2009 (banks, big tech, startups, scale-ups), I can see why a lot of businesses really want it to be true:\- Many regular non-tech businesses (think banks, insurance companies, etc) really suck at delivering software projects, most of their initiatives either outright fail, or go massively over-budget. They also have big consultancies (like Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, E&Y, etc) charging them massive fees for embedded software development squads - mainly because they themselves can't properly deliver.\- Many business people still think in the mindset of build vs run for how the world works. i.e I spend time and money to build something (with a team specialising in building), then I get to run it (without the builders). Think of something like building a house or an apartment block - after the house is complete you don't need structural engineers, electricians and carpenters hanging around on full-time salaries - they leave, you don't need them anymore. This is how a lot of people expect the world to work for most things, but its not really the case with software products / platforms. There is a real desire from many businesses to have it become this way. For example, if I'm a successful apparel retailer like Nike / Adidas - my business would be way more profitable if I only had to really fork out software development costs during major projects / uplifts. In the absence of those types of projects it would be way better to not have software development salaries bloating operational expenses, and would be able to deliver way better returns to shareholders.On the above points, I want to make it clear that I'm mainly talking about companies where you don't really think of them as a tech company, but because of how important web/mobile/digital channels are these days almost every company has had to build software out of pure necessity. If you think of companies like Nike, Walmart, Nespresso, banks, insurance companies, etc - you don't intuitively think of them as a tech company, yet over the past decade(s) software development salaries/costs have become a big part of their operational expenses, and how they operate in general.

This is after a week of working overtime to keep up by the way.I could immediately see my team eyeing up my jobs, just ready to get one over on me to be above me on the pile.Month after month, I would be bottom of the pile despite 70 hour weeks. After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.My check ins and ""performance"" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.I had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.OK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!Despite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.I didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.Eventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. It took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there.

Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.That said, yeah, if you’re self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There’s still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.Right now there’s a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don’t have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.As someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that’s just where the market is at right now.The best advice I can give you is:- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it’s a long shot and don’t get your hopes up, but it doesn’t hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren’t “tech” companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says “developer”, “software engineer”, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you’re probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",Drugba,2025-08-12 03:28:09,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1mnx0jd,False,

It's absurd that they don't have a system to take care of these issues.Second, they have way too many ""leadership principles,"" and they contradict each other - you can't ""dive deep"" and ""insist on the highest standards"" while also having a ""bias for action."" Their methodology for evaluating them is also extremely flawed, as they ask a question per LP and that is the only data they use to determine how you did. I told a story in one interview about being asked to lead a technical presentation for one of the biggest banks in the world after being with the company 90 days. I then learned (shout out to my recruiter for giving me any feedback) that I scored poorly in ""earns trust."" Yeah, okay.Third, they basically abandon the whole ""data-driven"" methodology with their myopic ""raising the bar"" principle. Who decides how good the ""average Amazonian"" is? Through what process? Twice I was told I was ""at the bar but not raising it."" Another way to say this is that they acknowledged I was better than about half the people there but they will continue to be employed by Amazon but I'm not good enough. Never mind that one of their LPs is ""hire **and develop** the best"" - if you're not one of the best already, you're not ""raising the bar"" and they're not interested.There are some things they do well.

It depends on whether the company thinks $10k-$20k is worth their #1 vs candidate over their #2In today's tech world, there are lots of entry level candidates and few entry level jobs. It is a buyer's market right now for new grads (you, the candidate, are selling).Lastly, imo, $80k starting now vs $100k starting in 3 months is likely going to come out pretty even in the long run. Two reasons for this:1 - After 1 year, the $80k/yr earned you $80k. After waiting 3 months to land a $100k/yr job, you'll earn 9 months of the $100k/yr job with is $67k. After 2 years: it's $160k vs $166k.2 - The sooner you reach the ~2 year mark, the sooner you can look for a new job and make a very large pay increase without being seen as a job hopper, changing too quickly and having little loyalty.It may even take longer than 3 months to land a $100k job.My advice, accept and optionally keep interviewing.",chesterjosiah,2025-08-11 17:27:57,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1mndksr,False,

I take those real human feelings and use that when I code forms. A great real-life example is how annoying government web forms are because if you mess up you have to start over; how dated the UX feels and functions when you have to fill out all your HR paperwork online for a new job.

But the phrase “hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard” still rings true. Whatever you choose to do, stick through it. If you’re an international student I’m sure that alone comes with a fair amount of discipline. Being thousands of miles away and still doing what you’re supposed to do everyday. It doesn’t matter if you join leadership or be an IC. You need consistency and discipline to see results.Lastly, I’ll say is, while learning to keep going is important, learning when to pivot is even more important. Note I didn’t say quit. Pivoting is just redirecting your energy to what makes more sense for you and your interests. You have limited time and limited energy, you can’t do everything heck even Superman can’t. So you need to learn to prioritize and pivot.For right now, rest assured that 2 years is a drop in the ocean for a potential pivot to a rewarding 40-45 year career. You’re not a lost cause, you’re just young. I promise you everyone is as confused as you are. Just start something small even if everyone has done it and stay out of your head so you can keep marching forwards with whatever pivot you choose in your life.",styada,2025-08-08 18:03:12,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1ml0zcj,False,

The best projects, imo, are ones that solve an actual problem or serve an actual purpose in your day-to-day life. It shows that you're always thinking about how you can harness CS to improve some pain point, and you take action to do so. You can start off with something really simple, since you're pretty new to the field. Maybe kind of overdone, but a pomodoro timer is an example of a potential project - someone thought, ""I wish there was a way I could time my study sessions to maximize productivity,"" and then took action and coded something up to do it. The more unique and personal this idea is to you, the better. Lastly, something important to note is that you likely won't get all the knowledge you need in your classes.

When you're a freshman it's harder, they mostly go for sophomores and juniors since they're closer to grad and thus return the company's investment quicker.If you're a freshman now, it sets a pretty good schedule for you. If you can't get an internship, which is usually the case, you spend the first year working on projects for the resume, and then use that for internships the next two years, and try to get a return offer after grad from one of those. When you're a sophomore, set yourself a fixed (# of apps) daily goal, even if small, and start.As for the projects themselves, I can't tell you what to make, but I'd started with a website with three.js. It was fun to write thanks to Three, it lightly dabbled in the process of hosting it etc., and it resulted in something permanent online, which imo is more satisfying than a local terminal program unless that serves a real use. Even better if you do something with even a small amount of users, so you can get started on databases.If you want to go more hardware/embedded CS, look into making an RC with as many functional systems you can put into it. I made one last year that I remotely (from the library lmao) attended some in person courses with and had classmates charge it in the room. Very transferable to swe? Not really, realistically. But it made me get to know many people and boomed my enthusiasm, and you really need that.TLDR don't care about my experiences: For your projects I'd recommend trying to solve a real problem but realistically, people usually fail to find something like that, you just need to start with anything to fill the resume and get the habit going.",2016KiaRio,2025-08-10 23:06:03,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,
n80rdo6,"Welcome to an awesome field! I also did C++ in high school xDAs for projects, there are a few things you can do now that you're comfortable with the basics:1. Expand on uni projects, especially those you find interesting. You're already doing them, you can work on them further and put 'em on GitHub.2. Think of whatever CS topic you enjoy or think you might enjoy (gaming, data analysis, web development) and/or real-life topic (history, finance, music, medical) and make something related. Doesn't matter if it's overdone (web shop, library record keeping) or novel, do something you'll like :)3. Don't go too big, you'll burn yourself out.4. On a similar note as 3, don't worry about perfection. Make something perfectable first.5. Use Git with all of your projects (publishable or not), get in the habit of writing good commit messages, and push everything to GitHub (and/or GitLab, if you want). These are greay habits for later. I think only 20% of my repos are public.Don't worry about publishing a project. Play around, take tutorials, make dumb scripts, and write whatever code comes to mind. Maybe some of it will be interesting enough for you to work on it further and take public.You can also try Advent of Code for code challenges similar to what you know (algorithms, data structures), with more flexibility than LeetCode/CodeWars. You can make your solutions public too (not the inputs!).You're very young and have tons of time to find your niche(s), so experiment early and cheaply.Things to keep in mind:- Try learning testing (unit testing especially) early, it's insanely useful and highly required in industry.- As mentioned, use Git with all of your projects.- Don't let LLMs like ChatGPT write for you. Especially this early, your skills will stagnate. This includes BOTH code and regular text (comments, commit messages, README files).- Do use ChatGPT to learn what you don't know, but also read documentation. Both are very useful skills.- Write a Readme for all of your projects (not right away, but over time). Markdown and documentation are both very useful in industry, and for those repositories you make public, READMEs are super important (arguably more so than the code).Don't overwork yourself into early burnout. Work on what you enjoy (and obviously your actual uni work), and if something is good enough, feel free to make it public. But until then, explore as many areas of CS as you can (embedded, low-level, programming language theory, AI (many subfields here), web development (front and back), operations/devops & Cloud (maybe a bit later), desktop applications (like your console apps), etc.).There's no deadline for this, do it in your own time :)",CaporalDxl,2025-08-10 23:07:52,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,

Now, given that it's hard to find jobs right now, what I would do instead of arguing and looking retroactively, is at least pretending to be coopeartive, and becoming proactive about planning out what you're going to be doing and making sure your boss is on board with it. So instead of saying ""you're wrong, look at everything I did"", you should say ""huh, I'm sorry that I haven't been meeting your standards - I'll get on that. I think what would be good then is if, as I'm planning out my day/week, I give you a summary of everything I'm looking to tackle and we can make sure I'm working on the right things and at the right pace"".So every day, you start off by looking at what tickets you're going to work on, and you send your boss a slack saying ""Today I'm tackling x, y and z. Is there anything else you'd like me to focus on today?"".Now, to give your bosses' some benefit of the doubt: it might very well be that 2-5 tickets a day isn't enough.

They did not deliver the same results as the other members of the team. If I were you, I’d ask my manager to schedule a time to meet and address this directly. You could say something like, I think I work slower then other people in the organization because I close an average of 5 tickets each day or hour or whatever. What do you think I should be my average? Tell your manager what you do to make sure your work is done to a high standard (you double check your work before you close them or maybe you spend additional time with clients,etc). Ask your manager for feedback about your work and be willing to change. Try not to be defensive if your manager gives you honest feedback or make excuses. It can be helpful to ask for suggestions on how to improve. (Thank you for letting me know I am closing 25% less tickets then my colleagues, is there training available to me to improve my speed.)If you have been diligent during your work day and you are not as fast as other team members, your manager should be able to explain that to you.

Why would the previous manager expect you to be awake or even wake up for his call? I never had this issue before but this time I work remotely for an APAC team and there are many cultural differences in terms of working hours etc. I could handle it the first two years as I usually don't mind working extra hours and the people were generally nice, even though there were a lot of issues like cultural differences, no other woman in the whole department etc. Last year my ex manager got promoted so another guy took his place and I ve been reporting to this new guy. The situation is exactly like yours. Continuously moving targets to always make me feel inadequate, never praising any kind of work I do even though the previous manager and my manager 's manager were giving me very good reviews etc. He is exactly like your current manager, giving no clear expectations, no clear communication and always saying that I should have thought of XYZ from the start. I don't mind feedback and I actually implement a lot of his technical feedback. It's the continuous subtle accusation about lack of professionalism, carelessness etc. there were many times that I was the only one looking at prod issues, I would resolve them, put a summary in public channels of what was the issue and how i resolved it, and then instead of getting a "" good job for figuring this out"", I would have to explain to him why did it take me 2 hours to resolve for example instead of 1. But what REALLY pisses me off is that he doesn't practice what he preaches about professionalism. He will release stuff without testing, release stuff without updating the database to be on the same version etc. But no one tells him anything because the rest of them are nice people. Anyway there is not much we can do. I actually did go to my previous manager and asked him if I could report back to him. I didn't go into details about my current manager though, I tried to avoid all the extra drama. I just want to get out of this situation. He said yes and he would request for the change. So I guess it helped having someone higher up that I had worked with in the past and he knows me already. But it's been a few weeks and nothing has happened. Maybe he didn't think it was urgent. I think we are hiring now and he might want to give him new direct reports from the new hire before changing me back to him, I don't know. I will ask again and probably this time I will be more specific about what the issue is, because I can't keep asking without giving concrete reasons. It's hard though to do it without making yourself looking like the one who is just complaining or the problematic one. So I am also looking for a new job, but the job market sucks.

November gives you time to settle in Tampa, address health concerns, and approach job searching from a position of stability rather than desperation.

Focus on companies that value government experience or have contracts requiring security clearances, as your USDA background could be an asset.Don't abandon programming over temporary market conditions.

n806bmc,"It's a very difficult question to answer, honestly. I graduated in CS this year and I've felt like my degree (even before I got it) opened doors for me, but then again, I didn't go the SWE route. I intended to be a programmer when I first enrolled in CS back in 2019, but after my freshman year I realized that coding for a living wasn't for me- just as a hobby. I stayed in school because I was more than halfway done with my bachelor's and I didn't want all of that money to go to waste. In my junior year, I applied to an IT internship and I ended up getting it. I continued to work in IT for 2 years, got my bachelors (with my minor being in IT), and now I'm a Network Engineer making $60,000. Even before I got promoted to engineer, I got offers to do tech sales and even got to do some traveling for it. I would've not gotten those opportunities if my anticipated degree wasn't listed in my resume.However, someone else's experience may be different from mine- maybe they've worked unpaid internships and now they can't get hired anywhere. I don't want to invalidate anyone's experiences, but please understand that there's a whole set of variables that impact the job market for everyone- as it is different in every city, and country especially.

n8kifgq,"There's no real market for someone in software dev who just comes in, do tickets, then get out. Maybe the goals aren't to get to ""the next levels"", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.Companies that do career ladders well will have a concept of ""career role"" or ""terminal"" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.That means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.Once you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say ""I'll be a senior my entire life"". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. Why? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same ""level"" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward. That's why there's some level of age discrimination: when you're young you're kind of at the bar by default because you didn't have time to regress. But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.The goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.But if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home...

There are people out there who have done hundreds of applications over the course of several months who would die for that chance.

When I actually spoke with people at the company, thats not the vibe I got at all, so I joined despite those reviews. I'm extremely glad I did. I bet those reviews were just from salty employees bad at their job, because I'm the last person to be ""buddy buddy"" with anyone at work, especially the CEO, but I got amazing raises and several promotions.

You didn't do bad, its just the unfortunate need to filter down the candidates. And generally that's because interviewing is a costly process for companies.

That wasn't the case when I was interviewing Jan 2023.One thing I adjusted in my phone screen approach with the recuiter is I try not to go into deep or prolonged detail which sorta invites them in and gives space for an actual normal convo.

The market was probably better when I got the job, but regardless, pursuing a career in tech is not automatically a lifetime sentence of unemployment. If I were asking myself the same thing today, given my experience so far, I’d say:- remember many of these articles are written to get attention and increase metrics for whoever published it- big tech companies and the tech industry in general do not represent the vast majority of the actual jobs you’re going to find- doesn’t matter what industry or career you end up with, you’re going to have to figure out how to cut through the demotivating and discouraging bs and realize the knowledge and experience you acquire for your career (whether by a degree or otherwise) is simply a set of skills you’ll always be developing over time to improve your “employability”; countless people have walked your path; and there is no cutoff date/circumstances for allowing more people into the field- identify your expectations and work on adjusting those rather than letting a job market always in flux dictate your life choices - for example, do you expect to graduate with a degree and immediately get a 6 figure job offer? If so, you’ll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. “Expectations are premeditated resentments” - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything.
