We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over. I've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos.

Get familiar with how a job postings tech stack works using your foundation knowledge. You might use SSIS/Agent/SQL today but how is the job posting tech stack accomplishing the same thing? Be able to talk that. As you get familiar, add those tech skills to your resume. A lot of MS SQL jobs are offshore these days. So not sure what that future looks like.

n1rwep2,"Partial / full open source tools are useful but also consider learning one of the major managed platform solutions (e.g. Databricks, Snowflake) as a lot of larger enterprises will opt for these (especially if they're money rich and sofware engineering skill poor). Both of them offer a free account for testing with limitations (Databricks daily limit, Snowflake also limited 30 day trial but you can create a new account later). Databricks notebook / compute environment is very similar to Fabric so that's what I'd recommend.Also pandas isn't really appropriate for any of these environments as it not parallel compute optimised (the whole code ends up running on the driver node). You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable). All of these platforms have a variant of SQL and I've found data teams who migrate from on-prem to cloud tend to prefer using it as they're not as comfortable with python, but you could also familiarise yourself with pyspark which will be relevant for both Databricks and Fabric.For loading data, I would get comfortable with e.g. using spark.read() for either append, overwrite or merge. Beyond reading CSV, look at reading/writing parquet and look at processing e.g. JSON files and handling semi-structured data operations (e.g. exploding on list elements) as you will often need to ingest from APIs with this structure and then flatten it for a reporting requirement.I would also familairise yourself with data platform design patterns, e.g. Databricks medallion architecture.

They're fine tools for other situations, but it's very likely you can accomplish everything you need already using using just the features of SQL Server.Personally, I'd prefer to get everything to one server which you can do pretty simply with either Replication or Log Shipping (though there's other options too). And for any large tables that you'll be running OLAP against, you could try columnstore indexing to satisfy your query performance needs. Indexed Views, Filtered Indexes, and Partitioning are some other out-of-the-box features that can help you with performance and data management as well.I say this as someone who ran OLTP and OLAP against the same SQL Server databases, that had tables which individually had 10s of billions of rows and multi-terabytes of data, on minimally provisioned hardware (8 GB of Memory and 4 CPUs), and most queries ran in sub-second time.",jshine13371,2025-07-07 12:15:19,2,dataengineering,t3_1lsg7gu,False,

n1qlfvr,"There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**This is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. For example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, ""real-time"" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. That said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.**Complex transformations (2)**It's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.Fundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute ""incrementally"". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables ""change"" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.For an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables ""change"" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).What this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**You are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.When it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).For example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).**Hype vs reality (5)**There is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",Unique_Emu_6704,2025-07-07 02:01:26,14,dataengineering,t3_1ltg0pt,False,

Most reporting & dashboards can be 5-30 minutes old with minimal impact. And 5-15 minute latencies allow you to do all the same stuff you would do with a daily process. Works great.

n0qeqzn,"I actually started as a fraud auditor, and later in my career led broader data analytics & data governance at a tech company so, have worn a few relevant hats here.I can't speak to the specifics related to banking & financial services, but I was in a similarly heavily regulated industry. This is definitely a very sensitive area and I think you are correct for erring on side of caution, since exfiltration or ""data leak"" risks could carry extreme repetitional risks for your company. Here are my general thoughts:- There are many procedures which do require PII. I won't get into them here, but say for instance Fuzzy Matching is involved. Sometimes the fraud team will keep these secret since if folks were aware of the nature of the detection analytics they could circumvent them. I'm referring to sophisticated stuff you can't really do this in PowerBI, not basic calculations or lookups. - If this access is absolutely necessary, the fraud team should make every effort to limit who on their team can view the data, they should have procedures for granting access, and document who has access and who approved it, ie I wouldn't advise a ""free-for-all"" but I would be pretty upset if PII was restricted. - I had access because I was one of the 'trusted few' at the company. I was maybe one of 10~ employees out of 100k employees who had the level of access needed to conduct this work, the others being legal, the CEO, CFO, etc. There were maybe 50+ other folks in my org, but the PII was masked for the rest of the employees. They could download aggregated statistics from dashboards, but not the PII or row-level data. - You may want to involve in-house Legal. Anytime I granted access to the raw PII data, we involved legal. - There are excel-level controls, like encryption and security, you can tell the team must be enabled anytime they send an email - we did this as a policy. There's no real way to enforce it, but we'd always encrypt the emails and the excel file if we ever shared it. - On that note, aren't there controls in your company which monitor the sending & sharing of Excel documents? ie if it is ever exported to a flash drive or printed? - Speculating here - I think Microsoft has a data governance tool, Purview, which might detect things like PII containing columns and restrict the sharing of the excel report? Might want to look into that. I briefly used it but can't speak to its applicability or effectiveness in this situation. Just my thoughts - could also maybe learn from them exactly what procedures they need to do in excel and see if you can design queries to handle it?

That’s why Spark (that originally was meant for parallel processing) usually goes along with Hadoop File System (HDFS).With this setup you can simply pick a CSV file, manipulate with Sprk, and then store in another location.Now let's complicate a little bit the situation: for example you can still store records as CSV table but want to enforce a schema, in this case you can spin up a Spark cluster with Hive Metastore (it’s just an external small database to store metadata of your tables). This allows you for partitioning, clustering, grant RBAC, ...In the last 20 years more complicated file types have been enforced in data engineering, like Parquet (think of it as a self describing CSV which has an header with column names and data type) and Iceberg.I don't know if this answer your question but to recap basically you need to combine a query engine with a metadatastore to have a complete database/datawarehouse otherwise you can only transform data from point A to point B.",Busy_Elderberry8650,2025-07-03 20:31:01,1,dataengineering,t3_1lqcxx0,False,

n1ags9c,"> do modern BI systems need an analytics DatabaseTechnically no, in practice yes. The reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. ""store this order"", ""lookup this invoice"" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. This is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. ""order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment"" or ""show all customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months"".These aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.Another aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.With this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.Regarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.They key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",scaledpython,2025-07-04 11:37:57,2,dataengineering,t3_1lrcx96,False,

Breaking it into two distinct steps allows the database to first have a copy of the data that it has statistics about, and can do it as a single bulk operation. You also have the option of creating an index on the staging table before the merge, which could help that process.Breaking it up into two steps also means that once the data is uploaded, you don't need to run your local compute process anymore, and you aren't susceptible to the process failing if you have issues with your local processing, the network connection, or the merge. It is generally just more stable, and if it has an error you have a definite point the error occurred, and since the target table merge can be a single transaction, it is easy to rollback anything critical.Having your local data processing engine do a direct upload to a table lets it use whatever optimisations it has for the connection. If it has specific support for your database, it may make use of bulk operations in some way to speed up the process.Or, if you have a separate tool for bulk uploads, you write the data locally in a format suitable for that, push to a staging table with that tool, then merge with a database script or procedure.SQLAlchemy may be able to help with the database SQL script to integrate from the staging table to the target table.",Anxious-Setting-9186,2025-07-03 00:58:46,3,dataengineering,t3_1lpxdy8,False,

For contracts, strip it to a single Great Expectations suite that only checks the critical login table; learners learn the pattern without drowning in rules. I’ve used FireHydrant for chaos drills and Datafold for diff diffing, while Pulse for Reddit quietly surfaces edge-case questions from learners before they hit support.

For example, say there's a new cost field - how do you know that some of your existing costs aren't now being split between an existing field and this new one? And of course, how will your code even know it's a cost field?Here's another example, say there's a string field - your code won't know if it requires an adjustment to some of your business logic. Maybe it indicates a cost type?So, if data quality matters, then it's best to have a data contract, and when the upstream system makes changes to that contract then you coordinate with them.Meanwhile, you can compare every record to the data contract to ensure that every row complies and you don't have any unapproved schema drift.",kenfar,2025-07-05 04:16:42,1,dataengineering,t3_1lrl7k6,False,
n1d2v5a,"Not sure this will help you but we 'solve' it by creating data contracts at the *compilation* level. In our infra this is achieved via two mechanisms:1. All streaming pipelines serialize to Protobuf2. All Protobuf schemas are shared via a monorepoCombined you get quite a strong consistency model for data interaction at the streaming level. Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID. That solves 99% of the data interaction mismatches.Having said that you're still ultimately persisting to a database somewhere, and that part will require an unavoidable migration. This is where the hack-ish solutions are usually found. Usually here you either go with the slow-but-safe versioning approach or with a simpler 'all downstream services upgrade simultaneously' one. Or just don't rename a field unless there's a strong business requirement. Pick your poison.EDIT: there is actually a cleaner option for column renaming in *some* databases, though I personally haven't used it. You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this: CREATE TABLE example ( old_name String, new_name String DEFAULT old_name ) This effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure. The caveat being that inserts into the new column won't be visible in the old one.

Even something lightweight like duckdb or a cloud based pgsql could work, especially if you’re layering a BI tool or dashboarding solution on top. But that does add more setup and ongoing maintenance.If not, and you’re mainly just showing charts or summaries from selected batches, then pandas might honestly be enough. You could just scan the folder, load only what’s needed based on the user’s selection, and cache results to keep things snappy. That keeps things simple and flexible, especially if your files aren’t massive.If I were you I would first answer these questions:- How big are the csv files, roughly? A few MBs or closer to GBs?- Are the column structures consistent across files, or do they change?- Does anyone on your team need to explore the raw data themselves, or are you the one curating all the views?- How often is new data added to the data lake?- Are there any heavy computations or aggregations you’re doing often that would benefit from SQL?And then, Once you know the answers to those, it’ll be a lot easier to decide if you need a proper database layer or if a well organised pandas workflow can get the job done.",Aggressive-Practice3,2025-07-02 07:26:23,6,dataengineering,t3_1lpp9nk,False,

Cache the converted parquet once at ingest, store minimal metadata (batchid, path, row count) in a tiny SQLite file so you can list options instantly, and use Streamlit’s st.cachedata to avoid rereading the same files. When the data volume finally outgrows laptop RAM, you can point the same parquet set at a warehouse like Snowflake without rewriting code.

I've found doing 'walk-throughs' of the data pipeline to be incredibly valuable, and they are easier to understand when someone sketches it out by hand on a white board or paper instead of just pulling up random scripts and expecting you to understand code with zero context. And, in general in the corporate world, always assume that every single person you're going to talk to is a horrible teacher, gives you no context that you need, or does not understand the context you're missing.For example, your first day you may sit down with someone and they will say ""we take data for daily crude futures, run it through our model, and load it into this report"" or whatever.They will not explain why they are doing that. They might just assume you know what a ""crude future is"", how it helps the firm, why the data needs to be prepared a certain way, why they look at things with one language vs the other, etc.Worse, maybe they won't teach you at all. Maybe they know you don't know any of this stuff, and will not want to spend time teaching you.One piece of knowledge or behavior you learn this year, when you're young, compounds for decades, so it is incredibly important and valuable for you to maximize the amount you learn. You do this by being annoying sometimes and asking dumb questions.Very, very often interns are terrified to ask questions, so, they often do narrowly-scoped tasks and never understand what it is or why they are doing it.A healthier approach is to adopt the opposite mindset: be terrified of NOT asking questions. Anytime you feel the 'feeling' of confusion, it's a very good thing, embrace confusion, become addicted to it, since that feeling is actually your brain learning.Not being confused is a bad thing, it means you're overconfident, which will make you very dumb over time.",Maskrade_,2025-07-06 08:35:42,1,dataengineering,t1_n1hd2yy,False,

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys.  So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.",Gators1992,2025-07-02 18:40:44,6,dataengineering,t3_1lq26dn,False,

Even with these instructions and all necessary context, LLM may fail to generate response you expect for questions like this.This may sound a bit weird, but if you have limited number of questions like this, it makes sense to prepare a report (pivot table?) that answers on the question *precisely*. If you want to encourage end users to ask their own questions - which means creation of their own new reports - first of all you need to configure a data model (cube?) that contains all necessary dimensions and measures needed to answer on these questions.Taking into account *realistic* capabilities of modern LLMs, it makes sense to offer end users 2 kinds of prompts:* ""Ask question"" in the context of the concrete data model (facts + dimensions). LLM gets in the context lists of the available dimensions, measures, filters + instructions and maybe even low-cardinality dimension values. Result is a tabular report configuration (pivot table or flat table) with filters, which can answer on user's question.* ""Ask question"" in the context of the concrete report data. LLM gets in the context report's table data (which is reasonably sized and not is too large for LLMs context window), possibly with supporting instructions. This is a kind of assistance with data interpretation, instead of analyzing values in table users can simply ask smth like ""what is the best client by premium"" - and get an answer if this report has calculated premium values by clients.Technically, with tools calling these 2 steps may be combined (LLM can compose a report, then load report's data, and give an answer), however this significantly increases a risk of wrong numbers in LLM response. In BI it is very important to get *right* numbers (not just maybe-yes-maybe-no numbers), so it is better to offer simpler but more reliable LLM-based functions.This is how we implemented LLM-based functions into our BI tool recently, based on feedback from real users.

The ""terminal"" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the ""shell,"" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type ""ls"" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the ""ls"" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).SSH, ""Secure SHell,"" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.When devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\*\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\* I'm simplifying a bit.

I think the key is small problems, not projects. Something like a small math simulation. My favorite was modelling the ""sick hobbits"" problem: ""There are 1000 hobbits on an island. X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick? On average, how long will the contagion last, how many days?""Once implemented, then vary it up by changing how many hobbits are visited per day, how long the sick hobbits stay around (maybe more than one day). This type of problem is good for learning because the code for it is just a page or two.Building programs into projects is another skill in of itself. To do projects, you need to start worrying about system design, modularity, testing, and more advanced debugging. So, start with something a lot smaller so you can get syntax, data structures, and control flow statements down. Then move on to larger projects where you'll then need to train additional skills. The issue with projects is that you're being forced to learn too much all at once, I suspect a person would feel completely lost.I'll hate to mention, but the 'easy' leetcode problems are generally good for learning programming language syntax and basics (again, the basics are syntax, control flow, and data structures).

Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write ""Hello, World"" in a dozen languages. OP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.I don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.As an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.Why is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.Programming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.Having said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.My minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",CodeTinkerer,2025-07-05 12:06:17,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ls1kp8,False,

It is from _that_ kind of thinking, that expertise develops.Well, of course, if one wants to stay a mediocre dev with limited perspective due to limited exposure to the things that are out there, then no problem! The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.If one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.Don't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know. There is tons you don't know and there will always be tons you don't know. What matters is, that you continue learning.

Some people choose to continue learning, and maybe project Odin could be a place where such people go to learn. Some are even fortunate enough to be able to do so on the job, at some functioning organization. Most others will not or are not at organizations that encourage learning.Example: In the past I have been at an organization that had fake ""learning days"". I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else ""learning HTML"", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job. It was completely dysfunctional.I think many people in this situation would not have energy left to then learn more in their free time. That is, if they were into being a developer out of passion and learning about computational processes, and not just for the good pay.

There's a reason people say to start with tic-tac-toe or a TODO app. Building something small and self-contained is great 2. Piggyback off of existing projects. Clone some open-source repos down, poke around, see how much you can understand. Pick something small and cool to rebuild as much as you can, using the repo as a reference. That way you can see how code is built and used in the real world.2. Tutorials can be really useful, but don't just build what's in the tutorial. Change or add \*something\* so that you can apply what you've learned.3. Maybe controversial, but I strongly recommend preferring text tutorials over video. I've found that text has a number of advantages. It's more similar to reading documentation. You can easily jump around back and forth without needing to rely on timestamps or trying to skip back and forth on a video. And I'd argue that reading long tutorials helps flex the muscle of quickly filtering relevant from irrelevant content, which is important when troubleshooting and searching for relevant documentation, browsing reddit and old Stack Overflow posts (if that's even still a thing) and even when chatting with an LLM and figuring out if it's hallucinating or giving you outdated information",No_Elk_6792,2025-07-01 18:07:12,13,learnprogramming,t3_1lp37xl,False,

API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the ""backend"" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end.

This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. Once you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",InVultusSolis,2025-07-07 17:03:39,9,learnprogramming,t3_1ltr5uy,False,

Well we just need to repeat the same stuff the specified number of time, something like: line = """" repeat for numbers of spaces line = line + "" "" repeat for numbers of o line = line + ""*"" print lineBut to be more concise, we could write as well: line = repeat("" "", number of spaces) + repeat(""o"", number of o) print linewhere repeat would repeat the string the number of time we want.

They gone too fast and you are lost now.But doesn't mean you could not do it on your own with smaller learning step and couldn't master all that with enough training.",nicolas_06,2025-07-07 04:44:26,13,learnprogramming,t3_1ltkhbx,False,
n1rmt93,"The other two guys before me actually said everything and in a very detailled but still comprehensive way.Do you really feel some need in boosting your creativity? Because you've put that in quotation marks.Sadly creativity was always or has become almost a meme, because (as the other posts confirm indirectly) it sounds like some kind of superpower for almost anything, from programming and maths (""multiple way to solve a problem"") till songwriting and visual artwork (doesn't even need any argument for those...does it?).But actually creativity is something so abstract that one could write philosophical essays about it (no irony here). And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.My experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...I studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.? By f-ing REPEATING various catalogs of ""questions/tasks that can be asked in the exam"". That's frustrating and I'd hope less people would have to work and especially to learn this way (because it's one of the heaviest turn-offs imo).Before I drift off into more pessimistic stuff, one thing I can tell you as a (hobby-)musician and occassional painter that aside from let's say 0.1% of the population who have superpowers, top genetics and were raised very effective & without any damages, creativity is a bit like natural mutual attraction (""love"") - you can't enforce it. Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?By doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!And by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / ""soul"" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (""background-process""-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity. Will, patience and time - I know, we all need especially the second one, but it's possible :)A bit untypical my whole post, but I hope this gives you some inspiration and new thoughts.

Toy projects and leetcode solutions are basically things you do once then barely touch again, so using this kind of code is acceptable. However, code in the real world has to be constantly maintained by several developers. The piece of code that you wrote today should still be understandable to you when you read it 6 months from now (and you've forgotten all about it) and understandable by your teammate who has never worked in that part of the code and maybe has never even met you.So your plain loop solution would still be good, and some might argue even ""better"" than the clever single liner.",plastikmissile,2025-07-07 07:29:18,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ltkhbx,False,
n1rvq9h,"> [Code snippet of cool mathy looking formula]> ... I think I couldn't have discovered this answer myself. I don't think I would have written it that way either. But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the ""perfect mathematical solution"" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.For this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.Now do the same for how many ""o""s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....So in this situation I would say that the ""goold ol' C-style for loop"" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop: // Pretend that height comes from the user. let height = 4; // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \n so that it looks // nicer inside the JS Console. let pyramid = ""\n""; let ohs = 1; for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { pyramid += "" "".repeat(spaces) + ""o"".repeat(ohs) + ""\n""; } console.log(pyramid);Some people won't like that style and will prefer a more ""functional"" or ""mathematically correct"" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less ""elegant"" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional ""mathematical"" style.",chaotic_thought,2025-07-07 08:15:48,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ltkhbx,False,

Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what ""things"" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other ""what ifs"" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).After step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of ""todo list"" of sorts for what I actually need to ""actively do"" to learn that material ""for realsies"".Step 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.Suffice it to say that ""Step 3"" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a ""library"" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).For step 3 (""implementations"") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes ""unfinishable"" for me in practice because I tend to write ""too many"" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little ""checklist"" to keep progress:\[ \] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\[ \] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\[ \] (146) \*bar\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\[ \] (146) \*\*cmdline\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept ""\["" and ""\]"" as synonyms for ""("" and "")"" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\[5\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \* \[1 + 2\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \* (1 + 2).\[ \] (146) \*\*\*cmdline\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output....In my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a ""\*"" mark to mean ""it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise"", \*\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \*\*\* or more to mean it is an ""advanced"" exercise.The stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.These ""checklists"" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual ""stuff"" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE).

They allow you as the developer to control the way your class is interacted with. In the field, you'll rarely be writing code on your own. Most of us work on projects with at least 10 other people touching the code that we write, and on code that other people wrote. You won't always have the benefit of knowing exactly what was going through the authors head when interacting with a class. Also... after a few months or years you won't know what was going through your own head.So, consider a scenario where a class has a static object in it which is critical to its function. Say.. an in memory data store or cache. Nearly every public function in the class calls this object and it would be really cumbersome to check for initialization in every function call. Plus, that leaves room for error. You or another developer later on might forget to check. But you could define it with a getter that checks initialization and executes lazy initialization if its not done. Now that initialization logic exists in one place, and you never need to worry about checking for initialization when using the object. And you don't have to worry about some other developer down the line writing dangerous code into your class that forgets to check initialization.Similar with constructors.

However, if you wanted to do something like clean the input - check bounds, convert type, etc., - or fire an event or something when the value is retrieved or written to, this is where a getter or setter is really valuable.C# does a better job of this, IMO, but getters and setters are the norm because globally accessible variables are a HUGE no-no in virtually every application.Most often setters are the complicated ones and public getters that just spit out the value of the variable are pretty common. However, one case I am currently using right now of a more complex getter is that I have to retrieve the firmware information of a co-processor that talks to my primary MCU application over a serial connection. I request that information and cache it when the program starts, but if I call my version getter and that value is invalid for whatever reason (firmware update, mainboard resets, etc) I can spin up the serial port and request the info again, then return the new information or an error code. From the application perspective, I am just getting the firmware version and it doesn't really concern itself with how. I don't have to almost ever change that code, and it can be reused in other places so that if I ever change how the firmware version is retrieved, it's in one spot and makes my job much easier.

Yes you could, and you often do if you want to be able to return a failure code. However when you don't need to return a failure code, it's less typing to just initialize in a constructor.One area I've found setters as being really nice is lets say you have a variable that should only be a number between 0 and 10, and you have a bug where it's being set to 100007. How do you figure out why it's being set to 100007? With a setter you can put a break point (or a conditional break point) in the setter, then trace up the stack to see where and why it's being set to 100007.As for getter, unfortunately with java if the variable is public then if it can be got it can be set.

n0sr2zm,"From a C++ perspective, where you can have it your way (you can directly access if you want to do that)... here is my 2 cents on these concepts. do-nothing getters and setters exist only for interface consistency. More on that at the end.Presumably, in a real (not a learning exercise) program, many of your variables have constraints that require validation, eg can a person's age be negative or higher than 200? Can their name contain unprintable characters or whitespace like tab? These constraints are put into the setters, and signal an error if the attempt to set them to an invalid value is made. Getters protect data that the user can see, but should not change. For example, with the person, you can maybe look at their address when making a map of your customers but this is not an appropriate place and time to be changing the values -- a getter can provide a look without letting you accidentally modify it. To modify it you must deliberately call the setter rather than just an oops side effect on a free wheeling variable. But when the getters and setters do nothing, and they often will, their only purpose is to keep it consistent. These 10 values have getters and setters and those 5 do not in class A, those 18 do not and 11 do in class B, .. C, D, E, ... after a few classes, remembering which variables in which classes have getters and setters is overwhelming. If you just assume they all have these functions and use them for everything, its that much less burden on the programmer. They also abstract validation: when using them ALL of your validation looks the same: while( !class.setter_for_variable(new_value) ) { display bad input message() new_value = get new input from user () }",Independent_Art_6676,2025-07-01 17:54:01,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lp4niz,False,

It might make the code look better, something like: switch(command) { case 1 -> generateRandom(); case 2 -> generateWithLength(); case 3 -> generateWithLetter();and so on. But it is a matter of taste.You could benefit from making a single method for reading a valid number from the input - something like: `getValidInput(int[] numbers)` that would only return one of the numbers in the array, or zero if something else was entered by the user. That would isolate your use of scanner to that method alone, and make the rest of the code easier to write without having to handle exceptions or different invalid inputs.It is always a good idea to have a lot of small methods that only do one thing - my own personal rule is that if I have more than two levels of if-statements or loops, I need to make a method to combine them.

In the U.S. an example might be Minneapolis or Atlanta. Both cities have lots of software jobs but nothing like Silicon Valley, Seattle, or NYC.

Your electrical background is actually a huge advantage. You already understand complex systems, troubleshooting, and working with detailed specifications. That kind of logical thinking translates really well to programming.The fact that you've already played around with TrueNAS, Linux, and Docker shows you're not starting from zero. Don't downplay that experience, lots of grads don't even know what Docker is when they start.At Metana we've had students from all kinds of trades backgrounds make successful transitions. What I've noticed is that people with hands on experience often do better than traditional CS grads because they understand how to build things that actually work in the real world. You don't necessarily need a degree for most programming jobs, especially in Canada where the tech scene is pretty good. Companies care way more about what you can build than your educational background.The ADHD thing might actually be an advantage once you find your groove.

Also even if you work in any other language, if you're working on a web page in any capacity, you will almost certainly need JavaScript so you might as well know it, even if you end up not using it as your primary language. For where to get started, The Odin Project is a great resource to get you on the right track.",shrombolies,2025-07-03 07:02:51,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lqb5f9,False,

Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. You should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. You will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. 5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. 6.) Be proactive. You can’t fail if you go hard at all the above every single day. The above 5 steps should be your full time job until you land a job. It might take time - but you’ll land something eventually - in fact it took me almost 2 years to land a job after learning how to code and following the steps above after 6 months of coding.

Worse comes to worse you meet some cool new people, best case you start getting tips.\- integrate your projects with the LLM companies APIs. Considering how popular these tools are in tech right now, you'll have a bit of an edge over people making boring boilerplate apps. If you want to be hired, working with these APIs will look good when you're demoing your work and show you're on the cutting edge.\- Don't let doomers discourage you.

Get good, show your passion and you'll stand out over a sea of apathetic grads who are just in it for the six-figure payday.\- Lastly, most importantly: only become a front-ender if you genuinely love it.

n0q4i1u,"This is one of the best questions I've seen in a while. It's really nice to see someone trying to clarify something about the interaction of the language with the environment it's running in.`scanf()` is not moving the cursor. The OS is. Well, the terminal application is, with the help of the OS (and possibly BIOS). It turns out that the cursor advances all the time. Like when you type in the command to compile:```$ _$ g_$ gc_$ gcc_```After each character typed, the cursor advances (most of the time). But terminals are very complex things. Suffice to say that the terminal--with the help of the OS--manages receiving keystrokes and ""sending them"" to the application.IOW, the terminal receives the keystrokes. It does what it usually does; advances it when you type a character, retreats it when you type backspace, etc. Then, after it does what it needs to (though there are exceptions, like what happens when you press `Ctrl-C` on a Unix-like machine), it tells your C program: ""Hey, someone pressed a character, here it is."" Then, you do whatever you're going to do with it.It's somewhere from ""a little"" to ""way more"" complicated than that in realities, but that's the general idea. Just to finish this up, the complexity can come around buffering, which is how many character the terminal and OS will hold before sending them. If it sent every character, one at a time, that could be inefficient, so sometimes terminals and OSes buffer. Generally, in terminal applications, hitting `` will force/suggest the underlying bits (terminal, OS) to send the data to the application. Also, it's the terminal that decides to move the cursor down (newline), and then return to the left-side on English/Western locales (carriage return).If you're curious about how terminals work on Unix-like machines, check out **Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment** by Stevens, often abbreviated ""APUE"".",qruxxurq,2025-07-01 08:28:40,7,learnprogramming,t3_1lovxji,False,

n0q7vlr,"In a traditional environment with a serial terminal connected to a remote computer, keyboard input to the terminal is sent to the remote computer to be handled as program input, and output from a program is sent from the remote computer to the terminal for display.Most of the time, the cursor is placed after the last output character sent from the remote computer. Sometimes other characters change the cursor position, like a carriage return moving the cursor to the beginning of the current output line, a line feed moving the cursor down one line, a backspace moving the cursor backward one character, and other special escape sequences can move the cursor in other ways (such as to a specified row and column).Also in most cases the operating system terminal driver echoes characters input on the terminal back out to the terminal. This may happen automatically in the terminal driver without the remote program having to do anything, but the terminal driver can also be put in a mode where automatic echo is disabled and the program must deliberately echo input characters if it wants to. A text editor, for example, may set non-echoing mode so that editor commands are not echoed when they are typed, and instead output from the editor program displays the results of performing the command.The terminal driver in the operating system usually also handles input in line mode, meaning that an entire line of characters followed by a ENTER is buffered up and made available to the program after ENTER is pressed. But the terminal driver can also be put into a mode where every keypress from the terminal is immediately available to the program, rather than being held and sent when ENTER is pressed.In modern computers the terminal is often a program that emulates the behavior of a serial terminal, because the serial terminal model is so pervasive for managing program input and output.In a simple program, output to the terminal is what moves the cursor, so calling scanf() does not cause the cursor to move, and if the terminal driver is in its normal mode of echoing input, it's the echoed output of input characters, or output from the program, that moves the cursor on the terminal",stevevdvkpe,2025-07-01 09:02:59,2,learnprogramming,t3_1lovxji,False,

n1u1sv2,"You might want to learn some higher level compiled language like Go first. C is a bit unforgiving, it totally lets you shoot yourself in the foot and C++ lets you do the same, except that your entire leg is gone afterwards.Beware of any mention, that C++ and C# are just supersets of C. That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.Find a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book ""Effective C"" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).Then, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.If you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet. It assumes that you know how computers work, potentially already have programmed in some form of assembly. It's more of a historic document than a valid learning resource. Don't get me wrong on this, it's a great read and you definitely should read it at some point in your learning journey, but it isn't the *best* way to learn C, anymore.",DreamingElectrons,2025-07-07 16:43:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lty6z0,False,

n16kwbd,"A ""flag"" is just something that can be true or false, on or off, 1 or 0. A boolean is the most basic example of a flag, but there are alternatives. `SDL_Init` uses a technique where each individual bit in a larger block of data is used as a flagThis lets you group a load of related flags together in a compact block of memory. In the `SDL_Init` scenario, each bit (flag) corresponds to a subsystem you want to initialize.`SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)` passes a collection of bits where everything is off (`0`) except for the one bit that corresponds to the video system, therefore signalling that is the only thing you want to initialize.The main advantage of using bit flags over booleans in scenarios like this is that it gives people using the library a very convenient way to specify a combination of flags they want to enable. You use the bitwise operator `|`. Setting two bits to ""on"" looks like this: SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_AUDIO)There's a guide to bit flags and how they're used in SDL's API design here: https://www.studyplan.dev/intro-to-programming/bitwise-operators",okwg,2025-07-03 19:36:52,11,learnprogramming,t3_1lqwoem,False,

We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:```some_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);```Now this function call only says hello.This way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params. It also enables extending the list of options very easily without having to go fix a thousand different calls to the said function.Hope this explains it.

And they can control anything that can make use of a condition, from a switch to a loop and in some languages, even a computation (eg in C++ you can use the false==0, true == 1 in a computation to zero out a term: its valid to say integer = 3\*x+2\*y + 42\*(x>0) ) to conditionally add either 0 or 42.

n1ermz7,"A predicate is just a function that takes an argument and returns a boolean. Intuitively it's like a function that answers a yes/no question about its input.In this particular case, you're totally right, you could just as easily write: List numbers = new List { 10, 5, 15, 3, 9, 25, 18 }; List higherThanTen = numbers.FindAll(x => x >= 10);However, sometimes you might want to reuse that logic. Maybe you're writing your own method like FindAll. Maybe the yes/no question isn't a one-liner so you want to split it out.In those cases, it's helpful to know about Predicate.",dmazzoni,2025-07-05 02:38:02,7,learnprogramming,t3_1lrzkl0,False,
n1eum30,"In the example, yes the predicate isn't doing much. Aside from re-use, creating a predicate with a descriptive name helps others read and understand the code's intent. If you're reading code and you see a lambda that's x=>x.code == '18962' && x.Department == 45It's not clear what that's doing. If the programmer wraps that in a predicate called ""ProductIsDonut"" the code is more easily read and understood.",edrenfro,2025-07-05 03:00:01,4,learnprogramming,t3_1lrzkl0,False,
n1evc3g,"To add to what u/dmazzoni said, `Predicate` is just an alias for `Func`, a function that takes an argument `T` and returns a `bool`.You can write it as:```Func isGreaterThanTen = x => x >= 10;```And it will work.Another use for these is if you want to swap in a function depending on some logic.```Func isGreaterThanTen = x => x >= 5;Func isGreaterThanFive = x => x >= 10;Func filter = someCondition ? isGreaterThanTen : isGreaterThanFive;List higherThanTen = numbers.FindAll(filter);foreach (int number in higherThanTen){ Console.WriteLine(number);}```And these come in handy when dealing with methods that do things to a similar set of arguments, and have some sort of controlling input.You can assign class methods to Funcs if the type arguments match. Note that the last type argument of a `Func` is the return type. So `Func` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`So instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:```Dictionary> handlers;void Init(){ handlers.Add(""A"", HandlerA); handlers.Add(""B"", HandlerB);}void Handle(string value){ if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler)) { var output = handler(input) } throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));}private SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value A...}private SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value B...}```",rupertavery,2025-07-05 03:05:22,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lrzkl0,False,

I have heard ""you're good for a physicist"" so many times, but I actually take it as a compliment. Most physicists don't care and want to make a throw away program. That's fine but if you want to learn how to make software that lasts longer than a single day, you obviously need to do something very different. I never really learned that systematically, I just kinda wanted to write stuff that was useful later, so I just naively tried to structure things more cleanly. I spent lots of time reading tutorials, reddit, other peoples code and whatnot. I did read ""Clean Code"" a year or so ago, and I thought it was ok but much is learned by trial and error, writing lots of bad code, rewriting it slightly better, changing the scope, trashing it again, and so on. Practice, practice, practice. And build nontrivial things, not just toy programs. If programs get big, you MUST apply some structure.

Help desk jobs are great for learning them but going to classes about anything you are interested in person is a great start. Just get a conversation started and keep it going.

For me it makes little sense creating a custom interface if I'm just going to use it in a single map statement or something. list.stream().map(just -> use.a.lambda.here()).toList();Is there an existing built in interface that does what you need? In the StringChecker example you gave I'd probably just use Predicate instead. Predicate stringChecker = s -> s.isEmpty();The stuff in ""java.util.function"" can cover a lot of use-cases, though sometimes you actually need to create something custom (like if you needed a TriConsumer or something like that).Generally I think it's a good idea to stick with standard built in stuff if you can get away with it, codebases are generally weird enough as it is so we should be careful about introducing new homemade weird stuff unless we have a good reason to do so.Edit: oh and you don't need to define a custom interface if you wanted to use the 'Class::Method' method ref syntax Predicate predicate = String::isEmpty; Edit2: re-read your question:I tend to prefer Class::Method syntax if it's used in a ""well known"" function, and or the lambda would require more than a couple of statements as I find it gives more ""semantic clarity"" on what it's doing, but I find it can often be quite confusing if it's some custom method I'm not familiar with since then I don't necessarily know what parameters gets sent to the method.for example ""take a list, filter null, convert to uppercase, print every item to console"" list.stream().filter(Objects::nonNull).map(String::toUpperCase).forEach(System.out::println); But here I don't really know what is happening ... foo(SomeClass::bar, SomeClass::baz);",SuspiciousDepth5924,2025-07-06 22:19:33,0,learnprogramming,t3_1ltdb8b,False,

If you want to become a Full Stack Developer:Start with web development. It's beginner-friendly, highly in demand, and offers a clear path. You can follow this roadmap:* HTML → CSS → JavaScript (vanilla)* Then move to React (frontend framework)* Learn Git/GitHub for version control* Then go into backend: Node.js + Express* For databases: MongoDB or PostgreSQL* Build real-world projects along the wayThis path gives you visible, hands-on progress and prepares you for full stack roles.# 2. If you're aiming for general Software Development or Big Tech:Then continue with C++ and go deeper into Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Companies like Google, Amazon, etc., focus heavily on problem-solving and core CS concepts. Your path could be:* Strengthen your C++ fundamentals* Learn DSA topics: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.* Practice on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces* Study core CS subjects: OS, DBMS, Networks, OOP# Still confused?Try both briefly spend a week or two on web dev, and then a week on DSA.

As your manager or mentor, I would want to work with you on that preoccupation because it can be career-limiting. Your focus should be on adding value rather than making sure you are getting “credit” for every thing you do. HR would tell you that is what your compensation is for and you can document on your self-assessment for your performance review. I would never utter the word “credit” again as this all transpires.Having said that, this is a wonderful opportunity and quite flattering for anyone, never mind someone early in his career. I would suggest writing a lengthy email about your concerns. You can start it with, “As the architect of this process ….. it has come to my attention… and in order to ensure maximum success…. I want to make everyone is aware xxxxxxx” List the important stuff, like why you think this won’t scale and why each instance needs to be customized. But offer fixes to the problems as well. How can this be customized so that it does work for other departments? What work effort would be required? Be specific and as lengthy as you need to be, as you will be saving them time and possible embarrassment. Also, if it doesn’t scale, you could end up being blamed, (“who created this in the first place”)Send your email to all interested parties and cc: your boss. Again, make sure the email is emotionless, fact-based and solely focused on you trying to help the company and the team to succeed.

It touches how we roll our lives on the big picture.As humans, our likes change over time, **and this is completely fine.**Oh gosh, if only you knew how cruel it is to realize for the first time you dont like to do that activity anymore that just a couple of years ago you could do with your hands tied. Did you lose yourself somewhere?Answer: no. Actually, you still like to do it, you just dont have that blasting flame anymore, and its ok. You cant lose yourself, because you *are* yourself. But you have to know that yourself is not static, it will change. And so will you. So now, you can bang your head against the wall wondering why you are no longer the person you were 10 years ago, or you can recognize that you may have changed, and if that is the case, welcome this change with open arms. After all, this is still you. Why reject it?But I understand that everything may still feel blurry to you, as it is often the case when we have ourselves facing such big changes. So maybe you're best off waiting before moving. You know the saying, la nuit porte conseil. In your case, you may need many nuits. You already gave a BIG step: acknowledging that you may be changing. Now, give time to time, to see how this will unfold. Maybe it's just a phase. Maybe not, and you need time for your mind to recognize the change, to stick to it, to decide that you you want to live by it from now on, and to be able to justify itself to you, so that when you ask yourself why you changed, it can reassure you that you did it because it felt better that way.In any case, dont rush to find it out. A definitive position will click when you least expect. And if its just a phase, well, I think you know how to go on with your life then.If its not, remember you will feel 'empty' during some time during the transition, and this is a part of the process. Transitioning can take longer than you expect, but profit from every moment. Do things you wouldnt do in other times, and remember something really cool awaits you.

n1jzqu0,"No, for a bunch of reasons. 1. The English and Spanish speaking worlds are relatively accepting of foreigners learning the language. The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.I speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities.

n0qzoaj,"I was laid off back in Feb and am in the third week at my new job now. I have 7.5 yoe and was able to get a lot of initial interviews. I made it to the late stages with five different companies, all past the technical round. But was rejected from three. I was able to end the prices with one when I got the offer at my current job What follows is my anecdotal experience. Companies are extremely picky right now. I would feel really strong about my interview performance. I would connect with the hiring managers and the CEO or CTO. I would feel great about my technical round performance. Then I wouldn't get the role. The reasons given, because I would always ask for feedback, were typically that I performed well, but someone was a better fit. Which makes sense. There were probably five hundred or more applicants. But a few of those I would see the same job posted a week or two later, those were frustrating. My advice is to keep a pipeline going. You want a few of those initial recruiter interviews a week so that you have a couple of technical and later stage interviews going at all times. The process seems slower than it used to, like a month or longer from application to offer. And give yourself grace. This is really difficult and you are going to get down on yourself.

Compared to the Netherlands, the US is a massive country where each role and each company and each city will lead to a VERY different life. If you move to the US you might be working 80 hour weeks with barely enough to pay rent and get laid off after 2 months, OR you might work 40 hour weeks, earn $300k+, have plenty of vacation days, and stay at the same place for 5/10/15+ years. So, my advice:- Apply around to roles in mid- or large-sized cities (NYC, Seattle, Chicago, etc.)- Interview IN PERSON (do not assume anything about a company based purely on what they sell you during an online interview - make sure their success is tangible) and thoroughly research employee reviews - Only accept an offer if your gross income will be 2x the household median income or higher FOR THAT SPECIFIC AREA - Do not actually move until you have signed an offer and your start date is <2 weeks away - Keep an emergency fund of at least $30k In general, just be smart about it and you’ll be fine. Edit: just want to mention that this advice is specially for OP. Someone with less experience or who lives in the US already doesn’t need to have as high of standards.",DigitalApeManKing,2025-07-03 16:13:18,14,cscareerquestions,t3_1lqrw01,False,

n1529uf,"For some people, it's a nightmare. They might only have 2 weeks PTO, might be 100% in the office, might have a terrible company culture, are extremely low paying (less than 104k), etc.For others, it's great. They have 4-7 weeks PTO, are hybrid, or even fully remove, with a great company culture that is extremely high paying.And a million flavors in-between. There is no single concept of being a SWE in the US. There is a ton of variety.My main advice is to never move before you actually have a job lined up. Don't move to SF with the hopes that the move will land you a good job, because there's a real possibility that it won't. If you want to move to SF, look for jobs in SF, and only move once you find one you like, that meets all your personal criteria.As for COL, AI, and google searches aren't good here. Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.Compute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in. That gave me a realistic number of what it would cost for me to move, and what my COL hike would be. Find apartments you would *actually* live in.

n0z2k2t,"I had a guy like that on my team. He wanted the whole codebase changed basically and when he didnt get his way he'd go to Jr engineers PR and lightly suggest these nitpicky changes. I dont mind changing a variable name or a method name or even a small refactor in a file I am touching. Things that wont add a shitload of time to the PR. Like if im already making a change to a file and someone had a nitpick comment I think I can quickly add, ill add it. But sometimes in the cases where it is beyond the scope of the PR I think doing what Sidereel said is the way to go. Most jobs reveiw you on your PRs and output. If it doesnt have a task, then they assume you didnt do it. Even if you do it yourself, it's better to create a seperate task because now you have the proof that you worked on something. Like let's say your task involves, creating a new method in Foo class to make Foo multithreaded or some BS like that. Principal Engineer who loves to nitpick, adds ""since you are touching this file, this other irrelevent method (let's call someMethod) just doesnt look good in this file and would be better used in Boo class. Please move it to Boo class"" When you look into it, you realize Foo::someMethod gets called in a few files that could take at least an hour of your time to fix, build, test, etc. You can either change it in the current PR because it's easier than having to create a new branch, rebuild, retest, etc. But the downside is when the current PR gets checked, you wont get credit for that refactor becuase that wasnt part of the task. So your manager will see all the tasks you have completed and he wont give you credit for that refactor. He will view it as the PR took you longer than it should've. But if you create a seperate task, sure it might not get fixed right away but once you do it, you will get credit for the refactor. Software enginneering is about playing the game. A piece of advice I heard was, it's better to do two tasks and show your manager all the work you did than to do 10 tasks and not say anything about it. Some higher level engineers dont care about your career that much they care to get what they want in the codebase. They have the belief that it's on you to defend your career (which it is) and if you are going to be a pushover than so be it. I learned that mistake a little too late. When the higher level engineer ask for something, I did it with little pushback. I wasnt afraid to say something I just didnt think it was a big deal. But then my PRs had more iterations than they should've and would spend an extra day or two longer due to some of these changes this guy wanted. Guess what was said in my review session? That my PRs take a bit too long and have a bit too much iterations. Guess who told my manager that? The higher level engineer. I think if it takes too long and is outside of the range of the PR, just politely say ""I gave it a quick look. It seems that this is outside of the scope of the ticket. WE can have a quick chat and if it's really needed I can create a seperate ticket for this.""",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-07-02 17:03:15,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1lped5s,False,

I've seen plenty of introverted product managers so long as you can still articulate and do the coordination part of the role, not every product manager is the energy spewer.You can understand whether you will succeed in product management by the views you take on things as a developer.

At Slack, our most successful PM was an ex-engineer who would straight-up say, ""I don't know, let me find out"" in stakeholder meetings. That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. Your dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work.

You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. I do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next.

You can start by asking them where the holdups are and see what they say/ take it from there.

n0y05rj,"I definitely felt like this when I stepped into a team lead role a year ago, the project was a mess, and I had to rally the team, get a plan going, and deliver in a couple of months.As I've had more time with the team, I've pushed the ownership of EPIC level tasks as far down as possible. Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.When an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.At least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.Doing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant. Most of the work you are describing, could be by the people on the team with only a little coordination cost.",justUseAnSvm,2025-07-02 14:00:59,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1lpngdd,False,

There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.But, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap. For now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. When you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else.

A significant part of our job is process/red-tape. At startups, process/red-tape can be straight up non-existant. You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.But at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.All companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible. It's like Facebook's old mantra (which they've since ditched) ""Move Fast and Break Things"". Who cares if what you released into prod broke something? You'll have a patch up in 10 minutes.Established companies are more focused on keeping things stable, not distrupting their user base, staying in compliance with all the many compliance/regulations/frameworks they need to abide to to make their customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.One thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future.

Company was losing projects and it seemed I was going to maintenance hell for some time. I jumped ship to make 120k+ with stock and good bonuses. It was 3 years of mental burnout from the start. I dont regret the money I made but I somewhat regret jumping ship due to mental breakdown.IM not saying the new job will suck but sometimes there is a thing about staying at a company that treats you well even if the work slows down a bit. It happens in many companies it's on you to decide whether it's worth it or not. For 136k base pay vs 150k base pay and the options you are getting, id stay at the job. Im sure it's getting boring but you know the work, you have more job security, the people likely love you. You get 2 fridays off a month (i've done 9/80 and I love it and wish I could go back to it). I dont like including bonuses as part of pay because they are not guaranteed and it's just used as a way to get you there. So really consider it as you only make an extra 14k. Is 14k worth travelling 4 hours, having to work 5 days a week every week, potentially losing work-life balance (this is a big one), etc. At your job I know it'sa bout 22% bonus, that's amazing, you are likely more guaranteed to get that 22% at your current job than your new job because they will take into account the years you have put in good work where the new job wont give you 30% the first year because the first year they likely are hoping you catch up. Theyll give you enough to be happy but I doubt it will be 30% and who knows how much they give you in followin gyears.

n0rwqc6,"You're not dumb. From my experience, 99% of new devs (interns, salaried, contract, whatever) get that same feeling when jumping into an established company with an established codebase. No reasonable person will expect you to ""just get it"" right off the bat. Keep asking questions until it clicks. It's the only way you will learn.That said, what I wish I had done much sooner was to just spend time with the software. Poke around. Get a feel for what the user's experience will be. Try to understand what problem it is that your software is trying to solve.For me, I jumped into smart agriculture development with zero farm experience. It wasn't until I sat in a combine and just drove around for a day that I understood why x button is there, why menu z is nested in menu y, etc.From there, you can start to understand the hows and whys of the software design. Most frameworks just tackle one area (except maybe for the ""we've got it all"" frameworks like Qt), so understand what frameworks/middleware you're using and, more importantly, why you're using it.Another thing you can do it almost any industry is look at other people's PRs. Presuming the title is ""fixed a bug where x would happen when you do y"", make a chain in your head between x and y and the chunk of code that was modified. It's a decent way to start connecting those dots. Plus, informally, it looks very good if you can say ""oh yeah, I saw something about that in Tim's PR"" since it shows you're engaged and taking an active interest.On a less technical note, nobody gets mad at the new guy for asking questions because they understand it's all a lot to take in. They have all been exactly where you are right now. What people DO get upset with is a developer who has been onboard for 6 months, a year, 3 years, or whatever and still doesn't know some of the basic things. Ask questions, take organized notes.Otherwise, if you have any specific questions about the industry you're in, what frameworks you're using, etc, feel free to ask her and we can lend a hand or at least point you in the right direction!",i_grad,2025-07-01 15:35:06,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1lp4ehz,False,

Ask them about their journey and their role in the company. And then talk to them about yourself and your journey. If you like the conversation, make it a point to speak to them regularly.

n1tfr4e,"Congrats.Your first week is usually onboarding., depending on company you either talk to your manager to decide how you're first few weeks will look like or you take an onboarding course. It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.Before any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.Get your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.Sign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.As for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.Ask questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up. Edit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. Also find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there.

I joined the industry more than a decade ago, and things have already changed substantially.

What I see happening, is that in 5-10 years, programmers will be super-efficient, and our job will look more like a tech or team lead that serves as the owner for the code and interfaces with management and stakeholder.Anyway, software isn't going anywhere, it's going to continue changing, but no matter what, we're going to have more software in 20 years than we do today, and someone is going to have to build it, or at least be the person responsible for it.Job security in software doesn't come down to the coding skills, it comes down to all the non-coding skills you have. Are you experienced enough to learn new concepts? Can you lead a team? How well do you do working on ambiguous problems? Do you have a track record of producing results in difficult environments? How well do you work with others? These are the driving questions that determine employ-ability.

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.This is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.Instead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. Generally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.What you want to avoid is generic ""entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models"".Now, what can you do to enhance your resume:1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. 2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. 4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the ""under the hood"" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff.

Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.So again, don't think ""well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD"", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.Instead, I would look for jobs where you can say ""typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this"", and those are the jobs you want to apply for.

n1h2d8k,"You don’t have much leverage. If you don’t like the offer and won’t take it but you liked the process and company tell them you enjoyed meeting them and are excited about the company but you were looking for an increase in pay and a more challenging role. Tell them that what they are offering is below your current comp and doesn’t align with the role you are looking for and invite them to reach out if they find the role you applied for becomes available. Speaking to the process, I think 9/10 companies that interview you for a role and bait and switch like they have aren’t good companies to work for. What they should have done is clarified the job you were interviewing for before the first round and certainly by the second round. Clarifying the job you were interviewing for at the offer stage is scammy. There are situations where that could make a lot of sense for everyone but this doesn’t sound like that. I think the kind of company that does this is also the kind of company that says “we would like to give you a raise and we for sure will but we have to wait until next year”",AltOnMain,2025-07-05 14:21:16,17,cscareerquestions,t3_1lsas4o,False,
n1h2ws6,"That sucks man, sorry to hear that! It's a frustrating situation.It's going to depend heavily on you & your skills, and on the company. It may be that you've really impressed them, and they want you - but that they're stuck with a limited number of approved headcount and just can't do it. Or something like that. The key thing in my mind is to focus on salary, not level. If they pay you like a senior/staff/whatever, then fuck it. Take the money. Title aint shit without the money.I had a similar situation: I was hoping for staff engineer, but got a senior offer. I was up front from the beginning about my interest in the staff position: I think it's important to lay the groundwork early - if you go through everything at one level and suddenly ask for the higher, that won't go over well. Then later, at the offer stage when we talked about senior, I was clear ""Hey I started looking at these because of the salary band of this higher level - can we meet in the middle somewhere?""There are obviously no guarantees, but that's how I played it. I hope it works out for you!",olddev-jobhunt,2025-07-05 14:24:23,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1lsas4o,False,

n1h796g,"Thanks for the response. This downgrade is from staff to senior as well. I went through the whole process discussing the staff position and the hiring manager even spent a solid 15 minutes walking me through their vision for the org and what the staff role will look like over the next 12 months. I do have a bit of a bad taste in my mouth from it TBH as the staff and senior job rec is basically identical with the exception of a single line about years of experience, which I easily meet for the staff role. Fingers crossed I get more info on Monday. I was given the offer at the end of day Wednesday with no comp numbers and just an email from the recruiter outlining what I shared in my OP and a “we will talk about it on Monday”. I feel like after 5 rounds of interviews including an hour long presentation and a 4 hour panel, they should have given more info regarding the downgrade and not leave me hanging all weekend… but such is life.
