mqnpaxh,"I spent a couple of years with redshift and I would pick literally anything else. Redshift is a very black box that throws unexpected errors and is very difficulty to introspect.One of the more frustrating things it does is it can sometimes pick a query execution path that it doesn’t support depending on the tables you’re hitting. Exact same query, exact same table structure will error from one execution to the next.It doesn’t support all of SQL and I don’t mean the syntax, I mean that certain sub queries and joins will sometimes not be supported.When it encounters an error it shows up as a stack trace to an internal C file that you don’t have access to.It’s also sometimes wildly inconsistent where the compute nodes and the main node have different behaviour. You need to internalise what will run where to be able to keep track.It’s a pain in the ass to optimise things because makes it hard to turn off caching and other optimisation to be able to measure execution impact of iterating on your queries, it rewrites queries into multiple queries and makes it a pain to track down how things are getting decomposed.Redshifts feature development is very slow, and it has surface level support for things like JSON. I wish we had gone with something like ClickHouse where you have some hope of seeing long standing issues and features gaps get resolved over time.It’s also quite complex in terms of managing it, if you adopt it and actually use it you’re gonna be spending a lot of time learning things that are only relevant for redshift which is a huge time sink. One of the major selling points of redshift is the price, but when you need to spend money on salary to manage redshift that calculation may not work out in redshift favour.",kitsunde,2025-05-05 04:49:33,18,dataengineering,t3_1kf1uff,False,

The comparison isn't equivalent. Redshift in combination with other analytics services such as Athena gives better results. It is the complete AWS analytics stack which needs to be compared with snowflake and databricks, not Redshift alone. Recently AWS have begun to address this with the new Sagemaker Studio.A huge chunks of the complaints fall in this category - UX, and features which are outside of Redshift but possible with other very well integrated services. On the other hand it is true that Redshift tuning needs higher skill and detailed knowledge. A lot of people don't understand what MPP is. Or how database internals work. However if uses correctly you end up running a cheaper and more efficient system.Personally I haven't seen any ""random errors"" - I've generally been haply with Redshift.After a long time looking at such discussions I've concluded that it's usually a problem of engineers not making an effort to understand their tools properly. You can run any platform - AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, BQ. Each has its pros and cons.Good engineers will figure it out, bad ones will complain. Maybe I'm just cynical.I know people who are happy with AWS, happy with snowflake, happy with Databricks, and also others pissed off with all of them - several migrating in between different stacks.The biggest sell of snowflake is that it is an easy environment to work in, but more expensive - what you save on salaries you may spend on snowflake.

Probably came off like I was optimizing for a use case they didn’t even confirm.In hindsight, I should’ve slowed down and clarified whether they needed real-time ingestion, what the downstream usage was (e.g., dashboarding vs search vs ML), and whether historical backfill was in scope.

They will tend to do validations of type and field for you pre-transformation, have a schema mapper UI, use metadata to drive everything, load it to a destination.3) build a basic ETL tool or use some third party software to glue and piece together one. This can be a lot of work. And also ugly in its own right when building an ecosystem around a third party.Sometimes what you are dealing with is just the name of the game. Organizing workflow for all your processes will make the biggest difference. A real basic breakdown of what I like to see:1) Store the raw data, either unstructured or semi-structured, or both. (If semi structured, some of the parsing step should be broken out to accommodate first)2) Parse the data with a schema/layout (if not meta data driven, just write some sql or code. Depends on how much time you have on your hands and if you expect to support many dozens, if not hundreds of layouts. Or just 7. In which case I’d dumb it down) should initially store everything as string, imho. I personally like to stage as stricter data types when reasonable (dates are a great example), as long as I’m capturing the raw data elsewhere.3) validate parsed data with a schema/layout. (Layout-specific validations — discovering inconsistencies from customer-specific problems4) transform data (and/or structure) using a schema mapping. 5) Store the sanitized data in a staging area.6)Validate data in staging area (validations on sanitized data)7)Send valid staging data to prod.Such system still has limitations as I laid out above, but if you only need to consolidate behavior, you need to build a workflow that will validate data from source, transform the input to a common output to be loaded from, then validate data at this staging area to validate for the destination (prod).",BarfingOnMyFace,2025-05-05 15:24:11,8,dataengineering,t3_1kf6eym,False,

mqk4z85,"In theory and in practice the skill sets overlap quite a bit.MLEs do data pipeline work mostly reluctantly (though not always!), since at least 70% of the work of machine learning in a real world setting is getting the data in a good spot for all of training, serving, and evaluation.At orgs which are more dysfunctional and where management doesn't clamp down on egos and attitudes and predefined notions of role scopes, the MLEs are able to sit around doing little while complaining about the data that they should be helping to engineer. Thus, many do not actually do much data engineering, funny enough, even though they should. Overall work quality does suffer for this, so don't run your data teams like this.At well run orgs the MLEs do data engineering and share ownership of pipelines with data engineers; DEs focus more on ops and moving data to different environments and MLEs focus on transforming data, though there aren't any hard lines, and human to human collaboration is necessary.It is unusual to move from DE to MLE, the reverse is a little more common. MLE is a more competitive title: mostly because it is sexier, more people want in, also pay tends to be higher because people assume it is more skilled (I really don't feel this way; median MLE has just superficial knowledge of a few concepts and a few Python APIs, but that's another topic for another day).

I’ve seen more de move to mle but this is just my experience. There is a lot more buzz around the mle title especially past year or so. They typically split around production areas. Eg an mle may need to bring in data for a poc the de group doesn’t have in house yet. One of the two may bring it into a dev env but when the model needs to be moved into production the de team usually take over that new data source integration and the mle works on deploying the model.

But for old projects being migrated it's a very time-consuming transition.A score-based linter (like pylint) instead simply gives you a score. And it's up to you, and your automation to determine what the minimum score needs to be to merge into prod. When I had to migrate a 110,000 lines of dbt that was (of course) a nightmare, we set up a process that would automatically reject any PRs using a number of rules. Basically, the worse your code was the more you had to improve it. The PR was appended with linter failure info, and the developer had a lot of flexibility - the decisions were made at the PR level, not the file level, so the developer could have a nasty file that was hard to fix and so decided to make improvements to other files instead. We didn't care.This process allowed us to force the codebase clean up to have gradually, so it didn't cause much hardship.

mr51432,"Why would it not be? Worst case they hire you and shortly lay you off, with some money in hand and Meta in your CV?",linos100,2025-05-07 21:34:08,85,dataengineering,t3_1kh8yub,False,
mr60l73,"I was a DE in RL during 2024 and left in Jan this year, so just giving my 2 cents here.Obviously, if you don't currently have a job, the answer is yes, especially in the current market. Not much to talk about there, so I'm going to assume that you do have a job that you are hesitant on leaving because of stability concerns in RL.IMO, there are three main factors for you to consider about stability. The first is the stability in the role itself. This depends almost entirely on what org the role is hiring for. Roles supporting, say, the RL games catalog/shop might not be as stable as roles supporting login or service stability. Even the most recent round of layoffs within RL only affected those within Oculus Studios (at least, as far as we know).The second is the overall trend of RL. Lots of people online seem to have a negative view on RL's trajectory since it's been a massive money-sink for Meta, but I personally would be surprised to see real mass layoffs across RL anytime soon.The third is the stability of Meta as a whole. From what I can tell, people within Meta feel very insecure about their jobs, especially after the Feb layoffs this year. I got to witness both the Nov 2022 and this years layoffs, and from what I can tell, moral is at an all-time low right now, even compared to Nov 2022, which was almost 3x as big a layoff. Several of my coworkers across multiple teams were already on the verge of burnout before Feb, but now, people are worried about this year's layoffs happening every year. Even though everyone that I worked with at Meta seemed like genuinely good people, many voiced concerns about others stealing their work, overtaking their scope, and whatever else they need to do to get great yearly rating, because apparently even just a good yearly rating isn't good enough to secure your position, and every year, the bar raises. Given the current market and that people's livelihoods are at stake, it's definitely a reasonable concern.Without more context about your current situation, like your current TC, financial responsibilities, or personal and/or professional priorities, I can't confidently give any solid pointers, but despite all of the doom I just posted, if given the opportunity, I would advise most people in most situations to take the job. Meta rewards you very handsomely for the shit they put you through and are not afraid to promote you in just 1-2 years if you can perform. I've heard of senior engineers breaking 7 figures because of stock bonuses and the stock's performance in the market. That kind of compensation is usually reserved for staff+, and if you can achieve even just half of that for one year, the amount you earn can be life-changing. Also, as others have mentioned, having Meta on your resume is incredibly valuable.If I were you, I'd definitely at least try to get an offer. In the meantime, you can weigh the different factors in your life that you care about. You won't even have to actually make a decision until you get an offer, and even if you decide to not accept the offer, you can at least try to leverage that offer at your current job for a raise.Good luck!",YUGETBPLUS,2025-05-08 00:54:20,27,dataengineering,t3_1kh8yub,False,

My boss was very impressed with this guy during the interview process, said he had a ton of contributions to open source projects and also had a lot of personal projects. He was supposed to be very experienced, and was hired for a senior role.On his first day, early morning we have a meeting to showcase the data architecture we are proposing to a big data migration we are supposed to do in a near future (migrating old legacy on-premisse ETL to something more modern on the cloud) and the guy just sits there nodding. Didn't ask a single question, no comments or suggestions. Meeting ends, we all go out for lunch and invite him, he says ""go ahead, there's some personal stuff I need to take care off during the lunch break, see you soon"". The guy never came back. We were all shocked, ""maybe it's something I said?"", ""did he think our architecture was so bad he didn't want to work here anymore?"", etc. I was a little suspicious because in the quick small talk we had he didn't seemed like he was a very experienced programmer, so I asked my boss to send me his GitHub profile. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of repos there. I started to click in each one and... It was all just repos forked from various open source projects with ZERO changes from the guy. So he just basically just forked a bunch of random repos to impress some clueless recruiter and it fucking worked.

Also it would require for you to go back and change previously written partitions as time goes on.The functionality more so exists so say you have a massive table where you want to “evolve” the schema and/or partition over time, you don’t have to rewrite the whole table.What you are proposing could work, but I am guessing you would be incurring some performance hits because now your query execution engine has to factor in multiple partition patterns. Would be curious actually about how this turns out.What I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt. Also cost of storage is cheap which is a big selling point of Apache Iceberg in the first place.Edit: And of course anyone who needs more data will accept that increased cost and simple go to the full history table.",teh_zeno,2025-05-04 09:10:14,5,dataengineering,t3_1kedne3,False,

It means the business is going to be very reliant on you as an individual to add value whereas your current employer knows exactly what they need out of your role more than you as a person. That equates to higher ownership and getting more business forward with your soft skills. If the two are the only option, as an expected parent, I would leave for the Healthcare job. However, I would be very frank with your current employer that you want to work there long term and if the role opens up for FTE, you will come back. Keep your doors open.

I assume it is similar in Fabric, but I also think they have fixed some of the shortcomings (although added others from what I understand). I will say this, after we got everything set up it worked well and operated like most modern data stacks. We transformed all of our data using dbt-core and landed our data using data load tool (dlt) on our data lake using git self-hosted runners kicked off using synapse pipelines, data was not huge and all of the complexity was in the dbt project. We rarely were ""in"" synapse after everything started to run smoothly. I would never pick Synapse or Fabric if I was going to make the decision for a new environment. However, if it is a greenfield project and you can help architect the solution and add solid governance/naming conventions I would say it is beneficial experience.

mr3e5ik,"Sorry for a big fat ""it depends"" answer. I think decisions like this exist on a spectrum, for the sake of your question.If the ML prediction outputs are something that is very ""closely"" tied to the document records, then re-funneling things through the raw layer so that it all flows downstream, could make a lot of sense. A trivial example, would be like a ""word count""... I don't really see anything wrong with adding a ""word count"" column alongside the original raw data, especially if downstream datasets will also benefit from it.If the prediction outputs are something that is totally separate from the original records, and/or if you plan to expand your ML platform to cover more models and different kinds of predictions, then it probably makes more sense to aim for an independent architecture, use things like MLFlow for tracking/registering instead of the existing DWH governance. But there's no absolute right or wrong here, it all depends on what direction the team is going in, what kinds of skills or resources are available, etc. There's no point pursuing a ""pure"" ML architecture that is too big for you, if you are a single solo MLE and can't support it well.

My team is doing with both ML and LLM outputs following same pattern.The reporting layer for model ready inputs is also a good idea (and something my team is doing). To add the ML/LLM outputs to reporting layer, you just need a separate object in your reporting layer for the final consumption. Our ML/LLM versioning is handled outside of the warehouse (through an app we built) and ingested into the warehouse. We have a generic section of our warehouse dedicated to modeling the ML/LLM workflow that includes entities like document (text/data evaluated), the prompt (type 2 generated from app data that version controls the prompts) and the ML/LLM outputs of each version of the prompt that was used against the given 'document'. All data flows through this generic model and then flows to the various reporting layers that need it. This also provides standard building blocks for document chunking/RAG which we have built on top of this. Not sure on exactly what you mean by pushing the derived data breaks the idea of it being raw data? The point is that is raw data, totally new. Take away the ML/LLM model used to create that data, you can't regenerate that data using SQL with the data you already had in your warehouse.

mr7rzsm,"No problem with the it depends as long as it’s as well explained as yours. Thank you for the insight!Predictions right now are for example article topics. The outputs are mostly used for reporting right now and even in the case of a recommender system, ML outputs would just be stored on a feature store and repurposed for the system or other models. A first question would be, what do you mean with an ML output being closely tied to the record and how do you measure it? In a sense, all ML predictions based on articles used for reporting a related to the article itself, but how that requires funneling them again to the raw layer I don’t get yet. Another question would be tracking lineage, output versioning and handling re-edited articles. The team uses dbt for ETL and lineage tracking, I don’t know if this would influence what integration to use. Moreover, if we were to track prediction versions, this could be handled in a feature store. But the real challenge is handling re-edited articles that must be repredicted and what integration would facilitate triggering repredictions and updates into our DWH.So far the options have been funneling to raw layer or an independent architecture sourcing from the analytics core, processing predictions in an independents architecture, and the piping predictions back into the later reporting layer. Only draw back is looking the dbt-integrated lineaging creating a kinda black box effect. But then again, this could be tracked from the ML side.

mr5fc4v,"Yep, this one.The ML prediction/classification aren't part of the data flow or modelling inside the dwh. It is a downstream system that generates new data that needs to be ingested.The days going to ML might change in some incompatible way, so this allows the ML output layer to account for that, rather than breaking things at the integration point. If the data from the ML changes then that forces to raw, and it goes through a usual process of standing a schema change or a new source.Another way to think of it is that a dwh processes *never* goes backwards through the layers. That makes it extraordinarily difficult to pick where to put the ML inputs and outputs as the most sensible place to integrate the data into other models could be anywhere, or in multiple places, or it might move.

Your suggestion is that ML models would be based on the aggregated data in later layers, be processed in an independents architecture outside the DWH, and then piped into the DWH as an additional source of raw data. Correct?Since predictions of this type would be tied to a uuid (here an article id), I’m guessing it wouldn’t matter if the ML predictions table have the schema of the aggregated tables (i.e. not a product wise schema, where each product comes in as a separate source), because the predictions table could be rejoined by uuid in the aggregated tables or even earlier, while still passing through the whole generic model.

mr7py45,"> We tried testing different models but the accuracy is quite poor and the latency doesn’t seem great especially if you know what you want.It really depends on how exactly you use LLM for natural language queries. The most trivial way when you just give SQL DB schema and ask for complex SQL that should give nice result for data visualization - this really can work with an inappropriate accuracy. This task might need highly refined prompt with many instructions (and RAG) + good (large) thinking model that can give correct results.At the same time, results may be much better if context is not SQL database but data model inside BI tool and output is not SQL but rather simple report configuration (JSON), generating this kind of structured output is much easier task for LLM (even small models you can self-host with ollama!) which doesn't require thinking, in fact users can get a relevant report in seconds.From BI end-users perspective, another useful application of LLM can be assistance with report's analysis: imagine that user opens a report, and simply chooses from menu ""Get Insights"", ""Find Anomalies"", ""Analyze trends"", ""Generate summary"" and this report's data context is passed to LLM with an appropriate fine-tuned prompt. This kind of unobtrusive AI-assistance can be especially useful for users that don't have any data analysis skills.This is how AI can be really helpful from BI tool perspective - in fact we're implementing these things in our product. I have another ideas too which are more complex to implement - like ""chat with data"" (so user can ask & get exact answers, not just reports, using all reports/data models available in the BI tool).",tech4ever4u,2025-05-08 08:56:30,1,dataengineering,t3_1khapj3,False,

I add metadata columns like load time and table key+current time+attributes to give a sort of historical key that's unique over time. The insert only approach compares the last state in the dw vs the incoming state to check for any difference, and to capture deletes.- flattened view: using DBT, I copy the metadata from the raw table, then expand out the attributes object into columns.- curated view: basically select star of the above, but with descriptions, added privacy tags (for tag-based masking), etc. this is what analysts see.Why I use this approach:- it's dead simple to maintain because even if the source attributes change, the raw layer still bundles them into the object column- new columns getting captured can just be added at any time from the view, ie object:new_column- keeping the full history is auditable and allows analysts to see what they ""knew"" at a given point in time, which can be very valuable in some circumstances, e.g. seeing how long it took for user status to change.The above is a rough description so lmk if you need me to elaborate",PossibilityRegular21,2025-05-09 14:53:45,1,dataengineering,t3_1kgassj,False,

mqog35e,"Hi! I am a little experienced programmer (\~20 years), mainly in heavy-data-oriented companies (banks, governmental taxes, investment funds, energy). IMHO, DataOps - and similar teams - are costly solutions for an underrated way of seeing data.Even companies dealing with high volumes of data can use other solutions, which - although old-school - are cheaper, effective enough, and have known, stable tools. Companies have analytics teams, reporting teams, controlling teams, etc., working closely with IT. If all they deliver useful, valid data, it's good enough. DataOps as a team is another layer of organization, which requires more collaboration, more tools, more discipline, more dependencies, etc., giving unknown (maybe?) better value. Which company wants to pay for it?!DataOps should be more a general concept, a part of strategy, like DevOps, not a new role or a new team. (BTW, this is one of the reasons for failure in introducing DevOps - by a team or a role foundation.) Of course, this is very convenient for some people to have a visible ""thing"" on an orga chart, with attached obligations and maybe some KPIs, but it is not working for 99.9% of companies - I guess this level, but I will try to justify:DataOps as a team or a role is a kind of coordinator role. There are two general attitudes (it's malicious, but it's for real): first, this role is given to the least competent person, who needs to do something, but in this role can't mess up anything; second, this role is given to the most competent person, who quickly becomes a bottleneck.But there is easier, working alternative, which paradoxically is also a MUST for DataOps: collaboration between parties. Without collaboration DataOps is probably impossible. With collaboration DataOps is probably not necessary.So, if you want to look for a very niche job offered by very few companies, that are rich enough to proceed with such an experiment, and if you have very high skills in business and technical issues, you are probably a good candidate for a very lucrative contract. In other case, have a good plan B. Whatever happens, good luck!",Greedy_Bed3399,2025-05-05 09:20:08,5,dataengineering,t3_1kf454a,False,

mrd5e58,"Azure Data Factory is indeed your best approach, using metadata driven pipelines with the Copy data from multiple tables template to dynamically handle your tables. Configure the pipeline with filtering parameters to support both full and incremental loads based on your requirements. For incremental patterns, either implement change tracking on your source if possible or add last\_modified timestamps and use ADF's watermark functionality to track loaded records.If your environment includes analytics data sources, Windsor.ai offers specialized connectors that could simplify part of your ingestion requirements. Their platform can handle the complexities of data extraction and deliver it directly to your Azure SQL target.Consider implementing a medallion architecture in your dbt project, where bronze tables are 1:1 copies from your source, silver tables handle cleaning and transformations, and gold tables serve business needs. This approach separates your transformation logic from the replication process and improves maintainability. For Azure SQL optimization, implement proper indexing, partition larger tables, and use OPTION (RECOMPILE) hints where appropriate to ensure your dbt transformations perform well even without columnar storage.",Analytics-Maken,2025-05-09 03:55:51,1,dataengineering,t3_1kex93m,False,

It doesn't go overly in-depth into any one topic, but still explains a lot of things in a way that's easy enough to grok even without a CS background.

mqx2h6h,"Let's be honest with you: your programs so far were way too small to really benefit from OOP. OOP works great with huge, complex programs.Yet, there are even smaller programs that can greatly benefit from OOP - provided, you have the right use case.For me, a prime example are card games. Here OOP can really play its strengths in simple, fairly small projects.Think about what you need for card games: you need cards (obviously), you need a deck, you need players (also obviously), players have hands (the card hands, not their physical ones), and there could be much more.Exactly the nouns above: Card, Deck, Player, Hand translate very well to Classes in OOP.+ A *Card* is a class modeling a single playing card. It has a suit, a rank, potentially a numeric value, potentially, a front and a back, and it is either face up or face down. It can be flipped (toggle face up/face down), can report its suit and rank, and value *provided* it is face up, otherwise it should not reveal its values.+ A *Deck* is a collection of cards. It can be initialized, can report its size, can be shuffled, can deal 1 or more cards.+ A *Player* models a human player with a name, potentially some money, a hand (the cards they are holding), a bet, etc. Of course, it can report all that.+ A *Hand* is basically similar to a deck of cards, but always directly related to a player.When you have this fundamental classes above and add a Game class where you define the rules of the game and how the game rounds run, you can quickly whip up any card game.Even better, by just changing the game class you can make Blackjack, Poker, and many more games by reusing the other classes you have previously made.Sure, you could just as well do all that without OOP (and it has been done plenty times already), but overall the OOP code will be much cleaner, much more modular, much easier to maintain and reuse, much shorter in total than its non-OOP counterpart.Reuse is one of the advantages of OOP. Another is *encapsulation*. The outside, the program that uses your classes does not need to know anything how the inside works, how it stores its data (state). The outside always ""communicates""/""interacts"" with the class/object through well defined and limited channels, pretty much in the form of a dialogue. The program asks the class/object for something and the class responds.",desrtfx,2025-05-06 17:23:22,93,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqx7tsd,"The primary benefit of Object Oriented Programming is that objects can model the system you are programming directly. An object contains data about itself, and methods to manipulate that data, so other objects can ""communicate"" directly with it, without having to know anything about how it is built.The example you supplied is just a single method that does some procedural work on some separate data, so you don't get any benefit from doing it more object oriented.But imagine a game, where different players have different health and shield-status, different inventory, equipped weapons and so on. Every item in the game is an object, so that when one player hits another with their weapon, you don't have some central code that does all the calculation, but the Player1 object sends a message to the Player2 object, that they hit it with WeaponA - Player2 then calculates the damage delivered by WeaponA, subtracts its own shield, and adjusts their own health-level. Maybe even deciding to hit Player1 back.That is all done by code inside the Player-object, making it seem more like the objects are ""communicating"" than running a procedure.Since many processes - in games and business - can be modelled as entities communicating, OOP lends itself very well to that way of thinking, and it is ""easy"" to transfer an abstract model of a system to independent objects, than to a huge procedural program. Smaller procedures, like parsing a text, calculating shortest distances or sorting data, usually don't benefit from using OOP.",peterlinddk,2025-05-06 17:48:31,20,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqwu7xo,"The benefits wont show up much on small single person projects over a short timespan.The essence of OOP is encapsulation. Encapsulation is what makes object polymorphism possible, and it’s the core thing that distinguishes OOP from procedural and most functional programming.The point of encapsulation is that it limits how much of the system you have to keep in your head at one time. At its best, you can focus on the responsibilities of a single object and trust that other objects are doing what they’re supposed to do. This is in especially important when you’re on a team where someone else is writing those other objects.One place where the rubber really hits the road with object-oriented encapsulation is in the enforcement of invariants. An encapsulated object can make more guarantees about its behavior than a publicly mutable struct. To understand whether a struct is in a valid state you might have to look at every place that has mutated it, whereas to understand if a mutable object is in a valid state you should (ideally) only have to verify that its constructor and setters properly maintain its validity. You can think locally rather than globally.The other place where OOP has a leg up is extensibility. When you encapsulate your objects by writing to an interface rather than a concrete implementation you gain the ability to add new implementations of your interfaces which will interoperate with existing code, without having to modify the existing code. This is also very important as the project increases in scale.I’ve written a basic [blog post](https://jnkr.tech/blog/abstract-data-types-and-objects) on the tradeoffs involved in choosing between proper objects and imperative abstract data types which you might find interesting.",josephjnk,2025-05-06 16:44:57,23,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqzorfa,"To your credit most intro programming courses do a horrible job of explaining the purpose of object oriented programming. They usually try to introduce it with some flimsy metaphors of cats and dogs and bicycles and wheels and then have you memorize the four tenets: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, without really giving a good reason for why OOP embodies these tenets better than any other paradigm. To their credit, it’s difficult to see the benefits until you are seasoned enough to start working on larger scale coding projects.First, let’s get this out of the way: OOP is not strictly superior to procedural programming. Different paradigms are good for different things. We also don’t choose one paradigm over another because of performance reasons, or really anything involving the computer. Paradigms are solely concerned with how we, the humans, conceptualize the code we’re writing. At the end of the day, every program is in an imperative paradigm once it gets compiled down to machine code.Procedural programming is great if what you’re coding is best conceptualized as a procedure; AKA a series of instructions. If you’re writing a python script to run some preprocessing tasks on your ML model then it makes total sense to take a procedural approach.However, let’s take the most stereotypical application of coding, software development. Say you’re developing an app like Microsoft Word. Is Microsoft Word better described as series of instructions, or as an object? In this case, OOP makes much more sense because you are developing a *thing*, and that thing is composed of many smaller things like buttons and menus and widgets. It makes it much easier for our brains to decompose the task of coding Microsoft Word into manageable subtasks in a way that effectively reduces complexity.In reality, most languages these days include elements of many different programming paradigms, there are very few languages that are purely one paradigm. This is nice because you don’t have to commit completely to one paradigm if there are little parts of your project that would be better done in another. JavaScript mixes OOP concepts with functional programming which works well for web developers since functional programming is great for dealing with network protocols.",Quantum-Bot,2025-05-07 01:26:50,8,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqy61gc,"As somebody who has spent many years working with Object Oriented Programming (languages, codebases), I think the ubiquity of OOP is a very negative thing for programming and learning. As a tool in the toolbox it's sometimes useful, but as a default I think it works far more poorly than procedural or functional paradigms for most problems. Done cleanly it can certainly work, but it's rarely done properly and often results in much more complication than is really required.As a learning pattern it is something that really seems to ""click"" with people in theory, but implementing in practice it brings in more natural bias about how things ""really exist"" even if that doens't make sense for the actually requirements for the code.You can frequently see this with beginners who want to do something like write a game, the first thing they will is start listing out object types and quickly realize that half the time ""Enemy"" should be a ""Unit"", but other times it should be a ""Targetable"" or something and often end up with inheritance trees that look like spider webs.With practice you can learn to manage this better, but it never fundamentally changes the fact that model isn't actually that great in the first place.I think a lot of people have spent so much time hearing the supposed benefits of OOP that they have never seriously questioned that fact.",Infinitesubset,2025-05-06 20:31:47,10,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,

But once things get big, your code turns into spaghetti.•OOP is like organizing your code into boxes (objects) that hold both data and tools to work on that data. Example: a Car object knows its speed and has a method to drive(). It’s great for modeling real-world things and managing complexity.•Functional programming is like a pure vending machine—you give it input, it gives you output. No side effects, no changing internal state. You focus on functions that transform data instead of managing it.

mqzy9zm,"> my professors swear that this approach is far better than procedural programming which I used to do (they mostly cite code reusability and security as reason why)Those are good reasons, but as a professional programmer I'd say a much bigger reason is that procedural code rapidly becomes unworkable as A) the size of the project grows and B) modifications, bug fixes, and new requirements are added.In large, multi-person projects that live for years, with procedural code you inevitably get to a point where you feel like you're immobile, held in a straightjacket by the code itself. Management tells you to add a feature so buyers can be enticed to buy a new version, and the more you look at what has to change to make the feature work, the more impossible it seems.Object-oriented code is a way to manage complexity, and make it possible to add to the code without having to understand all of it. It does that by encapsulating data definitios together with the code for the operations that can be done on that data, and helping separate one object's data and code from another's.",Leverkaas2516,2025-05-07 02:20:45,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,

It is only my opinion but here we go.Employers won’t except you to know everything, but they’ll expect you to know the basics very well. The tech industry is built on tons of abstraction. In our ‘modern times’, new, complex, shiny technologies are abstracted away to a point where using them is very easy. This makes it more and more common for underlying concepts to go overlooked.An example is the frontend web development world today. We constantly see new shiny web frameworks that make the development precess so much easier, and alongside them, the big frameworks trying to catch up. And as a result we see teenagers ‘vibe coding’ SaaS apps with minimal understanding.This is a slippery slide that makes you feel productive and confident in your programming abilities. Makes you think you can definitely land a job already.In reality, most employers don’t need people who can use new tools. They need engineers who can solve difficult problems. To become an engineer you need to have a very deep understanding of the fundamentals before going into the advanced stuff. Frankly, the fundamentals are not even about one’s ability to code or use different technologies, but rather theory that you learn by reading and practicing with pen and paper.In my opinion, the best way to land a job is by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (that means reading books and studying them, not solving random LeetCode problems), Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Unix, Databases and RDBMSs, OOP, and the cherries on top - a low level language (C or C++ - understanding explicit memory management and having the need to implement everything on your own is very good for practice), and a high level language (Java, C#, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc - pick your poison).Of course ’mastering’ these concepts is subjective.

Some of those choices, like requiring all variable declarations to be at the top of the function, have been fixed, but quite a few oddities remain.Also, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and C# all adopted a fairly similar basic style. Their function declarations, for instance, can look quite similar. But that doesn't mean that the style is ""simpler;"" other languages just choose different conventions. They're languages, after all. Different languages make different choices. Go's not really much more complicated than C; it's just that its functions look a little different.

Lets take on C++ strings and string processing first, then. Try doing the basic stuff... make a string from a constant, append to it, find a substring, convert it to uppercase, and so on. All those common things you do regularly. Use only C++, no cheating and using c-string tools or the string to cstring conversion.From there, I would master the vector class. You don't have to understand the template syntax fully yet, just know that its vector variablename format and work it from there. Work the learncpp chapter on vectors hard.NOW, with your feet a little wetter, give classes and object oriented programming chapters a look, and start working that stuff.A couple of things to forget from C for a while: pointers. Just forget them for now. You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while. Iterators are OK to use. macros. Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number. As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.As you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics. For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn. If referenced, its the real value, if not, its a copy, and that is a big deal for performance and behaviors both, to get that & or not absolutely correct.

Take the alternate route**Try something completely new: * perhaps **frontend programming** (which would be a nice match for your backend knowledge), learn some React, try to build frontends for your existing backends* or **games programming** \- pick a language and framework you like, and play around with making small games - if you like designing complex programs, that can be a great challenge, and could be an excellent hobby, if not exactly job-oppertunities* or **hardware programming** \- buy an Arduino or similar small scale microcontroller, and play around with controlling lights and motors. If you feel up to it, try to do without the libraries, and learn how to actually control the hardware. Can be very challenging, but also great fun, and the physical aspect makes it feel a bit different than programming, while still giving you lots of practice.* or **app development** \- try to make small apps for your phone, small things that you can use yourself, and decide if you want to expand in to better UI or more AI once you get going.Right now there's no guaranteed direction that will make you a lot of money, so pick the one you deem most fun, and try it out.

mqcm51u,"I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and used to work as a [backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) for multiple companies including Amazon. For the list of common professions in the Computer Science world, see: https://roadmap.sh/ I'm going to go through what you wrote one line at a time.> ""So, I'm in my first year of college and honestly, everything in tech seems super interesting—whether it's web development, AI/ML, DevOps, or cybersecurity. The problem is, I don’t know which one to choose, as I don't know much about them.""You start with the foundations that they all have in common. For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called ""discrete math"" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): https://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ Also, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489> ""Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.""You don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers. Circumstances ended up choosing for him.> ""How can I try out these different fields for a small amount of time and figure out what I actually enjoy the most?""Maybe check out various subreddits, follow them, and eventually send professionals in those subreddits chat requests to ask them about their profession. To help me find subreddits, I start with a Reddit search and then use The Map of Reddit (Google ""Map of Reddit"", it's a website to help you find related or interconnected subreddits). For example, for Machine Learning there is r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning , maybe r/DataScience . For experienced developers there is r/ExperiencedDevs . For backend developers there is r/backend . There is also r/fullstack , r/WebDev , and r/frontend .

I will share withou you what situation I found myself in to better illustrate this.I am building a dashboard that will show some data like system usage, uptime monitoring and some other things. I have a Raspberry Pi with a display set up for this and it will live on my desk so I can quickly reference it if needed.I needed to get the usage data from my PC to the Raspberry Pi and the solution I found was quite simpler than I initially expected: I made a Windows client that just sends data to an API and I configured a webserver on the Pi.I still needed some data from the Windows client to see if any relevant events occur, like loosing connection, getting an error or anything that should happen at runtime I would like to be notified about, maybe a few simple configurations. So I decided to make the application run headless, but having a tray icon. This helped me have a few settings in the tray menu, simple toggles, on and off. For the messages that communicate my client application’s state I chose to use notifications. So like this I have settings and feedback from the application without any actual UI.Of course it is more of a particular case creating a dedicated web server, but I eanted to ilustrate to you that there are some (maybe non-conventional) solutions, other than doing the interface in Python. I have also thought about implementing some logic on the webserver so it could send some data as a response that would trogger some change in the client’s behavios behavior. That would basically move the configuration from the tray menu to the thouchscreen display of the Pi. There are solutions, just think of what is best for your use-case!As for my reasoning, I think Python is more of a backend oriented language.

In all modern languages, strings are immutable and handled by the runtime, which means that comparing one string to another is as simple as comparing two addresses - it is as fast as comparing any other value!",peterlinddk,2025-05-06 06:42:06,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kfwzc6,False,

mqvbw4y,"There are many goals to writing a program. Many beginning programmers want to emphasize speed, but it can be misleading. In particular, programs already run very fast. The idea of fixing a slow program because you believe long if statements make it slow is often termed as premature optimization (not the specific reason, but any reason you think a program is slow).It's often more important that a program be readable if it's fast enough, and likely, it's going to be fast enough. If you have evidence it's running slow, then you can look at *profiling* a program. This means using a program called a *profiler*. Many beginners still choose to optimize without a profiler because it's just one more tool they need to learn, and they'd rather guess what's slow.If you insist, you can create a HashMap (or whatever C# has) that maps the command string to a something that implements a Command interface. You can pass the command line and the args. interface Command { void runCommand(String command, SomeType lineArgs); }Replace `SomeType` with the actual type.You would create this map in an initialization phase (static constructor, say). You'd do something like // commandMap is a hash map Command obj = commandMap.get(commandName); obj.runCommand(commandName, lineArgs);It is a bit more complicated to get this set up, but not a whole lot more.",CodeTinkerer,2025-05-06 11:56:49,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kfwzc6,False,
mqw6jg4,"If you're only 4 deep into an if/else chain and worrying about the performance implications of using a switch instead I know two things:A: You are prematurely optimizing. Don't worry until you have a reason to worry. Why are you thinking about this now? What does the loop do? Do you have a hard time constraint you are trying to stay within? Don't optimize prematurely. That doesn't mean you should write fast and shitty code, just that you need to learn the optimal amount of ""should I consider this now"" vs ""note this as a place to consider if execution time becomes and issue"".I am a firm believer in not putting off refactor if you see problems, but beyond keeping good, clean, defensive coding practices, overthinking problems that haven't even presented themselves yet will just drive you fucking crazy.B: You have decided to listen to random people give you ""this is how it is"" advice instead of exploring and learning about how if/else and switch might differ in the resulting assembly. Stop letting other people answer your questions with other things you don't understand. The internet is full of fucking nonsense, and I read TONS of it being given as confident ""this is how it is"" programming advice when the reality is ALWAYS more complicated and nuanced. Get curious. The answer to your question is out there and well explained by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.Anyway, what you are doing is fine. Using a switch might make it look a little cleaner if it gets longer. I would also look up using function pointers and a dispatch table, more as a thought experiment. Function pointers seem outlandish at first but are an amazing tool to be comfortable with. If you want to DM me at any point, I do light tutoring for free and I think this is a cool problem to talk about a few interesting design patterns.edit: I dropped the term ""function pointer"" in this without thinking language.

I give it the plan and just have it fill in some of the details.But even then, I have to check it very carefully. It quite often gets something wrong, especially the longer the code gets. Like, it might have two functions that both look right if you look at them separately, but if you look at the program overall you realize that one is interpreting a certain parameter exactly the opposite as the other one is.* How do you *stay intentional* while working with AI tools?I often add things to my prompt like: don't give me all of the code, just discuss the approaches. Or: before coding this, think of lots of clarifying questions and keep asking me them until you're confident that the spec is unambiguous.I like to help get the AI started, I define the class names, method names, and variable names as a starting point. It's really good at taking my lead and following a similar pattern. That way things are written the way I want, and mistakes jump out more than if it's not my style.* Do you treat AI output as a first draft, or as something to deeply understand and improve?Again, if I don't fully understand it, I don't trust it. That means my homework is to research what I don't know first.When I do understand it, I often ask AI for several modifications, then take it as a draft and modify it to my own style.",dmazzoni,2025-05-09 01:14:13,26,learnprogramming,t3_1ki64b7,False,

mrdgxwk,"I think most people here know at this point that AI can't do the whole job for us. It's excellent at code completion, i.e. guessing what you probably are going to write next. Anything beyond that and you have to be very skeptical with what it's giving you. It will confidently tell you exactly how to fix a problem, even if the solution isn't remotely correct. It's also an excellent rubber duck and sanity checker. Ask it small simple questions about syntax or common paradigms to refresh yourself. Always keep in mind it can be wrong, even on simple things, even when it sounds very confident, and think critically about its responses, don't trust it blindly. The thing about ""coding"" is that it's the easiest part of the job that is software development. AI can and often will write functional and efficient code for common problems, but your job as a developer is to figure out how solutions to common problems can come together to be a useful application/tool/interface. So use it to help speed you up on things you want to write, when you already know what you need to write, but don't rely on it to just magically know that right way to wire up a class to do something specific in a way that works with your application. One tip: I'm a big fan of asking AI to review the ""intent"" of my code. I'll ask it to examine a section of code and give me its impression of what it believes the developer who wrote the code was intending for it to do, and how they likely intended to use it. I do this to fact check myself, and make sure I didn't just spend a half hour writing nonsense that doesn't do anything remotely close to what I thought I wanted it to do. Again, always keep in mind it can be wrong, but use its response to figure out if an external viewer might see your code differently than how you do. It should be noted, comments and variable names can heavily skew the output sometimes. It's often not worth the effort, but I have occasionally deliberately obfuscated my code before asking it to review it, to make sure its impression isn't being colored by the hints in the naming or comments. The flip side of that is that sometimes you can ask it to identify when naming or comments are confusing in light of what the code is actually doing.",Enerbane,2025-05-09 05:30:43,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ki64b7,False,

mr3d3ru,"Whenever someone says ""possible"", they usually mean ""likely"". For example, someone could ask ""Is it possible to play in the NBA?"". The answer is ""Yes, it's possible, because people play in the NBA"", but it is nearly impossible for almost everyone.The odds that you can become a front-end developer are far greater than being in the NBA, which means it's hard to guess whether you can or can't. That's the risk you take. You have to be willing to spend time to get good regardless of whether you make it or not. There are hundreds of thousands of people that want to play in the NBA, and they try really hard. Fortunately, many can play at a much lower level (for fun, at a high school, in college, etc) and so they can gain some satisfaction in doing that even if they can't earn millions of dollars. They want to believe they can make it, which is why they try. You have to delude yourself that you can, until enough evidence presents itself that you can't (or you lose interest).A potential problem with your dream is why you haven't started it. If you are second-guessing yourself (""Should I do it or shouldn't I do it? What are the odds I will succeed?""), then you can run into trouble. Either you have to convince yourself that you are good enough to do it, or you have to say you're going to give it all you've got and not worry whether you're good enough or not because those kinds of worries just stop you from making progress.And really, that's the danger. Once you have doubts, and they start to impact whether you'll learn enough, that can stop you. If you had other goals like ""I want to write a small program to play checkers or a simpler game"" then those goals are more achievable right now.I would consider picking a smaller, reachable goal right no, such as, I'm going to spend 3 months taking some online programming course, and see how I feel. If I am still motivated, I'll continue to work on it, rather than make that decision now before you even start.",CodeTinkerer,2025-05-07 16:47:14,45,learnprogramming,t3_1kh15qe,False,

Do not listen to people saying straight out ""no"", or ""not possible"", or ""not in current market"", they are **fucking idiots**.

I mean for real, ask yourself this: ""If i spent 16 hours daily learning, and live & breath programming every day, including weekends and holidays, then would I be able to catch-up and get a job?"". If you frame it like this, then obviously the answer is yes. It's the same concept when people ask you: ""What are the chances that you make 1m$ this year?"" And majority people respond ""1%, 2%"". Then shift the perspective - ""What are the chances you make 1m$ this year, or else your entire family dies?"" Suddenly everyone answers 100%. It's not the goal or timeframe, it's the perspective. My point is, anyone that is so closed minded to give you a definitive answer to a question that is so open-ended, is a dumbass.I am completely self-taught in everything I have done in my life. I dropped out at age of 16 from high school to pursue business, and when my peers were getting their bachelors, I was buying a new apartment.

I wanted more stability in life, where I still make great money, but not at cost of all my time and health. So I started learning programming to transition, and mind you I started in 2024.

Until I realized that there is future, but only for people who put in the work, and don't spend their time worrying on reddit.

mr61m3y,"I started my professional career with Java. I had written code in some other languages before this. Technically I started with BASIC but I would say that Java was the first language I learned to code in at a professional level.If you have a particularly good reason, like somebody being able to support you, like you have described, then there is no real reason not to start there.That said, in isolation, I would say no. The language designers at Oracle have done a reasonable job of bringing the language up to modern expectations but there is a lot of history there and backwards compatibility to maintain and I think that has resulted in some less than optimal things.The Java platform (distinct from the language) is great, there is a huge ecosystem, lots of libraries and the JVM has some of the most clever engineering that you'll find anywhere. It's a nice platform, but if a person I knew was starting today, and wanted to learn Java platform development I would probably suggest Kotlin over Java. You can still use all of those tools and libraries and run on the JVM but I think it is a nicer way to express yourself and has some really useful features.Independent of even the JVM, i'd probably say that Python is perhaps the best absolute beginner choice. At the risk of upsetting some Python people, I think Python is the closest modern, widely used language to the BASIC that I started with. Obviously people use it for insanely complex stuff (ML in particular) but the syntax is pretty simple and the much maligned, 'meaningful whitespace' feature is actually not bad when it comes to instructing people on writing readable code. The people who complain about Python's indentation semantics are typically indenting their non-Python code in the same way, or their IDE is doing it for them.

In any job, you are going to have good points and bad points. And as real professionals, though, we must find ""stomach"" to cope with the unenjoyable bits as well, at least in a professional manner.There are certain types of programming that are enjoyable for some folk and not to others. For example, Web Development, Frontends, etc. Some people really enjoy doing that kind of work, and others find it kind of dreadful or annoying. You have to learn what kind of programming or systems ""get you up in the morning"" as it were.But if you don't enjoy programming ITSELF, then I'm not sure what can be done. There are always annoying parts to the craft, as well, but once you have done it for a while you know you can get ""to the goal"" and that is always a good feeling for me. For example, if you don't understand how something works yet you need to understand, then that is annoying at first, but you know that you can eventually ""get it good enough"" to accomplish the task. Or, if you are in a greuiling debugging session then again it's frustrating, but with experience you know that you can either find the bug eventually (even if it's just one dumb typo) OR can find it or learn to find solutions to work around it if it is too elusive. In any case, once you achieve these goals, it's ultimately going to trigger dopamine in the brain and will become addictive in a good way (basically a self-fulfilling positive cycle in psychology).

If you have to really stop and read it, or read it a few times to understand what it does, then your code is not readable.* If you would read it in about a year of not touching this code, would you understand easily what it does? It's easy to read it when you know all the context and all the considerations that are part of it, but you will eventually forget it. What happens then?* Is it easy to understand *why* something a code does something? For example, you do an if check for a specific value. Is the *reason* why we do this value clear? If it's not clear, then a comment should explain it.* Is the code efficient? No need to over-optimize, but we can at least not repeat things that don't need to be repeated. For example, if you need to fetch something that doesn't change during your flow, fetch it once and use it for all relevant operations, rather than fetching it over and over. Same can be said for complex calculations.* Is the code going to external APIs too often? Most APIs are rate limited, and you don't want to overdo it in order to prevent being blocked. Even if a single flow works, what happens if the flow is invoked a few times by multiple users? Some APIs also charge you for each API use, so you want to keep costs down.* Is the context of a flow clear? For example, say a user updates their details and clicks ""Save"". Is it easy to know what user triggered this flow, when, and how? How do you know you're not accidentally saving over the wrong user's data?* Logs and tests: this is for the real world rather for academic tests, but good to keep in mind. Are there useful logs placed in strategic locations in the code to make it easy to follow along a log trail if something goes wrong? Are there tests to make sure that your flow works?Following those points will make sure your code is in at least in a pretty good condition.

mqvl0qi,"Programming probably feels hard to you. Although many disagree, think of it like learning a foreign language, say, Japanese (let's pretend you don't speak). Or if you studied a foreign language, ask yourself how long it took. Was it just magic that you learned it? Probably not.Learning to program is somewhat similar. You start from basics and progress from there. Maybe the a-ha moment is understanding how a program runs or making your first algorithm, but it isn't a single a-ha moment, and it doesn't mean one day you don't know how to program, and the next day you're churning out code.There's always new stuff to learn (whether you choose to or not) and it's done in steps. Have you ever seen people who draw really well. Sometimes they post their drawings over the years from stuff just better than stick figures. Sure, maybe there's a year it starts to take a big leap forward, but there's often more progress after that.We all want shortcuts, but they aren't always there.For a recommendation, try (web search: `MOOC Java`). This is a free course in Java. You can do it in C# instead, but if you do it in Java, there's automated grading. The key is to do all the programming exercises, and not just read.

There can be confusing, but they still really just boil down to these core ideas. Eg ""ternaries"" are just short-hand conditionals.

mqxyiaf,"you can send the data in an email in csv format without any real programming, but you won't need an exe type program for that either. It can probably be done with just some really snarky batch file, depending on what exactly you have and what exactly you need to do beyond the stated stuff. I highly recommend looking into this idea. The learning curve is very low, just poweruser stuff instead of full on software engineering level. that said, a windows .exe file is generated by turning a programming language (the stuff YOU write) into machine code (the .exe file), which is done by the tools (compiler and linker for example in C++) for that programming language. Some languages are 'interpreted' and do not make an executable program, but instead run directly from the source code. That may also be ok for your needs, but any computer using the program would require the tools to run it, which are not default installed on windows. A windows program that makes actual windows (the GUI) take more know-how, as you have to learn the tools to make the windows and widgets on them. This can be little more than glorified drag and drop to build, but even so, there is some learning curve to it. If you don't do those things, the program will be a 'command line program' and work under the cmd shell (dos shell) that you may or may not use (its part of windows). Such programs just accept typed text and print out response text to the shell, 1980s style. Even when you make a windows exe, the target computer may need something you used -- its often a shocker to beginners that other computers lack the debug libraries so debug mode executables won't usually run on other machines.

mqwxcvd,"If you’re on Windows, just start with Cygwin; it’s very similar to a Linux, but it runs natively on WinAPI without blocking it from you. (Properly, it’s a POSIX operating environment.)MinGW comes with some of the same gunk, even forked from Cygwin, but gives you a much thinner shim around WinAPI, which ranges from irritating to miserable for beginners. (E.g., the Windows environment of the NT kernel—now the sole one AFAIK—has two separate subsystems, console and graphical, and they expose slightly different APIs and behaviors. Cygwin matches other Unixes in model and behavior, which means you can follow Unix tutorials, and if you’re careful with `LONG` vs. `long` you can probably follow some Windows ones too.)WSL2 is another option, but it’s stood off from Windows itself by a hypervisor, which means you don’t get good access to things inside the Linux domain from outside or vice versa.Otherwise, chances are you’re already on Unix. Apple’s Darwin (incl. OS/X→macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, etc. ad ridiculam) is in the FreeBSD family, which derives from Jolix which is a clean-room BSD/Net2 Unix. Linux wasn’t forked from anything, but its kernel tends more towards the AT\&T family of Unixes culminating in System V, rev 4 (SVr4). Android is a variant of Linux using Bionic as libc and very little in the way of shell environment; desktop Linuxes tend to use the GNU libc and environment, of which Bash and GCC are also constituents.On Android, you can install F-Droid and thereby Termux and Programmer’s Keyboard; immediately run `pkg update && pkg upgrade`, then you can install your preferred packages. Termux layers GNU onto Android, giving you a rough, subordinated desktop Linux environment.For desktop Linux, I use Neon, which is an Ubuntu variant for KDE, which is my preferred windowing environment; Ubuntu is a vast family of Debian-based distributions, so pretty much anything major will do—Mint is supposed to be reasonably good, but you do you. Konsole (part of KDE, but runs anyway) is imo the best terminal available on Linux (also works for Cygwin and Win-per-se); open it up, start a [shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), and you’re good. If shit ever breaks, Ctrl+Alt+Fkey will usually drop you to a lower-level terminal, so monkeying is never far away.Most Unixes uses Bash for their interactive shell nowadays, though POSIX mandates certain characteristics for the baseline shell environment, and older systems tend to have their own, quirky Bourne shells. IIRC modern Linux tends to use Ash or Dash for POSIX and startup scripts via /bin/sh—Bash used to be used everywhere.For editing, Kate (also KDE) is a very good GUI (MDI) editor for getting started with, but I strongly recommend you at least install Vim and start learning the basics, whether or not you use it for day-to-day work. It comes with a built-in tutorial, and it’s pretty straightforward to pick up. Very useful when you’re three ssh forwards deep, trying to resurrect a very custom, in-flight supercompute batch job, for example.So that’s 1½ languages to start with, Bash and Vim.I’d probably start in on a C tutorial, also—prefer GCC or Clang; under no circumstances should you use MSVC for C or C++ unless you’re being paid to or have no choice in the matter. Also, I’d recommend staying away from full IDEs in general for just now, since you don’t need all the extra trappings. Build directly from command line, and try to engage directly with the terminal where it’s not counterpurpose. Get a feel for imperativeness.IIRC for Apple, you get a Clang-in-GNU’s clothing with XCode, but I don’t do their nonsense so that may have changed. XCode itself is a …fine editor, but probably overkill for your purposes—syntax highlighting will often not line up with what the compiler actually sees or does.On Linux and Cygwin, you go through the usual package management tools for compilers, or build them yourself if feeling adventurous. `pkg install gcc` for Termux, `pkcon install gcc` for Neon, `apt-get install gcc` for Ubuntu, `yum install gcc` for RedHat, and Arch has its own, fancy mess.If you install all the goodies—sometimes from separate foo-doc packages accompanying foo—you should have Bash `help` built-in command, a `man` command to acess manual pages (e.g., `man man` for man’s manpage), `whatis` and `apropos` to search for manpages, and `info` to browse the info manuals. (E.g., `man gcc` tells you how to run the `gcc` command, and `info gcc` tells you how to use it. /usr/share/doc may also have some goodies.)I recommend installing the POSIX manpages alongside native, where available, and bookmarking or downloading the 2001–2004, 2008–2018, and 2024 editions of the [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/), which is what you aim for if you want your code to be portable to other OSes in the Unix family. (Links to prior versions at bottom of that index page—only 2001/12, 2008/09, and 2024/05 editions are recognizable from within the C-language build environment. You can also find 1988 and 1990 versions as FIPS-151-1 and FIPS-151-2, FWTW and FTTB.)If you learn C, K\&R’s *The C Programming Language,* 2ed (1988—not 1ed from 1978) is the usual approach vector, and you can easily find free copies to work from. It’s a bit out of date, but so is most C software, and you can push forwards from C89 pretty easily using the draft standards, or backwards using XPG, TCPL/1ed, and compiler manuals.[ISO WG14](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is presently in charge of the language (qua ISO/IEC 9899), so they produce standards docs that form the backbone of the language. The final drafts are effectively equivalent text for free, so they form the most portable layer undergirding the language, and then dialect extensions (e.g., GNU, MS), POSIX and X/Open, and other environmental stuff layers atop that. If you want to know whether something ought to be “legal” or not, start at the standard for your language version and then look at your compiler and ABI manuals for how the blanks are filled in.Good luck! I’d probably run through to pointers, then take a dip into assembly and come back, but delve however you like. Most of the system software is in C or C++, and if you’re on Linux, the source code is readily available to explore and play with, so you can reconstruct pretty much everything to your choosing.",nerd4code,2025-05-06 16:59:30,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kfuc30,False,

mqlm2p6,"Yes you can, you were already on the correct path: A simple recursive pseudocode for the standard towers of hanoi problem where the tower has n disks on start, you have an empty temporary middle and want to move it to the end would look like: function hanoi(n, start, end, temp): if n = 1: move the 1 disk from start to end else: hanoi(n-1, start, temp, end) // move 1 disk from start to temp and recurse move the 1 disk from start to end hanoi(n-1, temp, end, start) // move 1 disk from the temp to the endSo lets do a simple correctness proof:Obviously, it holds for n=1: If there is only 1 disk, then the base case is valid by definition: we move the tower to the end, done.Next: Given the inductive hypothesis holds for n disks, the induction step is now P(n) -> P(n+1)Lets put P(n+1) in and we go to the else branch:* hanoi(n+1-1, start, temp, end) is exactly the hypothesis assumption: this validly moves the n smallest disks from start to temp via end.* After this call, our state is start only has one disk and it must be by definition the largest disk at the bottom, temp has n stacked disks that are all smaller than the (n+1)th disk of start and the end is empty.* we move the largest (n+1)th disk to end, this does not change the order or violate any property* After this call, end has only one disk and it must be by definition the largest disk, temp has n stacked disks that are all smaller than the (n+1)th disk.* hanoi(n+1-1, temp, end, start) is again exactly the hypothesis assumption: It validly moves n disks from temp to end via start.* So now, the (n+1)th largest disk is at the bottom and all the other disks are at the top.

I would urge programmers to think about code this wayI would also say that induction and recursion are two sides of the same coin, basically opposites. Recursion takes a case and breaks it down into sub-cases until it gets down to a base case. Induction does the opposite - builds from two base cases every possible sub-case.You can prove your code is correct by doing an induction proof on it - proving the base cases are correct, assuming the recursive calls will provide the right answer, and proving your call will produce the correct result. You can also do this with runtime complexity or amortized analysis. A simpler example is something like merge sort. If you can show ordering 1 element works and is ordered, then show that you can correctly merge two ordered sub-lists into an ordered one, you can prove that your code orders the entire array.

mqgxrd3,"Hey exact same boat here, untreated ADHD, graduated in December from WGU and work full-time as a mobile diesel technician with an ever changing schedule. I hit it extremely hard with the job search and have only had two interviews first one for full-time junior dev, I bombed. Second one, was an internship at the same company, position got pulled because the current state of our economy. That really killed my motivation.After that I pretty much didn’t touch my laptop until about the middle of March, where there was the first local in person hackathon in my city. I signed up and started to get excited about programming again…and then extremely nervous, because up to that point I realized I got through the degree because the “thought process” & “project requirements” were given to me pretty much on a silver platter. With a mediocre grasp on the fundamentals and no real problem solving experience I didn’t want to look incompetent in front of people that were likely much younger and realistically more experienced than me. So, I went to roadmap.sh and started from the beginning with JavaScript. I got reacquainted with the basics and nuances and went to the event, I was in a group of 4, one took building out the frontend, ironically another guy was currently enrolled with WGU as well and he took the backend, the other was our pitch person and that left me as a floater to just help wherever I could. This was the absolute best position for me! the frontend was next.js/tailwind, backend was spring boot with a Postgres db. I remembered enough about the backend and how everything “worked” that I was able to help there anytime our backend guy got stuck or needed a break and was able to pickup right where he left off, having used typescript at WGU and refreshing my js knowledge I was able to figure out enough of next and tailwind to be helpful there too. This helped in a few ways. Building a fullstack app with stuff I hadn’t used and people I don’t even know in 48hrs showed me 1.) I knew more than I gave myself credit for and 2.) I’m capable and genuinely have a love for programming. We lost but since then I have been steadily keeping detailed notes on project ideas that pop in my head at any given time, so I can work through how to actually get started building them and make it a point to spend the downtimes at work to study, listen and consume tech related things and then when I get home in the evenings even if it’s something as simple as writing a function that does something trivial or solving a problem on codewars, I try and code at least something everyday to make it habit. So far I’ve been able to stay pretty consistent with that. Now that WGU has MSCS programs I’m planning to enroll for that to give me a tangible goal and something to work towards since I doubt the job market is going to turn around anytime soon and I want to gain additional skills in a structured way.I know most of the advice floating around is to network, grind leetcode, move cities, etc, but for some of us that isn’t a possibility at the moment and I say find some way for you that makes you excited to get home and build that project or learn that tech stack or concept and keep getting better a little at a time until you finally get the opportunity to make the career change!",AnteaterAvailable571,2025-05-04 01:57:17,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ke6ces,False,

mqqaqys,"From the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/ranges-indexes):>A range specifies the start and end of a range. The start of the range is inclusive, but the end of the range is exclusive, meaning the start is included in the range but the end isn't included in the range. The range \[0..\^0\] represents the entire range, just as \[0..sequence.Length\] represents the entire range.[A comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54092520) on stack overflow contains some sorta lost info on how this came to be:>We decided to follow Python when it comes to the from-beginning and from-end arithmetic. 0 designates the first element (as always), and \^0 the “length’th” element, i.e. the one right off the end. That way you get a simple relationship, where an element's position from beginning plus its position from end equals the length. the x in \^x is what you would have subtracted from the length if you’d done the math yourself.>Why not use the minus (-) instead of the new hat (\^) operator? This primarily has to do with ranges. **Again in keeping with Python and most of the industry, we want our ranges to be inclusive at the beginning, exclusive at the end.** What is the index you pass to say that a range should go all the way to the end? In C# the answer is simple: x..\^0 goes from x to the end. In Python, there is no explicit index you can give: -0 doesn’t work, because it is equal to 0, the first element! So in Python, you have to leave the end index off completely to express a range that goes to the end: x... If the end of the range is computed, then you need to remember to have special logic in case it comes out to 0. As in x..-y, where y was computed and came out to 0. This is a common nuisance and source of bugs.>Finally, note that indices and ranges are first class types in .NET/C#. Their behavior is not tied to what they are applied to, or even to be used in an indexer. You can totally define your own indexer that takes Index and another one that takes Range – and we’re going to add such indexers to e.g. Span.

There's a lag while the data is being fetched and then the page updates. During that lag, there's nothing to indicate that anything's happening.The low-grade way to fix this is to put a spinner or loading bar on page while you wait for the content to be fetched. The much better way of doing this is to render the page on the server. Modern frameworks allow you to do both without much difficulty, especially if you're using Node or Deno to serve your website, and you can also progressively load content over XHR now.I noticed that when I resized the window from a mobile width back to desktop width, the layout was odd. This implies that you're building the page with JS rather than relying on CSS media queries to lay the page out at different screen widths. Ah, `determineLayout` confirms it! You can do a lot more with CSS than you might realise.I see your firebase keys are in your JS config. I guess that means I can use your database at your expense? These should be on the server. At the very least, stick them inside a JWT.Your JS is nice and clean. The way you're populating the DOM is satisfactory for a site this small, but even here, you should be able to reuse components. For example, you have lots of functions that build back buttons (""back to categories"", back to foobar"", etc). Try and make a single function for that. See if there are other opportunities for code reuse.Also think about using the CSS `:hover`pseudo-selector to make it clear to the user what elements are interactive.

Here's my workflow for learning something new:1) Get a tutorial, not a simple youtube video, but a proper one. a LONG one that explains all aspects. I usually go to udemy.com and find a fairly new (don't want old code), highly rated tutorial on the language/framework/library/etc. If it's a big topic, it should be 20-30 hours long at least. Never pay more than $15-$20 for a tutorial, if there isn't a sale, wait a few days or use ""incognito/private"" mode and they will create sales, udemy adds sales for new users, once it knows you the sales are less common. 2) Go through the whole tutorial following along. Write out EVERYTHING They write. Dont' just watch, Human brains remember better the more senses we use. Watch it, write along with them, and even better, try explainign the concepts you're learning to someone else out loud, even if there is no one else, explain it to the wall. The more senses you use when learning, the more you remember. (The brain thinks it must be important if you're doing so much to learn it)3) NOw that you're done and have forgotten half of everything you learned, the tutorial becomes your documentation for your own project. So how do you start making a new app with this language/framework? it's in the tutorial. How do you display text on the page? It's in the tutorial, find it, do it. How to make a list with a for loop, in the tutorial. How to make it dynamic? In the tutorial. You see the point. One tutorial should include almost all you need to create a new app.4) The most important thing to remember with coding, is you aren't making a full calendar/Todo app, you're just doing things one step at a time. Write out everything you need to do. ""I need a todo list to show"" - too much. You need to display text. You need to display an array of text. you need to display an array of text that is dynamically created. step by step. Do each simple step first, only move to a more complicated step if the simpler step is working. Most good tutorials will do the same thing. You'll start with hard coding text, and doing things manually, then they will show better practices that are dynamic or customizable. That's how all coding works. Start simple, then step by step work towards more complexity.> i get hit with these thoughts but they are different like: ""what if the code does not work, i don't think you will be able to figure what to do, its not worth it because you will be looking for 3 hours for answers about a error in badly designed code"". Then you have to quit. ;) Seriously, again, we all get it, but you have to ignore it. It's the naysayers in your head, tell them to shut the f**k up and do it anyway. Yeah you might waste three hours doing it wrong, but then you know what not to do next time and that's how we learn how to do it right.I read a article about a reporter asking Thomas Edison how annoying it was to create 300 failed light bulbs. Edison replied he never failed, he found 300 great ways to not make a lightbulb and only after learning what not to do did he know what to do. If you're not failing, you're not learning. I just build a backend for my Vue app with tons of security. Had a great flow for CSRF tokens (Cross Site Security tokens), when I deployed to production it all failed. Turned out the CSRF token wasn't working with my sessions. so I changed the csrf library, and it didn't work with my authorization library. So I switched libaries again and it didn't work at all. A week of failures. But I learned certain libraries don't work well together so I wont use them like that again, and I learned other ways like Authorization bearer tokens which can replace csrf tokens (somewhat), so now becuase i failed, I know new ways to do the same thing for future projects, and I know certain libraries I shouldn't be using anymore.>When i look for help from different places without asking anyone, i am bombarded withDon't get a million tutorials teaching a million things, get one that teaches you everything at once.

mr8phru,"I’m a software development manager, and I’ve had to give that kind of feedback before. The reality is, every task comes with drivers and constraints. If the business wants something done, it’s because it provides value—but that value only matters if the costs (like time and effort) don’t outweigh the benefits.If your manager brought this up, I hope they were direct about it. There should be no mystery here. Understanding the ""why"" behind the feedback is important: it's often about balancing quality with efficiency.Here’s how you can tackle it:1. **Improve your estimating skills.** Be realistic about how long tasks will take, and speak up if the deadline is too tight.2. **Include contingency in your estimates.** Plans rarely go perfectly—account for interruptions, unexpected challenges, and even just bad days.3. **Prioritize effectively.** Focus on the essentials first—what absolutely needs to get done. That way, if setbacks happen, you can adjust without missing the core requirements.4. **Apply the 80/20 rule.** Recognize that 20% of the work usually delivers 80% of the value. Tackle that first, and you’ll find the rest often falls into place more easily.Finally, self-assess and seek guidance. Understand your manager’s expectations, find a mentor for candid feedback, and always keep sharpening your skills—not just new ones, but fundamentals too.The goal isn’t just to avoid criticism; it’s to become more effective and confident in your work.**Addendum:** Before I get waves of criticism—yes, I did use AI to help generate this response. But let me be clear: every thought and idea here is my own.I’m mentioning this because, fittingly enough, I often struggle with being too slow and too detailed when writing responses. To address that, I use GPT by giving it an outline my points, tell it my preferred tone, and have it draft a response efficiently. I’ve given it instructions on how I like to communicate and trained it to match my general style.Some might be offended by that, but the reality is: this technology is here. I’m using Reddit as a learning ground—not just for discussions but for honing my ability to work with emerging tools. If we don’t learn how to use it effectively, someone else will. Personally, I’d rather be ahead of that curve.This is the same technology that is being integrated into software development tools and can be a great factor in increasing productivity--and increasing performance expectations.

Instead make two, say one that focuses on whatever your strengths are(if your internships were more backend or data whatever) and the other more general jack of all trades. Try your best to schedule out your job searches. Meaning, you spent x hours applying then stop. You're already burning yourself out and it isn't working.

The idea that you could cut comp by 50% and increase workload by 50% without a mass exodus is pretty disconnected from how labor markets actually work. Engineers aren't stuck in one company or even one industry. Talent moves. Fast.Tech compensation is high because demand is high, the skillset is hard to build and maintain, and the impact on business is massive. If one company decides to nerf pay and crank up workload, that’s a gift to their competitors. Good devs won’t just stick around out of loyalty or passion; they’ll walk. Even the ""not-so-passionate"" ones are often very competent, and they know their market value.Could there be some cooling in salaries over time? Sure, especially as markets mature or we hit saturation in certain roles. But some exec ""overheard"" saying they want to halve pay and work people harder isn’t a signal of an imminent industry collapse, it’s a signal they’re going to lose talent fast if they try.So yeah, I'd still code if unicorns were real.

mr9telq,"You said above $150k. The recruiter pushed you to $180k. There are only two things I can think of going on here.1. The recruiter is a real piece of shit and is putting their thumb on the scale by pushing you to $180k so that they can tell the hiring manager you are expensive, making the candidate that the *recruiter* favors more likely to get the job.2. The recruiter is looking out for your best interest and doing you a favor - even if you don't get an offer. Sometimes the recruiter knows that salary will not be a factor in the final hiring decision. When I've hired, whenever there were high quality interviews, salary was the last thing I or anyone in the process cared about. Getting the call right on picking a high performer was all that mattered. Salary was only a factor when all of the candidates were meh and you didn't think getting a high performer was a likely outcome.The reason for the dynamic in point 2 is simple. If you are a manager and hire a high performer, it makes what you deliver look good to your boss. In this scenario the boss will almost never care if the high performer's salary is high for the organization's salary bands or the salary is above market. It's the opposite. They will worry about retention if the salary is low. If you hire a mediocre performer, the boss will have questions. Being able to say that the person's salary is below market and you can't replace them without paying more can be satisfactory.",unskilledplay,2025-05-08 16:47:08,47,cscareerquestions,t3_1khu4xq,False,

mr2oq2k,"I've worked at 3 Fortune 100 companies - so, large companies.The only job postings that I think would qualify are when someone posts a job that is intended for an internal hire. That is when a team has decided to create a job to make a career move for an employee (maybe a promotion, maybe a diagonal move), and in order to create that new role - even if they intend to hire internally - they need to (by law) post the job publicly and have that posting up for at least some amount of time before hiring.EDIT: u/ImSuperHelpful is correct - it's not by law, but it seems to be a very popular policy at a lot of companies to prevent nepotism/encourage diversity. It's been the case at every large company I have worked at. I also wonder if it helps to prevent potential lawsuits for discrimination.The idea of having posts out there that the company does not intend to hire for generally doesn't fly at most companies because the entire process of creating a job posting starts with actually getting a real job approved first.It's also why recruiters can't just create a job posting to look busy - again, it would be the hiring manager (i..e, the person who owns the team where the new employee would work) that would need to get the job itself approved by his leadership before HR and recruiters get involved.Now, I don't doubt that there are some companies that do that - I think that might be true for super mega large companies like Meta, Microsoft - and that is to have a generic job posting meant to attract candidates for a large swath of jobs, but without necessarily having a job opening right this moment. But I think that's a minority of companies that do that.I think as someone else said, the other source of issues might be 3rd party recruiters posting fake jobs to farm resumes - but those should be easy to spot because they wouldn't actually tie to a real company's job posting.I think the reality is that a lot of this job postings are real - there's just so many applicants (including internal ones), that it probably feels like they're fake.",dfphd,2025-05-07 14:49:12,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1kgxzpn,False,

But I think you’re thinking about it too simply, and the way you’re approaching it is (at least slightly) counterproductive. It is valuable to be perceived as competent, confident, and personable. When switching jobs, making new connections, or seeking capital investment, peoples default assumption will be that the MIT grad who’s a staff engineer at FAANG is smarter/more capable than the state school grad working in QA at northwest mutual. But I think at some point, you cross a vague threshold where you’re taken seriously at a glance and you don’t really need to worry about micromanaging “prestige”. I’d even say that continuing to be visibly/noticeably concerned with prestige is a negative signal if you’ve already “made it” into high scale software development. It reads either as very self-conscious or very braggy, neither of which are good things for people to think about you. Strongly preferring a big brand like FAANG or a major scale-up over f500 or a small startup is just rational career planning.

mrd79vl,"If by ""big tech"", you're also thinking of FANG, I can speak to that as I was in a similar situation in my career. I've made the transition from startups and mid-sized, low-billions-valuation companies to FANG. It wasn't hard for me to get interviews, as this was many years ago when FANG recruiters would reach out on LinkedIn and such. It was harder to get offers (there's more luck involved than anyone tells you), but I managed to do it by Leetcoding and really trying to understand the algorithms and patterns instead of memorizing solutions. There has been Leetcode escalation since my time there, but I don't have enough interview experience these days to tell you how much.I think if you're just in it for the TC and/or life experience to be at a FANG/Fortune 5 company first hand, then definitely at least try it so you don't feel like you missed something. I'm glad I did just so I knew what it was like.I would recommend against it if you are expecting to seriously level up your dev game. If you're already a highly productive dev at your company and you deliver things faster than your peers and understand all of the tradeoffs of your tech, then you probably won't learn as much as you might think. You'll probably just learn how to use their old, custom tools that solve the same problems you've already solved at your startup but with more popular, open-source tools. Some of what you hear about crazy WLB is because at one point (and maybe still, I don't know) FANG was hiring a ton of new grads who didn't know anything and then were dropped in the deep end. I wasn't at FANG very long, but I still saw many interns and new grad hires cycle through my team and it seemed like a lot of what they didn't like were just things they didn't know because they had no other work experience.I can't say it was the right move career wise because I'm personally of the belief that FANG doesn't have the reputation it once had and could be off-putting to some in this hyper-polarized society we live in now. Many of my teammates at a local company would actively trash FANG and viewed people who worked there as being active and willing participants in hurting society (not joking). At the very least, I suspect saying you worked at FANG today will be kind of like hearing another dev tell you about how they worked at Yahoo in the '90s.

People do get lucky, and I mean lucky, and get jobs without degrees, but it’s few and far between currently. To note, I am only talking about post 2022 to present. Before 2022, the need for junior level developers was a lot higher, but with outsourcing and AI, junior level tasks no longer need an associate to complete. Not to mention during Covid, overhiring was ramped and some companies are still trimming the fat with layoffs.As a graduate you are expected to have atleast one internship under your belt, with a year of experience, and a deep understanding of CS. CsMajors who lack a portfolio or skills will not make it through technical interviews but will beat out ATS filtering because of the degree. I would say also, the notion the average CS major can’t code is relatively false on average, an average CS graduate is relatively capable, but there is roughly bottom 20% who are completely lost. Now keep in mind there are fewer jobs in SWE then their used to be, and more CS graduates both in Bachelors and Masters programs then ever before. Most good companies will receive 100s of applicants and have only 2 jobs available. From a business perspective, why not filter by degrees and get an academically strong candidate with experience and a portfolio. To beat this out you will likely need a strong open source portfolio, with live production level applications and very good networking, I can not emphasize this enough, without a degree you will need to be well networked. It’s possible but it is an uphill battle often as you don’t have the resources of college students or a piece of paper saying you know what you know.

Software isn't a game we play for a day and can take big injuries, but a game we play week after week for years. For you, it doesn't sound like you are in a sustainable work environment -- you'll ever suffer some major health consequences then lose your job, or lose your job a little bit sooner and be back home.Therefore, I'd figure out what you need from your work to start getting on top of your health: maybe that's medical leave, or it could be an accommodation like more WFH. Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.You're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.Also, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: ""This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager"".

mqt440e,"The only tip I can give is maybe list the skill used at each place. It's what I do and I guess it works for me because I've always been doing that and it seems to work for me. Like when you said you used WebSockets you didn't say which language you programmed in. I would list everything packages, library, programming languages or whatever used on any given project. It bloats the resume, but no human is going to read it. You just want to cram in keywords. Even some jobs ask for ""git"" experience and I just assume that is a given and don't list it, but I do ""managed projects with git"" dur. Even when it seems redundant like you used Java at your last two companies, get that keyword in there at each company.Also, it may just be me, but I find a lot of companies don't give a shit about ""non-professional' experience, projects don't get any weight. They will explicitly say so in job descriptions (X years of professional experience with Y). Or recruiters or managers will appear kind of disappointed when you admit you know something from a personal project.And also, you can just lie. A find a lot of companies rarely check you on the skills you know, if you know you can pick it up easily, they won't know the difference once you're on the job. A lot of requirements are written by managers who think you need 5 years with git or else you don't know it at all. And like what I mentioned about projects above, you can just say you did that at your job rather than as a side project.Anyway getting your foot in the door is hard, I got my first job by referral from a relative.

If so, see if career services are one of them. They can provide advice. And if you can attend their in-person career fairs, I would attend those. I always had better experiences when I can see the person who accepts my resume.2. Instead of checking online, drive around and see what businesses are available. Then check their careers' site page if they have one. Not all companies advertise on social media.3. Since you are in Texas, there are a lot of state-based companies with software jobs. HEB corporate, USAA, etc. Check out their site pages. I never really had good luck applying on social media.4. See if there are local career fairs to attend (not school ones).

It was what created the bootcamp/self-teaching craze, where anyone could drop some money on a 1-month bootcamp and land a 6-figure job without a degree. Demand greatly outpaced supply. New grads were easily breaking in, experienced devs were job hopping for insane salary increases... it was chaos.I ask because this is a very different conversation if most of your applying happened in 2020 (bad market from covid), and 2023-2025 (bad market thanks to 2021-2022), versus if you were trying in the golden era.If you were trying in the golden era with a CS degere and weren't getting interviews... something's very wrong. I have some complaints about your resume (that might be more relevant in todays market), but none that would warrant 0 responses in the golden era, it's not *that* bad. One thing I would definitely do is remove your Civil Engineering degree. Generally you only want to list *relevant* skills/qualifications on your resume. While getting that degree is an impressive feat, it's not relevant if you want to be a SWE. I'd give the same advice about your sales experience, you can keep that there, but you should be leaning into the soft-skills side of it to tie it back to something employers value in a SWE. Exceeding sales targets is not relevant to being a SWE. But I bet you picked up some really strong communication skills from that role, talk about *that.* Try reading through your whole resume with that in mind: ""What am I trying to communicate to the reader here? Is this relevant to SWE?"".What kinds of roles were you applying to? Were you just applying to roles grossly outside your qualifications? What kinds of companies? Large F500 companies are much more likely to hire new grads than small companies for example., if your search was focused on small companies in your local town that could be a problem. Are you willing to relocate? Relocation is the norm for your first job out of college, even in good markets. That could be an issue if you're not.

Are you trying to immigrate to the US or something?The issue is if you're not getting calls, there's not really that much that *could* be wrong. It's pretty much either your resume, or the companies/roles/locations you're applying for.

Add your current experience and when asked, tell them more or less what you said here. Say you felt the job wasnt in line with what you wanted for yourself. As for promotions, it may hold you back a year. Really depends on job and on you. Promotions arent really due to YOE. It's a factor but really promotions are due to your output. If your output is expected than expect 2-3 years to get promoted. If you always over-perfrom expect to get promoted quickly. It's easier to go from SWE1 to SWE2 than it is to SWE2 to Sr SWE.

mrflypd,"If you work at a company that is expected to be online 24/7, there will always be 24/7 on call. So if the on call by itself is your issue, you'd need to look for teams whose products are only used during business hours. They're definitely out there, but not super common.From a rotation/frequency standpoint what you're describing is pretty standard. I've been on call at every company I've worked for, the rotations have always lasted 2 weeks, and the frequency of rotation obviously depended on how large the team was.The issue to me personally would be the amount of calls you're getting after hours. The word ""normal"" isn't a useful term to use for things like this, because being called super frequently absolutely *is* normal at a lot of companies. But it's not normal at others. There isn't an industry-wide normality you can refer to, there's a lot of variety.One thing I make it a point to do when I'm reverse-interviewing is discuss exactly this. I ask about rotation, how many times they get after-hours calls, business-hours calls, an example of what the team did in reaction to an after hours call, etc. I'm trying to establish the product stability and the team norms so I can decide to join or not.What I'm usually looking for when I ask about after-hours calls is a few calls *per year*. After hours calls need to be treated extremely seriously, and should be ""Fix ASAP"" kind of issues. If the product is so on fire that they can't keep up with patching after-hours issues, and you're getting called even once a week, I want no part of that product.When I was job searching in 2021 I had offers from several companies. When I asked one of them about after-hours calls, the hiring manager smiled and proudly said ""we only get a few calls a month!"".... the fact that was *good* in their mind set off alarm bells in mine. Another company responded ""Well the product's only a couple years old, but we've never been called after hours so far, most of our support issues are during business hours"". Green flag. I joined them. I only ended up staying there about 2.5 years, but I indeed got called 0 times after hours during that time.",SouredRamen,2025-05-09 15:24:27,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1kiidif,False,

We get paid a retainer for the shift which works out to approximately 1-2 hours of pay for week days, and it’s double at weekends, quadruple on bank holidays. If there is an incident outside of work hours, then we get paid OT for dealing with it, starting from 1 hour and otherwise rounded to the nearest 30 mins.

Base pay was an extra 30k but with bonuses and RSUS it was closer to an exrtr 70k for the next few years.

mqsijhq,"When I was looking for my first job in 2022-2023 as a self taught without degrees, I researched the job market of my city and found out that jobs were divided into 2 main groups: popular techstacks and unpopular ones. Popular techstacks were Nodejs, PHP, Java, and C# with Nodejs being the most dominant among new grads like 5 to 10 times higher than usual (I asked my cs friends from colleges/universities all over the city and they all confirmed this) while PHP was treated like a second class citizen even though positions were just as much as for all of them. Unpopular ones were Python and Ruby: I'm talking about like just 4 or 5 postings per month.So I had a decision to make, should I compete in popular techstacks knowing that there would be more jobs to apply but the competition would also be crazy or should I choose a less popular one knowing that there would be only a handful of jobs to apply and only a handful to compete against? I picked the latter, learnt both Python and Ruby, and landed my first role after 3 months.Niche stacks have served me really well and now I'm even more invested in them. At my previous and current company, I've got the chance to add Golang and Elixir to my resume too. So now basically I have to maintain the knowledge of 4 stacks knowing that the amount of jobs I can apply to won't even compare to many of friends who have experience with only Java or Nodejs. For the current company, I've been more involved with the hiring process and the amount of Python/Ruby devs are still very few and far between.

mrflhzv,"I would say careful money chasing. I worked at a defense company my first job. Made 90k my last year there. I jumped for the money which was almost twice as much (base+stock+bonus) and it was FAANG. It lead to 3 very stressful years of non-stop work. Once I got out of it I was happy I got the experience and made money off of it but even happier I was past that stressful work. If I had known before getting there, I would've applied elsewehre. Sometimes a 30% uptick in pay may mean 2 times the work. It's not to stray you away but all I say is careful, sometimes a good work culture is taken for granted because of money and people in corporate world are trained to always want more. It also matters what your pay is and if the extra 30% would change your life. I get it's alot but if that extra 30% wouldnt really do much different for your life now then I say really consider it. If it's like you struggle to make paymenets or set yourself with a good savings/investments than I get wanting to take it.As for the job-hopping. It doesnt look terrible but it doesnt look great right now. Since it's a startup they may not care but usually jobs expect your first 6 months to a year to be a learning curve. They expect that you will have to be handheld for the most part on alot of tasks. Especially as a Jr/Mid-level. So for the first and current job the fact you had a year or less there doesnt make you look like an expert. ALot of jobs are going to assume it will take you a year to fully get comfortable in the codebase and teh idea is ""do I want to hire someone who may leave next year before I get the most of him/her?"". In your 4 YOE, some places will assume you've only had 1 year where you gave very productive work and the rest you were always learning. You may get away with it now because you are Jr/Mid-level and it's assumed you will still be in the learning curve stage for a bit but Im not sure applying for Senior and Staff engineer roles in the future will look at that and think ""he is an expert in this one field"".
