Check out this [white paper](https://www.redshift-observatory.ch/white_papers/downloads/introduction_to_the_fundamentals_of_amazon_redshift.html) for more info.

mqnpaxh,"I spent a couple of years with redshift and I would pick literally anything else. Redshift is a very black box that throws unexpected errors and is very difficulty to introspect.One of the more frustrating things it does is it can sometimes pick a query execution path that it doesn’t support depending on the tables you’re hitting. Exact same query, exact same table structure will error from one execution to the next.It doesn’t support all of SQL and I don’t mean the syntax, I mean that certain sub queries and joins will sometimes not be supported.When it encounters an error it shows up as a stack trace to an internal C file that you don’t have access to.It’s also sometimes wildly inconsistent where the compute nodes and the main node have different behaviour. You need to internalise what will run where to be able to keep track.It’s a pain in the ass to optimise things because makes it hard to turn off caching and other optimisation to be able to measure execution impact of iterating on your queries, it rewrites queries into multiple queries and makes it a pain to track down how things are getting decomposed.Redshifts feature development is very slow, and it has surface level support for things like JSON. I wish we had gone with something like ClickHouse where you have some hope of seeing long standing issues and features gaps get resolved over time.It’s also quite complex in terms of managing it, if you adopt it and actually use it you’re gonna be spending a lot of time learning things that are only relevant for redshift which is a huge time sink. One of the major selling points of redshift is the price, but when you need to spend money on salary to manage redshift that calculation may not work out in redshift favour.",kitsunde,2025-05-05 04:49:33,18,dataengineering,t3_1kf1uff,False,

The comparison isn't equivalent. Redshift in combination with other analytics services such as Athena gives better results. It is the complete AWS analytics stack which needs to be compared with snowflake and databricks, not Redshift alone. Recently AWS have begun to address this with the new Sagemaker Studio.A huge chunks of the complaints fall in this category - UX, and features which are outside of Redshift but possible with other very well integrated services. On the other hand it is true that Redshift tuning needs higher skill and detailed knowledge. A lot of people don't understand what MPP is. Or how database internals work. However if uses correctly you end up running a cheaper and more efficient system.Personally I haven't seen any ""random errors"" - I've generally been haply with Redshift.After a long time looking at such discussions I've concluded that it's usually a problem of engineers not making an effort to understand their tools properly. You can run any platform - AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, BQ. Each has its pros and cons.Good engineers will figure it out, bad ones will complain. Maybe I'm just cynical.I know people who are happy with AWS, happy with snowflake, happy with Databricks, and also others pissed off with all of them - several migrating in between different stacks.The biggest sell of snowflake is that it is an easy environment to work in, but more expensive - what you save on salaries you may spend on snowflake.

In which case I’d dumb it down) should initially store everything as string, imho. I personally like to stage as stricter data types when reasonable (dates are a great example), as long as I’m capturing the raw data elsewhere.3) validate parsed data with a schema/layout.

Most would also wish they had the experience. The good news is: you’ve already taken the hardest step. You recognized the change and started upskilling. Python, Spark, SQL—those are the right moves. You’re not starting from zero.Now it’s time to shift from learning to building especially showcase a story / impact. Courses are fine, but real traction comes when you can point to something you’ve created. Set up a public GitHub repo with two or three small but complete projects. Think end-to-end: pull in data, transform it with PySpark or dbt, orchestrate it with Airflow, push it into a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake. Even if it’s basic, the fact that it works is what hiring managers want to see. Aka you are self sufficient and not to be watched but deliver results.At the same time, tighten how you talk about yourself. You’re not “catching up”—you’re evolving. Build a 60-second intro that shows you’ve worked in high-scale environments and now you’ve added modern tools to your stack. The story needs to be clear and confident.Also—don’t get stuck applying to roles blindly. Be intentional. Focus on companies in transition—those moving from legacy to cloud.

I have seen so many databases filled with stored procedures that no one wants to touch and they aren’t being version controlled.With DBT you organize sql scripts in nice little project folders. Add as much or as little documentation as you wish. You can reuse common snippets of code (macros) among the scripts, which is helpful for making the code modular. The whole thing is code so it harmonizes nicely with git and version control. Finally, the little SQL scripts are easily referenceable by orchestrators to be used as building blocks in other programs.Duckdb is used to create versatile lightweight ephemeral database instances that can hold a lot of data in memory and can run blazing fast queries and joins in SQL. If you need to temporarily store data then duckdb is a nice way to ingest, transform, and stage data on its way to some more permanent system. Well, you can even use duckdb as the final resting place for some data since it is after all a portable embedded database like SQLite. Duckdb can fit just about anywhere in a data pipeline, but it’s especially useful for memory-intensive or slow tasks that are bottlenecking your workflow.Honestly the tools have a ton of overlap and you could very well use both, like [this guy](https://georgheiler.com/post/dbt-duckdb-production/).",BrisklyBrusque,2025-05-02 04:19:50,58,dataengineering,t3_1kcrd8o,False,

There's a quote about writing in general - ""Perfection is achieved, not when there is *nothing* more to add, but when there is *nothing left to take away*"". Giving someone 6 page CV isn't going to make them think ""this person is seriously experienced"" it's going to make them roll their eyes a bit. That shouldn't discount that candidate (I definitely wouldn't throw a 6-page CV in the bin, for example), but it definitely doesn't help.2. making ""hail mary"" applications as an entry-level dev for a position that is advertised as a senior position may *feel* productive but is kind of a waste of your time and the recruiter's time. There may be exceptions - maybe they were planning on also hiring someone junior and may contact you about that position - but that's kind of rare.Similarly for the ""there's no such thing as entry level in data engineering"" - that's someone trying to appear profound, but instead is frankly coming across as an unhelpful dick.If you're lacking experience try for internships, give Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a shot, try to do some self-study and personal projects or find some open source project you can contribute to.

If your storage is cheap you can also keep it around, but you don't want to run every single dev process at full scale.At a place I was at previously we'd essentially snapshot the prod environment in a way that we could repeatedly 'restore' it to other environments as needed.

Basically, the worse your code was the more you had to improve it. The PR was appended with linter failure info, and the developer had a lot of flexibility - the decisions were made at the PR level, not the file level, so the developer could have a nasty file that was hard to fix and so decided to make improvements to other files instead.

Would be curious actually about how this turns out.What I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt.

mqi7bwi,"In rapid development areas where things are changing a lot and/or where a lot of people have understanding of the data structures of the original system, it is quite helpful to just have a 'published' replication of the source system. It means that people that are familiar with that system can use your data platforms to get at the data they need, without having to put strain on the original source.Another thing you could do is, with the 'internal tables, if some team wants access to some state like that you just make a copy of the model and call it a published one just for that team. You should then able to make changes to the original model to suit your own needs, and they've got something stable. It does mean you might have two materialisations, and you'll have two dependencies, but it might be worth it.You still might have a bit more going on with the source-replica styled tables. People might want a history of the data in there, for example, so you might still run raw staging copies, then produce 'latest' and 'full history' representations of the data. It generally isn't hard to do both, since the latter gets you the former, so you can make it a standard that every time you ingest a new source you create these representations to provide to anyone that needs it so they can get quick access.Later down the line you'll have to grapple with data governance issues, but in a small org it can be handled more directly.",azirale,2025-05-04 08:20:08,2,dataengineering,t3_1kdfzoi,False,

mqdrqcv,"For testing and trying tools you should probably split that. Trying to put everything at once will take you a long time and you won’t be able to validate your progress and maybe you’ll stop in the middle because it was too long and you don’t see the project ending anytime soon.First focus on ingestion.This will guide you collect data from a source and store it.You can try a couple different sources here like REST api, web sockets, MQTT topics, GraphQL API, just here you can have some fun.Do things simple, use simple python and once it’s working THEN try to improve if you want ti make it faster or what ever.Then focus on transformation Load the data from S3 to Snowflake. It doesn’t have to be automated. Ingest enough to have a couple of hour/days worth of data for your need and load that at once into snowflake.Now configure your first DBT project and make sure you are able to connect to snowflake using DBT debug command.Then clean and transform your raw data to something meaningful.Note that before you start the ingestion step you should know what’s the first thing you want to achieve. If you don’t this won’t work. Find something you want to know then find the data source for it, not the other way around. It’s always more fun to do something which have some value for you. Then work on testing you ingesting code and you transformation. Might be boring, but it’s a needed skill.Then focus on automation. Configure your airflow module and orchestrate you ingestion module on a schedule with your DBT transformation from a trigger when the ingestion for a specific partition is done.Then you can start looking into streaming.Configure your infrastructure (Kafka, or red pandas or what ever you want)Then modify your ingestion module so it send events instead of full set of data. For example if you were collecting all weather records from all country well don’t wait for the complete process to be finished, yield events as you consume them to your Kafka stream.Then configure your ingestion engine spark/flink/quix/bytewax and run some transformation on real time data.Then try to configure some threshold will would alert you in real time if xyz happen, if the temperature increase from x in the last hour.Then work on building beautiful dashboards.Then you can try to consolidate all pieces together.This is never a small project, and doing everything at once won’t bring you where you want. Do small integration instead. You’ll get completion reward as you go and you will be more willing to continue instead of dropping because the scope is to complex.Cheers and good luck",Commercial_Dig2401,2025-05-03 15:11:44,3,dataengineering,t3_1kcfjo6,False,

mr3e5ik,"Sorry for a big fat ""it depends"" answer. I think decisions like this exist on a spectrum, for the sake of your question.If the ML prediction outputs are something that is very ""closely"" tied to the document records, then re-funneling things through the raw layer so that it all flows downstream, could make a lot of sense. A trivial example, would be like a ""word count""... I don't really see anything wrong with adding a ""word count"" column alongside the original raw data, especially if downstream datasets will also benefit from it.If the prediction outputs are something that is totally separate from the original records, and/or if you plan to expand your ML platform to cover more models and different kinds of predictions, then it probably makes more sense to aim for an independent architecture, use things like MLFlow for tracking/registering instead of the existing DWH governance. But there's no absolute right or wrong here, it all depends on what direction the team is going in, what kinds of skills or resources are available, etc. There's no point pursuing a ""pure"" ML architecture that is too big for you, if you are a single solo MLE and can't support it well.

My team is doing with both ML and LLM outputs following same pattern.The reporting layer for model ready inputs is also a good idea (and something my team is doing). To add the ML/LLM outputs to reporting layer, you just need a separate object in your reporting layer for the final consumption. Our ML/LLM versioning is handled outside of the warehouse (through an app we built) and ingested into the warehouse. We have a generic section of our warehouse dedicated to modeling the ML/LLM workflow that includes entities like document (text/data evaluated), the prompt (type 2 generated from app data that version controls the prompts) and the ML/LLM outputs of each version of the prompt that was used against the given 'document'. All data flows through this generic model and then flows to the various reporting layers that need it. This also provides standard building blocks for document chunking/RAG which we have built on top of this. Not sure on exactly what you mean by pushing the derived data breaks the idea of it being raw data? The point is that is raw data, totally new. Take away the ML/LLM model used to create that data, you can't regenerate that data using SQL with the data you already had in your warehouse.

It is a downstream system that generates new data that needs to be ingested.The days going to ML might change in some incompatible way, so this allows the ML output layer to account for that, rather than breaking things at the integration point. If the data from the ML changes then that forces to raw, and it goes through a usual process of standing a schema change or a new source.Another way to think of it is that a dwh processes *never* goes backwards through the layers. That makes it extraordinarily difficult to pick where to put the ML inputs and outputs as the most sensible place to integrate the data into other models could be anywhere, or in multiple places, or it might move.

mqofhw9,I’ve effectively made this transition over the past few years because I’ve been in your situation a lot so I guess here’s my thoughts: 1. Learning ‘data ops’ will only make you more employable and will never be a bad thing. A lot of data teams are not fully supported by a central devops team so being able to do it yourself will be invaluable.2. Don’t try to be an out and out data ops engineer. Most business do not hire for someone that specialises. Being a data engineer with a lot of data ops experience will get you a long way in my experience and is probably better for your employability.Anyone else out there feel free to correct me if you think I’m wrong - this is all anecdotal from my personal experience.,valligremlin,2025-05-05 09:13:50,5,dataengineering,t3_1kf454a,False,
mqog35e,"Hi! I am a little experienced programmer (\~20 years), mainly in heavy-data-oriented companies (banks, governmental taxes, investment funds, energy). IMHO, DataOps - and similar teams - are costly solutions for an underrated way of seeing data.Even companies dealing with high volumes of data can use other solutions, which - although old-school - are cheaper, effective enough, and have known, stable tools. Companies have analytics teams, reporting teams, controlling teams, etc., working closely with IT. If all they deliver useful, valid data, it's good enough. DataOps as a team is another layer of organization, which requires more collaboration, more tools, more discipline, more dependencies, etc., giving unknown (maybe?) better value. Which company wants to pay for it?!DataOps should be more a general concept, a part of strategy, like DevOps, not a new role or a new team. (BTW, this is one of the reasons for failure in introducing DevOps - by a team or a role foundation.) Of course, this is very convenient for some people to have a visible ""thing"" on an orga chart, with attached obligations and maybe some KPIs, but it is not working for 99.9% of companies - I guess this level, but I will try to justify:DataOps as a team or a role is a kind of coordinator role. There are two general attitudes (it's malicious, but it's for real): first, this role is given to the least competent person, who needs to do something, but in this role can't mess up anything; second, this role is given to the most competent person, who quickly becomes a bottleneck.But there is easier, working alternative, which paradoxically is also a MUST for DataOps: collaboration between parties. Without collaboration DataOps is probably impossible. With collaboration DataOps is probably not necessary.So, if you want to look for a very niche job offered by very few companies, that are rich enough to proceed with such an experiment, and if you have very high skills in business and technical issues, you are probably a good candidate for a very lucrative contract.

But branch predictors are pretty good, so unless the if statement is very unpredictable or 50/50, you'll be fine.edit: As far as optimizing if statements out of loops, sometimes you can split the loop into two loops with separate logic, and that allows you to extract the if statement outside the loop. Alternatively you can look into branchless programming, which usually relies on methods like boolean algebra.

In modern ISAs, you typically see cmp and jump instructions bundled in the same one, this would be executed faster than two instructions, but the jump offset addressing is usually smaller.How fast are those instructions? Well that would depend on the architecture, but I assume they are done in a cycle easily.Of course, if you don't need the IF, your program would obviously be faster, because you reduced the need for an extra instruction.But in reality, it shouldn't make it that much slower (remember one instruction only), but since IF is used to cover side cases, it'll obviously make your program bigger, how big you may ask? Depends on what the compiler optimizes the if to, it could be a branch with a link, it could be a skip, etc...If you're strictly testing loop scenarios, just think to yourself ""every time I run this loop, I am doing an additional instruction"" so if the loop is 8 instructions long, and one of them is the IF instruction, then yeah, it would make it somewhat slower.

Generally speaking, developing programming languages and techniques is a matter of allowing humans to express, in the ways that they think, a bunch of instructions than can be converted to the way the machine 'thinks'. Humans think in objects. There is a thing called a car. I have one. Mine is a particular colour and it can drive to places at various speeds... yada yada yada. OOP let's us express these ideas in these ways. When it comes to large, complex systems, this kind of separation and encapsulation can help tame the chaos. Over the years, I have come to accept that forcing \*everything\* into the object model is a mistake (as a Java guy for a couple of decades, this was a hard lesson to learn), but there are times when it is the right way to express an idea, even a very complex one. Over time and assuming the tools support it (and hopefully in 2025 they do), you just learn to combine all this stuff.",hitanthrope,2025-05-06 16:38:03,218,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqx2h6h,"Let's be honest with you: your programs so far were way too small to really benefit from OOP. OOP works great with huge, complex programs.Yet, there are even smaller programs that can greatly benefit from OOP - provided, you have the right use case.For me, a prime example are card games. Here OOP can really play its strengths in simple, fairly small projects.Think about what you need for card games: you need cards (obviously), you need a deck, you need players (also obviously), players have hands (the card hands, not their physical ones), and there could be much more.Exactly the nouns above: Card, Deck, Player, Hand translate very well to Classes in OOP.+ A *Card* is a class modeling a single playing card. It has a suit, a rank, potentially a numeric value, potentially, a front and a back, and it is either face up or face down. It can be flipped (toggle face up/face down), can report its suit and rank, and value *provided* it is face up, otherwise it should not reveal its values.+ A *Deck* is a collection of cards. It can be initialized, can report its size, can be shuffled, can deal 1 or more cards.+ A *Player* models a human player with a name, potentially some money, a hand (the cards they are holding), a bet, etc. Of course, it can report all that.+ A *Hand* is basically similar to a deck of cards, but always directly related to a player.When you have this fundamental classes above and add a Game class where you define the rules of the game and how the game rounds run, you can quickly whip up any card game.Even better, by just changing the game class you can make Blackjack, Poker, and many more games by reusing the other classes you have previously made.Sure, you could just as well do all that without OOP (and it has been done plenty times already), but overall the OOP code will be much cleaner, much more modular, much easier to maintain and reuse, much shorter in total than its non-OOP counterpart.Reuse is one of the advantages of OOP. Another is *encapsulation*. The outside, the program that uses your classes does not need to know anything how the inside works, how it stores its data (state). The outside always ""communicates""/""interacts"" with the class/object through well defined and limited channels, pretty much in the form of a dialogue. The program asks the class/object for something and the class responds.",desrtfx,2025-05-06 17:23:22,93,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqx7tsd,"The primary benefit of Object Oriented Programming is that objects can model the system you are programming directly. An object contains data about itself, and methods to manipulate that data, so other objects can ""communicate"" directly with it, without having to know anything about how it is built.The example you supplied is just a single method that does some procedural work on some separate data, so you don't get any benefit from doing it more object oriented.But imagine a game, where different players have different health and shield-status, different inventory, equipped weapons and so on. Every item in the game is an object, so that when one player hits another with their weapon, you don't have some central code that does all the calculation, but the Player1 object sends a message to the Player2 object, that they hit it with WeaponA - Player2 then calculates the damage delivered by WeaponA, subtracts its own shield, and adjusts their own health-level. Maybe even deciding to hit Player1 back.That is all done by code inside the Player-object, making it seem more like the objects are ""communicating"" than running a procedure.Since many processes - in games and business - can be modelled as entities communicating, OOP lends itself very well to that way of thinking, and it is ""easy"" to transfer an abstract model of a system to independent objects, than to a huge procedural program.

mqwu7xo,"The benefits wont show up much on small single person projects over a short timespan.The essence of OOP is encapsulation. Encapsulation is what makes object polymorphism possible, and it’s the core thing that distinguishes OOP from procedural and most functional programming.The point of encapsulation is that it limits how much of the system you have to keep in your head at one time. At its best, you can focus on the responsibilities of a single object and trust that other objects are doing what they’re supposed to do. This is in especially important when you’re on a team where someone else is writing those other objects.One place where the rubber really hits the road with object-oriented encapsulation is in the enforcement of invariants. An encapsulated object can make more guarantees about its behavior than a publicly mutable struct. To understand whether a struct is in a valid state you might have to look at every place that has mutated it, whereas to understand if a mutable object is in a valid state you should (ideally) only have to verify that its constructor and setters properly maintain its validity. You can think locally rather than globally.The other place where OOP has a leg up is extensibility. When you encapsulate your objects by writing to an interface rather than a concrete implementation you gain the ability to add new implementations of your interfaces which will interoperate with existing code, without having to modify the existing code. This is also very important as the project increases in scale.I’ve written a basic [blog post](https://jnkr.tech/blog/abstract-data-types-and-objects) on the tradeoffs involved in choosing between proper objects and imperative abstract data types which you might find interesting.",josephjnk,2025-05-06 16:44:57,22,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqzorfa,"To your credit most intro programming courses do a horrible job of explaining the purpose of object oriented programming. They usually try to introduce it with some flimsy metaphors of cats and dogs and bicycles and wheels and then have you memorize the four tenets: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, without really giving a good reason for why OOP embodies these tenets better than any other paradigm. To their credit, it’s difficult to see the benefits until you are seasoned enough to start working on larger scale coding projects.First, let’s get this out of the way: OOP is not strictly superior to procedural programming. Different paradigms are good for different things. We also don’t choose one paradigm over another because of performance reasons, or really anything involving the computer. Paradigms are solely concerned with how we, the humans, conceptualize the code we’re writing. At the end of the day, every program is in an imperative paradigm once it gets compiled down to machine code.Procedural programming is great if what you’re coding is best conceptualized as a procedure; AKA a series of instructions. If you’re writing a python script to run some preprocessing tasks on your ML model then it makes total sense to take a procedural approach.However, let’s take the most stereotypical application of coding, software development. Say you’re developing an app like Microsoft Word. Is Microsoft Word better described as series of instructions, or as an object? In this case, OOP makes much more sense because you are developing a *thing*, and that thing is composed of many smaller things like buttons and menus and widgets. It makes it much easier for our brains to decompose the task of coding Microsoft Word into manageable subtasks in a way that effectively reduces complexity.In reality, most languages these days include elements of many different programming paradigms, there are very few languages that are purely one paradigm. This is nice because you don’t have to commit completely to one paradigm if there are little parts of your project that would be better done in another.

Management tells you to add a feature so buyers can be enticed to buy a new version, and the more you look at what has to change to make the feature work, the more impossible it seems.Object-oriented code is a way to manage complexity, and make it possible to add to the code without having to understand all of it.

mr2m2ac,"Amidst all these optimistic comments, I’m going to shatter some dreams. It is only my opinion but here we go.Employers won’t except you to know everything, but they’ll expect you to know the basics very well. The tech industry is built on tons of abstraction. In our ‘modern times’, new, complex, shiny technologies are abstracted away to a point where using them is very easy. This makes it more and more common for underlying concepts to go overlooked.An example is the frontend web development world today. We constantly see new shiny web frameworks that make the development precess so much easier, and alongside them, the big frameworks trying to catch up. And as a result we see teenagers ‘vibe coding’ SaaS apps with minimal understanding.This is a slippery slide that makes you feel productive and confident in your programming abilities. Makes you think you can definitely land a job already.In reality, most employers don’t need people who can use new tools. They need engineers who can solve difficult problems. To become an engineer you need to have a very deep understanding of the fundamentals before going into the advanced stuff. Frankly, the fundamentals are not even about one’s ability to code or use different technologies, but rather theory that you learn by reading and practicing with pen and paper.In my opinion, the best way to land a job is by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (that means reading books and studying them, not solving random LeetCode problems), Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Unix, Databases and RDBMSs, OOP, and the cherries on top - a low level language (C or C++ - understanding explicit memory management and having the need to implement everything on your own is very good for practice), and a high level language (Java, C#, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc - pick your poison).Of course ’mastering’ these concepts is subjective. There is no right answer as to at which stage of that exactly, one will be able to land a job. However, learning about all of these concepts to a decent extent is the fastest way to land a good job in the field.",todorpopov,2025-05-07 14:36:02,9,learnprogramming,t3_1kgx1qu,False,

All those common things you do regularly. Use only C++, no cheating and using c-string tools or the string to cstring conversion.From there, I would master the vector class. You don't have to understand the template syntax fully yet, just know that its vector variablename format and work it from there.

Just forget them for now. You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while. Iterators are OK to use. macros. Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number. As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.As you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics. For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn.

Continue on the current road**Learn other languages / frameworks for backend development: Java Spring Boot, JavaScript Express, C# w Razor/Blazor, Python w Django / Flask, or whichever combination you find. Something new but well known.**2. Go deeper in the professional development career**Learn more about the infrastructure around coding: all the DevOps branches, testing, automated testing, dev containers, docker, github actions, deployment, CI/CD and so on - become a ""software developer"" more than a programmer, and understand the environment around the software.**3. Go deeper in programming**You have some low level C++ knowledge, but do you understand data structures and algorithms, do you know how a linked list is built, or why a hashmap is as fast as it is? While these aren't necessarily required skills in this day and age, it helps to understand more about the machine, more about why programming works the way it does, and it can be very code-nerdy fun.**4. Take the alternate route**Try something completely new: * perhaps **frontend programming** (which would be a nice match for your backend knowledge), learn some React, try to build frontends for your existing backends* or **games programming** \- pick a language and framework you like, and play around with making small games - if you like designing complex programs, that can be a great challenge, and could be an excellent hobby, if not exactly job-oppertunities* or **hardware programming** \- buy an Arduino or similar small scale microcontroller, and play around with controlling lights and motors. If you feel up to it, try to do without the libraries, and learn how to actually control the hardware. Can be very challenging, but also great fun, and the physical aspect makes it feel a bit different than programming, while still giving you lots of practice.* or **app development** \- try to make small apps for your phone, small things that you can use yourself, and decide if you want to expand in to better UI or more AI once you get going.Right now there's no guaranteed direction that will make you a lot of money, so pick the one you deem most fun, and try it out.

The problem is, I don’t know which one to choose, as I don't know much about them.""You start with the foundations that they all have in common. For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called ""discrete math"" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): https://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ Also, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489> ""Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.""You don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers. Circumstances ended up choosing for him.> ""How can I try out these different fields for a small amount of time and figure out what I actually enjoy the most?""Maybe check out various subreddits, follow them, and eventually send professionals in those subreddits chat requests to ask them about their profession. To help me find subreddits, I start with a Reddit search and then use The Map of Reddit (Google ""Map of Reddit"", it's a website to help you find related or interconnected subreddits). For example, for Machine Learning there is r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning , maybe r/DataScience . For experienced developers there is r/ExperiencedDevs . For backend developers there is r/backend . There is also r/fullstack , r/WebDev , and r/frontend .

If you can't handle that delay after having typed in a command, of course you should go with the faster version ...Anyways, never believe anyone talking about how some constructs in the programming language are faster or slower than others - usually they are wrong, and perpetuate myths started by 1970s assembly-programmers.

mqvbw4y,"There are many goals to writing a program. Many beginning programmers want to emphasize speed, but it can be misleading. In particular, programs already run very fast. The idea of fixing a slow program because you believe long if statements make it slow is often termed as premature optimization (not the specific reason, but any reason you think a program is slow).It's often more important that a program be readable if it's fast enough, and likely, it's going to be fast enough. If you have evidence it's running slow, then you can look at *profiling* a program. This means using a program called a *profiler*. Many beginners still choose to optimize without a profiler because it's just one more tool they need to learn, and they'd rather guess what's slow.If you insist, you can create a HashMap (or whatever C# has) that maps the command string to a something that implements a Command interface. You can pass the command line and the args. interface Command { void runCommand(String command, SomeType lineArgs); }Replace `SomeType` with the actual type.You would create this map in an initialization phase (static constructor, say). You'd do something like // commandMap is a hash map Command obj = commandMap.get(commandName); obj.runCommand(commandName, lineArgs);It is a bit more complicated to get this set up, but not a whole lot more.",CodeTinkerer,2025-05-06 11:56:49,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kfwzc6,False,

That doesn't mean you should write fast and shitty code, just that you need to learn the optimal amount of ""should I consider this now"" vs ""note this as a place to consider if execution time becomes and issue"".I am a firm believer in not putting off refactor if you see problems, but beyond keeping good, clean, defensive coding practices, overthinking problems that haven't even presented themselves yet will just drive you fucking crazy.B: You have decided to listen to random people give you ""this is how it is"" advice instead of exploring and learning about how if/else and switch might differ in the resulting assembly. Stop letting other people answer your questions with other things you don't understand. The internet is full of fucking nonsense, and I read TONS of it being given as confident ""this is how it is"" programming advice when the reality is ALWAYS more complicated and nuanced. Get curious. The answer to your question is out there and well explained by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.Anyway, what you are doing is fine. Using a switch might make it look a little cleaner if it gets longer. I would also look up using function pointers and a dispatch table, more as a thought experiment. Function pointers seem outlandish at first but are an amazing tool to be comfortable with. If you want to DM me at any point, I do light tutoring for free and I think this is a cool problem to talk about a few interesting design patterns.edit: I dropped the term ""function pointer"" in this without thinking language.

Then optimize your solution for a bigger data set. Lastly use a popular search algorithm (binary search for example) to implement for your solution. Did it decrease your run time?

mqvl0qi,"Programming probably feels hard to you. Although many disagree, think of it like learning a foreign language, say, Japanese (let's pretend you don't speak). Or if you studied a foreign language, ask yourself how long it took. Was it just magic that you learned it? Probably not.Learning to program is somewhat similar. You start from basics and progress from there. Maybe the a-ha moment is understanding how a program runs or making your first algorithm, but it isn't a single a-ha moment, and it doesn't mean one day you don't know how to program, and the next day you're churning out code.There's always new stuff to learn (whether you choose to or not) and it's done in steps. Have you ever seen people who draw really well. Sometimes they post their drawings over the years from stuff just better than stick figures. Sure, maybe there's a year it starts to take a big leap forward, but there's often more progress after that.We all want shortcuts, but they aren't always there.For a recommendation, try (web search: `MOOC Java`). This is a free course in Java. You can do it in C# instead, but if you do it in Java, there's automated grading. The key is to do all the programming exercises, and not just read.

In any job, you are going to have good points and bad points. And as real professionals, though, we must find ""stomach"" to cope with the unenjoyable bits as well, at least in a professional manner.There are certain types of programming that are enjoyable for some folk and not to others. For example, Web Development, Frontends, etc. Some people really enjoy doing that kind of work, and others find it kind of dreadful or annoying. You have to learn what kind of programming or systems ""get you up in the morning"" as it were.But if you don't enjoy programming ITSELF, then I'm not sure what can be done. There are always annoying parts to the craft, as well, but once you have done it for a while you know you can get ""to the goal"" and that is always a good feeling for me. For example, if you don't understand how something works yet you need to understand, then that is annoying at first, but you know that you can eventually ""get it good enough"" to accomplish the task. Or, if you are in a greuiling debugging session then again it's frustrating, but with experience you know that you can either find the bug eventually (even if it's just one dumb typo) OR can find it or learn to find solutions to work around it if it is too elusive. In any case, once you achieve these goals, it's ultimately going to trigger dopamine in the brain and will become addictive in a good way (basically a self-fulfilling positive cycle in psychology).

There can be confusing, but they still really just boil down to these core ideas. Eg ""ternaries"" are just short-hand conditionals.

My concern would be that you're struggling to get through the content, even when taking ADHD meds. If you don't have a genuine interest in programming (as in, actually programming, not ""what you think programming is""), then it isn't unlikely that it's just... ""not your thing"". You don't need to be a math genius, or be able to perfectly follow code in your mind, but you do need to be interested. A lot of the developers I know could take ADHD meds and program for 18 hours straight. It make them insatiable.At some point, you'll need to learn more about data structures, algorithms, and memory (which is usually what the Bootcamps skip). I tried my hardest not to learn that stuff for as long as possible, but eventually... you just need to. It helps you recognize problems and how to solve them.JavaScript is particularly tricky (even though it's also beginner-friendly) because it's the only language that has built-in templating, windowing, rendering, and styling (HTML, the browser, and CSS). Vanilla JS teaches you about manually manipulating The DOM, but the second you move into more professionally-oriented work, you'll likely be using frameworks like React that abstract The DOM away. So they teach you all this ""document.querySelector"" stuff in JS, it's unlike anything in any other language, and when you've finally figured it out, they say ""just kidding, we usually use libraries to do that for us"".JS and all of it's libraries, packages, and frameworks update regularly. Syntax changes, frameworks fade in and out of popularity, and you'll need to keep up. I'm autistic with ADHD, and for me that's a benefit. It keeps changing, but it keeps getting better, the tools are fun and relatively easy to use, and I enjoy trying and learning all of the new stuff. Keeps me from getting bored and keeps me sharp.Bootcamps are intended to jump-start you. So they'll walk you through database, server, and user interface - relatively quickly - so you have a reasonable understanding of how to build a complete application, even if you don't perfectly understand the languages, syntax, and tools being used. It's just a starting point.For Vanilla JS, as is always recommended in this subreddit, [https://javascript.info/](https://javascript.info/) is the best, most modern, comprehensive, interactive tutorial. If you can get through part 1 (save part 2 and part 3 for later), you'll have a really good understanding of Vanilla JS, it's tools and it's syntax (depending on how well you learn, and how well you integrate what you learn).",AmSoMad,2025-05-06 15:47:17,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kg6wi7,False,

mqxyiaf,"you can send the data in an email in csv format without any real programming, but you won't need an exe type program for that either. It can probably be done with just some really snarky batch file, depending on what exactly you have and what exactly you need to do beyond the stated stuff. I highly recommend looking into this idea. The learning curve is very low, just poweruser stuff instead of full on software engineering level. that said, a windows .exe file is generated by turning a programming language (the stuff YOU write) into machine code (the .exe file), which is done by the tools (compiler and linker for example in C++) for that programming language. Some languages are 'interpreted' and do not make an executable program, but instead run directly from the source code. That may also be ok for your needs, but any computer using the program would require the tools to run it, which are not default installed on windows. A windows program that makes actual windows (the GUI) take more know-how, as you have to learn the tools to make the windows and widgets on them. This can be little more than glorified drag and drop to build, but even so, there is some learning curve to it. If you don't do those things, the program will be a 'command line program' and work under the cmd shell (dos shell) that you may or may not use (its part of windows). Such programs just accept typed text and print out response text to the shell, 1980s style. Even when you make a windows exe, the target computer may need something you used -- its often a shocker to beginners that other computers lack the debug libraries so debug mode executables won't usually run on other machines.

mqwxcvd,"If you’re on Windows, just start with Cygwin; it’s very similar to a Linux, but it runs natively on WinAPI without blocking it from you. (Properly, it’s a POSIX operating environment.)MinGW comes with some of the same gunk, even forked from Cygwin, but gives you a much thinner shim around WinAPI, which ranges from irritating to miserable for beginners. (E.g., the Windows environment of the NT kernel—now the sole one AFAIK—has two separate subsystems, console and graphical, and they expose slightly different APIs and behaviors. Cygwin matches other Unixes in model and behavior, which means you can follow Unix tutorials, and if you’re careful with `LONG` vs. `long` you can probably follow some Windows ones too.)WSL2 is another option, but it’s stood off from Windows itself by a hypervisor, which means you don’t get good access to things inside the Linux domain from outside or vice versa.Otherwise, chances are you’re already on Unix. Apple’s Darwin (incl. OS/X→macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, etc. ad ridiculam) is in the FreeBSD family, which derives from Jolix which is a clean-room BSD/Net2 Unix. Linux wasn’t forked from anything, but its kernel tends more towards the AT\&T family of Unixes culminating in System V, rev 4 (SVr4). Android is a variant of Linux using Bionic as libc and very little in the way of shell environment; desktop Linuxes tend to use the GNU libc and environment, of which Bash and GCC are also constituents.On Android, you can install F-Droid and thereby Termux and Programmer’s Keyboard; immediately run `pkg update && pkg upgrade`, then you can install your preferred packages. Termux layers GNU onto Android, giving you a rough, subordinated desktop Linux environment.For desktop Linux, I use Neon, which is an Ubuntu variant for KDE, which is my preferred windowing environment; Ubuntu is a vast family of Debian-based distributions, so pretty much anything major will do—Mint is supposed to be reasonably good, but you do you. Konsole (part of KDE, but runs anyway) is imo the best terminal available on Linux (also works for Cygwin and Win-per-se); open it up, start a [shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), and you’re good. If shit ever breaks, Ctrl+Alt+Fkey will usually drop you to a lower-level terminal, so monkeying is never far away.Most Unixes uses Bash for their interactive shell nowadays, though POSIX mandates certain characteristics for the baseline shell environment, and older systems tend to have their own, quirky Bourne shells. IIRC modern Linux tends to use Ash or Dash for POSIX and startup scripts via /bin/sh—Bash used to be used everywhere.For editing, Kate (also KDE) is a very good GUI (MDI) editor for getting started with, but I strongly recommend you at least install Vim and start learning the basics, whether or not you use it for day-to-day work. It comes with a built-in tutorial, and it’s pretty straightforward to pick up. Very useful when you’re three ssh forwards deep, trying to resurrect a very custom, in-flight supercompute batch job, for example.So that’s 1½ languages to start with, Bash and Vim.I’d probably start in on a C tutorial, also—prefer GCC or Clang; under no circumstances should you use MSVC for C or C++ unless you’re being paid to or have no choice in the matter. Also, I’d recommend staying away from full IDEs in general for just now, since you don’t need all the extra trappings. Build directly from command line, and try to engage directly with the terminal where it’s not counterpurpose. Get a feel for imperativeness.IIRC for Apple, you get a Clang-in-GNU’s clothing with XCode, but I don’t do their nonsense so that may have changed. XCode itself is a …fine editor, but probably overkill for your purposes—syntax highlighting will often not line up with what the compiler actually sees or does.On Linux and Cygwin, you go through the usual package management tools for compilers, or build them yourself if feeling adventurous. `pkg install gcc` for Termux, `pkcon install gcc` for Neon, `apt-get install gcc` for Ubuntu, `yum install gcc` for RedHat, and Arch has its own, fancy mess.If you install all the goodies—sometimes from separate foo-doc packages accompanying foo—you should have Bash `help` built-in command, a `man` command to acess manual pages (e.g., `man man` for man’s manpage), `whatis` and `apropos` to search for manpages, and `info` to browse the info manuals. (E.g., `man gcc` tells you how to run the `gcc` command, and `info gcc` tells you how to use it. /usr/share/doc may also have some goodies.)I recommend installing the POSIX manpages alongside native, where available, and bookmarking or downloading the 2001–2004, 2008–2018, and 2024 editions of the [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/), which is what you aim for if you want your code to be portable to other OSes in the Unix family. (Links to prior versions at bottom of that index page—only 2001/12, 2008/09, and 2024/05 editions are recognizable from within the C-language build environment. You can also find 1988 and 1990 versions as FIPS-151-1 and FIPS-151-2, FWTW and FTTB.)If you learn C, K\&R’s *The C Programming Language,* 2ed (1988—not 1ed from 1978) is the usual approach vector, and you can easily find free copies to work from. It’s a bit out of date, but so is most C software, and you can push forwards from C89 pretty easily using the draft standards, or backwards using XPG, TCPL/1ed, and compiler manuals.[ISO WG14](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is presently in charge of the language (qua ISO/IEC 9899), so they produce standards docs that form the backbone of the language. The final drafts are effectively equivalent text for free, so they form the most portable layer undergirding the language, and then dialect extensions (e.g., GNU, MS), POSIX and X/Open, and other environmental stuff layers atop that. If you want to know whether something ought to be “legal” or not, start at the standard for your language version and then look at your compiler and ABI manuals for how the blanks are filled in.Good luck! I’d probably run through to pointers, then take a dip into assembly and come back, but delve however you like. Most of the system software is in C or C++, and if you’re on Linux, the source code is readily available to explore and play with, so you can reconstruct pretty much everything to your choosing.",nerd4code,2025-05-06 16:59:30,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kfuc30,False,

mr3d3ru,"Whenever someone says ""possible"", they usually mean ""likely"". For example, someone could ask ""Is it possible to play in the NBA?"". The answer is ""Yes, it's possible, because people play in the NBA"", but it is nearly impossible for almost everyone.The odds that you can become a front-end developer are far greater than being in the NBA, which means it's hard to guess whether you can or can't. That's the risk you take. You have to be willing to spend time to get good regardless of whether you make it or not. There are hundreds of thousands of people that want to play in the NBA, and they try really hard. Fortunately, many can play at a much lower level (for fun, at a high school, in college, etc) and so they can gain some satisfaction in doing that even if they can't earn millions of dollars. They want to believe they can make it, which is why they try. You have to delude yourself that you can, until enough evidence presents itself that you can't (or you lose interest).A potential problem with your dream is why you haven't started it. If you are second-guessing yourself (""Should I do it or shouldn't I do it? What are the odds I will succeed?""), then you can run into trouble. Either you have to convince yourself that you are good enough to do it, or you have to say you're going to give it all you've got and not worry whether you're good enough or not because those kinds of worries just stop you from making progress.And really, that's the danger. Once you have doubts, and they start to impact whether you'll learn enough, that can stop you. If you had other goals like ""I want to write a small program to play checkers or a simpler game"" then those goals are more achievable right now.I would consider picking a smaller, reachable goal right no, such as, I'm going to spend 3 months taking some online programming course, and see how I feel.

Recursion takes a case and breaks it down into sub-cases until it gets down to a base case. Induction does the opposite - builds from two base cases every possible sub-case.You can prove your code is correct by doing an induction proof on it - proving the base cases are correct, assuming the recursive calls will provide the right answer, and proving your call will produce the correct result. You can also do this with runtime complexity or amortized analysis. A simpler example is something like merge sort. If you can show ordering 1 element works and is ordered, then show that you can correctly merge two ordered sub-lists into an ordered one, you can prove that your code orders the entire array.

mqgxrd3,"Hey exact same boat here, untreated ADHD, graduated in December from WGU and work full-time as a mobile diesel technician with an ever changing schedule. I hit it extremely hard with the job search and have only had two interviews first one for full-time junior dev, I bombed. Second one, was an internship at the same company, position got pulled because the current state of our economy. That really killed my motivation.After that I pretty much didn’t touch my laptop until about the middle of March, where there was the first local in person hackathon in my city. I signed up and started to get excited about programming again…and then extremely nervous, because up to that point I realized I got through the degree because the “thought process” & “project requirements” were given to me pretty much on a silver platter. With a mediocre grasp on the fundamentals and no real problem solving experience I didn’t want to look incompetent in front of people that were likely much younger and realistically more experienced than me. So, I went to roadmap.sh and started from the beginning with JavaScript. I got reacquainted with the basics and nuances and went to the event, I was in a group of 4, one took building out the frontend, ironically another guy was currently enrolled with WGU as well and he took the backend, the other was our pitch person and that left me as a floater to just help wherever I could. This was the absolute best position for me! the frontend was next.js/tailwind, backend was spring boot with a Postgres db. I remembered enough about the backend and how everything “worked” that I was able to help there anytime our backend guy got stuck or needed a break and was able to pickup right where he left off, having used typescript at WGU and refreshing my js knowledge I was able to figure out enough of next and tailwind to be helpful there too. This helped in a few ways. Building a fullstack app with stuff I hadn’t used and people I don’t even know in 48hrs showed me 1.) I knew more than I gave myself credit for and 2.) I’m capable and genuinely have a love for programming. We lost but since then I have been steadily keeping detailed notes on project ideas that pop in my head at any given time, so I can work through how to actually get started building them and make it a point to spend the downtimes at work to study, listen and consume tech related things and then when I get home in the evenings even if it’s something as simple as writing a function that does something trivial or solving a problem on codewars, I try and code at least something everyday to make it habit. So far I’ve been able to stay pretty consistent with that. Now that WGU has MSCS programs I’m planning to enroll for that to give me a tangible goal and something to work towards since I doubt the job market is going to turn around anytime soon and I want to gain additional skills in a structured way.I know most of the advice floating around is to network, grind leetcode, move cities, etc, but for some of us that isn’t a possibility at the moment and I say find some way for you that makes you excited to get home and build that project or learn that tech stack or concept and keep getting better a little at a time until you finally get the opportunity to make the career change!",AnteaterAvailable571,2025-05-04 01:57:17,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ke6ces,False,

mqqaqys,"From the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/ranges-indexes):>A range specifies the start and end of a range. The start of the range is inclusive, but the end of the range is exclusive, meaning the start is included in the range but the end isn't included in the range. The range \[0..\^0\] represents the entire range, just as \[0..sequence.Length\] represents the entire range.[A comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54092520) on stack overflow contains some sorta lost info on how this came to be:>We decided to follow Python when it comes to the from-beginning and from-end arithmetic. 0 designates the first element (as always), and \^0 the “length’th” element, i.e. the one right off the end. That way you get a simple relationship, where an element's position from beginning plus its position from end equals the length. the x in \^x is what you would have subtracted from the length if you’d done the math yourself.>Why not use the minus (-) instead of the new hat (\^) operator? This primarily has to do with ranges. **Again in keeping with Python and most of the industry, we want our ranges to be inclusive at the beginning, exclusive at the end.** What is the index you pass to say that a range should go all the way to the end? In C# the answer is simple: x..\^0 goes from x to the end. In Python, there is no explicit index you can give: -0 doesn’t work, because it is equal to 0, the first element! So in Python, you have to leave the end index off completely to express a range that goes to the end: x... If the end of the range is computed, then you need to remember to have special logic in case it comes out to 0. As in x..-y, where y was computed and came out to 0. This is a common nuisance and source of bugs.>Finally, note that indices and ranges are first class types in .NET/C#. Their behavior is not tied to what they are applied to, or even to be used in an indexer. You can totally define your own indexer that takes Index and another one that takes Range – and we’re going to add such indexers to e.g. Span.

It's not a shortcoming for JS, because for a senior JS developer it's part of the job to keep a tight ship, code linearity and easily readable unit tests (see examples of Express in JS), but for someone learning: choose TypeScript as long as it is an option (almost always is nowadays).I even believe that frontend needs TS more than backend, because it's harder to structure frontend for code linearity when you have more important hierarchies such as layouts, components, events, async effects, the DOM...

mq65dnf,"I spent the last two and a half years switching careers to CS after a decade in manufacturing. Two weeks ago I got two offers and and accepted one as a Software Engineer without any professional experience. Here's the route I took:2 year technical college. This got me exposure to more programming concepts, experience working on a small team, and a small portfolio of a wide range of applications to pad out my resume without costing a fortune. The applications I ended up with werent fancy, but I put more work into them than I needed to and really tried to experiment where it was allowed.After graduating I started working on personal projects in my free time. I set up a homelab server to learn more about networking and security, and made some small applications that made my life easier both at home and at work. A few of my software solutions got adopted by my company for widespread use. I had fun doing these, but more importantly I was able to replace a lot of the academic work on my resume with these, and it gave me talking points when doing interviews.I'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not, but I haven't had to do any leetcode in any of my interviews. They have been way more interested in talking about the solutions I made, and the impact they've had. I spent a lot more time practicing talking points, terminology, and having a professional conversation because I'm bad at interviews. In the end I believe this helped set me apart, and I highly recommend spending some time explaining parts of your projects to someone (or even just to an AI).When you do start applying places, spend some time customizing each application for the job You'd be surprised how many people don't. Also, it helps to format any examples you give in STAR format. Some say it's outdated, but it helps keep things consice while effectively conveying impact.The market sucks, but some things don't change.

mq4cc77,"I thought I knew the answer, but apparently I was rather off.  Here is Claude's responseI'll explain how physical memory is partitioned into blocks for contiguous memory allocation in operating systems.In contiguous memory allocation, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or variable-size partitions that can be allocated to processes. Here's how it works:Physical memory is organized into addressable units (typically bytes), and the operating system manages this space by dividing it into partitions or blocks. When processes request memory, the OS allocates these blocks based on specific strategies.There are several approaches to partitioning memory:1. Fixed partitioning: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (like your example of 10 MB chunks). Each partition can hold exactly one process, even if the process doesn't need all the allocated space, which can lead to internal fragmentation.2. Variable partitioning: Memory is allocated exactly as requested by processes, resulting in variable-sized partitions. This reduces internal fragmentation but can lead to external fragmentation as processes terminate and free memory becomes scattered.For allocation, the operating system maintains data structures (typically tables) that track:- Which blocks are allocated or free- The size of each block- The process using each allocated blockWhen a process requests memory, the OS uses allocation algorithms such as:- First-fit: Allocate the first available block that's large enough- Best-fit: Allocate the smallest available block that's large enough- Worst-fit: Allocate the largest available blockThe actual implementation involves memory management units (MMUs) that translate logical addresses (used by processes) to physical addresses. These hardware components, along with operating system tables, handle the mapping between a process's address space and physical memory blocks.Modern systems use more sophisticated approaches like paging and segmentation rather than contiguous allocation, as they address many of the fragmentation issues.",mikeyj777,2025-05-02 01:08:17,-9,learnprogramming,t3_1kcor54,False,

The idea that you could cut comp by 50% and increase workload by 50% without a mass exodus is pretty disconnected from how labor markets actually work. Engineers aren't stuck in one company or even one industry. Talent moves. Fast.Tech compensation is high because demand is high, the skillset is hard to build and maintain, and the impact on business is massive. If one company decides to nerf pay and crank up workload, that’s a gift to their competitors. Good devs won’t just stick around out of loyalty or passion; they’ll walk. Even the ""not-so-passionate"" ones are often very competent, and they know their market value.Could there be some cooling in salaries over time? Sure, especially as markets mature or we hit saturation in certain roles. But some exec ""overheard"" saying they want to halve pay and work people harder isn’t a signal of an imminent industry collapse, it’s a signal they’re going to lose talent fast if they try.So yeah, I'd still code if unicorns were real.

That is a sign of the problem, in addition to spending several years and not actually getting software dev experience, which speaks to fundamental motivation.

It will give you a place to say your piece, as well as talk to people who have gone through similar things, de-stigmatizing the shame.People are saying quit trading and gambling. You should, but I am going to tell you that is a *symptom* of the cause, because waiting years to try and get a job after getting a degree, or not applying yourself to available skill learning resources (you literally have to not look for them) indicates that your problems lies in fundamental motivation, and is likely co-incident with other mental illness. You need to fix that first, or at least find a sustainable coping strategy or short term medication assistance, because everything you've described (switching from what sounds like hardcore imposter syndrome pivoting to high risk, low reward strategies as the first shift you've described) points to the problem not being your ability to learn, but in fact, something emotional you're not dealing with that is impairing your ability to deal with your problems, which are not compounding (and not just like the interest on debt).This stuff is worth figuring out and you are not hopeless, you're just mostly avoiding doing this, because I highly doubt I am the first person to say this to you, but in case I am.

G or M > A, partly because A is structured as a VC fund in a trench coat and is much lower prestige, and partly because even in 2025, G and M have wildly better WLB.

mr2oq2k,"I've worked at 3 Fortune 100 companies - so, large companies.The only job postings that I think would qualify are when someone posts a job that is intended for an internal hire. That is when a team has decided to create a job to make a career move for an employee (maybe a promotion, maybe a diagonal move), and in order to create that new role - even if they intend to hire internally - they need to (by law) post the job publicly and have that posting up for at least some amount of time before hiring.EDIT: u/ImSuperHelpful is correct - it's not by law, but it seems to be a very popular policy at a lot of companies to prevent nepotism/encourage diversity. It's been the case at every large company I have worked at. I also wonder if it helps to prevent potential lawsuits for discrimination.The idea of having posts out there that the company does not intend to hire for generally doesn't fly at most companies because the entire process of creating a job posting starts with actually getting a real job approved first.It's also why recruiters can't just create a job posting to look busy - again, it would be the hiring manager (i..e, the person who owns the team where the new employee would work) that would need to get the job itself approved by his leadership before HR and recruiters get involved.Now, I don't doubt that there are some companies that do that - I think that might be true for super mega large companies like Meta, Microsoft - and that is to have a generic job posting meant to attract candidates for a large swath of jobs, but without necessarily having a job opening right this moment. But I think that's a minority of companies that do that.I think as someone else said, the other source of issues might be 3rd party recruiters posting fake jobs to farm resumes - but those should be easy to spot because they wouldn't actually tie to a real company's job posting.I think the reality is that a lot of this job postings are real - there's just so many applicants (including internal ones), that it probably feels like they're fake.",dfphd,2025-05-07 14:49:12,14,cscareerquestions,t3_1kgxzpn,False,

mq81l4l,"This depends on a few things \* The kind of job search you're doing (fishing around for new offers with low information vs already knowing exactly what you want)\* The quality of the recruiter\* The job market that you're inMost of the time I would say no; in general I think it's best to have an idea of where you want to be and give that range for where you want to be. Ex. if you make $80,000 and want to make $100,000 tell them you want to make $100,000 to $160,000 (arbitrary ceiling chosen but give yourself a nice range) rather than you make $80,000. I don't think it's unreasonable to give SOME number, if your number is TOO low then it's possible you should have bolstered your position by understanding the market better (to be fair, sometimes difficult to do).However third-party recruiters don't just have the incentive to match you to multiple companies, they have the incentive to match you ASAP. That means if they're going to companies, they may be getting the cheapest offer just to line you up with a few offers and have you choose (if you are presented with 3 offers ranging from $85k to $95k it may also give the impression that is all companies in your area are willing to pay and cause you to commit early). This isn't always the case, but if you get a lazy recruiter, this is more likely.If you give them a target, they will more likely hunt against that target, in which case you're aligning their goals (getting you matched) with your goal (getting you matched at your target) which I think saves everyone some time in the long run (companies for whom you are out of their league won't bother, companies who are willing to pay more may be more inclined to be more competitive).Hope that provides some clarity.EDIT: I also generally don't like advice to never give a number, I think that's just lazy on the part of the candidate and can be wasteful of the time of the recruiter if they're following leads you would already know are not worth your time.

mqp69tv,"If you're self-admittedly hyper-focused on how others perceive you, don't you see how that could *also* carry over into your perception of how important it is to the industry, recruiters, managers, and referrals? It'd be a little weird if you *didn't* think it was important to them.While there's *some* truth to the fact that prestige can get your foot in the door at a lot of places, it's not a requirement to have a long and successful career. It's not even a requirement to break into FAANG. It can *help*, but it's not necessary.If you think about it, the overwhelming majority of people in this industry are not working at, never have worked at, and never will work at, those top 0.001% of companies that people are referring to when they say FAANG/FAANG-adjancent/big-tech. There's tens of millions of other companies out there that are just considered ""normal"". That's where the bulk of our industry works, not at the companies you see in the TV show that are glamorized by the media.This is a you problem (although a problem many people also share, so you're not alone or anything). How you work through this is way beyond reddit.I have never focused on prestige, I care about a lot of other things more than I do prestige. I've worked for 2 non-tech F500's, a tech F500 (that doesn't have an amazing reputation for software), a medium late stage startup, a large late starge startup, and now another large non-tech company.My career has been just fine.

When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.> ...> Eventually, I had to ask myself: Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing? And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.You just answered your own question, you *feel insecure*. I think you just brushed this off, but it sounds like you feel the need to constantly validate and confirm your worth due to insecurity. Hopefully it should go away once you get some experience under your belt, or if your priority in life changes(such as getting a partner, getting married, starting a family, etc.).Not every successful engineer becomes an icon in the tech world, a social media influencer, or even a revered name that is whispered among their peers. While some become celebrities in their own domains, others prefer a life of quiet anonymity. > But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, career advancement almost entirely depends on perception. Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.This is because you surround yourself with people who believe in this and actively participate in this grind.

mqq7tj5,"You’re right that perception is important. “Your career is what people think of you” is a pretty insightful way to think about progression. But I think you’re thinking about it too simply, and the way you’re approaching it is (at least slightly) counterproductive. It is valuable to be perceived as competent, confident, and personable. When switching jobs, making new connections, or seeking capital investment, peoples default assumption will be that the MIT grad who’s a staff engineer at FAANG is smarter/more capable than the state school grad working in QA at northwest mutual. But I think at some point, you cross a vague threshold where you’re taken seriously at a glance and you don’t really need to worry about micromanaging “prestige”. I’d even say that continuing to be visibly/noticeably concerned with prestige is a negative signal if you’ve already “made it” into high scale software development. It reads either as very self-conscious or very braggy, neither of which are good things for people to think about you. Strongly preferring a big brand like FAANG or a major scale-up over f500 or a small startup is just rational career planning. I don’t mean this in a flippant way, but agonizing about picking meta or google or citadel for prestige reasons is probably a question for therapy. It sounds like you’ve overcome a lot of challenges to get where you are. I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself. But things aren’t as Machiavellian as you’re thinking. People aren’t going to go out of their way to help that person who wouldn’t ever shut up about how awesome they are and how many other offers they got and how hard it was to choose because they’re so impressed with them.

Software isn't a game we play for a day and can take big injuries, but a game we play week after week for years. For you, it doesn't sound like you are in a sustainable work environment -- you'll ever suffer some major health consequences then lose your job, or lose your job a little bit sooner and be back home.Therefore, I'd figure out what you need from your work to start getting on top of your health: maybe that's medical leave, or it could be an accommodation like more WFH. Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.You're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.Also, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: ""This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager"". This complaint is common in a few people I've had to coach for not meeting expecations, and it's difficult for them to understand that praise of a single task, or doing one thing well, doesn't equate to broadly meeting expectations.

mqt440e,"The only tip I can give is maybe list the skill used at each place. It's what I do and I guess it works for me because I've always been doing that and it seems to work for me. Like when you said you used WebSockets you didn't say which language you programmed in. I would list everything packages, library, programming languages or whatever used on any given project. It bloats the resume, but no human is going to read it. You just want to cram in keywords. Even some jobs ask for ""git"" experience and I just assume that is a given and don't list it, but I do ""managed projects with git"" dur. Even when it seems redundant like you used Java at your last two companies, get that keyword in there at each company.Also, it may just be me, but I find a lot of companies don't give a shit about ""non-professional' experience, projects don't get any weight. They will explicitly say so in job descriptions (X years of professional experience with Y). Or recruiters or managers will appear kind of disappointed when you admit you know something from a personal project.And also, you can just lie. A find a lot of companies rarely check you on the skills you know, if you know you can pick it up easily, they won't know the difference once you're on the job. A lot of requirements are written by managers who think you need 5 years with git or else you don't know it at all. And like what I mentioned about projects above, you can just say you did that at your job rather than as a side project.Anyway getting your foot in the door is hard, I got my first job by referral from a relative.

mqfht7f,"It's okay, the struggle is real. The big divide here is you have a CS degree but got non-CS degree work. I'll comment on the CS path first since I know it.If you want to work in CS, AWS Developer Associate is okay to get. Not foundational / practitioner as software developer. Cert won't get any jobs but has a small chance of getting you to the interview stage and helping you with a design problem. Master's in Data Science is a worthless degree. A Master's in CS is useless except either **a)** you can land a paid internship and co-op in CS to reset yourself **b)** reset a long work gap where you feel recruiters are discriminating **c)** you don't actually learn CS with the CS degree or work experienceDoing QA work and deployments, it's more or less a dying job for Americans and has been so for years. Why Cognizant does it, was POS IBM where I was. Newer trend is make the developers do the tester job as well for the same pay. All of a sudden I was coding and deploying my own code with responsibility for all levels of testing. Violates segregation of duty and forces me on 45-50 hours weeks but saves the man money.If you still want to go this route and build on your work experience, yeah the cert is probably okay and degree probably works the same way in that it's a calculated risk. Less a risk if the degree is fully funded. You can do Multivariate Calculus. The shock value ended in Calc II.

So my intent in pursuing these is just for learning something fruitful, then I can hopefully build my own projects to show some competency on my own.I hear what you're saying about the Data Science Master's, it isn't much on its own and actual experience matters. But I can't get a job without experience, and I can't get experience without a job, as the saying goes, so that's why I considered this. Rutgers also offers a Master's in Business and Science which combines data analytics and business courses, but having to fund it myself, fully or partially, I dunno I just don't want to bother with school again, now that I think about it more. Also for calculus, I haven't touched it in well over 5 years, neither at work nor school, basically forgot everything, so that's why I am so hesitant about that part.Companies expecting people to be a jack-of-all-trades just so they can save money is an irritating trend.

mqsijhq,"When I was looking for my first job in 2022-2023 as a self taught without degrees, I researched the job market of my city and found out that jobs were divided into 2 main groups: popular techstacks and unpopular ones. Popular techstacks were Nodejs, PHP, Java, and C# with Nodejs being the most dominant among new grads like 5 to 10 times higher than usual (I asked my cs friends from colleges/universities all over the city and they all confirmed this) while PHP was treated like a second class citizen even though positions were just as much as for all of them. Unpopular ones were Python and Ruby: I'm talking about like just 4 or 5 postings per month.So I had a decision to make, should I compete in popular techstacks knowing that there would be more jobs to apply but the competition would also be crazy or should I choose a less popular one knowing that there would be only a handful of jobs to apply and only a handful to compete against? I picked the latter, learnt both Python and Ruby, and landed my first role after 3 months.Niche stacks have served me really well and now I'm even more invested in them. At my previous and current company, I've got the chance to add Golang and Elixir to my resume too.
