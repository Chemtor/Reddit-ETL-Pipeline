Of course, many emergency responders would also report much higher stress levels. Those folks are probably doing just as good a job as the no-stress folks, but they're thinking about their work differently. Something has clicked in the heads of the no-stress folks, and they can get on and deal with terrible situations effectively without it affecting their internal state. They presumably have healthy mental hygiene outside of work: hobbies, practices etc that keep them on an even keel.I think this applies to all office/corporate/white collar jobs just as much.

mopcy3u,"They can be, but you need to use them appropriately. In data systems there's often a tradeoff between latency, throughput, and query volume. You can easily get a distributed k:v store to ingest millions of entries per second, and each write can be retrieved essentially immediately for low latency results, but it will generally struggle to handle large analytical queries.Your deltalake tables can ingest enormous volumes of data, and are great for huge analytical queries, but there are limitations on the types of write that you can do in the process. Most importantly here MERGE operations have *a lot* of overhead -- you'll be rewriting entire files for an update to a single row, and every write is going to leave behind another time travel copy of the data it just superseded.You can clean up these time travel copies. You run compaction periodically, then do a VACUUM with a custom short time with the necessary override to let it delete files less than a *week* old. You'll still have a lot of overhead processing the merges, however.What is often better with rapidly updating data when using something like deltalake is to move away from merging every single change, and instead just blind-inserting new values to an append-only log with a timestamp of when that row version becomes active. From there a window function looking for the latest timestamp for a given key lets you filter for the 'current data'.Over time the total amount of data will get pretty large, and that will get inefficient. So you can periodically create a proper merged 'current state' table that *doesn't* need the window-function-for-latest filter. Then when querying for the latest data you start with that fully merged table as your base, you anti-join the keys from the timestamp filtered append log, and union data with the window-function-for-latest filter only on the new append log data.That query will skip all the 'previously merged' data from the append log and keep the window processing to a minimum, but still lets you get the latest state from the append log where it applies.You'll want to do something like a bucketby on both tables on the key, so that they are properly organised to minimise shuffles to achieve the joins and window functions.You can tune the full merge period to whatever suits. It could be hourly, or daily, or any frequency you like. Each time you do a merge you can also compact and vacuum to clear out old data. If you partition your append-log by a time bin you can also drop old partitions to save storage space there too -- and it can help with skipping files that won't be relevant.---These sorts of 'streaming into big analysis' issues seem to come up from time to time.

mp5fv8t,"I was very successful on my project with customer matching, exactly what you are talking about. We wound up buying a tool. Biggest single take away is that it’s not “can you do this” but rather “how accurately can you do this”. There are so many tools/techniques that can do this - but the accuracy levels vary. As you pay more, or get more sophisticated, your match accuracy and speed goes up. For example, on the easy end would be to compare address line 1, city, state, and zip from multiple data sources against each other and make the match. There are so many problems with this, so it’s not very accurate. Examples of higher end algorithms include:- Typo detection with various string compare/character distance algorithms- Phonetic representation (matching on how words are spoken not spelled to account for typos)- Address tokenization (not matching 123 4th ave. To 4 123rd ave, because you parse an address into what it represents (house number and street)- Nickname substitution (Tom matches Thomas)- Abbreviation matching (CIA matches Central Intelligence Agency)- Address validation - comparing an address to the US Postal Service to see if it’s real (don’t try matching fictitious addresses)- Understanding name titles - (Mrs, Miss, Sir, Jr, III, II, etc. John Thomas can match Mr. John Thomas, or John Thomas II is different from John Thomas III)Etc…. You get the point…Ultimately, there are two big things: match accuracy and match speed. Accuracy evaluates two records against each other using all the different rules, scores each one, and then this is where you come in — you set weights on the different rules to “tune” the algorithm. Essentially, you are optimizing either overmatching or undermatching — you will never be perfect. In some cases you want to overmatch (say you are sending direct mail promotions and are fine accidentally grouping father and son as same person). In some cases you prefer to undermatch (say you are grouping medial records/data and don’t want to give a child the medication his father is prescribed because you incorrectly linked the two as the same entity). Second big thing is speed. Ultimately, you are comparing each record against each record - do the math…. It’s too long to actually compute. So, these tools take short cuts - they actually only compare subsets of data against each other (important- this means some rows will never be evaluated for a potential match). For example if record 1 is “123 1st St, NM USA” I don’t actually need to compare this one against any data that isn’t from the state of New Mexico (NM). HOWEVER, what if I’m wrong about the original record being in NM? If I am, then I have no hope of making a match (let’s say it’s actually in MN - typo) so my accuracy is compromised because of my speed algorithm. So, again, this is why you pay more as features go up. Can you have speed and accuracy - sure, but it will cost you.NOTE: As an interesting aside, I was also on a Material Matching project. Materials are very different from customers, it’s actually not a data problem but an image recognition problem. Our first approach was to treat it like customer and look at attributes we stored in data (length, width, etc.) and perform the match. It was terrible. Poor data quality, and you can’t capture enough data - for example, you might have same H,W,D and weight, but you don’t capture “right hand” or “left hand” part (which makes them different). The answer is software that matches visually looking at the CAD drawings in 3d. Very cool, and very expensive. Really isn’t a BI problem at this point, but an Engineering problem since it’s in the CAD world.EDIT: you will need a manual method to override matches, and fix them. In my project our software matched 95% of the data correctly!!!! The business had to use 5 full time head count for 1 year to perform the additional 5% match. So - this should tell you how valuable the software is, and how difficult it is to manually match millions of rows of data. EDIT: I didn’t state this, but the process is to create “groups” of data (entities). So, your target data is [group id or entity id], [record id], [attribute columns: name, address 1, city, state…]. The group id/entity id field is just the master record, record id. This can be set as the first record that forms the group/entity (group id=record id) or you can use logic to ensure this is your “golden record”. You have many matching rules, each rule matches rows using the various match algorithms above (think of it as sub-matching) - we had 3 big ones. Highest weight rule was where all attributes matched between two records (name + address), rule 2: name + zip matched, rule 3 - address only matched. First step of the process was a data quality phase - ensure all records have these fields populated - ie: if zip is blank or wrong, we look up address to populate the zip. EDIT: What exactly is a “entity”? You’ll find really interesting situations in your data. For example, for us an entity was a customer/account. We found situations where a customer has multiple buildings, each on different roads (close to each other on their property) which made the addresses very different, requiring manual matching override. Think of a large corporate campus, university, or government facility (military base). All those buildings are on different roads, with different addresses - but are the same entity. It’s very unlikely the tool will match them, since it matches addresses.. so manual overrides are needed (unless you can work in reference data and additional rules about all the various streets on the campus…)EDIT: you’ll also get matching logical problems where record A matches record B, and record B matches record C, so that means A=C. But it shouldn’t…so you have this huge blob of over matched records you need to manually split up. The incorrect matching is coming from data quality problems. Essentially, you have 1 bad address row causing two entities to be incorrectly linked. This can happen when businesses use central billing locations - like a corporate headquarters, or a state/city office. For example, the city cemetery and the city water treatment, and the city transportation service all get linked because their data comes to you via the cities single administrative building with a single address.EDIT: I really liked this book. Data Matching, by Peter ChristenEDIT: Think about what you are going to do with the data. If it’s data warehousing only, you might want to build a “reference style Master Data Management database”. This essentially is only used for data warehouse/analytics, and consumes data from systems but does not push data to source systems (or claim to own customer). But if you need to create the enterprise definition of the truth, and your job is to “own” the definition of customer for the enterprise — then you need to catch customer data being entered in various source systems, master it quickly, and push it back to those systems. There are different styles of MDM architecture/tools. Same matching principles - but speed and integration becomes a more important requirement.",rotr0102,2025-04-26 14:27:15,22,dataengineering,t3_1k8dmdp,False,

mo8d5t4,"If you can’t touch the source (no log access?), your best bet is the full extract + diff approach you mentioned.You can try primary key diffing: Compare today’s extract to yesterday’s and consider anything missing likely a delete. This works fine for daily batch and is reliable if PKs don’t change.To make it a bit more robust, consider soft-deletes downstream. In your warehouse, mark missing records as deleted rather than removing them. This way you keep history and avoid accidental data loss.To “optimize”a bit, you can do a hash-based comparison. If tables are huge, and full PK comparison is too slow, you can hash rows or chunks of data to detect changes and only diff those chunks.Also, some teams snapshot the full table daily and treat it like slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2). Storage-heavy, but you get full history without needing to touch the source.Re: tooling, Python with Pandas or even dbt (as an SQL option) can handle the diff logic but it will be kinda complex to maintain.Now, the issues with this are:1. Late-arriving data can look like a delete if yesterday’s extract was missing a row that shows up today.2. Extract gaps (like job failures) can cause false positives.3. High-churn tables can make diffing expensive or slow.So keep these in mind.That said, I definitely recommend pushing for log-based replication though. It will make your life 100x easier.

Another tip, you can take a look at Fivetran's teleport sync and try it out. If your company has a budget to use it, good for you. If not, try to use the Fivetran teleport sync on a test DB where every query is shown in the log. You'll see each query that Fivetran uses to do their CDC. You can try to reverse engineer it.

mp6ylpg,"Yes - because you're retaining history at the raw/source layer, you can easily go back and create scd-2 type tables with valid to/from fields later as needed. So for your current use case, sure. I would however advise you to consider that what your stakeholders consider to be current data and what you consider to be current data may not be the same thing. So, for example, if you're doing dimensional modeling and you're choosing to only use current data in your dim tables, you're missing out on what could be critical information for each fact line in the time that it was loaded. For example, if they want to track customer activations and deactivations, you would use a historical dim customer table for that. So as long as you have this in mind and are prepared to shift to historical dim tables when these requests come up, you should be fine. Regardless, because you are retaining that history at the raw source layer, you'll be fine.

I recommend sticking to the big 3 - AWS, Azure or GCP. Platform: You have Snowflake and Databricks as the major ones. Use Snowflake if you only care about data warehousing and BI. It's easy to learn and quick to get started on. Use Databricks if you also want machine learning and a few other neat features like advanced analytics and big data processing. The learning curve is a bit steeper in my opinion, but it's worth it because of better flexibility/control.Tools: look into are dbt, SQLMesh, airflow, kafka, fivetran, terraform, pyspark and the list goes on. I highly recommend dbt because it allows you to easily abstract data modelling and transformations while remaining (nearly) platform agnostic. SQLMesh is also proving itself to be quite good, outperforming dbt in certain things like write operation times and incremental models, but has a much smaller community than dbt. You can use fivetran for integrating a gazillion sources. I won't go through all of them, but I definitely recommend looking into pyspark if you're working with large data sets. It will significantly boost your pipeline performance! All in all, there are so many decisions to be made. My advice is to keep it stupid simple. Pick only what you need and nothing more.

The change control window in Coalesce is similar to Git - it has two panels that show your modifications vs the last committed version and the changes are highlighted. As for committing all changes or line item, it really depends on how frequently you commit.

moj785f,"Seminal book on the topic is “Designing Data Intensive Applications”, but that is pretty general.I think for spark specifically, the best thing you can do is inspect the spark ui. You can read about the different types of joins spark does (shuffle, broadcast etc) and even use hints in your SQL or pyspark to force a certain one.SQL and pandas and spark have a lot of differences, but one thing that’s helped me is learning the fundamental data structures at play. SQL databases use a B-tree for its index, so if I 10x my data size, my reads are only 2x slower. Parquet uses a bloom filter so you can filter it with a WHERE clause extremely quickly. Chapter 3 of designing data intensive applications goes into this.Related to this, one neat optimizations databases do is use statistics for query optimization. For example, if you have [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) statistics, the query optimizer can get more accurate cardinality estimates on your data. This can really help if you have many joins. There’s a good paper from Meta and others (including Pandas creator Wes McKinney) going into the differences between all of these systems, and it gives a good overview of what needs to happen between you submitting a query and getting data back: https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2679-pedreira.pdf",Candid_Art2155,2025-04-23 01:11:49,4,dataengineering,t3_1k5mazo,False,

What data products you support require real time. This can usually reduce the scope of the streaming data you need to manage in real time.2.

moibijc,"1. Iceberg is a protocol that defines both how the metadata and data files are represented in your object storage. That means that all your existing non Iceberg data, even if already parquet, has to be rewritten in Iceberg format. The data itself will end up as parquet files, but these parquet files will be located and structured according to the Iceberg spec. 2. If your new data arrives as parquet files on S3, you'll have to configure some kind of pipeline to detect new files and INSERT/MERGE them into existing Iceberg tables. I recommended to someone on here recently to use a cron or lambda in conjunction with Athena to accomplish this. There are many ways to approach this. 3. Yes! a lot of engines support reading Iceberg (and Delta Lake). Particularly if you are using AWS Glue as a catalog. You can leverage Iceberg tables in Redshift, Spark, Athena, Trino, Snowflake, Clickhouse, and a few others if you have Iceberg tables cataloged with AWS Glue.

mokfigo,"I actually built Iceberg support in daft and can speak to some of the… frustrations about the ecosystem :face_with_tongue:1. Iceberg is just a storage format. In order to do anything with it, you need a data engine that understands the protocol and can read/write from it. Historically, only Spark really understood this protocol (because all the logic for this protocol was written in a .jar). Nowadays, other engines are slowly catching on. 2. Yep — if a new parquet file drops somewhere, you’re going to need to run some kind of job with your data engine of choice to read that file and write the data into your iceberg table. No magic here unfortunately and different engines might do this differently :(3. Now here’s the real kicker… if you want the latest and greatest features in Iceberg I would argue (very sadly) that Spark is the only engine that can do the newest stuff. Iceberg itself is pretty much just developed against Spark, and there is even logic in Spark that doesn’t follow the Iceberg spec that other engines have had to follow because of how ubiquitous Spark-written iceberg tables are in the wild :(The problem is that the iceberg protocol itself is very complex, and all the logic for adhering to the spec was originally written for the JVM. So only JVM tools such as Spark can leverage the latest features. That being said though there is tremendous progress being made in other ecosystems such as the PyIceberg ecosystem and iceberg-rust that are promising. We leverage PyIceberg for reads/writes of metadata (but do our own data reads/writes) which so far seems to be a great compromise :)",Hgdev1,2025-04-23 06:28:14,6,dataengineering,t3_1k5ghoy,False,

mp4e1s9,"The short answer is clustering can be beneficial when inserting records if implemented correctly. The long answer:Columnar storage in general (not just BigQuery) is usually stored as read-only files that have built in metadata describing what data is in each column. This allows for more efficient filtering at the file level. It is slightly more complex than this when it comes to a Data Warehouse like BigQuery, but generally when you “merge” a record into columnar storage, you can think about the operation like this:1. Search for the file your data is potentially in based on file metadata2. If the record could be in a file based on the metadata, read the existing data in to memory3. Find the matching rows in each column4. Update them if they exist5. Overwrite the existing file in storage and update the file metadata if a record was insertedClustering improves look up speed in this process by making it more efficient to find the right file to operate on. For instance, let’s say you have a table of product purchases with a reference to the customer who made the purchase. This table has mutable attributes like product delivery date (NULL until it has been delivered) that need to be updated on delivery of the product. An appropriate clustering field for this table might be customer_id, which would logically group all purchases by the associated customer_id when writing to a file. This way, instead of needing to read potentially every file in the table in to memory to try and find a purchase to update, it is able to read in only a select file or two. In order to take advantage of this, you would need to use the customer_id in the merge predicate.",EngiNerd9000,2025-04-26 09:51:59,4,dataengineering,t3_1k82dcn,False,

Parquet is a good general purpose way to store time series, and also works well for logs and images (hint: use zstd compression for large blobs, not snappy). Importantly it is fast and compact, and this data is optimal for your analytical/ML workflows. You can also set up batch reading/writing if your dataset gets bigger than available memory. Then records can be loaded from parquet to your OLTP database. Depending on how your data is stored on disk, duckdb could be a good tool here - especially if you have a larger than memory workload. It supports reading data in many formats, including raw blobs or text data (for images/logs).

For multimodal data, you can most likely get away with storing a URL pointer in Parquet, and the raw data as a file with an appropriate encoding (e.g. JPEG).

However, if this is true you can have a single task managing scd's: SELECT * FROM TABLE ( INFER_SCHEMA ( LOCATION => '@your_stage/path_to_files/', FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format' ) );Better yet you can create a table from stage with: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE your_table USING TEMPLATE ( SELECT ARRAY_AGG(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(*)) FROM TABLE ( INFER_SCHEMA( LOCATION => '@your_stage/path_to_files/', FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format' ) ) );This will essentially automatically add the fields for the table -- see documentation above. You can also do something like: ALTER TABLE your_existing_table SET ENABLE_SCHEMA_EVOLUTION = TRUE;On an existing table and then any \`COPY INTO\` would automatically track and gracefully handle schema changes. **\*There are limitations, so please read the docs carefully\*.** This should dramatically reduce your dynamic SQL needs to the point where only your mart/dwh layers should have to alter their SQL, but it would depend highly on any unknown complexities.If your data is being ingested directly to a raw table and not a stage -- your options become a bit more limited to probably what you are already doing without any 3rd party tooling or some large SP / Task doing the bulk of the work.The greater answer to your overall post is likely -- tasks aren't the wrong choice, but there are probably better options.

Languages are tools, concepts translate between them. If you master one, then you'll stand out vs. others who mastered none, and you'll pick up any language required of you on the job in weeks.- DSA classes & Leetcode. Most important part of CS due to how interviews are structured. Do 250 most common LC problems and focus on easy/medium unless targetting FAANG for first job.- Build practical projects. Initially start simple, like that easy react page you created. You learn by doing 10x faster than tutorial hell. You need to learn how to structure your own projects and build something from A to Z, from having an idea to breaking it down in small parts and building it out (without guidance provided in tutorials).- Project structure for bigger applications, everything has its own place and the quicker you start modulating projects the way they do in production the faster you'll grow.- Find a specialization and focus on it. Try simple projects: react frontend page you did, then try building a backend API with CRUD, try building a simple ETL pipeline for data, then try a simple github CI/CD with github actions and dockerize one of the apps. Nothing complex. Cover basics of each, build them in a few days, and then ask yourself: which one seems most interesting to you, which one seems like something you'd like to pursue?Specialization matters heavily. Everyone spreads themselves thin, and if your goal is to achieve what CS grads do in 4 years, you should pick something early on and master one area.

Rarely are there rigorous dives into the properties of the underlying enabling abstractions. If you are learning these at a university, the typical course names are calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, complex variables, nonlinear dynamics.Then there’s the math that's just about uncovering the deep underlying properties of abstractions. Everything is built from first principles, rigorously, no details overlooked. Definitions/theorems/proofs are the focus. Computation is an afterthought. Typical university course names are real analysis, abstract algebra, topology, formal logic.The former will improve your ability to program, but the latter will really improve your ability to program, come upwith algorithms, general mathematical reasoning and much more at the expense of increased difficulty.Personally, rudin’s intro to real analysis (principles of mathematical analysis, or colloquially, baby rudin) changed my life.

These days automatic transmissions are faster than humans can shift and nearly as reliable with less and less horsepower loss as the years go by. What your instructors are getting at is similar. C and Rust are cars with manual transmissions or in computer terms manual memory management. C#, Java, and the node.js platform are automated memory management languages. Manually controlling gears, downshifting into a corner, clutch kicking when you want the ass end of your car to slide, and dumping the clutch for a nasty burnout are things you can only do in a stickshift. Similarly, manually allocating heap (and stack) memory, directly accessing processor register information, running online assembly and other features are only possible in systems languages like C and Rust. Most people just want to get to work and back safely which is why most cars these days are automatic. Business software (and jobs) are the exact same. Businesses don't want to hire you to write a compiler or window manager. They probably want a crud app that is fast enough and doesnt look awful.

mommpil,"Everyone else is talking about speed and I think that's completely missing the point, there are very good reasons to use C++ other than just speed.Here are some things you can do in C++ that you can't do in Python. All of these things you can also do from C. Many of these things you can also do from Rust and other languages that compile to native code, but not all of them.1. Call native operating system APIs directly. If you're on Windows, go to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and explore the tens of thousands of APIs. The ONLY way to call these APIs directly is from a compiled language like C++. If you call them from any other language you're just calling some wrapper function that calls the function from C. That's even true for C#, even today there are some Windows APIs that you can't call from C#. Some specific examples below.2. Memory mapping. Let's say you have a 1 GB file. In C++ you can memory map that to an array of bytes with 1 billion elements. The memory map function returns almost instantly, it doesn't copy the file into RAM. When you access byte 777,000, it doesn't read the previous 700 thousand bytes, it just reads only one small chunk of the file from disk into memory at the moment you access it.3. Shared memory. You can have multiple processes on the same computer that ""share"" a chunk of memory directly. To communicate they don't need to copy huge data structures back and forth if they don't want to.4. Hardware drivers. Using C++ you can write directly to a memory address, or read directly from a memory address. Most hardware peripherals are entirely controlled this way, by communicating via nothing other than accessing special memory addresses plus hardware interrupts to let you know when something changed. On a modern operating system you can only do this if you write a kernel driver, but if you get an embedded development kit you can write bare-metal code that talks to keyboards, sound chips, push buttons, or whatever just using direct memory reads and writes.5. Hooking system functions / injecting code into other processes. For example on Windows, write a DLL that provides an alternate implementation of some common function like ShowWindow, then inject that DLL into some other process so every time they call ShowWindow, it actually calls your function instead.",dmazzoni,2025-04-23 16:00:35,223,learnprogramming,t3_1k5xqyo,False,
molmju8,"A useful resource is Bjarne Stroustrup's site for A Tour of C++: [https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html](https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html)Even if you don't use that book, you can look at his exercises document, which could be used in principle along with ANY C++ learning reference. And if you look through it, you will very quickly find little ""baby projects"" that could be made that are very C++-specific. For example, let's look at the list for concurrency:> \[2\] Write a program with two threads: one that writes ""hello"" every second and one that writes ""world!"" every second.>\[3\] Time a loop. Write out the time in milliseconds. Do this for the default setting of your compiler and for a setting using an optimizer (e.g., −O2 or ""release""). Be careful not to have the optimizer eliminate your whole loop as dead code because you did not use a result.>\[4\] Repeat the histogram drawing example from §5.6.3 for a normal\_distribution and 30 rows.>\[5\] Use a regex to find all decimal numbers in a file. So, on that list, \[2\] and \[3\] \*could\* be done in Python, but they would not make sense. The issues that Mr Stroustrup is trying to teach here (e.g. how concurrency works on the OS or hardware level) is probably best observable in C++. Also for \[3\] this is purely a C/C++ thing. Python turns code into bytecode in a completely different way. I very doubt that Python does loop elimination or anything like that, for example. Also, to properly do all parts of \[3\], you will also need to look at the assembly language output of your code to see what optimizations your compiler is doing (and to really verify whether it is eliminating loops, and under what conditions it does that).Exercises \[4\] and \[5\] probably could be done in any language, of course Python would be an easy language to use for \[5\]. I'm not sure why Stroustrup placed these exercises in the concurrency section. Maybe he mentioned those topics in the same book chapter for some reason.",chaotic_thought,2025-04-23 12:53:27,23,learnprogramming,t3_1k5xqyo,False,

Without those skills, you can't get any experience, so it's a necessary part of the puzzle! But the tech boom of the last decade or so has meant a **lot** of people have learnt some coding skills, so jobs increasingly require both skills **and** experience.>how the heck does programming even work? What the hell is happening?Think about a simple circuit, with a battery, a push button and a lightbulb: you press the button, the lightbulb switches on; you unpress the button, it switches off.Now imagine you have a 7-segment LCD display (like the ones on digital clocks that display numbers): that's just 7 versions of the same thing, so in order to display the number ""5"" on your screen, you need to press and unpress the right combinations of 7 buttons. But that's really annoying, so instead, you create a mega-button labelled ""5"", and just wire it so that when you press the ""5"" button, it press and unpresses all the right buttons for you. Congratulations: you have abstracted away the electronics, and now you have a simpler interface.Programming is just that: abstractions upon abstractions. You can't write a ""hello world"" program by interfacing with the monitor directly - mapping each key on your keyboard to the setting and unsetting of individual pixels - primarily because that would be insane. It would be like my 7-button example above, but trillions of buttons. Computers would be utterly unusable without abstractions to handle all that for us.>I know I could probably just import a GUI library and use it, but I don't want to just use a library, I want to understand how this technical stuff (that my school didn't teach) works.Firstly, don't blame your school for not teaching you how to build a computer from scratch out of transistors and diodes. That's like complaining that your school allowed you to buy pens and notebooks, rather than teaching you how to grind your own ink, whittle your own quill, fell your own tree and process it into paper. If you're really, deeply interested in that, then you **can** work towards it: it's not a bad thing to do, it's just a very niche thing to do. For most people, as they transition from school to work, they should really be focusing on what they need to do / learn / practise to make their skills **productive**.

Let me throw my opinion.You're asking yourself how a ""programmer"" thinks as in, what's the type of mentality you should be following to produce proper code.But the truth is the code and good coding practices is just one of the many tasks one actualy has to think of about because being a ""programmer"" almost never means _just coding_.The actual job involves a lot of aspects, to name a few potential examples: finding customers, understanding what they need and want, planing resources like time and money, concepting about data transfer, data quality, user experience, security aspects, documenting all of the above... and endless others.You can study all you want, do plenty of tutorials and watch a dozen YouTube videos but without a proper project this all means little, and this is the reason many people fail to find a job or gather experience to begin with.So here is what you should be doing: simulate projects. Find yourself either a friend or family member. Inform yourself about their daily tasks, their interests or hobbys and figure out where there could be need to have an application or automatization process to make their daily routine easier.Or, at last resource _pretend_ that you have a hypothetical customer, take up on different and role-play with yourself (for example, pretend that you're Person ABC, a developer, DEF, a customer, GHI, a project manager, etc, and even send emails to yourself).Now that you have a _reason_ / a project to code, research about all the steps that a project usualy requires from start to finish (GPT can help you if you don't undergo a specific training) and go through all of the steps.Yes, this will triple or quadruple the actual effort rather than just coding, but this is essential for your experience, professionalism, and ensuring you've concepted and properly planned the actual development phases and don't end up stuck in a loop of overcorrecting your implementations, because you also must set yourself time and hypothetical budget deadlines.There is only so much information I can provide here in a few sentences but I hope this helps you understand how a ""programmer"" works. Being ""just"" a programmer doesn't realy exist. You will in most cases be at least a team member, preferably also a Consultant, potentionaly even a project manager or even a freelancer. Grasping all the involved roles and being able to understand their minimum requirements will help you understand what's actualy important.Also, last tip, start very small, with little apps and ""customer expectations"". Stuff that seems easy done and implemented can add a lot of effort and grow the project exponentionaly because each part of the project needs some extra time for that specific aspect to consider.

Now programmers do indirectly memorise syntax, but it's only because this is a byproduct of understand the syntax.This would be my suggestion:1. Take an example of some C++ code from the internet.2. Open a text editor and type in the code. Don't copy and paste the code. The typing will help you to remember things.3. Run the code through a compiler making sure it compiles and runs. Understand what the running code is doing.4. Now go back to the editor and write one or more lines of comment for every line code in the file. Tie some of the comments back to the behaviour you saw when you ran the code.5. Now go back to step 1 and repeat this for another dozen or so different examples.Those 12 examples could easily be a day's work, only because you will need to research each and every line of code so that you can write the line of comment for code that makes sense and is accurate. But what you should also find; as you loop through more examples that process of adding a comment get easier; you should also find the typing gets easier and is more accurate.Now if you repeat this for two or three weeks, you'll find your way on the way to being a programmer.And using this approach you can actually measure your progress. If after one week you're still struggling to write a line of comment for each line of code, then you really have not learned much. Over those many examples there will be many common lines of code, meaning the comments will also be common. It is the details found in those comments that you are trying to memorise, not the code.PS: For context, here are some examples typical line comments. But in general, these comments should also span more than one line.// import the iostream.

So for example if a project builds with gcc, clang, and MSVC they might wait until all three support all of the syntax, but if the project only needs to run on one platform with one toolchain they might upgrade sooner.Allowing features from a newer C++ rarely means updating all existing code. Parts of the code that are stable and haven't changed in a while might still be written in an older style, including a pre-C++11 style.So if you joined a company today and got put on a C++ project, my expectation would be that it supports and allows C++20 (which has been stable in all compilers for a while), does not support C++23 (most compilers have incomplete support, the average project doesn't want to be bleeding-edge), but that lots of the code doesn't take advantage of newer features where it could because nobody has bothered to rewrite it.Newer versions of C++ standardize things like networking and threading that were previously only available from third-party libraries.

This includes goddamn function arguments- despite arrays not really existing, there is still a length operator- indices starting at 1 ... but ofc. since arrays and maps, sorry *""tables""* are the same thing you can still *assign* to `tablename[0]`- another consequence of this absurdness is this completely valid assignment: ´arr[-42] = ""oh uh""`- tables are also conflated with objects: `t[""name""]` and `t.name` both work the same. Not even Python is that stupid.- without `local`, assignments default to the nearest var of the same name. If there isn't one, they default to global. Meaning, accidentially generating or overwriting global state is really easy. Combine that with the silent nil-derefing, and you see why debugging Lua feels about as good as a papercut.- only the last arg to functions works as a vararg, but you can still put a vararg before the last...and silently get everything but the first argument dropped- general syntactic idiocy: the `:` pseudo-accessor, the `..` operator, the `#` operator. The lang has `not` as a boolean operator, but somehow `~=` (not-equal) is a thing. The `end` keyword to end blocks with.

Also consider your definition of a ""project"".A project does not have to be large. And if you do have a larger project in mind, you can probably break it down into smaller ones. When I was writing file parsers as part of an automated test tool (it took in a file describing expected values and various data recording files), I studied parsing techniques. I wrote a variety of one-off programs that parsed the various input file formats and then turned them into libraries that could be used by the actual target program. Each one of these took me 1-5 days (some formats were simple, others were not, by the end I was able to reuse code as well for similar formats), then I integrated them into my main program and glued it all together and had a beta version for my colleagues.What I didn't do was try to implement all the parsers all at once (context switching between each task) or only write them as part of the main program with no way to evaluate my partially working system. By setting them up as these one-offs I was able to stay focused, generate some tests, and figure out if I really was parsing the data correctly (mostly taking the parsed data and regenerating the original files and comparing the two).If you have multiple projects that you want to complete, set deadlines. Decide that ""By 15 May I want project X to have features A, B, and C."" Then do it. If there's no external driver of priority (no work or school objective, all personal) you declare your priorities. Otherwise everything is the same priority and no progress is ever made. Even for work I do this. If I have a 12-month project with no one deciding which features needed to be done by a particular date, I just set them myself. If the customer/user didn't like my ordering I'd ask for their priorities and if they still didn't give them (or everything was #1) then I stuck to my plan.

That being said, low code environs can be massively helpful in niche fields like computational geometry where having visual feedback for geometry manipulation is - I'd say - almost mandatory.From what I've seen so far - no-code or low code tech seems to thrive in cases where (a) the majority of the users aren't programmers, and (b) outputs from these technologies aren't the deliverables in and of themselves.By deliverables I mean the end product being shipped/deployed/put into production.For example, in the construction industry - architects and engineers will frequently use no-code solutions to build quick and dirty prototypes for their projects. But these prototypes aren't the deliverable, the drawings and 3d models are. They'll use the prototypes as seeds/base for building mode complex models sure, but the direct output from a no-code or low code solution is rarely ever passed on as the actual deliverable.To sum it all up - For a typical career in programming, I feel you don't really need it (outside of cases where using them speeds up the feedback loop).

If you understand that concept, you pretty much know all that you need to to make an Application Programmer's Interface. You could take a read into Interfaces in Java, for example, to get a better sense. (Not all languages have explicit Interface constructs, but the concept still exists: a set of abstract calls that do something specific that can be used without any specification on how they are implemented (a black box)).",rinio,2025-04-22 13:02:14,2,learnprogramming,t3_1k55eqj,False,
mogevaw,"POV: I've taught CS for many years, including general programming and APIs.APIs are a specific style of data transfer, which is a variation of input and output. So what you're wanting to learn is a particular style of programming. That's a good goal, but you need to learn general programming concepts before you can comprehend a specific subset of coding. There are two distinct ways of thinking about APIs, and both depend on some knowledge of core programming ideas. First, you can write a program in any language that *consumes* an API. That is, you can write a program that uses an API to find the current weather in Barbados. This is a relatively straightforward process in most languages, but typically you learn this after you've learned more fundamental things, like how to get information from the user or from local files, how to handle looping and branching, and how to write functions.The other way to think about APIs is to *produce* an API. In that sense, you are writing a program that lives on some type of server that produces data in some kind of machine-readable format (usually JSON, but other formats are certainly viable). This is also not a difficult process, but it requires knowledge of essential programming concepts, and typically you'll also want to write a front-end package to test your API. I would say start with any good programming course. There's a good reason Python is taught as a first language in most CS courses. It's reasonably straightforward, and is excellent for a number of use cases, including working with APIs. You can read and create APIs with Python out of the box, but for creating an API, you'd probably be better off using a library like flask, bottle, or rapidAPI. I would definitely learn standard programming ideas first before digging into libraries. Express.js is fine, but it's a specialized form of JavaScript that doesn't make any sense if you don't already know how to program in vanilla JS. It seems to me that CodeAcademy has a more organized curriculum. It doesn't go straight into using APIs, but that is fine. If you can't drive yet, race cars don't matter. Learn to program in a language, then we can focus on the particular skills you want. FreeCodeCamp is great for looking up a specific skill, but it often makes a lot of assumptions about what you already know.

And I'll tell you, I'm pretty sure there are just two different kinds of programmers and I don't think there's a major problem with either approach *as long as* the people with your approach are making sure to clean it up as they go. *Personally*, I find myself thinking contract-first. Regardless of *specific* guts any given function (or class or anything) needs, what is the contract it makes with the outside world. If I want to calculate the distance between two sets of latitude & longitude coordinates... I may not yet know exactly how to correctly calculate that... but figuring out the exact contract I want for handing that work off to a function is pretty trivial: func calculateDistance(from: Coordinate, to: Coordinate) -> Distance { return 0 }(for whatever syntax you need for your language) If I chunk my application up in this way, I can write the main flow of `main` or whatever into this smaller bites and start with an organized structure of code that I just need to go back and fill in little chunks bit by bit.If it's easier for you to implement all the logic first *then* slice chunks off to move into functions, I think that's *also* fine.... but it also means the contracts, the interface, becomes kind of an afterthought *and* it means your first pass likely has you non-obviously duplicating some code.",nhgrif,2025-04-25 12:41:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1k7dit2,False,

This massively increases adoption and helps you get grants and sponsorships \- Build it for you first; everyone else comes second otherwise you lose grasp of the visionBasically:\- No one will use it if the documentation sucks or if the github looks dead \- Integrating with other tools is the fastest way to grow since you are tapping into existing userbases \- During downtime or if you get writers block, use your framework as a content creation engine...this gets you views and also helps you apply for grants etcAs for resources:\- Look up ""Commercial Open Source Software"", even if the point isn't to make money it helps you understand how big frameworks gain momentum \- Keep an eye out for fellowships and foundations, eg I received over $15k in grants from Processing Fellowship alone by integrating with p5.js and three.js",qrxer,2025-04-23 15:43:26,5,learnprogramming,t3_1k61676,False,

It helps us think clearly and communicate precisely.Our motto? “If you can’t draw a simple model to show what you mean, you don’t know what you’re doing.” Had an intern once say he couldn’t show his idea in UML—meeting got pushed to the next day, and he was told to come back with diagrams. He did, and he learned.Now, for fast-moving projects like web dev, I get that full diagrams might feel like overkill—but there’s still real value in being able to sketch your thoughts quickly and clearly.",RightWingVeganUS,2025-04-23 22:16:47,8,learnprogramming,t3_1k69qeo,False,

mokosj2,"Python is a good start and is enough to understand programming concepts.To be completely fair, the most important concepts you need to learn have nothing to do with actual programming or languages. Those are your foundations - Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Databases. There’s a very good reason most universities focus on theory for the first two years of a CS degree, and not so much on coding. Learning these will make you understand programming as a whole. After that, any language will be equally valuable to you.To answer the question. I’d say, after learning Python well, you can either go useful, frontend or lower level (well every other language is lower level but that’s not the point).If you want to find a job as quickly as possible, learn Java or C#. Those languages are by far the most used in the industry and there’s never lack in demand (keep in mind that there is also a lot of supply). If you choose this option, you have to know that you’ll also most definitely need to learn their respective web frameworks - Spring and .NET, as they are pretty much required by the job market. This is a very good path to take and I can highly recommend it. Also, keep in mind that there’s a very good chance you circle around to Java/C#, even if you choose a different path now, since these are one of the most essential languages and are taught and used everywhere.Another popular route is to master JavaScript and become a capable full-stack developer. That’s also where React comes in. React is a JavaScript framework used for simplifying the way to build responsive web interfaces. I think there will be time in the future to worry about frontend, so I wouldn’t choose learning JavaScript at your current stage.Finally, the lower level route. I personally encourage any beginner to go deep into the land of pointers because you gain soo much more understanding of the way a computer works, than you do by using Python or JavaScript. For this I recommend you go with either C or C++ (personally, I’d go with C). These languages are what we call “lower level” because they don’t have fancy built in features to simplify the hard stuff and you have to think a lot more about everything. Those languages have no “garbage collection” meaning you need to allocate your own memory, and you need to free it when you don’t use it anymore. They use pointers to reference the data you use. C has no Object Oriented Programming, meaning you can only encapsulated data using a “struct”, and you can’t have methods tied to that data (procedural programming).",todorpopov,2025-04-23 08:04:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1k5s9wt,False,

We all have our favorite little solutions, but if you can write a function with a loop and a few \`if\` statements, you're done.>However, the above link doesn't explain why the hashmap solution is more efficient.Hashmaps trade space for time. They offer O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, which is to say that you can find, add, or remove an element in constant time regardless of whether it contains 5 elements, 5 thousand, or 5 million. But they get that speed by using enough space to avoid collisions (where different keys hash to the same location) most of the time, so they're very efficient in time, much less so in space.>I've heard that in technical job interview problems, if you can use a hashmap, then you should. Would you agree with this?Certainly not. Use the right data structure for the job. Hashmaps are often a great choice, because if you can get constant-time access to every element, that's pretty appealing. But hashmaps are unordered, so a poor choice if you want to access elements in order. They use a ton of space, so not great if there's a space constraint or if the number of elements is huge.

momk8j9,"Big O, `O()`, is an **abstraction** to help us _estimate_ algorithm complexity, performance, and scalability. * In _theory_ there is no difference between theory and implementation. * In _implementation_ there can be a HUGE difference.Like all abstractions the devil is in the (implementation) details.The reason we DO count instruction cycles when profiling is because it gives us an absolute time that we can use to compare against. We can compare:* _actual_ **run-time** time versus the* _expected_ **theoretical** best case. That is, we can do A vs B comparisons such as A is `X%` faster or `Y%` slower to answer the question: _Is our optimization helping, hindering, or neither?_But oftentimes we want to know HOW an algorithm scales up relative to input size. `O()` is an _estimate_ of this which may, or may NOT, be accurate:If we have three algorithms that all perform the same task and have this scaling ... * O( n )* O( n^K )* O( K^n )... then the linear `O( n )` algorithm is probably going to be the fastest, by far, all things considered.However `O()` IGNORES RAM speed, RAMaccess patterns, and branch prediction -- all which MAY be factors!The _reason_ this was done was that pre-2000's CPU speed and RAM speed roughly had a 1:1 mapping. We used to store calculations in tables because the computation speed was SO slow.However by the 2000's CPU speeds became significantly faster than RAM. As CPU speeds increased and RAM didn't (as much) it became faster to calculate more, lookup less.Unfortunately Computer Science textbooks never got the memo that `O()` has COMPLETELY failed to adapt to the changing hardware and performance uplifts of modern systems. **It is an INCOMPLETE metric.**Let's take a [simple example](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/cache_line_speed) of summing up entries in an array. sum = 0; for( int col = 0; col < STRIDE; col++ ) for( int row = 0; row < SIZE; row += col ) sum = data[ row + col ];_Normally_ stride is 1, sequential acess, but what if it isn't?We can change the stride to show HOW we access data (and the data cache) plays more and more of a role the larger the data set.For example with an array of 2^30 elements (1,073,741,824) we see this falloff:| Stride | Op/s | Time ||--:|--:|--:|| 1 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 2 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 4 | 733 M/s | 00:00:01s || 8 | 388 M/s | 00:00:02s || 16 | 213 M/s | 00:00:04s || 32 | 141 M/s | 00:00:07s || 64| 116 M/s | 00:00:08s || 128 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 256 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 512 | 100 M/s | 00:00:10s | | 1024 | 66 M/s | 00:00:15s |EXACT same O(n) but HUGE differences in the Real World^TM.HOW we access this array matters! This is why ... * AoS (Array of Structs) and * SoA (Struct or Arrays) ... can have such a HUGE difference even though we are iterating over the _same_ data. **All those cache misses add up to slower performance.** This demonstrating O() IS incomplete for modern algorithms.In modern performance programming, often times we want a _branchless algorithm_ as we are _trading latency for throughput._ We want to keep the CPU pipeline saturated with work and not cause pipeline bubbles or flushes via branching.There are 3 categories of optimizations from slowest to fastest:1. **Micro-optimization** or [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html). On older compilers and slower CPUs you would replace `MOD` with `AND` for powers of two, division with multiplication and bit shifts. i.e. Calculating `7*n` as `n + 2*n + 4*n` -- assuming your CPU even has a `MUL` instruction!2. **Algorithm.** Using a faster algorithm used to be the second step in optimization . We would use `O()` as a guideline for performance/scalability.3. **Macro-optimization** or Cache-Oriented aka Data-Oriented Design (DOD). As we deal with larger data sets optimizing for _minimizing cache misses_ becomes more important.See [CppCon 2019: Matt Godbolt “Path Tracing Three Ways: A Study of C++ Style”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6c4Kwbv4I) where OOP, FP, and DOD is compared.",mysticreddit,2025-04-23 15:48:41,4,learnprogramming,t3_1k5y2ma,False,

As others have pointed out, Intel has not innovated in a while.Back in the 1990s, the thoughts that Motorola would stop producing processors and innovating was absurd. The 68k CPUs drove entire generations of home consoles, not to mention oodles of commercial applications.The fact is, they couldn't keep up with Intel. That's what buried them. Now, if anything, they build ARM designs, no need to innovate. But that's also why you don't find them so prevalent in modern markets. They still do stuff, but the Motorola of the 1990s has been subdivided and chopped up more times than a tin of tomatoes. It never really recovered it's prominence in the processor world, it just makes low key devices, that's why you only sometimes see the Motorola logo gracing various products. They license a lot of it's IP. The question is, what's burying Intel? In the home markets, maybe AMD? Samsung certainly has a major edge against either company's offerings with most of Samsung's fabric being manufactured and designed with far cheaper labour than what the Americans can do. I don't doubt that in 15 years, when we want to build a new home PC, we'll be looking at NVidia and Samsung processors instead of Intel.

mouus6m,"Just a similar anecdote, in late 2023 / early 2024 my previous employer implemented some really fancy AI tool that would scrape jira, github, etc to allow management to analyze how much time was being spent on various features, vs prod support, vs etc.It was emphasized very strongly, and very frequently, by management that this tool would absolutely not be used for performance tracking of an individual, and was only going to be used at the team/department level for aggregate stats. Even though the tool absolutely was tracking stats at the individual-level, they just said they weren't gonna use it.Everyone knew they were gonna use it. We're not stupid.That company used to have an amazing WLB, and then there were a couple C-suite changes and a bunch of upper management changes and not long after those changes this tool was introduced, and the culture went to shit.I found another job by mid-2024.It's nothing inherently wrong with my previous company, or with Microsoft.

Then when they change, you jump ship, and your salary gets re-adjusted to market rate.I found another company with a great culture/WLB in 2024, and it's still great now.

When the market is overall doing well and people agree spending money, that Cascades down to every segment of the economy - if you spend more money at restaurants, waiters make more money, so they spend up on Hulu without ads, so SWEs at Hulu get paid more, so they buy a bigger house, and their realtor makes more money, etc.I feel like that's the logical side of the answer.Then there's seemingly just.... vibes.For like 5-10 years, every tech company got into this arms race of spending as much as possible on DS, ML, etc. Like, you couldn't be a tech company and not have an answer when the board of directors asked ""what are we doing in ML?"".I was working at a dino Fortune 500 company - not tech. And I had to put together an entire deck for my boss to tell the board what our ML strategy was. The point is, you couldn't get left behind. Even though the ROI was trash, you had to throw money at it. Most companies had no idea what they were gonna get out of it.And I feel like at some point, that broke. I think Twitter under Elon opened the floodgates - he went the opposite way (let's get rid of bloat) and to a degree it allowed every company to reset. And sure enough, every company immediately took that as an opportunity to pivot into cost savings mode - even though most of these companies are still doing great financially.So when will the job market improve?One answer is when the overall economy starts doing better. Another answer is whenever some sunset of tech companies decide they want to play offense and start spending again to try to separate themselves from the rest",dfphd,2025-04-23 01:09:08,28,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5k197,False,

Humans are centered around physical human connection, and from personal experience, complete WFH ends up making work completely transactional and robs us of the one solid good that comes from work - building connections and that feeling of comradery.Equally, as a junior looking to build skills in a new career, working from home as a developer has significantly increased my learning journey. Every time I go into the office I've felt like I've 10x my learning progress from seeing people in person, having them overhear my conversations and peer at my code, offer suggestions etc. And that's considering most of the experienced devs don't ever come in... if we ALL were going in at the same time it would be even more productive.There are even more reasons - I personally am more productive in a structured environment with a routine going into the office; I like the exposure of meeting more senior people who I wouldn't ordinarily get a chance to bump into; I like separating my home life from my work life.Yeah there are costs... commuting costs and time, less time at home for chores and receiving deliveries, the lack of convenience of it all and having to use equipment worse than my home set-up...but I just see those far and away less important than the gains from being in the office.I mean if you don't care about your job, or you don't care about any of the above, and find home working works fine for you, then okay, but it doesn't for everyone. And I kind of want to be able to go into the office and know that other people, experienced people, interesting people (even the assholes) are going to be there for me to be able to develop and build connections with - because this mixed system of 'go in if you want' isn't working, and it's mostly junior people who have their careers ahead of them who are mostly losing out.",CookieMagnet0,2025-04-26 15:21:43,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1k754az,False,

mojbqka,"Outsourcing to India sucks from the US for a reason that's entirely unrelated to racism: Time zones.Collaboration sucks. Needing to ask questions during the work day is impossible. The number of times I've seen a team work for eight hours on the wrong task, or a solution that's completely unviable, is nearly equal to the number of days I've worked with Indian engineers.And there's another reason that outsourcing to India sucks: The best developers in India don't want to work under those conditions, and they don't work for $20/hour or whatever you're paying your outsourcing team members. I'm told that many of the junior developers who get hired by outsourcing companies are making $10/day, and it's blatantly obvious that they do just enough work to keep the contact live for as long as possible. None of this is even remotely racism. Put a billion people in an area that has insufficient employment opportunities and you'll find millions who are willing to learn just enough software development to be able to do a crap job in outsourcing as part of a scam to extract money from richer countries. It's human nature. It has nothing to do with their culture or the color of their skin or their accent (though extra strong accents can impede communication, and that's a real problem).Not only that, but scammers running consulting companies run them in the US as well. Several of such companies are well known as defense contractors. Remember the debacle of the Obamacare web site that had something like 50 different consulting companies working on various parts? I'd have a hard time assigning that work to fifty people much less fifty teams. And the result was a disaster.That said, at the low end of developer skill? It may very well be permanent. For the last 30 years it's been bad for lower skill developers more often than it's been good. Higher skill developers are still doing OK even now, at least if we're willing to accept lower salaries. So the question to ask yourself is what your relative skill level is. If you have always been in the bottom of your class or the slowest employee wherever you have worked, it might be best to try for a pivot.(Edits: Fixed auto complete fails)",TimMensch,2025-04-23 01:38:40,190,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5mwwc,False,

They are incentivized to focus on passing the interview rather than long-term transferable skills. I'm sure some of them are good enough for the position, but that isn't always the case.With AI and vibe coding, it's never been easier for mediocre developers to pose as a higher skilled one, especially when you only work remotely. Once the companies start to smell the shit pilings of AI generated code as it starts to cost them in maintenance, we might see a recovery.

The 2008 crash we probably didnt fully recover until like 2012 or so. The argument i always make (and i have little actual numbers or data) is that covid made everything ridiculously high. Government was giving out money like candy to any independent worker or business. People were getting money that they didnt deserve to get (some did need it). I didnt deserve a stimulus check tbh, and i got one. In 2020 everybody stayed put to their jobs because they didnt know how the future would look like so it was best to stay put. Then things open up in 2021, companies all have the money to use for hiring so companies of all shapes and sizes ar hiring. Jobs become remote and it looks like remote is the future. But what i think happened was that companies didnt realize how hard it was to hire remote workers and have them quickly learn their codebases. Jr engineers didnt have any camaraderie with their older engineers. Then the free money is gone, people arent spending as much as they did in the high time of covid, and many projects get acwd because small companies can no longer keep up after the government help ended. Bigger companies realize that they can either get a similar engineer for less money or that they overhired in 2021-22 and can fire PIPd employees quicker without having to give severance. Companies have still paused hiring for some time and because of that many people have stayed without a job. I also think potential candidates are too in love with the idea of remote work that anything less than that they are avoiding. But i applied to many jobs and sooke with many recruiters.

It could be that you just didn't hire strong candidates, or it could be that something in the company or team dynamics isn't helping people flourish. It sounds like you are pushing to upskill others, rather than others being the driver of their own growth. This means management needs to get to work. It's their responsibility to create a healthy team dynamic, where everyone is pushing to be better every day, actively trying to upskill themselves. But fixing this situation isn't your job - it's the job of management. So my question for you: what is management doing about this? Do they see the same issues? Do they have a plan? Do you have confidence in their plan?

mp7f0ep,"I've worked at a smaller defense contractor (in comparison to Lockheed Martin, for example) and then moved to big tech. I'd say there are two primary advantages of working in defense. One is that you have better WLB as you can't really work at home with a laptop since most of your work has to be done on a clearance computer, so after your 8 hours you just check out which you can't really do at big tech because your laptop is basically expected to be always with you. The second is your job can't be outsourced and you won't be H1B'd either.The disadvantage is that your pay reflects that. Another disadvantage, although this is team based, is that the work we were doing also reflected that - we were using JavaFX in 2022. Like what. IMO, if you have on call or if your WLB is ever compromised in defense, flat out no, definitely not worth it. If you don't, it depends on what you prioritize - do you prefer better job security, but lower pay, or do you prefer less job security, higher pay? I will say that defense as a stepping stone is very good. Getting a clearance is super helpful because it's possible to leverage that into a high tech job which requires a clearance, so you have the higher pay and higher job security.",So_,2025-04-26 20:42:00,21,cscareerquestions,t3_1k8k1zh,False,

You have to actually choose to put in more work than you necessarily have to at some point.However you reach limits of what you can do without it because at a certain point your job is no longer about doing well defined widget-adjusting tasks, and furthermore this comes more suddenly than you'd think.Most of the times I've seen people flame out in this industry is because they precisely fell into this trap.

The ""So you just wrote some Java?"" comment seems like classic insecurity from the interviewer.Don't remove it from your resume though - that would create weird gaps and honestly most places still see it as valuable. Maybe try addressing these concerns proactively in your cover letters or early interviews by emphasizing why you're specifically interested in their company size/culture.

The expectation is that if you’re from FAANG you’ll blow the interviewers out of the water. Reality is actually different, I have seen hiring managers tank candidates who otherwise passed because they did too much “architecture” and too little coding (in spite of passing the technical rounds”). We tend to have hired Amazon folks mostly from FAANG. I suspect because Amazon has a true high performance culture where it’s sink or swim, so those engineers have real grit and are not afraid to grind or get dirty, but they are looking for new opportunities in a less crowded space (why are 20+ SWEs all working on the same problem, etc.).",jacquesroland,2025-04-26 13:15:39,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1k7yw44,False,

It's analogous to civil vs electrical, they have some surface level commonalities early on but you have to fully commit to one in order to achieve a minimally employable skillset (and then commit to some amount of effort again if you're going to switch).Within SWE, there's a lot of variance, from the super-competitive big techs of the world to startups that are hungry for scrappy go-getters to ""boring"" F500 industries to the consulting world. Some don't even do DSA questions. Some don't even have recruiters.

moq0kln,"are you checking r/ExperiencedDevs ? I have 2 Bay Area centered 10 YOE friends who got jobs both through LinkedIn reach out from recruiters. They spent months and didn't have as much luck in beginning of 2024 in doing the cold applications. They've had more luck during the end of 2024, though one moved to NYC. Both based in the Bay. One hired an ex-FAANG recruiter who was a resume writer but basically they both filled in their linkedins and got premium and connected with as many recruiters as they could to start the process, sent some cold messages. Basically SEO gaming to show up higher on a recruiters radius. I think they were averaging between LinkedIn big company applications and startups on Wellfound about 1/50 call backs per application. This included top companies not just FAANG and local + hybrid positions not just remote. Focused on the Bay Area geographically but NYC as well for one of them. One is a former .Net dev the whole time and the other was an embedded systems/C++ developer for half their career, then Data Science focused developer the other half. They both did around 6 months of cold applications, one did maybe 100 since they wanted to make their own cover letters and the other did about 300. Both non FAANG but F500 company SWEs. One BS in CS and one BS in ME, no MS nothing else extra. Some side hobby projects on their Github but apparently no one has looked at those. The both got full time positions again in F500 companies, one as a senior SWE and one as a staff level SWE. So I'm not saying that you don't get call backs from cold applications and you're doing the right thing with applying as soon as possible, but I think your geographic region matters a lot too. A lot of it is just luck. The numbers are insane. We're into a new presidency and past Q1 2025 so things might be looking different in terms of effective advice compared to even 2023 - 2024 which were both brutal for the SWE market. While you do cold applications, polish your LinkedIn profile, increase you SEO with recruiters. You don't need to pay anyone for that, I think the various job search subreddits have a lot of LinkedIn tips all for free. You just need to pay for LinkedIn Premium. I'm averaging 1/100 ratio of applications to call backs as a data engineering applicant with 2 YOE of direct DE experience, though on prem and I'm working with a huge gap of almost 18 months. I only use cover letters on applications to startups on Wellfound or YComb jobs. Otherwise I've just been submitting without a coverletter following the advice posted on r/EngineeringResumes for working on my resume using their wiki and template. I've applied to around 400 jobs, almost all of them directly through the HR portals of the company but a few through easy apply because I saw someone on reddit say it worked for them, totally by chance. I've applied for mostly on site or hybrid positions in most of the major geographic regions of the US. I've had recruiters reach out on linkedin, after I changed my LinkedIn seeing their success. 2 actually, for contract work but better than nothing and if my shitty profile can get it then there's hope for others with even some experience. Also not to shill for a service but to really maximize the cold applications I used hiring cafe because the Job Title + multiple Geo region search was a bigger time saver compared to LinkedIn and just opening all the jobs in new tabs and working through each one, one by one.

mofh4pm,Ask them things if they don't answer or don't give enough info say your tasks depend on this knowledge and to give you more time. If they gatekeep further then tell your manager you have blockers and see what they say.,deejeycris,2025-04-22 13:43:23,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1k56kc1,False,
mofrp9v,"We need more context to give any useful advice tbh. What are the tasks that you need external input on? How are your teammates gatekeeping their information?For example, if your teammates have some sort of specialized domain knowledge that your project hinges on, and you can’t get responses from them, then you have a legitimate grievance. But it’s also possible that this isn’t specialized knowledge at all, and is information that you could find yourself if you really tried. Maybe your team doesn’t want to condition people to expect hand-holding for this stuff. I’ve seen both scenarios personally. The approach you need to take to fix it is different depending on which category your situation falls into, so some self awareness is important here.",maikindofthai,2025-04-22 14:39:00,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1k56kc1,False,
mog11gj,"This will become the norm IMO, since people will try to become more ""essential"" and ""indispensable"" in an attempt to gain some job security (understandable, we all got bills to pay).Everyone will have their little piece of domain knowledge that they'll protect with their own lives, and make it as inaccesible to others as possible.People will try to obfuscate their work and hide any competitive or productivity advantage they have so it doesn't become standardized.These are difficult times.

mojr7sw,Most gatekeeper are there to make sure they are irreplaceable. If you are not naturally analytical and socially/emotionally intelligence things will get hard since this industry can be full shy guy with low social skills or just full of con artist who manage to survive 5 years at that company.,MaverickRavenheart,2025-04-23 03:12:15,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1k56kc1,False,
mp3aenw,Gonna be real try to find what resources they used. If not I would find a new job asap. They aren't going to help you so what you can do is just flag them in the exit interview or let them sniff there own bullshit.These fuckers are a dime a dozen. Let's scared little nerds sit in there own crappy corner in fear for the rest of their lives.I would start leetcoding then leave and block any attempt of them if they every lose there job. After a month you would stop caring about them completely.Always job hop until you find a place you can grow a few years at.It's more important to find a place to grow them to force them to change.

mob9k62,"Disclaimer: I currently work for AWS, but as an SDE not CSE.If you're happy with the terms and compensation, I don't see why not to take it if you don't have any alternatives. Assuming you're a CS graduate aiming for SDE roles, an SDE position would be ideal, but CSE is preferable to multiple years of being unemployed if you're not finding anything else. Worst case scenario you quit if you find a better opportunity.",w0330,2025-04-21 20:07:19,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1k4mjn5,False,

mobem1a,Its certainly better than nothing. There might also be good internal resources to get going from a CSE -> SDE. Just don't bet too much on being there for 4 years. It is not a place you want to feel trapped in if things are bad.,somehwatrandomyo,2025-04-21 20:32:17,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1k4mjn5,False,
