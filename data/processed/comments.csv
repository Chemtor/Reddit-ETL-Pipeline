You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.Also, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL. The common sql flavours are Hive, Spark, Trino and PostGres. Heck even kafka uses its own brand of SQL. Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform. Learning Java is useful if you need to go deeper into those tools, as those big data tools by Apache run on Java, and the latest and greatest features are released on Java first. Learning git and docker (containerisation) is also useful for an infrastructure as code approach.If you are intending to just be a user of Big Data platforms, just skip ahead to mastering SQL and PySpark.You can also consider learning cloud infrastructure too (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) as they have their own flavours of big data infrastructure which is another rabbit hole to venture into. They have their own courses and certification programmes.For a more holistic education, reading books on data warehousing, data lakes and delta lakes would cap it off nicely.

Sure you can argue that the ""medallion architecture"" is just marketing crap rebranding an idea that's been in use for decades, but pre-aggregated data serves a vital purpose when you're serving data to analysts. Just off the top of my head:- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development.

You are given much more autonomy than working in house because your client assumes you know what you're doing based on your price tag and the fact your sales team probably sold you to them as an ""expert"". You also gain broader experience and it's a place where being a jack of all trades and self learner is greatly appreciated, which is kinda rare in UK companies.",mo_tag,2025-08-30 06:05:04,6,dataengineering,t3_1n3qhqo,False,

It is called “pocket mining” and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little corner. ...>Pocket hunting is an ingenious process. You take a spadeful of earth from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment. Whatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being the heaviest, it has sought the bottom. Among the sediment you will find half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads. You are delighted. You move off to one side and wash another pan. If you find gold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan. If you find *no* gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you are on the right scent.>You lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the hill—for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich deposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they wandered. And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point—a single foot from that point you cannot find any gold. Your breath comes short and quick, you are feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down, they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interest—and all at once you strike it! Up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold. Sometimes that one spadeful is all—$500. Sometimes the nest contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out. The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men exhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a party who never got $300 out of it afterward.Mark Twain, ""Roughing It""About sums it up.

Given the amount of overhead of running something yourself, I would definitely not rule out Snowflake. It really is a breeze, you data size sounds like you are always in a small warehouse. One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.What I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables.

BigQuery gives 10GB of storage and 1TiB of query data processed per month for free. Not just that, in BigQuery you can partition your data on various field and time, which optimizes your query processing to use less resources and manage costs. Big Query's Active storage costs $0.02 per GB which you will be charged around $20 each TB after 1 TB coz first 1TB each month is free. In snowflake it's around $40 and no free storage.And as long as Postgres is concerned, you can use a hybrid in which you can use it for smaller transactional data which you might not want to store for longer period, like logs, sessions, and sometimes historical data, you can use it for quick processing for your SaaS and use Data Warehouse for analytical use cases because as your data will grow Postgres will start to slow down in processing, but data warehouse will be great for processing big data, using this approach will significantly optimize your cost and boost your use case.",Total_Weakness5485,2025-08-29 06:00:04,9,dataengineering,t3_1n2ycuz,False,
nbbge6r,"This is the wrong way to think about this.Snowflake is a consumption based pricing model. It's not really about the size of your data at all. It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.They give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.It scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.BUTthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \*and\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.It's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.So the math is simple:DIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (""Free!\*\*\*"") + a lot of opex (""pay people to manage it"") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)PaaS/SaaS is higher capex (""Snowflake is expensive!"") + very little opex (""this thing runs itself"") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.So in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.When my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: ""When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.""PS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price.

Your use case (drilling down by UPC, store, category, department) is pretty much textbook OLAP stuff that CH excels at.A few things to consider though:1. You'll still need to think about your data modeling. ClickHouse works best when you denormalize things into wide tables, which might mean rethinking how you structure your retail data2. The PowerBI integration exists but it's not as smooth as native connectors. You might want to test the performance of PowerBI queries hitting ClickHouse before committing3. Consider whether you actually need PowerBI at all for this. Are you embedding a PowerBI dashboard into a user-facing app? If so, any reason not to ditch it and just build some data APIs and a custom dashboard UI?Druid is also solid for this but ClickHouse has better SQL support and is generally easier to work with imo.I'd definitely recommend spinning up a ClickHouse instance and loading a subset of your data to test query performance before making any big decisions.

The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values. * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows. * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred. For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year?

But realistically, many of the high-paying Senior Data Engineering roles today require strong DSA/CS fundamentals. Since I’ve been out of college for a long time and never had much exposure to those concepts, catching up feels like a hard climb.I’ve been trying to master Spark and other DE concepts, and while I’ve made progress, it hasn’t translated into higher-paying opportunities yet.On the client-facing side, I do enjoy talking to people and building relationships — in fact, that’s one of my biggest strengths and part of the reason my career in IT has been semi-successful so far. This makes me wonder if a pivot into Inside Sales or Pre-Sales might be a better fit, since it combines technical skills with people skills.Financially, I’m not very stable right now — more or less living hand-to-mouth while supporting my family. This makes it harder to take big risks, though I am eager to find a path that brings both stability and growth.So I’m torn: should I double down on becoming more technical (even if it’s a longer climb), or pivot into a solutions/Pre-Sales role that might leverage my natural strengths and offer quicker growth?",Plane_Philosopher593,2025-09-01 15:16:14,2,dataengineering,t1_nbuao2a,True,

nbsbhcv,"- Understanding their point of view and their background. At my company we have the chance to shadow people in other teams or other groups/departments, like a mini internship. We're encouraged to use these to understand different aspects of the company. When you understand what they do, how they're talking with their counterparts you get a better feel for what they need communicated. Alternatively, having a mentor-type person who can give you direct feedback.- Talking with people directly, asking: ""hey, I just gave you this explanation but I want to improve and want to know which information is useful to you and which one isn't. Knowing what you know now - what would the ideal explanation be for you?""- asking directly how technical the explanation should be, and adjusting on the fly.- slightly different background (R&D) but I learned that explaining the thing that happened in the order that it happened makes for terrible story telling. You need to figure out what the value is for someone, and then cut all the explanations that are not useful in, well, explaining it. That's a tough one for me because it also meant having to let go of my ego - as in: having to drop some information and explanations that I really found good / useful when they don't help in making the messageseven clearer.Maybe ""Storytelling with data"" is helpful for some situations?- I'm not saying that's the case for you but for me one big learning was that I'm probably not the most important person, and that what makes my job interesting to me is not relevant at all. It also doesn't matter whether my solution is picked - not whether it's implemented in the way that I envisioned it. What matters is that the team as a whole benefits from an idea - I had to shift to a broader view of things rather than just of me and my work. This takes self-reflection and it also takes experience. - Also, what I do is a service to others. Have a look at leaders who have a service-mentality to their leadership style and try to emulate them.Generally, what helped was direct feedback and interacting with colleagues. What worked less is trying to figure things out by reading and thinking it through - that useful sometimes but it doesn't cut through my echo chamber. What's still missing for me, some people need an explanation that's not an explanation but a story that they can digest on their level of understanding - I sometimes struggle if I have to simplify it so much that the story stops being meaningful to me.",norfkens2,2025-09-01 04:55:18,3,dataengineering,t3_1n4n346,False,

And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).If you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good.

Interview hiring managers, explain your intention in your career path for the future, ask what technologies they're hiring for.Identify 2 or 3 real, long-term careers that way (one technology = not a career), learn only that specific thing/career (nothing else matters), maybe get certified for it (optional), and interview for junior/medior positions while being honest about your career path and skills.Learn only what matters for that specific position. Nothing else matters, and can be seen as a negative/distraction. You could learn >99% of technologies in the world and still not get a job if you didn't learn the 1 technology the company needed.Find yourself a company that can use your background beneficially (instead of seeing it as a negative), and that's willing to give you support to fill in the gaps while you're learning.I would say ""that's it"", but to be honest whether or not you find a company like that depends 100% on the individual hiring managers you will meet/interview, and you do need to get lucky.But the good news is that no impostor syndrome is ever needed on this path.",Skullclownlol,2025-08-26 14:42:43,0,dataengineering,t1_naqsatn,False,

Like yeah, data is messy and unpredictable in ways that traditional software isn't, but that's exactly why you need better tooling and processes around it. The messiness doesn't go away just because you're cowboy coding your way through it.The schema as code thing is huge. We believe very strongly in general ""data as code"" principles at Tinybird (all resources defined as code and managed with version control). Seen a lot of people get burned because their production schema drifted from what they thought it was, or they made an upstream change that broke downstream consumers without realizing it. Having that versioned and trackable is just basic hygiene at this point.The local dev environment piece is important too. One thing that I love about webdev, specifically Next.js, is just spinning up that local next server and getting instant feedback on front end changes. We've focused on that a lot at Tinybird, making it easier for people to not only spin up ClickHouse locally, but actually test the whole pipeline end-to-end including ingestion and API layer. It's a huge shift in the right direction imo.I guess the key is not just blindly copying SE practices but adapting them for data's unique challenges.

Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).Then it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer.

nb2pqez,"TL;DR: gather requirements and build something that works for YOUR use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that wasn’t built to meet the functionality you need from your system.I personally like the medallion architecture in principle, but this is the classic issue with it: shoehorning your specific use case into a framework that doesn’t work for you. The medallion works well for what it’s meant to because it encompasses separation of concerns, e.g. land raw, untouched data in ‘raw’, cast, parse, and make data workable in ‘stg’, then join and aggregate data into usable datasets in ‘gold’/‘marts’. This makes trouble shooting easier and pipeline creation systematic. You architecture says to hell with that but let’s call it “medallion”. It’s not, when you modify data in “raw” it’s no longer actually… raw… the medallion architecture also wasn’t built with data catalogs (thinking catalogs in the observability sense, I.e a data dictionary, you may have a different meaning. Too many new buzzwords) or semantic layer in mind. It was built as a framework for what are now data/analytics engineers to systematically build pipelines. With that being said, forget the idea of using medallion architecture for your use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that isn’t meant support your functional requirements. I don’t like the idea of joining tables or building incremental models in “bronze”, but if it makes sense for your use case then great. Is it because you need that data for backfills/full refreshes of your catalog layer? Maybe use s3 to store that in partitioned files instead. Have a team super familiar with sql/dbt but not familiar with how to integrate with s3 and would be a hassle to train? Then that solution is out of the picture. One last thing: report specific layers are dumb imo. Don’t do that. That’s how you get one report that says revenue was X and another that says revenue was Y because analyst B was working with VP C who doesn’t believe GAAP needs to be followed precisely and wanted his dashboard to make him feel good. Or you’ll just get duplicate queries/tables. We have an “analytics”/metrics/semantic layer organized by what fact table it stems from. That’s what works for us, it may not work for you, but we designed it to work for our use case and tech stack",Routine-Ad-1812,2025-08-28 04:08:12,3,dataengineering,t1_nb2bwrc,False,
nb31frb,"I'm not sure where the confusion is. We are exactly making sure not to shoehorn our requirements to fit into a framework that isn't built to meet the functionality needed for our system.That's the entire point of the post and my comments here. Whenever there is a use case that comes in front of us that doesn't fit into the way we've structured our DBT project, we figure out how to fit it in, we don't change the requirements to fit how we're doing things.Maybe someone can actually expand on the downvotes to my comment instead of pointing out other things instead? I could be completely wrong with what I said, but I can't learn anything if we're not actually responding to anything specific in my downvoted reply. Only thing I can think of is that maybe DBT's recommendations have evolved since they've added semantic layers, since you would generally want to build semantic layers on top of your silver layer, so it should definitely fit somewhere into the DBT project.As far as how the medallion architecture works, I've seen what I've said recommended here and elsewhere before. It's like you said, just do what fits your use case. When you say raw, you mean something more raw than I might. When people at my company say raw, they mean something that you can use to rebuild anything that's raw. That might be renaming fields back to their original names, reconstructing an original field, or casting numeric columns back to varchars.That being said, I agree with you that once you starting doing more complex stuff like incrementals, joins, etc., it stops being a view into the original raw data and starts to become something more.However, if you asked me if these models more closely represented raw data in a bronze layer or business entities in a silver layer, I would tell you that these models more closely represented raw data. This is because the entire intention of these models are to surface a more curated view into the raw layer. They answer questions like ""I see that X from this data source is being mapped to Y in this other data source, why are these data sources related this way?"" Then you can go into the models for each data source and see how they've been transformed so that those models can be related together.For example, maybe there's some fuzzy search logic that builds an incremental mapping for related columns shared by the 2 data sources which then gets joined into each model. Does this change the raw data in any way other than adding new fields to these datasets? No, but is this logic that we think is simple enough that we would justify doing it on top of our source data? No. And does the result represent a business entity? Still no, because the business entity would probably be these 2 datasets joined or unioned together.Having said that, if your problem with my original post and not my comment is that I classified that layer as ""bronze"" and don't want me to call it that, that's fine. That's not my intention and frankly I don't care what it's called, I just chose to call it (in parentheses) something I thought others would understand. Maybe I didn't explain it very clearly in my original post, feel free to let me know.For your last note, thanks for the suggestion. I agree, we try to shy away from report-specific stuff as much as we can unless we have a really specific use case that really doesn't fit with what everyone else is doing (some nasty period-over-period metrics for example). I like your idea of an ""analytics"" layer instead, makes perfect sense.",simplybeautifulart,2025-08-28 05:43:18,1,dataengineering,t1_nb2pqez,True,

You’ll probably want to also tie datasets back to specific reports depending on the analysts capabilities in your organization. You should also structure this better with a historical table and what not - just explaining an example approach and not a perfect ERD. If analysts are viewing reports (and not building) then it might make sense to have a warning label on each report that appears when the dataset is considered stale.

It's worth a full read, but I wanted to paraphrase the section about [the VS Code extension and Language Server](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components#the-dbt-vs-code-extension-and-language-server).There's actually 3 components worth calling out:1. The Fusion CLI binary (basically the equivalent of dbt Core but in Rust)2. The Fusion Language Server binary (a.k.a LSP)3. The VS Code extensionA language server share a great deal of code with the Fusion CLI but it's intended user is not a human in a terminal, but rather an IDE who can talk to it on behalf of the user. When you download or update the VS Code extension you might notice that in the bottom status bar it will say: ""Downloading file"" that's the extension grabbing the latest version of the Language Server from our CDN.In it there's a pretty diagram (made by yours truly) that shows that the VS Code extension has two buckets of features broken out by the binary that powers them1. **by the CLI**: running commands, previewing models2. **by the LSP**: intellisense, lineage, go to reference In a comment >So can I access the enhanced features in fusion without using the extension in another IDE?Theoretically, the Fusion LSP could be made to work with and distributed such that it could work with other IDEs like you say.

The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. The other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues.

This is actually a recommended approach when you need to split data from a single collection into multiple destination tables.Here's how it works:1. First, you need to define logical partitions in your collection by specifying one or more fields as partition keys:```collections:  acmeCo/user-sessions:    schema: session.schema.yaml    key: [/user/id, /timestamp]    projections:      country:        location: /country        partition: true      device:        location: /agent/type        partition: true      network:        location: /agent/network        partition: true```2. Then, in your materialization, you can use partition selectors to direct specific partitions to different tables:```materializations:  acmeCo/example/database-views:    endpoint: ...    bindings:      - source:          name: acmeCo/anvil/orders          partitions:            include:              customer: [Coyote]        resource: { table: coyote_orders }```",dani_estuary,2025-09-01 01:29:16,1,dataengineering,t1_nbqptfq,False,

nbawgez,"Both can be hard if you are unfamiliar with them. Frontends can contain incredibly complex logic, as can backends. In my experience, finding client or server side code hard depends mostly on your familiarity with both the technologies being used, and the codebase.

The complexity of backends can relate largerly to the distribution of services and their interaction with one another. This requires the ability to store a large, and complex mental model, which can be difficult. Frontends can contain complex physics based animations, or complex state interactions, which also involve having a clear mental model.

nbc09e9,"It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:When someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their ""first"" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the ""21st"" century even though the year begins with ""20"" and not ""21"". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').In many buildings throughout the world, the ""1"" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's ""nice"" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is ""0"" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.(Side note: This ""number of floors offset from the ground"" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).Here is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a ""0"" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a ""1"" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.It might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the ""group index"" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.The above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.I'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",Phoenixon777,2025-08-29 15:34:51,32,learnprogramming,t3_1n36naw,False,

I think it just made sense to the people making compilers for various programming languages to start with the first available byte value, which is all zeros, which comes out to a decimal zero. I also suspect this is related to the limitations of early systems. Way back, programmers were trying to make use of every bit they could because so little memory was available. This is the reason for two year dates and the Y2K problem. Back at the time, programmers thought ""Hey, that's two whole bytes I could use somewhere else that could actually be useful.""

What actually keeps you moving is discipline and consistency. Make a schedule, stick to it, and just keep showing up.Here’s the thing: once you stop, it’s surprisingly hard to come back — even if you used to love coding or learning before. That’s why it’s so important to stay connected, even on low-energy days. Watch a CS video, read an article, or just mess with some code. The longer you’re away, the bigger the gap gets, and the harder it is to return, so you need to do something no matter however small that might be. For God sake even just opening vs code & browsing through the code for couple of min also counts.Also, a little arrogance is actually useful. Not just belief in yourself, but that competitive arrogance of “I want to be better than others.” When everything else feels low, that pride can keep you grinding. And don’t underestimate daydreaming. Imagine what you’ll be once you finish this project or learn that new concept. Sure, it’s mental masturbation, but it feeds your feedback loop and keeps the fire alive.All these factors — discipline, arrogance, dreaming, consistency — they don’t always burn equally strong.

I went the opposite route and learned the programming first and then had to go back and learn all the theory (don’t recommend this route).

C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C. Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more ""lower level"" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn. Not essential, I believe, but useful. I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.As far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy.

You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of. The trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up ""JS how to add 3 + 5"", look up ""JS how to add two numbers."" Then apply it to your situation.

Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. 2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and ""first steps"", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. 3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow.

You have class time, homework, and that's pretty much it. If you have questions, you ask in class.Universities are different. Professors and TAs offer office hours, and you really, really should take advantage of them. Do the homework, go discuss it in office hours to just see what they say. Most of the time, the person having office hours will be completely alone and you won't be interrupting anyone else's time, because *no one seems to do this*. I took a graduate level Computability and Complexity class in my senior year. Another student and I learned the professor liked latte's.

Something systems level like C/C++/Rust, something very high level like Python, and something like Java/Go/C#/some other garbage collected but very productive language. One of the best things I did was to become a grader. It was sort of like a TA position, but we just graded projects and held office hours, we didn't teach classes. If something like that is available, I'd highly encourage doing it. It's one thing to learn how to debug your own code. Learning how to work through 30 other people's code? That's an irreplaceable experience. I mean I was paid to learn how to read and evaluate other people's code, and that is such an important skill. It's something they don't really tell you will be important, but when you're working in an existing codebase and with other people who are also contributing to it, you'll need to not only be able to write your own new code, but also to read other code that someone else wrote (and also your own 2 to 5 to 10 years later when you're a completely different person).",Paxtian,2025-08-27 01:59:53,4,learnprogramming,t3_1n0s4vi,False,

nbhwjmp,"It can be hard to put these into practice. You end up picking a few things and trying those out first, then slowly add other ideas. Your priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.Also, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.So, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.My advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.You can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.There's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.For example, I encountered something similar to the following: code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30Let's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.It would read better as boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) { return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 || taxCode == 30; }Even if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.The other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.If you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.There are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-30 14:31:26,10,learnprogramming,t3_1n412gy,False,

You can also use it for Unity or Godot game engine.You can pick Java too which is very similar to C#, but I like it slightly less for some reason.Python I usually advise against as a first language, because of its dynamic typing and you might learn some things you may have to unlearn later on. On the plus side, Python is very good to know for prototyping and automation and it's very popular and you should definitely learn it at some point.

nbx12s4,"Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one). The best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project. The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit. Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound. We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else. The key is the input. What a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground). This is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code). The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***. A library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox. It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks. A good example of this in JS is JQuery. They are typically very specific uses and very tiny. You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine. SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer. A game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic. Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware. In general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them. They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic. Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer. You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",kcl97,2025-09-01 22:31:30,2,learnprogramming,t3_1n5x6l2,False,

You might only use a subset of it's functionality, and you might change libraries if one isn't working for you etc. (provided you've achieved loose coupling)Frameworks are more fundamental to your app. You won't change framework, you'll rewrite the app if you do. Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this.

Can think of it as loop and replace each element with the result of f.filter -> perform boolean function on each element in the array only keeping those that match the predicate.reduce -> can be used in lots of different ways but commonly I use it as a map and a filter combined so I don't need to do .map and then .filter on the result but you can also use it to take an array to object or other complex data transformations that can't be done via other array functions.There are a bunch of other methods you can use in a library called lodash which you should learn if you can.Also I would recommend using typescript as it holds your hand and makes sure what you are programming is safe.",Lonely-Foundation622,2025-08-30 18:16:15,1,learnprogramming,t3_1n447bb,False,

nba11xt,"This sounds like an AI prompt, but whatever.First of all, I think there is a hidden contradiction in your question:>In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?>“What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”In the first question you asked what ""someone"" should do. In the second one you ask what a ""beginner"" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.If you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a ""scripting"" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.If you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a ""scripting"" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.If you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.If you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java. You will have no trouble finding work, and you will never truly understand anything about programming or computers.

We were still coming out of the Great Recession and I had no idea what was going to happen. I only managed to land a job because I played World of Warcraft with someone who lived in the same city and he offered to refer me.It was a back office position, mostly trade support and compliance. Not riveting or lucrative stuff. At this point, I probably had two things going for me: I'd been working with computers in some capacity since I was 5, and I had recently done an internship where I was exposed to VBA and general scripting.After about 6 months on the job, I started playing around with VBA to automate parts of my daily tasks away. My manager was very supportive and so were my IT folks. After that, I snowballed because as I wrote scripts to automate my work away, I had more time to experiment. As I experimented, I collaborated with other teams to automate parts of their work.After a year, I got poached by a hedge fund. I learned a few more things, but it was a bad environment for me and I got fired inside of 3 months. Luckily, I had built my VBA skills enough that I got contracted to work on a year-long project at a large financial institution.After that project, I joined a consulting firm where I used my VBA knowledge to make Excel and PowerPoint do some incredibly complex things. After two years, I realized I needed more; I didn't want to stay in this niche and I saw the writing on the wall that this might all go away in the medium term. A friend from college I kept in touch with referred me to his company.That was my first opportunity in a tech company. But I wasn't a software engineer, more of a ""solutions"" engineer. But I applied everything I learned into this new role. Except instead of VBA and Excel, it was Python scripts, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Bash. I also made sure to understand the ins and outs of our entire tech stack.Two more years, I made my way into FAANG and haven't looked back since (I'm no longer in FAANG, but I'm still in tech, making more money than I ever thought I would).A few takeaways would be that networking is important, but it can take on many forms that are conducive to introverts (I'm one myself). How many people can say they got jobs through World of Warcraft? Another thing is, everyone runs their own race. I'd say the first 5 years of my career had little direction, and it wasn't until 7 years in that I thought to consider myself a software engineer at all, but each step I took was a calculated risk to incrementally get me there. I was always adjacent to the tech, to the code, and demonstrated value to the point where the developers started listening to me.If you have an opportunity to now, I would encourage you to take whatever computer science courses you can to set yourself up.

Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. 2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. 3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. ""Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%""). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.4.

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.Look at what you wrote:>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.This is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, ""why don't you just talk to him?"" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.You will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.You should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.So many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.The dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy.

You might be given vague specifications (""do thing that make profit!"") alongside very precise and bullshit instructions as to how you should implement something (""using latest AI models!""). You might have a coworker or boss whose approval you rely upon who is toxic. There are countless examples where your autonomy is stripped and you are put in an impossible position and you are pointedly told to deal and STFU.Burnout isn't limited to just tech, but I think it's more common in tech than most professions to have a few decisions made above you to render pointless the entirety of your work output while the expectations to ""perform"" remain.",pydry,2025-08-28 12:43:54,1108,cscareerquestions,t3_1n2ap76,False,

I was completely in panic mode and had a ton of anxiety around it. I’ll tell you what i did that helped me the most. I immediately got my resume updated and reformatted it. I used the pragmatic engineer’s template. Some here may frown on this, but asking ChatGPT for help writing bullet points was helpful for me. Not your entire resume, but just help summarizing things you want on your resume. Apply for unemployment. It’s there for things like this, use it. Reach out to your network. Nothing panned out for me within my network but reconnecting and chatting with colleagues was massively beneficial to my mental health. If you’re anything like me, it’s easy to think “im not a good developer, I’ll never convince another company to hire me”. Meeting with former colleagues and friends and hearing from them what I was good at and that I’m a good developer helped a ton. Start applying. I used LinkedIn (avoid easy apply. I’m convinced those are ghost jobs and scams) and Indeed. I kept a spreadsheet of places i applied. Mostly for my personal use but it does come in handy when filing your weekly UE certification. In my state, they require 5 weekly job search activities. Having this info handy makes it easier to file. While applying, spend time learning or working on interview prep. Have your story prepared and ready. Recruiter screens will usually be a general history of you and a high level overview of your experience. Be prepared to explain anything that might raise questions in your resume, good and bad. I used ChatGPT for technical prep. It was a massive help. Once you land technical interviews (and you will soon with your experience), use ChatGPT to help you prep. I pasted the job description into chatGPT and asked it to give me technical interview questions based on it. You’ll also want to read Glassdoor reviews for the company you’re interviewing with. I wouldn’t have gotten the job i have now if i hadn’t done that. I learned they place a very high value on your “why join (company)” and going back to the prep, having that answer practiced and ready was massively helpful. I was laid off early May and started my new job, that is better in every way, at the end of June. While it’s true the job market is tough right now, it’s still pretty good for mid+ level devs. I got a decent amount of interest and actually landed a job I never thought I could get. You also might look into contracting with your local/state government. There were a bunch of those in my area that would be perfect as an in between while you find something more permanent. Lastly, just know that your worth as a person isn’t based on your job or title. I learned that I placed way too high of value on my job and being a provider for my family financially. Being able to step back and be that parent who’s there for the family and provides value in other ways helped me be a better dad and husband.

Sure, few interviews let me *literally* Google (some have, I just have to let them know I'm doing it), but every other interview has always made it very clear that I'm welcome and encouraged to ask syntax questions to the interviewer.No interviewer I've worked with has ever been caught up on if I remember `.length` vs `.length()` (which I still get caught up on because of my heavy Java experience and my kinda recent transition to Node/Typescript). Nobody cares if I've memorized any of the syntax of the language I'm programming in. They care that I can program. That's why they're willing to answer syntax questions, which I've asked many times, and gotten offers from.I also don't recall a company that *forced* me to use a specific language. Hell, back in the pre-covid days we all whiteboarded in pseudocode anyways. But since I've been doing remote interviews, companies have always made it clear I was allowed to program in the language I was most comfortable in. Again, nobody's paying attention to syntax memorization, they want to see me solve a problem via logic. Not rattle off something memorized that the worst programmer in the world could memorize.Same for BE vs FE.... My current company is an example. I knocked the BE interview portion out of the park. I killed it. Then I got to the FE portion in React.... and I didn't do too well. I had to ask *a lot* of syntax questions, needed some nudging, some hand holding, and I didn't even finish the whole interview before time ran out.And yet, they gave me an offer. My resume made it very clear I'm mostly a BE developer, I made that very clear in the HR interview, I made that very clear in the HM interview. They knew what to expect, they just asked the FE questions as a formality. It may very well be the case that you're not doing as well as you think you are in the Java interview. That, or you're not making it clear that your strength is BE/Java, and not FE/React.I'm just surprised your experiences interviewing are literally polar opposites of mine.

I think we are in the early stages of a recession, combined with us having high interest rates and over hiring in pandemic has made the job market really tough for entry level talent. I don't think tis going to get better in 1 to 2 years. However, what I do think is that tech and CS is not going way. My personal educated guess is that there will be new types of roles emerging that will be more like product person + roles. Essentially where you would be expected to do project managing plus software development with AI tools. I don't think software engineering that requires extensive OOP experience are going anywhere. I think AI is going to make certain areas of tech explode that people aren't thinking about enough today. The biggest one is I think cyber security, fraud detection etc. The thing is the tools that tech has pushed the last ten years (AI, Crypto, Payment servies like cash apps) are eco systems that have encouraged sophisticated criminal activity and thats only going to grow. That also means the opposite is true jobs meaning to minimize fraud risks, protect data are probably going to grow.People talk about AI automating jobs, but most of the people doing the talking have never even sat in a labor economics or macroeconomics course. AI is the type of technical innovtion that compliments the skills of some workers and replaces the skills of others. USually what these type of technologies replace are repetitive tasks. So the more your job is doing the same repetive task (i.e. generating the same reports/analyitcs over and over again) the more likely that job is replaced by AI. This is why I think the future is being more in the product type roles (which are the ones getting laid off the most). However, these jobs will evolve into something like product + software, instead of just product,I also think the industries in general are going to reward people who think outside fo the box and push creative boundaries. AI is very good at creating simple designs.

Your question, taken at face value, makes no sense. Why would an employer willingly choose a candidate with less demonstrated experience?

""How do I get hiring managers to consider me?"" was a question I asked myself, fruitlessly, for years. But as a hiring manager now, I get it. Why would I have considered me?

In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.By placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.As for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base).

nbbdili,"I’ll try my best but in general the definition is fuzzy. When I interview with a senior engineer I tend to look for:1. Experience. Not in terms of years but in terms of lessons learned. I tend ask what project stays with them and what lessons they learned. How does it inform how they review designs and code. I’m mostly looking for people who have learned from their failures and can debug their code and designs and do the same for others. Do they have a story where they may have changed their mind after new information was gained or is it a constant stream of “my way or the highway.” This also means as a senior they do have a bit of a network and will have stories of how they talk to and manage people.2. Technical communication. As a senior, I expect them to be able to communicate not just for themselves but for the team and to be an advocate for reasonable designs while keeping the schedule in mind. I need them to tell me why things will take x days, not just that things will take x days. I want to know why they came to a specific decision and what other decisions did they consider. For people who have had a ton of experience doing this they will have a good signal to noise ratio.3. Team advocacy. Ultimately trust-worthiness and energizing a team are part of being a leader. Are they going to be a net gain of energy across the team under tight deadlines or are they going to be toxic? It’s hard to determine this within an interview, but as you work with them it gets easier to see. If they are motivated to work as an engineer usually that passion will come out in an interview and is actually hard to fake across multiple interviews. How do they interact with their maybe peers in the team/peer interview?4. It’s really corny but leadership. What I mean by this is that senior engineers shouldn’t argue from a stance of authority. Authority is given to someone because of who they are not because of the title they wield. How do they make their case? Is it with evidence and data or because they fall back on “experience?” This falls into the communication pillar too. If you have the experience you can tell stories and don’t need to say “because I’m senior.”5. Understanding of the scientific method. What I mean by this is I see engineering as the practice of making the same behavior repeatable. This means similar to science everything is a hypothesis to be continuously tested. SLIs, KPIs, etc need to ensure that we continue to be good. A senior engineer advocating for manual testing is fine as long as they have a plan for how we maintain that process and why we need to. Do they question our accepted reality or do they accept it without thought?6. Hard skills are a given and they should be fairly proficient in at least one language. This means they should be able to tell me how the language works and what it’s good for and not good for. They should have tried and tested ways to debug problems in said language and have a reasonably good understanding of how the language runs on a computer. Ie if I get a resume where the guy tells me he is a C++ expert of 10 years I expect him to be able to explain things like how vector or shared_ptr work or how exceptions work and how memory works for C++. They should have stories of how their language of choice is annoying or incomprehensible at times because with enough projects and lines of code all projects become annoying to manage in some way.",Antsolog,2025-08-29 13:46:15,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1n17b5u,False,

I can't speak much for ML, but I work in a team with over 50% of the engineers being MLEs. Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. There are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. Downside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. That being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29.

Get an internship and do a good job.

Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense).

The field is very prone to coming up with stories and drinking their own koolaid. You will read everywhere about AI, but reality is you have several compounding factors that makes the job market suck right now. This includes high interest rates, which effects tech more than other industries as that means there is less startup money and financign out there, over hiring during the pandemic, general economic uncertainty due to tariffs and current immigration system in the u.s.

Sounds like you may have missed out on a position because you didn't know how to do that. Have you gone back and tried to learn, in case it comes up again? You might see certain patterns come up in interviews. What are companies looking for? Portfolios feel like they are from another time, although you might be able to get an interviewer to take a look during your interview. But the problem is they can't be sure if you actually built the thing yourself unless they ask you questions about it. If you're looking for an entry-level position, no one is expecting you to have created a big project on your own. They want to see what you know. But building a project is one way to learn these things. Look at your own reply. You got rejected because you didn't know how to use C# for endpoints (possibly just one factor). You say you know C#. What have you built with it? Is it something relevant and useful for a position, or is it something that would make sense for some other type of job? For your meal planner, what was the backend?

nbv3ioc,"For me, it's like thinking about why automated warehouses are more efficient than warehouses that are retrofitted with automation. The warehouses are made for humans, so there's a lot of ""wasted"" space and energy put into lighting, climate control, space for humans to walk around, safety, human-readable labels, etc. If a robot has to dodge humans, keep them safe, and read plain-text labels, it's going to be less efficient and a lot harder to program than a dense structure that \_only\_ accomodates bots and works by perfectly orchestrating them from some central computer. Coding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it). This is a huge bottleneck for LLMs, because they have to use their computer-language brain to translate your natural langauge into a programminmg language only for it to end up back as a computer language, and that's only for coding itself. IMO, ""beyond human"" programming would cut out the middleman (programming langauges) entirely and work purely on CPU instructions. Data would be densely packed and would not be human-readable, ""code"" would be pure binary, there wouldn't really be a distinction between API, Database, Frontend, etc. Basically it would look a lot like how ML ""brains"" look to us now: we can't really look at the data they're made of and trace exactly how input A leads to output B, because it's all just inscrutable math to us. We just have to give it in the input and tell it if it got the output we expect.

That all goes towards how affordable and scalable a codebase may be. And ""stability"" strictly from a codebase perspective (ignoring infra) is again mostly a human concept. How bug free is it, how easy is it to catch *human mistakes* that create bugs before they get released. And it ties back to extensibility, how easily can features be added without accidentally introducing regressions that slip into prod.Unit, integration, and regression testing are *all* concepts built to catch *human mistakes*. It's so when I make a change, I can click a button and see if my change broke anything, and we can enforce passing tests before PR's get merged to prevent mistakes. Remove the human element, and none of those concepts serve a purpose anymore.""better than human"" programming, is programming without bugs, or need for simplicity/readability, or need for extensibility, or need for maintainability.One example of what that might look like would be a codebase with 0 testing, and that's extremely abstract and difficult to read, to the point it might even be non-sensical to a human reader. I'd know it was either written by a ""better than human"" AI that has no need for the fundamentals of human programming, or by a bad SWE that isn't aware of the fundamentals of human programming.Better than human programming is when AI has reached a point where 99% of the issues/concepts that this industry have literally evolved around simply no longer exist. ""Difficult to extend"" is strictly a human problem. If AI coded itself into a corner, it'd just rewrite everything from scratch.

naz2272,"At smaller startups or mid-level to senior positions, you'll absolutely get asked about system design concepts even as a frontend developer because they want engineers who understand how their frontend decisions impact the broader system. Large tech companies especially love throwing CAP theorem, load balancing, and scaling questions at frontend candidates to see if you think beyond just the UI layer. That said, plenty of companies still focus purely on frontend-specific system design like state management, component architecture, performance optimization, and API integration patterns.Your experience with mostly frontend-focused interviews isn't unusual, but as you level up in your career, expect more full-stack system design questions to creep in. The good news is you don't need to be a backend expert - you just need to demonstrate you understand how frontend applications fit into larger distributed systems and can make informed decisions about caching strategies, data flow, and performance bottlenecks. The key is showing you can think holistically about user experience from both a technical and architectural perspective. I'm on the team that built [AI for interview practice](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen this trend where frontend roles increasingly include broader system design discussions, so having a tool to work on these trickier cross-domain questions can really help you stand out when these curveballs come up.",akornato,2025-08-27 16:30:12,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1n12x0x,False,

What happens a lot is people name drop something somewhere that sounds like it might fit at a glance, but doesn't quite make sense in conjunction w/ everything else they added around it, I ask them a question about it, and they admit not knowing much about it, or worse they wing it, poking more and more holes into the design as they go.For example, we might be talking about performance, and then they add redis somewhere in the diagram, but it's in a suboptimal place, or they didn't think about cache invalidation or whatever, and then they start adding bandaid arrows and it just goes downhill from there.Another thing that a lot of candidates are surprisingly bad at is schema normalization, and that comes up quite a bit because data modeling is a sort of a ""checkbox"" topic.",lhorie,2025-08-27 04:18:42,2,cscareerquestions,t1_navudrk,False,
