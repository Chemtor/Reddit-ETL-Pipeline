I am not myself very confident in this, again. But the argument goes like this:A standard stack in our industry will not be possible without a standard stack in web/backend. Fundamentally, data is a byproduct of a company's main business at first. A company may become ""data mature"" or ""data driven"" by converting this byproduct into a core loop of the business, in fact even its moat, but no one starts a company with ""data driven"". When you're starting a company, you can build software that will become your moat, but you can't ""build data"". In effect, I think by the time a company starts even thinking about data engineers, it is already stuck with some existing and effectively immutable architectural components, and our systems must use tooling that plays nice with those. So until these upstream components become standardized (e.g. the SQL/noSQL war in OLTP land finishes definitively, REST is fully replaced by gRPC, etc) - our systems won't.",szrotowyprogramista,2025-09-17 23:21:26,3,dataengineering,t3_1nj5ntc,False,

nf32dfm,"Edit - I can’t believe I missed this. in the near future we are going to see an enormous change with AI writing code. It’s possible that the offshore resources will be entirely replaced with AI coding. It’s also possible that companies will demand generalized data professionals (kimball, analytical engineering, master data management, etc) and then those generalized people will just instruct AI to build solutions in the technology of the year. If this starts to become the trend, then you’ll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company. This would be a very interesting and disruptive time to be a data professional! (If it happens)——————————-One of the things I’m keeping my eye on is whether companies start switching develops each time management attends a conference and decides to change their stack. To be clear - I’m not seeing it now - but here’s the scenario I’m looking out for. 1) outsource DE to India. 2) hire X dev’s with current stack3) management changes mind on stack4) replace current India team with new India team who know new stack5) repeat yearly, each time manager attends conferenceThis catches my attention because of 1) the current trend of tools changing quickly, 2) the enormous availability of cheap labor offshore. Keep in mind, if managers want to do this, they will have no issue finding offshore bodies to fill roles.So - as an onshore senior/lead Im happy I’m deep into a business domain (subject matter expert) and would be needed for more then my coding skills. If you are worried about this scenario you might start by asking how you can fit into this paradigm. If a company won’t hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable “hot swappable” developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok. If the answer is if no - I just know SSIS and I really can’t do anything unless my team lead holds my hand - then I would set some goals for career development.",rotr0102,2025-09-19 15:18:30,3,dataengineering,t3_1nl3ief,False,

So the Pulumi Python code can live within the same repo as our Python business-logic (actually APIs in our case) and be run by our CICD process with GitHub Actions. Looks like it supports a few other languages besides Python as well. The only real headache I've run into here is needing separate environments for the business-logic code vs the Pulumi code because of dependency clashes between the two.

In all fairness the few times I have used ssis at work, I have it a shot initially when he asked me to, I put the packages in my own GitHub repo. Not it’s good that I have a version but I brought up that that’s just my copy from dev. I can’t see what’s on production. I’m not saying that I want or need production level access but I’d a real pipeline where there is some tangible proof that my dev package went to production aside from him saying he copied it to production. It would also be great for him in case something goes wrong with a new update then he can roll a package back to the previous working version.Overall I get your point and it’s valid and I know I get sucked up in the python vs ssis argument because that’s what started everything and I’ve felt that my dba outright didn’t listen to some of my concerns because I wasn’t doing things his way.

nfbt5qd,"Better observability and pipeline monitoring. Often pipelines fail and there isn’t any notifications on the ssis end to let me know. Recently I was told that he does allow me to use an smtp server to notify myself of failures. This is true and I only have one counter to it right now and that he doesn’t use the emails for the the packages he has built in the past that my team relies on so often I am stuck trouble with stakeholders emailing me because he doesn’t let me know that something went wrong on his end. This brings my next point.Better data practices. You could say that I could do this with SSIS and I could if I had the opportunity to but it’s not my environment and the dba will not let me try anything different in his environment. I want to standardize things like ci/cd and proper data pipeline monitoring as well as documentation. From my point of view it seems easier to do so with a tool that aligns better with my skill set and the skill set of my team if I cannot change anything in SSIS environment. I mentioned in another comment that the dba didn’t go for implementing ci/cd in his environment.Shorter product delivery times. This isn’t really because of ssis vs python. I could make an arguement like that but I know that that is subjective. This is more about man power and ease of deployment. There are more coders in my agency than gui developers and the business units are required to build their own data pipelines (dba words because he said that he doesn’t have enough staff who know ssis to support the business units. He only got two new people in the last few months and they aren’t trained.) from my point of view leaning into a coding based orchestration tool or a coding solution in general will alllow the business units to really build their own data pipelines efficiently and then IT and the dba can just manage production which is what he seems to want anyway. I guess I’m saying this will play to changing skillset of employees and allow the organization to develop faster as a whole instead of business units feeling frustrated by a slow IT.Technical debt. This one is tricky because I can see both the IT setup as technical debt and mine. My team is technically acting like a shadow IT in some ways and that always resulting in technical debt. However the dba is on an outdated SSIS. By that I mean he still uses msdb and hasn’t upgraded to ssisdb which would at least allow for basic version control. Additionally as I said, he doesn’t really have anyone who knows ssis well on his team and therefore if he leaves one day my organization is in a pickle. He can say similar for what I want to do but I am documenting everything I’m doing so there is at least that. Also I am training and have already trained people on my entire environment in case I leave. I do know that this point is probably the most debate point that I am making however. Overall I’m saying that if we move to a more modern setup that fits better with the skillset of those in and outside of the agency (outside matters since they are required to build their own data pipeline) then I think we can eventually get off ssis completely and overall have a more manageable system that more people are familiar with.I typed this up very quickly so it may not be the most clear response.",lilde1297,2025-09-20 23:02:56,1,dataengineering,t1_nezlx34,True,

Google also offers GCP and AWS has Redshift (not recommended). One other you might want to look at is Motherduck, which is quite a bit cheaper than some of the others. You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.The database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs.

By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core.

neu90h0,"As to advantages:Some very useful features become much easier if you have multi-table transactions / true ACID compliance. Sure, not all use cases need those. But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. To begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transactionWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. There are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. For example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portalOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshotIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.Performance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.Locking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't.

But in Synapse SQL Serverless, it also had responsibility for the distributed aspects of query optimization (somewhat similar to the ""Chrysalis"" split query optimization Synapse SQL Dedicated had before that).

nf0ibqw,"So, are you doing this locally or on PowerBI service on the cloud?Personally, we started there, and then started working on a data warehouse so we had the data centralised, updated regularly and with a single place to find it, every report gets the same result. But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.If you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing). But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.So, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.Try to source control your dashboards.If you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.Stored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).Creating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",-crucible-,2025-09-19 04:05:29,3,dataengineering,t3_1nksner,False,
nf3lue4,"I don’t have a lot of experience with Power BI specifically , but I have some more general technology-agnostic recommendations. Depending on your data environment, you could think about working on your semantic or analytics layer to help simplify or standardize your data access patterns. Kimball’s Data Warehouse design approach is a highly-recommended resource in that space.I also like thinking about creating stored procedures, views, and similar objects for these use cases - really any sql you’ll be reusing should be functionalized/modularized in some way, either by developing views, stored procedures, or pipelines that materialize the data you’re retrieving based on what makes sense for your data environment. I’m coming from a DBA/SSIS/sql-heavy background though, and those approaching from a more software engineering background will likely recommend different approaches based on their favorite tech stack and their CI/CD and version control preferences.I’m not a big fan of text-to-sql or promptql-style approaches mainly because I feel like that’s something that should be more for data exploration and presented to the end user rather than a way to streamline your reporting pipeline - all my opinion though, I just don’t like that added layer of abstraction from data when I’m thinking about robust data processes.",dgwyr,2025-09-19 16:51:52,1,dataengineering,t3_1nksner,False,

Your API integration experience is actually really relevant since data engineers spend a lot of time building ETL pipelines that pull from various sources. Companies definitely value programming experience over pure data background - it's often easier to teach someone with solid dev skills about data concepts than to teach a data person how to write maintainable, scalable code.

They have a lot of short-term (6 months to 1 year) missions with TJMs between 500 and 750€ (in top tier companies). I know for sure that they work with TotalEnergies and, despite the fact that they look, most of the times, for experience with geosismic data, during the interview this is often seen as secondary. What comes out is that the experience with moving data from one sink to another is much more important (and also a little bit of PM). If I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications).

Which also has rainfall data. So you don't actually need to develop a device and place it your self. If you explore the website above:* Water level information, such as normal, warning, danger, caution.* There are links to some states sensor telemetry website.* State specific infobanjir. With more detailed information, such as camera feed.* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.These are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.You can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.You can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.As for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.I'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. You may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.As for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.So, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. For flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. This is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?Here's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.I do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.Anyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.If you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\_id=1059.Anyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",zemega,2025-09-16 05:23:49,8,learnprogramming,t3_1nhtsu3,False,

You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs.

Fairly common solution among indie game developers (since we have big binary files like images or cutscenes and do like them versioned but not everyone wants to take a plunge into Perforce).But it costs money - 80GB of storage VPS on something like [hetzner.com](http://hetzner.com) is about $10/month.

They're failing interviews because they can't explain what a log is from high school math or a limit from Calculus. They think it's not important. They don't know binary or anything about how data is stored. They're grinding ""DSA"" but they don't know that cache misses make a program 100x slower, because they never took ""useless"" courses like architecture or operating systems. They don't really get what references are because they never managed memory. They don't know how to comment or write documentation. They've never seen an actor diagram. There are entire courses on all these topics. This is just off the top of my head.Meanwhile, cheating has ramped up big time over the past ten years. People were paying Indians thousands of dollars on Chegg and Upwork to do their entire coursework for them. I know this firsthand. That was before AI too. Now it's totally fucked. Teachers literally can't give homework and it's a learning crisis. I don't know why people pay so much for education just to cheat and get the paper but it's not long before employers catch on.Everyone has it backwards. The degree is what's invaluable, not the paper. If someone actually pays attention in school, they will learn things that others will never know. The reason why so many think education is useless is because so many cheated their asses off.

Why would they even start with the self-taught pile? From their perspective, it's easier and safer to pull the best CVs from the people with CS degrees. It's not about your actual skill; it's about how you look on paper amidst a sea of competitors. That's the reality. Not only that, there is also a chain of responsability behind hiring, because hiring is expensive. If the hired person turns out to be someone incapable of doing productive things, some people will start to look at who hired him. Which hiring manager do you think has the chance of defending himself : - ""But look, the person had a diploma for X, Y years of experience, and done projects with Z, how could have I guessed that it was all bogus"" - ""Okay, the person had no diploma and no experience, but they all learnt this by themselve, did all these projects, and had a good vibe"" The first one, you can't really blame. The second one, it's obvious the decision to hire was risky and subjective so you can really blame him for that.

neve673,"I will go in the exact opposite direction if some comments here: This is a tough question to answer, because it doesn't really matter. I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. The more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for ""applications and tools"", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? If you want to be the most versatile, able to learn ""anything(TM)"" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to ""count""): \- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! You should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. Additionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. I think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production.

Don't vibe code - hell no - but anything you'd search the internet to know, ask AI first, then dig a little deeper, fact check it - its the faster version of digging through stack overflow and stack exchange and reddit to cross reference the collective knowledge, right? And have AI write code, do a peer review, build on what it writes, feed it back in - go back and forth with it, like you would peer programming. Use it to bounce ideas around and fill the gaps in your knowledge. If you rock up to an interview with the skill of knowing how to utilize AI effectively in your development, then you WILL be the most attractive candidate, because, honestly, a lot of experienced devs are behind the curve figuring it out and we're feeling the heat from our employers with all their crazy high hopes for AI.If you like web dev, there are still plenty of jobs out there, even if the job landscape has thinned out and changed in the last 5-10 years. But also be open to try anything - I NEVER thought I'd end up a web dev, I didn't do well in those courses in school so I thought it was the LAST thing I'd ever do, but I'm SO GLAD I gave it a chance and I ended up liking it so much more than I'd ever thought I would.Also, I got lucky: I was a year and a half out of school and struggling to get an interview for junior roles and was kicking myself for not trying to get an internship the minute I graduated. Some internships will accept you shortly after graduation, but most won't accept you more than a year out. But when I reached out to a connection about a junior role at their company, their company countered by offering me an internship which turned into a full-time offer and I've been there nearly 3 years now. So 1) If you want workplace experience after graduation, definitely don't give up on internships (plural, even if you finish one, don't assume its gotta be one and done); post-grad internships are out there and experience is experience and employers love demanding 2-3y of experience from new grads and junior devs for some crazy reason. 2) Build your connections, reach out to your connections, never stop making them even after you land a job; they don't stress that enough in school, hell it probably should be it's own course its that important.",elanestra,2025-09-19 04:54:46,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nk1wan,False,

Python Java etc. this is API development experience) 2. Make a front end using your Java framework or using Javascript/React to be the user interface to interact with that database using the API you built (don’t focus too much on looks, focus on making requests to your API and retrieving data and adding data to the database)3. Learn a little about docker to stand all your services up This is a great project for people trying to get practical experience before an internship, the idea itself doesn’t matter too much. Could be a twitter clone, simple picture display app, anything.

You tried to write a novel without even having a detailed plan of what you want to write - common ""writer's block"".Sit down with pencil and paper and flesh out your ideas before programming. Write down what your program should do, what parts it should consist of, what features it should have. Then, think about each individual feature. Determine what you need for that particular feature, make a detailed plan/roadmap.This specifying, breaking down, analyzing, solving process is the really important part of programming, not the implementation in code, that's the actually easy part (and the part that to a certain degree can already be covered by AI).As with every similar post, some book recommendations: + ""Think Like A Programmer"" by V.

You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==""1"" : list.append(input(""What do you want to add?"")) elif input()==""2""...')- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself - level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.For bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called ""designer"" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.The more you do, the more you learn.

nfdwzo3,"There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. The idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then ""attach"" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health. All of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of ""system"" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.Typically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like ""has components x y and z, but not a"". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.This is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.This roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.htmlRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_SystemThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).Here are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:C++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratchC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/C# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/Here's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",Bobbias,2025-09-21 08:23:15,12,learnprogramming,t3_1nml899,False,

Usually this will result in the easiest-to-test and most-likely-to-be-correct solution.If you can't figure out the general rule, take a piece of the problem which is solvable and then work backwards from there. For example, for n = 3, the middle line is this: 32123First write a loop that outputs just this line, for any n. That's part of the problem. Then work backwards to make it work similarly for the other lines (so that the line before middle is 32223, and so on). Doing it this way is fine too, but there are more opportunities to mess things up or to get edge cases wrong.For the given problem this is not really a problem, though, since ""exhaustive testing"" is pretty straightforward.

Can you entirely avoid branching aside from the necessary loops by writing a value every time? How can you generalize your condition to give you a number to write instead of a boolean? This will prevent a large void in the middle.Something that might make it more efficient: how can you restructure the loops such that the number to be written at each position can be directly inferred from only the iterator values at that position, so aside from the code configuring the loops, nothing else needs to be aware of how large the square is?

We can convert ranges by subtracting n from all members. From there, it's just whichever coordinate that's farther from the center what takes precedence.

And especially for these types of projects, I’d say don’t use ANY code generated by ai, it kinda defeats the purpose. You can use it as a googling aid “how do I get the length of an array, but not as an actual coding assistant “give me a loop that finds the highest value”.Also, when you see code by others, don’t think you learned whatever you saw because you understood it. That don’t mean shit if you can’t recall it when you need to. Seeing the solution to the problem is obvious, and easy to understand.

Nowadays this topic is often called ""serialization"" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.Just as one example, look at how the [""Protocol Buffers""](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe ""messages"" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.It uses the same ""length prefix"" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.Reusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.Or if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip.

On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.One way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number.

It's going to replace - at a text level - whatever it finds, *before* that gets sent to the compiler. So if you do that define, any time it sees ""foo"" it will replace that with the number ""1"".

So when you're reading the code and want to know what the value of the constant is, or if you want to change it, you have to go looking for what source file it's in. A small hassle, but non-zero.The thing about using more memory is also technically true, since the constant has to be stored in memory at the exported symbol address, since the compiler cannot know whether anything outside of your code will also use that symbol. This is hardly of any consequence, but slightly annoying. The compiler also can only optimise away the fetch of the value in the actual file where the definition of the constant is, not in any other file. This is also hardly of any serious consequence to performance, but slightly annoying.Could you elaborate on what the weird problems using a literal instead of a variable would sometimes cause are?",Updatebjarni,2025-09-21 22:18:40,0,learnprogramming,t3_1nmwgos,False,

nedmhfx,"1) at a university? Yeah. You'll learn enough of coding but especially good programming practices which will make you a good fit for jobs in the future. Though i recommend padding out your resume whether via internships or simple certifications cause entry level can be rough to get into. 2) Not really, AI is here and it'll affect things but even if AI is used for coding it'll require actual programmers to fix its problems and implement things. It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. 4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good. Generally uni will teach you coding from scratch so it's not like you need to learn a whole lot by yourself beforehand.

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.It is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.I'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs.

AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.My advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language.

I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better. I can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. I feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience. If you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite.

Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet.

You should always build your own project - sometimes I build it alongside with following the tutorial, adding steps as I go along, sometimes I begin the project when the tutorial is over.

Since there are conflicting views of how advanced AI is now and how quickly it can learn and develop much further, I wouldn't stop learning just in case the idea that AI will take over everything in 5 years is wrong.Besides, there is not enough fresh water in most countries for the water needs of AI facilities in addition to supporting humanity. That may slow things down. Since the facilities need more land area but also cool temperatures, why can't they be built at least partially underground to conserve both land and water?Perhaps u could focus on building things that would help build up city services or get things modernized for underdeveloped areas.I understand that everyone wants to make lots of money, but since u have found a full-time job already, u have set yourself on a good path to make a life u want. Maybe your idea for using IT could help u work with non-profits and places that can't pay hundreds of thousands up front, but that u can help because u want to serve the public.

I think that’s because yeah…, repeating exercises is boring af. BUT repetition is also what makes things stick. Think of music, which in fact is also a language in its own context. You hear a song enough and you can recognize it. We communicate with symbols and logic. You gotta learn what the symbols mean in the specific context and then how to use them to express what you want. So a breakdown of an example you gave in another comment. -Program in C (language/format)-Seconds to minutes (formula)Even if you don’t know that 60s = 1 min by memory, you can find the formula and write it down. The C language will have a way to write the function, the variables and handle any printing or user interaction. That’s the part you gotta know or find out about the language beforehand (like rules or properties). The coding skill comes from being able to write down that broken logic into the computer code. So you gotta be familiar with the language and how it works. But in general terms you can do things for everything. Problems will sometimes have a full sentence to just say something is equal (the same) to another thing. You can usually simplify it into formulas or terms like: 3 bananas + 3 apples = 6 fruit. Instead of thinking “how pretty we can say something” in the language we’re thinking “how fast can we make a computer understand it”. I can say “I would like 6 of that delicious fruit, please good sir.” or I can say “6 fruit”. In logical terms they mean the same. “I would like” implies addition for me, which would different to “Here you go, some fruit…” which would mean a loss for me.

If your only motivation is money, it won’t be enough to push you through the difficulties of a tough project, especially since there’s no guarantee it will actually make money. Instead, pick a project that’s useful to you personally. That way, even if you don’t gain anything beyond the learning experience, you’ll at least have built a tool that helps you in your own life, which is already a great benefit.So, I asked myself: is there anything in my life that I could automate?

nfb1iea,"Got it. I don't know what the context is here -- and anything involving working with raw data is well above the level of this sub -- but the gist is probably this:You have an HTML file, which contains a table presenting some text, two cells per row. The *tr* is the element for a row, the *td* the element for a [cell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td). Each of these cells has a class called ""datavalue,"" and from that HTML file, you could write a script that grabs everything out of any cell with the ""datavalue"" class, so you end up with a text string of ""003F00502040003F00502040"".... (I assume that there are also rows with 00, 04 , etc.)The screenshot is a [hex editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) of some kind -- I don't know which one but they basically all do the same thing: they open a file and let you directly see and edit the raw data. Right now you don't have the actual raw data, though, you have the text ""003F00502040003F00502040"" etc., so you'd have to convert that to the equivalent data file. (Don't worry about the specifics of that, there are probably built-in functions for it in whatever language you're using.)Then in the hex editor you can view what the bytes of the file are, where they are in the file, and what characters they would be if it was supposed to be readable text. This data is almost definitely not supposed to be text, but without more context I don't know what it's supposed to be. (i.e., the 00 3F and 00 50 are probably supposed to be 63 and 80, but I don't know exactly what the 63 and 80 are being used for.)Again, all of this is very much above the level of this sub.",motherthrowee,2025-09-20 20:27:49,1,learnprogramming,t1_nf9vygr,False,

neq1svi,"Just from glancing at your code, I see at least two major problems:1. You're not using `break` statements at the end of your `switch` cases. So if `action` equal 2, the program will execute the `case 2:` branch, and then it will ""fall through"" and execute `case 3:`, `case 4:` and `case 5:` as well.2. Doing `cin >> text` when `text` is a `std::string` just reads a single word, defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. The other words are left in the input buffer. So after first reading the word `""Going""`, then the next time you try to read an integer, the next word will be `""to""`, which can't be parsed as an integer, so it'll fail.

For another, most of their projects are reimplementing other projects that are in use and define a communication protocol. So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.As to your point about whether to recommend it, sure I agree it's not right for everyone, but I personally feel the tests are quite reasonable.

Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.I also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.AI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.I'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",SouredRamen,2025-09-16 18:25:07,100,cscareerquestions,t3_1niov8g,False,

nf0m1pp,2 caveatsI think its more difficult to mentor/train another in social skills. For technical skills someone typically is assigned to help mentor and onboard and teach you/docs to read etc. Having to mentor someones social skills is a lot more awkward and I doubt anyone wants to explicitly be told they need to do that. So a lot is on the individual if they know they need to grow that area and practice it themselvesAnd then with technical skills there’s a lot of room to make mistakes and failsafes to catch you. With QA/canary/code review/rollbacks etc and even if a mistake makes it to prod typically it’s fine and a learning experience. Whereas in a social setting first impressions are very important. As you mentioned it can be awkward at first but unfortunately that impression can stickIt’s definitely not untrainable but trickier,mustgodeeper,2025-09-19 04:32:54,29,cscareerquestions,t3_1nkttp4,False,
nf0pch8,"I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.Anyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.This is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.Like OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just ""smooth talkers"" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?There's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having ""good english"" and ""talking shit"".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. 3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",whathaveicontinued,2025-09-19 04:58:06,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1nkttp4,False,

nerk8w7,"The pattern you usually see is this: if someone comes from very humble beginnings with no networks, no capital, and no guidance, and still becomes wildly successful, there’s usually an incredible amount of luck involved. Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.Take Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.If you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.Finance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.So if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper. No contacts, no capital, and no safety net mean it will take much longer to reach the same level as someone who started with connections.",StoicResearcher,2025-09-17 20:06:12,113,cscareerquestions,t3_1njiusd,False,

nfbftw1,"I've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned. **As an Ambitious Overachiever:** From my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to ""showcase"" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes ""above and beyond""** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the ""regular"" amount of work on your other projects. In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** On the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**Something I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a ""go above and beyond"" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**It is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.*****Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**I took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker. I found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.****Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. **Summary/takeaway:**Brute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman. Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",Luke_Ghostblade,2025-09-20 21:44:59,50,cscareerquestions,t3_1nm908c,False,

nfbln86,"More is more obviously, unless you're blatantly doing the wrong thing. The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender). My practical recommendations are 2 things1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most. One anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder ""requirements"".

Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide ""okay this person is incompetent"" and finally fire him.So hiring managers have to be very, very careful.

People irrespectively have been comparing themselves to others within their social circle for millennia. The rich compared themselves with other rich. The poor compared themselves to other poor. The middle class compared themselves to other middle class.

For example:Any job can be cushy if you're in the right positions. But your perspective is off-keel and your barking up the wrong trees. Within ALL professions, there is the top, middle, and bottom. What you see on social media being ""cushy"" jobs is nothing more than a facade - including in the industries you mentioned. They are designed to spark envy.Many of these high paying jobs are not ""cushy"" in the slightest - at least if people are actually performing their job.

Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.It's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.Layoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry.

Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.This requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said ""No thanks"" to plenty of companies.I've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career.

He would get off department calls, and the second he hung up, one of our managers would say, “oh good, he’s gone, now we can get some real work done.” So…Fortunately for me, the business saw how little value he was bringing within 6 months after, and suddenly he was forced out in a matter of months once his old boss (and best friend) left him high and dry to pursue a higher position.I hate to admit it, but someone once told me, “50% of your career is what you know, and 50% is who you know.” I’d hate to think they are right, but I’llbe damned if there isn’t a pole of evidence to support it.",AwkwardPersimmon6041,2025-09-19 18:41:37,45,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlb2qu,False,

Keep in mind there are many different software domais to know, you are simply more familiar and comfortable with lower level code. To me it seems it sounds like you would benefit from studying things from the ground up. Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.Alternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.Git and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.Testing your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.As for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.Don't give up!

Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I’ve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don’t do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.It doesn’t hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it’s their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well.

Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level.

Think of how many repetitive tasks could be automated, or how much useful data is just waiting to be collected and leveraged, or how climate change is presenting new challenges that need to be overcome.

Right now what most people call ""AI"" (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value. There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that ""it'll do everything we need soon"".There's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.Unlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.I would liken it to the ""Dotcom Bubble"". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because ""having a website for your business"" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.I expect AI to be the same.

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).I'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that. But if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort.

nevn46o,"Start aggressively looking for a nanny share, which is when you share a nanny with another family. Facebook community groups will be a good place to start. If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. Your other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. Both of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses. It's also better for babies that small to be home. Group care is just not the best option for that age, so if you can avoid it, you should.

new0fsz,"People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.Some background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.Our original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.Towards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. So in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.My wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.TLDR;My situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.My advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.DM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",natey_mac,2025-09-18 13:59:13,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1nk5eig,False,

It's not that you have to have a deep understanding of every layer, top to bottom, but at least be able to sketch it out and know a little bit about what it does. It's totally normal if the parts ""far"" away from where you normally work you don't know so well. Nobody will care whether or not you can describe how CAN signaling works. You should probably at least be able to describe what it looks like when the CAN messages are delivered to you though.This in particular is a red flag, so hopefully it's a joke:>“Tell me something about RTOS”>“Uhhhh…you have tasks and the scheduler schedules them….”You've worked on this thing for 2 years and haven't put in the work to understand *any* part of it?

nexjnc5,"I came from defense company where i worked on a radar for 4 years. I then went into one of the companies you listed and worked in their cloud services for aobut 3 years. Your concerns are valid. I dont know how closely related my first job is to your job but here was my experience. At defense, work life balance was a lot better. I didnt have to think about work after 5 pm. The tasks were good enough to keep me engaged but i didnt need to know anything crazy or expand my knowledge really. You could get by and not understand everything. So when you said the quote about not really understanding RTOS, i get that because i worked on things that at the time if you asked me to explain it, tbh i only knew the basic overview of it, not the ins and outs. One of my tasks was actually coding a lot of the receiver and transceiver code too lol. But i was a big overperformer even if i only did like 20 hours a week and chilled the rest. In defense, nobody really disagreed as everybody was just there to give their hours and go. We never really dealt with customers as our project wasnt fully completed. After 4 years i wanted to go for bigger and better and i got in the big tech company (again it's one of the ones you lsited). They wont give you an embedded engineer to ask you things but they may ask you a system design question and the question could be related to what you have experienced at your current job. So youd have to explain how the receive and transceiver work for example. When it comes to coding questions, i think praciticng leetcode and really understanding Data structures is good enough. I think the problem in the interview iwll come when they ask questions like ""tell me a time you disagreed with an older engineer/customer?"" or ""tell me a time you had to deal with an angry customer?"". Unfortunately in embedded stuff, that doesnt come up as much, especially in defense industry. I cant speak for you job but can you answer those questions?"" The vibe i get from your post is that you just do you and there isnt much pushback from either side. Also, be careful chasing these big companies. Like i said i got into one of the cloud systems and for 3 years the work was hectic. I was doing 5x the work and it still wasnt enough for them. I got PIPd after two years and then fired half a year later. Personally the project was just a lot and they expected 60+ hour weeks but it was more like ""only do 40 \*wink-wink\*"". Seniors and principals were too stressed and overworked to helpout and get on calls to help jrs. Everything was a meeting. Standups would take 2 hours because they wanted to discuss something. As a mid-level i was expected to lead meetings and projects. The culture was just toxic and the thing is they can be like this because they know there's a million other people gunning for your job. During reviews you were compared to what your coworkers were doing not what was expected of you. so if you exceeded your own expectations, but all your coworkers are working 60+ hours and have 60+ hours of work to show while you only have 40 hours of work ot show, your manager will go ""why are you so behind?"" and telling them you stick to 40 hours isnt enough. Again this isnt all projects in big tech. Like i knew a guy who worked at AWS which is supposed to be the worse of all of them, but his project was very chill where he doesnt think aobut it after 5 pm. It's very project dependent. All im saying is dont just do it for the money and fame, really consider it. There's plenty of big companiees that dotn fall in that faang bucket that pay just as well. Remember our career pays very well regardless of industry. Even if you make 120k, you are making more than most careers. So dont sell your life for that 200k. Apply to these companies, but make sure it is a right fit for you. Also dont fall in love with the bonus/RSUs they will throw everything at the bonus/RSUs to get you in the door, those are not guaranteed. I didnt know this until i got there but RSUs have a long vesting period. At my last job, i didnt get it until my 1 year anniversary and even then i only got like 20% a year and it wouldnt completely vest until my 5th year.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-09-18 18:22:05,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1nijfzq,False,

You can't really drill these like you would technical coding questions, but you can practice explaining your thought process out loud and getting comfortable with saying ""I'm not sure, but here's how I'd approach it.""Jane Street's bar is high and they're looking for a specific type of analytical thinking that either clicks with you or doesn't. But the uplifting part is that if you've made it to round three, they already see potential in you. Focus on being genuinely curious about the problems they present, don't be scared to ask questions, and show them how your mind works rather than trying to guess the ""right"" answer.

There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. Big tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service.

Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. Im not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call. You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. Im just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be.

neqvwfm,"Azure deployments, scripting with Python and Bash, FastAPI, and Databricks is good mix of cloud engineering, automation, and backend development all valuable and marketable skills. Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. Your role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.Before you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for.

nf9swh3,"For software development, the languages that companies value most right now are Python (super versatile: backend, automation, data science, AI, security), Java (still huge in enterprise and backend), C# (popular for backend and enterprise systems), C++ (more specialized, but strong in systems, embedded, and performance heavy apps). You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it’s useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.If you’re interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you’ve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you’re more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.EU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things.

Automation tools to write a Python or C# script that automates boring tasks (like cleaning up files, organizing data, or generating reports). System utilities to build a command line tool for network scanning, log parsing, or monitoring resources. Cybersecurity mini tools which are things like a password strength checker, simple intrusion detection script, or vulnerability scanner.

Research the problem.2. Design a solution.3. Spec out the architecture.4. Build the product.5. Ship the product.6. Pray that users like the product.7. Deprecate the product because it sucked.However, we quickly learned that1. User requirements are a moving target. Business processes are constantly changing, and software has to constantly evolve to meet the constantly changing requirements.2. Users are very bad at explaining what they want. You can spend a year meretriciously designing a feature only to find out that it doesn't address the underlying unstated problem and users hate it.Under the modern method, application development follows the much simpler process of1. Identify a problem2. Build a prototype3. Collect feedback4. Repeat until good.If you want to ""architect"" software, you should become a core infrastructure developer. Things like the kernel or message queue or a compiler or a database are very meticulously designed.Going back to the skyscraper analogy, we build the core infrastructure really well, but the finishes are hastily put together because we're going to be renovating every five years.",zacker150,2025-09-20 07:34:42,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlp0d9,False,

Maintenance on a single family home can easily be in the tens of thousands of dollars a year. There's a saying about bridges: when you finish painting you start at the beginning. Why do you think HVAC technicians make a good living?As for the question in the title: because the people paying for things are paying for them because they want features. No one cares about clean code or good system design unless it gets them more features faster. Maybe they're willing to have one feature now instead of two tomorrow, but the thing they care about is the feature, nothing else.",qwaai,2025-09-20 05:10:12,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlp0d9,False,

I think many of us can relate to bad processes, tooling or products. Not trying to change bad things is basically just resignation - that kills moral end product sentiment.Even traditionally slow and stable companies like banks have to join this race as they are under attack from fintechs.Quality definitely suffers, but there are ways to mitigate the impact (DevOps).",HelicopterNo9453,2025-09-20 05:38:09,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlp0d9,False,
nf8fbwm,">An architect doesn't build a skyscraper in a month and then spend the next 100 years working constantly to fix all of its little issues. They build it slowly and deliberately over years, then finally walk away with a building that will last centuries with minimal needs for maintenance.An architect isn't racing against thousands of other architects all trying to build that exact same building on the exact same plot of land, and whichever one gets it built first is the winner and gets paid, while everyone else walks away with millions of dollars in loss and wasted time with nothing to show for their efforts except a damaged reputation that will make their future endeavors even harder.Software has always been about a balance between quality and speed to market. You need both to have a successful business.The difference between your company's big new product, or your startup, becoming a household name depends heavily on timing.

nfatnv1,"One thing that you should be congisant of is that none of the issues (as you've described them) sound like they materially impact the value of the product and prevent it from generating revenue. It's easy when junior to place too much emphasis on the quality of the code and not look at the wider picture. The most successful developers that I work with can understand this balance and walk the line.I own and lead the development of a trading system in the investment banking industry, and faults can easily cost hundreds of thousands or millions, yet I'm still shipping fast and not always perfect.There's a balance to find, where I can understand the impact of different features and the way in which they might fail. I know where I can compromise on certain areas, to focus on the critical things, and deliver a product that enables the business to make money. If I have to make everything perfect before I can ship anything, my business can be losing huge amounts of money in lost opportunity. If I ship something faulty we can directly or indirectly lose money. I also know where I can push out a feature to a reduced and experienced audience to gather early and critical feedback to ensure we build the best possible thing.Getting a product released and in use is critical, so you can start getting realworld feedback on how it's performing and adjust development prioritises in response. If you take the skyscraper approach and don't deliver the final product for a long time, you don't start receiving real feedback until it might be too late or very hard to change course.",bakingsodafountain,2025-09-20 19:46:44,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlp0d9,False,
