nnfkk05,"I don't think data quality is purely owned by product managers any more than security, availability, and scalability are.The biggest issues in my opinion are: * Data & software engineers and product managers have little understanding of the impacts and contributing factors to data quality issues. * Data engineers build systems in which they copy the encapsulated schemas from source systems into their warehouse to then transform them. Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems. As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts. * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time. dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this. * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment. Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.It doesn't have to be that way.

The way they do so is perfect for them.Marketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.The only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business. Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X.

nmscbyr,"I work for government: city-level economic growth data.The first thing in the morning I do is to ssh into our Linux virtual machine, manually run a pipeline I should have automated ages ago but haven't done so lol. This specific pipeline lives in our Virtual Machine of our Azure subscription, in which we integrate our Python scripts/modules and our Postgres server. So I am basically just typing some commands in the terminal until the pipeline completes which is a very simple report that ends up in a Google Drive folder for end users of our organization to see.I then go to Microsoft Fabric (the tool chosen by our organization for all data things), go to the monitor tab, see that the scheduled pipelines and any other job is running accordingly, maybe check the Excel reports we are generating to see everything is in order even if we are confident that things are fine.Attend a virtual call only me and project manager, in which like 5% of the whole call is talking about data, issues, tasks we have to do, and the rest of the call we talk about our lives lol.That's always the same, independent of the project.Now, depending on what we are working on, the rest of the day would be doing exactly that.For example, right now we are trying to organize more our workflow, so we are trying to implement the medallion architecture. So this last week I have been creating lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric (an object that lets you store structured and unstructured data within this ecosystem) where our bronze data will reside, ideally, I am separating a lakehouse for each data source (so we got sources like ArcGIS objects such as tables and PDF attachments, Postgres tables, nighttime lights satellite rasters of the Earth Observation Group, the typical Excel/CSV/txt files in a shared Google Drive folder, etc). We want to work less with Fabric notebooks because it lends itself to poorly organized code and workflows, and replace those with suitable items like Dataflow and such.But for 4 months I worked in implementing a system to gather real-time info from one of our ArcGIS social programs surveys. This again resides in our virtual machine, not in Fabric. I did this by deploying a web server and activating webhooks in ArcGIS and a receiver in Python, so ArcGIS basically sends a post request to our server every time there's a new registry or a change in the survey, we then transform this json payload (do some calculations, merge it with other existing data —data which can be obtained via API calls—) and finally upload the structured new registry in our Postgres tables which follow a relational schema. We haven't yet implemented this infrastructure to the Fabric workflow, so that's a task I am also working on.The Fabric notebooks we have are basically for data cleaning and transformation in either Python or PySpark.There's little routine in my job, since once we have something under ""control"" we are always thinking what else we can do to implement cool tools or new data or make cool analysis. For example, by December we want to be able to implement in our workflow a ML model one economist in our team is running about city's quarterly GDP prediction by grid, but first we must automate the ingestion of the inputs of the model such as .shp, geojson, etc files and create the full pipeline so that we then run that model.Disclaimer: I didn't study anything remotely related to software or data engineering. I studied economics but my career path took me to a much more data engineering roles for reasons I don't even know lol, life just surprises you sometimes as I never had this remotely in my mind. So far I have enjoyed it a lot! I work from home, I am free to make my own decisions, people hear my suggestions and ideas, and we can implement things freely. No micro-managing whatsoever. Also, there are routine things, but most of the time we are thinking in new ideas, so we are free to be creative.If you have any questions I am glad to answer them!",RoundAd8334,2025-11-02 22:57:30,5,dataengineering,t3_1omf6qa,False,

The concepts you learn building in Azure Data Factory (for example) will allow you much more easily learn something like Airflow versus if you were just learning it from scratch.Also, the vast majority of companies you apply to already use at least one of these and your audience becomes a lot bigger if you are an ""Azure expert"" vs. a ""Snowflake expert"" or a ""PySpark expert"". You can definitely learn any tool you want, but you also need to consider the market and what jobs will be available when you're ready....Almost all of the major tools like Data Factory, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Snowflake, XYZ123, etc. and so on will all be around in the next couple years, but if you focus on something like dbt, for example, you're going to only have a handful of companies that use that and only like 1%-20% will give you an interview - so just keep this in mind if you learn less popular tools.",HOMO_FOMO_69,2025-11-05 04:00:31,2,dataengineering,t3_1omf6qa,False,

There will be reports, there will be dashboards, there will be analytics there will be god knows what.Whatever will be the next hype cycle in the world data, companies still need their infrastructure running. As the old joke goes, whenever a data scientist joins a company, the first question they ask is 'well do you have a data infrastructure running?' and the answer is mostly no.AI/ML is really interesting and there is space for innovation. DE work is less innovation, but more hands on problem solving. I liked working in both. You can still transit from DE to AI/ML easily, you'd have a very solid foundation.I'd vouch for DE with an AI/ML flavour. If the market shifts, then you can become DE with a something else flavour (e.g. bit of analytics on side. Dashboarding maybe?). You already have an ongoing experience with AI/ML, combine that with a solid expertise in DE and you have good chances ahead I think. I'm sure i'd be happy to have someone like that on my team.Some skillset i'd recommend overal: strong grip on SQL and Python is already given for you which is great. Add understanding PySpark on top (with Spark generally), add a good understanding of a cloud provider (Azure or AWS, some relevant resources) add a data platform skill on top (Databricks or Snowflake). Get a basic understanding of OOP, maybe implement a simple pipeline platform in OOP for an example project.The market will always change and shift and we always had to adapt. Learning never stops in either field, but i agree that AI/ML is currently steeper than DE. If you cant land a DE role, go for a Data Analyst with (and i cant emphasise this enough) heavy tech skills orientation. Many business views DA jobs business only and not IT.

nngmmh4,"The cleanest most ""correct"" solution I've seen on GCP is to switch to the KubernetesPodOperator. The gist is that every single task in your DAG runs in its own isolated Pod in GKE. This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\_id, task\_id, and most importantly, customer\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny But if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a ""good enough"" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\_in\_hours \* cost\_per\_hour\_of\_worker. It's not perfect - you'll miss network and disk I/O - but it'll get you 80% of the answer for 20% of the effort and help you find your most expensive tasks",ummitluyum,2025-11-06 18:32:01,12,dataengineering,t3_1opw2z9,False,
nngalqo,"I don't think the vast majority of people using Airflow are in this scenario. If your Airflow workers are not dynamic or they use the same pools of compute for all tasks, having a tagging system that trickles up into GCP/AWS billing is likely not possible. However you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. Regarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.My opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go.

(Ironically now we want to jam everything ino columnar store table file formats, that can partially trace to Vertica - Stonebreakers columnar OLAP db (fit for purpose)). The core issue is that our infrastructure layer never evolved to make fit-for-purpose systems practical at scale. We know different workloads need different data structures, different storage engines, different consistency models. But the operational reality of managing multiple specialized systems, keeping them in sync, and reasoning about data flow across them remains prohibitively complex for most teams. State management is a big reason for this.So we get stuck with pragmatic compromise. Teams choose Databricks or Snowflake or whatever and then bend their problems to fit the tool, because the alternative is managing a constellation of systems that might be technically superior, might better fit the different business needs, but is operationally untenable.There is a ton of conceptual inertia in industry too. We think in terms of linear data flow: source to warehouse to consumption (ETL or ELT). But that framework doesn't naturally accommodate materialization into multiple fit-for-purpose targets. The tooling, the abstractions, the operational patterns are all built around central systems of record (BI, Analytics, Dashboards), not around dynamic materialization.This is a key problem I'm working on. Until we have infrastructure that makes it trivial to materialize data into whatever shape and system the workload actually requires, without creating operational chaos, we'll keep defaulting to whatever single system we've already adopted, even when we know it's not right for half (or more) of what we're asking it to do.The inertia isn't just conceptual.

nn6epnv,"I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.First, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.Second, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.Third, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.That said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.I am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this.

nn1o6n6,"I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.As for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",Kardinals,2025-11-04 12:49:22,2,dataengineering,t3_1oo5u6o,False,

For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.What’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously.

That's what a transformation layer, like dbt, is for. You land the messy, multi-version data in a ""raw"" Iceberg table, and then build a clean dbt view on top of it that uses logic like coalesce(first\_name, name) to give your downstream systems a consistent, predictable schema.

I find most resources for learning when it comes to programming to be quite frustrating, and they don't explain enough. I was only able to do a semester of computer science, but I was attending a university generally quite well regarded for their computer science / cybersecurity programs. I ended up having to stop attending for financial reasons, unfortunately. Anyway, what I LOVED about their program is that it broke everything down to the fundamentals. It's been a few years so some of the following may be incorrect. This is just an example, but they had us learning C++ and started us off by learning how a computer works. Then they had us learning how a variable is basically just assigning a name to a block of memory, and storing data in that location. Or how arrays are sequentially assigned blocks of memory, so if you know where X index of an array is located in the memory, you can find the other indexes. How you can't dynamically increase the size of the array due to how C++ is reserving memory, how typing works, etc. I find that with most learning resources, they just don't even *attempt* to explain how a particular thing works beyond a basic level. But then when you try to wade into the waters of reading documentation, it's so filled with technical jargon that it's often incomprehensible to a beginner. I don't want to build legos and just slap stuff together. I don't want to know how to USE a particular programming concept, I want to actually know how it works. I recall when I was younger, attempting to build some small projects. Inevitably, I would write a bit of code that I thought understood in one project, and try to re-use the same concept in another project with a slightly different use-case, only to find that it fundamentally was not doing what I originally thought it did. When that happens now and again? Not a big deal. When that's happening pretty frequently? It becomes frustrating, and it makes me think that even when I can re-use a concept in multiple projects successfully, that I still don't totally get what it's doing. That's the issue that I have with trying to learn by just trying to make something. I care a lot less about making any one particular project, and a lot more about knowing how everything I'm doing actually functions. Anyway, huge block of text over.

Here the Odin Project also does a great job. You learn the theory and then you build a project they provide where for each project you need all the theory you were supposed to learn prior. The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project.

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. Through coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.At the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.Anyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. While this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.All in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years. It's never too late of course to start but I can't help but think if I had put that effort in when I was 15 I'm sure I wouldn't have ended up in a warehouse.

A domain is usually one table, but it may access other tables as needed. I don't do repositories as they are mostly just extra work, also EF is a repository, but you do you.The business layers job is to restrict how data can be accessed. What goes in when you create a new object? Usually the pattern is* Search - a way to list and possibly page through a set of objects, returning a summarized, smaller object that contains only the stuff that needs to be displayed. If paging is required, I have a generic class that returns the paged set and the total count. I also have a common extendable filter class.* Get - returns more detail about the object. May return child objects as needed.* Create / Update / Delete There may be more, specific ways to interact with the domain, those get added as needed. Sometimes you want to update only one field, like status, progress, without updating the entire object. Separating thouse out give a nice, clean, clear API and shows intent.If this is a web project, the controllers are mostly interfaces to the business layer. I can sometimes call multiple business layers in one place, but I never try to reuse code from one business layer as-is unless it makes complete sense. Don't be afraid to repeat some code. Or if you do, push it to a service that gets shared. The main goal is that each method should be doing something unique, and that if it changes, then everything affected should be minimally affected, i.e. the change shouldn't affect their core behavior.I separate (as much as possible) security from the business layer. So business logic should only care about what to do, not who is accessing it. Sure you will pass in some user information for filtering, and you will have logic that changes based on who is accessing the data, but you should have up-front checks before the business layer is called. This way you can test or use your business logic, either via unit tests or in a prototyping project without having to deal with setting up security contexts.",rupertavery64,2025-11-03 09:06:10,2,learnprogramming,t3_1on6g8o,False,

They don’t care about backlinks or meta tags; they care about context clarity.Think of it like this: instead of keyword density, LLMs look for meaning density. The cleaner the structure, like H1 → H2 → lists → short paragraph, the easier it is to turn into embeddings that make sense during retrieval.It’s a mix of HTML parsing + embedding similarity. The model doesn’t want to guess what the content means; it wants to know with high confidence before it recommends it.I’ve noticed smaller sites win here because they’re often simpler: fewer pop-ups, less CSS noise, and more direct semantic HTML.

The opcodes are literally switch settings that direct the operands to the physical hardware gates in the cpu. Your OS is not going to do any final compilation of your program. It’s going to load machine code into an isolated virtual memory space and control physical memory storage, swap space, and cpu time vs other managed processes. It will also provide mediated access to hardware via OS calls. You still have to compile for the right cpu architecture and OS. Virtual machines like the Java JRE let you start with a semi-cpu agnostic median build that is JITted into machine code at runtime. The OS still doesn’t do it. With some runtimes, like .net, you do have to specify a target cpu architecture as well. That’s a VM design choice on whether they want to abstract certain cpu features like the size of registers (32 vs 64 bit), endian storage, etc. and OS features. These choices still have to be made eventually of course and abstraction adds overhead if the actual cpu uses a different standard.

In actual development, which framework or language to use is usually dictated by the situation. For example, if the client’s system is in JavaScript, you can’t just use Python. If they want React, you gotta learn it and use it right away. So, there’s no framework that’s definitely worth learning or should be ignored. It’s just about using the right tool to solve specific problems.My advice is, if you really like Django but don’t have a project for it right now, why not come up with your own project? Build it and keep improving it. You’ll discover a lot of cool things about the framework along the way.But if you’re not super into Django, feel free to check out other languages and frameworks. There are tons of them out there. You might find one that you really love someday.I used to mainly work with Django and Flask until I started using React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS.

Try drawing a curved line in pitch dark as this is basically what a computer can see - nothing. Have you ever tried to draw a curved line on an ""Etch-A-Sketch""? Similar problem. Or, get a CAD program to precisely draw your curved line. Or, get a 3D printer or a CNC machine to follow your curved path. All these are far from simple.Curves in general are no trivial math, no matter what algorithms or what curve systems you use. Every trigonometry or math professor will tell you that.What we humans classify as ""simple"" doesn't mean it is really ""simple"" in an objective manner.Computers are generally very dumb devices that are only good in one thing: calculatingYou have to tell them every single minuscule step that they have to perform.Once you accept that computers are extremely dumb and that you have to tell them every minuscule step you are on the right track to becoming a programmer. Stop assuming things, stop classifying things. Nothing ever is as ""simple"" as we humans see it. On the other hand, a task that might be impossible for you, like calculating with huge numbers, is trivial for a computer.

Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, ""signal processing"" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.Expect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \*massive\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.Break everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility.

nnadgly,"> How to figure things out on my own?Kind of ironic that you're even asking this, rather than figuring it out on your own, no?The process is pretty straight forward - you think about it. You read about it. YOU BEGIN BY STUMBLING AROUND, LOST AND ALONE IN THE DARK until you trip over something that might possibly happen to lead you somewhere. You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.Figuring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...If what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff. Every failure informs you of what not to do and how not to do it. You have to know what you want to accomplish in the first place so you can measure how far off you are.> I want to know how I can truly figure things out on my own and study effectively without missing important or essential informationYou need to embrace that you're totally missing shit, all the time. There is a depth of knowledge in front of you that you have no idea is even there, but the more you learn of it, the more profound all future insights would be, the faster and better you will find future solutions.But don't miss the forest for the trees. I've been programming for over 30 years - I'm tickled that Unicode is backward compatible with 1830s telegraph equipment, and that means something to me, but it doesn't mean anything to you. You're not there and it doesn't have to matter.> while also avoiding wasting too much timeThis bad attitude is not going to serve you. NOTHING is a waste of your time. Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, ""wasting time"" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you. You may not yet be on the path you want, but you're learning all sorts of other things, and it always comes back around to aid you.",mredding,2025-11-05 19:08:35,2,learnprogramming,t3_1op92xf,False,

nnmqdpc,"Jira is absolutely a solid choice (when it isn't atrociously slow, but that's not something you need to worry about). I won't try to convince you of something else. Below is more of a personal observation to put my recommendation in context.I have worked with a lot of bugtracking/planning software. bugzilla, trac, redmine, jira, codebeamer, github issues, IBM doors... big and small, well-known to self-made. At the end they all do more or less the same with varying degrees of usability and features.And some things never change:- Planning is mostly garbage. This isn't a slight against you, this is universal. The entire agile movement at its heart is about the realisation that planning longer than two weeks ahead is reading tea leaves. If you need to plan, plan only enough to keep people busy for a week. Ideally the subjects of what needs to be done should fit on a single screen. Jira can do that, a text file can do that too.- Any planning tool is only as good as the people maintaining it. It's a non-trivial commitment and it is thankless work, and people who like coding will quickly forget about it. Only commit to processes you can also keep up. Jira can model entire epics and release plans and whatnot - and will gladly rot away with outdated information unless you slavishly document everything there.- Text is king. Whatever you do, a few month from now you'll need to find it again within the hundreds of tasks you did in the meantime. You can search for text, but you can not search for audio or images. Try to keep everything as text as long as possible. The tracker may have fancy images or support draw.io embeddings, but as soon as you try to export to pdf or copy paste into a code editor or try to localise it breaks in creative ways.- Locality is also king. Every external tool is a chance for things to go out of sync or to get lost. There's an old open source project where I have been contributing for over two decades now. We've gone through 5 different bugtrackers in that time. Every time the decision to move was correct in the circumstances, but every time it meant we lost the entire bug history.",aanzeijar,2025-11-07 17:44:12,2,learnprogramming,t1_nnl51dn,False,

If they have an operating system (e.g. linux) then you can use VM langs. These tend to be your bigger devices with more power. If battery operated customers really care about battery life. If you have 30,000 sensors around the country with button cells in, you want it to be 5-10 years before you have to replace those... so we use microcontrollers and C (sometimes C++). Custom protocols are sometimes seen, but LoRa(WAN) etc. are common too. You need to be comfortable at the bits-and-bytes level ideally. Good fundamentals in general software dev (data structures etc.), network programming, are necessary.

And these are all scenarios where a solution like site builders, CMS etc are not only easier, but often the most appropriate solution. Any experienced dev will tell you there's no point reinventing the wheel unnecessarily, and you really want to avoid building yourself from scratch anything that handles money or PII.Companies that do need custom web app development/maintenance, are hiring teams of them on long-term contracts or FTEs, via job postings/recruiters/consultancies, not from bloody Fiverr or the local community notice board.

There is a university in Vienna that is very strict, and many say that it is so difficult at the beginning that they can't get through it with a 20-hour work week. That's why online IU is probably the best choice for me. I also thought that I would study computer science in general (networking, software development, web development...) and do a master's in cyber security.Thanks for sharing your story. Self-study is good, but to avoid tutorial hell, you have to choose something specific. Ich habe kein Angst von AI weil ich habe teilweise benutzt.

Good companies use interviews to measure how you think and communicate, not how well you memorize obscure stuff.At this point I treat interviews like noise, one bad experience doesn’t mean you’re not good enough, it just means you hit a broken process. I practiced and interviewed using StealthCoder to focus on explaining my reasoning clearly instead of chasing random trivia. It gives hidden hints and structured solutions so you can focus on communication and problem solving, which is actually what real interviews should value.You’re right, these companies need to fix their process.

Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass. So there’s a balance you need to find where you come up with how to test and the AI just writes it.

My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.There's 2 approaches to this:* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one.

Our on-call can be brutal and all of the things we own are critical so it can be stressful. It’s not friendly to early career, especially if it’s not the type of work you are interested in, and it has been a struggle. I was told that this experience with systems would be great for my future career opportunity so I went along with it. What I’ve found is that I’m missing out on a lot of traditional early career exposure. I don’t have much OOP experience and I don’t know much about writing or owning the destination services themselves. This has made it tough to change teams (I’ve gotten direct feedback that they want more code experience) and it means that to land another job I will have to be “creative” on my resume and when interviewing. In the current market, people want specific tech stack experience, not generalists. So yes I very much feel pigeon holed as a result of the bait and switch and it has impacted my career trajectory and my overall happiness in the industry. I don’t write code or build things: I put out fires, stare at dashboards, and debug kubernetes logs. I’ll spend an hour figuring out an esoteric 1 line yaml configuration change which could literally take down the entire business if it’s done wrong, and then a teammate will ask why it took me so long. I am expected to understand the entirety of our system as opposed to just my one vertical. It is not at all what I expected when I chose this career. I do not recommend taking an SRE job out of school. As others have said, it’s something people usually choose to get into later in their career, it assumes a lot of underlying knowledge, it’s high stakes, and it’s not the type of work everybody enjoys or excels at.

nns2uxn,"Yep, this is one thing I think a looooooot of execs either underestimate or don't even think about when they decide on a layoff.When I was laid off in early 2023, half the engineering department was let go, so from 16 people down to 8. Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.In the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.One of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, ""If we offered to bring you back, would you?"" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.Layoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.The entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.There are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay.

nmym1g2,"You don’t have to love it. You have to tolerate it. HOWEVER, your chances of success go down drastically if you don’t at least enjoy it in the early stages. Building things with words and watching the computer spring to life to do your bidding is magical, in a sense. Not enjoying that basic part early on says your tolerance for it might be too low for an industry that prides itself on burnout.However! There are a lot of cushy, well paying jobs in literally every field. And, in most of these jobs, you will find that having a working knowledge of scripting, data manipulation, and basic structures can give you a MASSIVE advantage.My advice: find something you want to do. You’re 26. I’m sure you at least have interests that could point you toward something career wise.Love travel? Become a photographer or something that lets you utilize it. Use scripting to manage your catalogs more efficiently, making your website and portfolio presence stand out more with some web development, etc.I started out loving coding.Then, over the years, I started loving it less.Then it went to apathy.Now I actively dislike it.This was only after ten years. I wish I had gotten my creative writing degree and done what I wanted with my life instead of chasing money.TL;DR: the industry sucks right now. It’s not the slam dunk it was five years ago. If you already don’t like it, maybe give it another six months to a year, but just bail. Do something else.

nmxiy6g,"One of the big issues right now is the industry is in a downturn. There’s debate if and when things will turn around. There’s a chance by the time you graduate, the market will be better, but there are no guarantees in life. There is a general shift away from remote work. Hybrid is more popular these days, although there are some places going 5 days on-site. It won’t be impossible for you, just hard. There’s value being in-person, especially earlier in your career or time at a new company/team. You don’t need to necessarily love programming, but you need some combination of competence and caring. When I say “caring,” I mean wanting to do a good job rather than half-ass it. You don’t need to work a million hours. There are a lot of really lazy devs out there. And a lot of people want to gatekeep the industry to those “who truly care.” I’m not trying to contradict myself. In latter scenario, caring means people who eat, live, and breathe tech. You can still be quite successful without that. There are some online universities, if you really cannot stand your current state. There are about 3-4 that are regularly recommended, but their names escape me at the moment. Definitely a step above University of Phoenix. You will be getting a real degree. One other thing to consider is some women don’t like tech working environments. Men in tech can be weird for several different reasons. You have the original nerd types, and now there are tech bros. There have been initiatives to increase the number of women in STEM, but YMMV how each company has done. I saw this post in another sub and thought it was interesting. It’s open to some interpretation. https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1n5xc3s/im_told_that_our_engineeringfocused_culture_is/There are also tech roles that are don’t require coding.

I've literally had to tell people ""don't tell me the number you think I want to hear"", for example, when I smelled a ""going through the motions"" estimate.On the code quality front, ""letting them failing"" is another way of saying to give people autonomy to potentially shoot their own foot (and then own up to it).

EM does a lot more in the realm of fielding requests for work coming from other teams. Understands our capabilities, commits us to work that is in our ballparkand so our tasks to start are usually very broad in definition, something like ""Add Drawer Login Component"" with really just the design files attached and some bigger acceptance criteriait's on us to break that down to the smaller manageable tasks, and point them as a group. Then they're just added to the queue for the sprint, that's what we've committed to. All unassigned.and so now, anyone can pick up any of those tasks, let's say given an assumption we all have similar skillsets. Maybe a junior picks up a task that is a little more difficult; they can either take on the challenge, or maybe a more mid or senior stops them and says - ""oh hey this might be a little more involved, but you can help me build this part of it"" and create another ticket.So now we're all trusted to get the job done by doing all the discovery and now we have to work a little bit more together, and everyone has an idea of who's taking what. Junior A is prob waiting on bigger design things from Senior B before they can start. The senior would be inclined to prep the junior on what they have to do. or get them to focus on something else while Senior B finishes.You, just kinda make sure that you're aware of the progress, and the more senior engineers are there to identify risks.

I wrote some rather cheesy input routines to input the data and drew the graphs using the Apple Pascal Turtle Graphics library that came on the floppy disk.

Azure is _more_ than thriving.Second, look at the company in question’s health. Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company. However, if more than half of the reviews indicate serious backstabbing problems, then yeah, that’s a major red flag.)",jrt364,2025-11-05 11:29:38,26,cscareerquestions,t3_1op07lo,False,

nn8yf0v,"This is kind of a brain dump, but hopefully it helps:There are four types of layoffs (at least):1. The company is doing bad and they need to cut costs to stay afloat2. Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more ""efficient"", which actually means ""overwork the shit out of people""3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fineAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.A company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.A company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.And lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.I think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market.

Stability of position may ""feel"" stronger and your psyche will appreciate it.

With a company doing layoffs expect lots of changes in direction and reorgs.So basically, your thought exercise while not totally impossible is hinging on two assumptions: the company was hurting before and the layoffs are improving their standing, and that these companies would be even interested in hiring in the first place.

nn4lesf,"Did this about a year ago. SA / sales-adjacent roles were not on my radar at all, I had 8YOE as a SWE. I just thought the role sounded interesting and applied. In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. I’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.I’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet.

It just sort of happened because those teams took me in early career and it just... sort of kept going on like that since then.I am purposely rerouting to full stack side from purely BE as I am noticing more and more job postings want full stack (so doing best to adapt to the job market for future job searches).>what factors helped you choose your pathtbh, I don't know. I think for most of my career, I didn't know much so I just adapted given the work I was given. And I never really gave much of a thought. It's really difficult to know anything early career and all I knew during college was I absolutely wanted to avoid networking, C++, OCaml, machine learning. Looking back now, I feel thinking in absolutes is not good and I should have given those fields a try.I did do data engineering side (more niche) early on but quickly pivoted away because I noticed data side was going to get paid less than general engineering (the trend was dying and the number of job postings were too slim so I escaped while I could early career).>How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?Job Security - Feels nonexistent. I think this is the worry with generalists. I am way too easily replaceable by offshoring as offshore infra matures more and more. I wish I would have specialized and am doing my own sort of specialization in some ways (explained later on).Compensation Growth - Leaves to be desired. If I could redo I would have run immediately to Machine Learning. The pay premium is so much greater. It's noticeably more. Basically about $80\~200k more a year when you are senior/staff. And career growth (promos) seem much faster for more niche fields. For instance for those in security or ML, they can get external Google Senior offer at 5 YOE. A generalist might need 10 YOE in comparison and get paid worse.Day to day satisfaction - I find working with motivated coworkers with a decent manager is what sets the day to day satisfaction. Not the type of work I do.>specializing in a niche vs being a generalist?While my skills are generalist, I am 'specializing' in business domain. That's how I plan on 'buffing' (?) my resume. So while my coding skills are generalist, the domain I am working on is becoming more specialized.I definitely noticed how helpful that was when doing a job search recently.[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025\_job\_search\_2\_month\_long\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025_job_search_2_month_long_results/)Applied 18 companies and 15 gave interviews. All 3 that didn't respond were for generalist roles that were far off from my business domain. And the 1 recruiter who ghosted me after recruiter call was also for a role far outside the business domain I worked on.If anything, I noticed throughout the interview process the jobs that were closely in lined to business domains basically just gave me offers (freebies). It's a huge advantage to have experience in closely related niche fields.I say specialize early on in potential in-demand fields if you can because the ones with high barriers of entry like GPUs, AI inference, etc are extremely difficult to offshore. And basically have no competition once you have sufficient experience (best for job security). And can command huge premiums in the market as you become senior+ (+ promos are easier and quicker).If you cannot specialize like that and you are a generalist, at least specialize on the business domain. Why wouldn't a hiring manager pick someone who is exposed to similar business domains over some random candidate who worked on something completely different? That said do keep in mind generalists are the most replaceable so offshore worries will be a bigger threat over time. :/**I honestly feel generalist just sucks. Most easily replaceable/offshore-able.** **Specialize in what companies need but cannot find. It's all supply demand and promos/compenstions do reflect such as well.** **Have knowledge in many stuff but be deep in 1 topic.**In a bad economy, also keep in mind while generalists can apply everywhere, specialists (in domain or busines knowledge) will be first in line for those jobs.

That's an interesting topic to get into, too.Myself, I've serially specialized in both my roles and what industries/segments I've been focused on. In both cases I've tried to get as deep in the speciality as practical. Roles: backend dev, product manager, project manager, software & systems architect, no-hands-on people manager. Bouncing from one to another hasn't held me back. I honestly couldn't say which I enjoyed more and the world needs all of them. With industries, I specialized in systems (primarily app servers and orch platforms), dev tools, data agg/monetization, and vertical search engines. That might not seem like a huge range, but each of them are pretty specialized and their first choice is to hire people from their own space, so the segments are a factor.I don't think specialization necessarily holds you back from making changes. As a hiring manager, for a mid-/senior dev I want to see people have been in 3-6 companies in at least 2 industries over 4 to 12 years digging as deep into whatever they were doing at the time to be great at it.

nndcrrd,"I worked on a project converting a project from an Elixir backend to Go(lang). The company had basically been chasing the language they thought to be most popular among devs and also handle large numbers of users. I personally think if you feel confident enough learning it, and intrigued with the features/use cases, it should be well worth your while. I have since interviewed for a few companies that were headhunting for experience in Go, and I will say I've had more inquiries from recruiters because they noticed that experience on LinkedIn over my more extensive experience with JavaScript and Ruby. As I'm sure you've noticed, the more programming you do the easier it becomes to pick up new languages. Python will be but a breeze after Go. TLDR; yes, it has stood out to me as a very lucrative language if you have the time/bandwidth to learn it.",c-romo,2025-11-06 05:13:44,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1opnw38,False,

I recently built a Blazor side project using .net 10 RC1 and it was pleasant if you don't want to deal with javascript. I got into Go about 10 or so years ago but haven't touched it much since.

nnjqe20,"I have three pieces of advice from someone who has been in this game a long time and who has been in roles where I didn't feel like I was successful.First: If you onboarded at the end of August, then you are less than three months into this job. I have never been at a company where anyone really got up to speed in less than six months. If it's a large company, a fast-moving company, or both, it can take closer to a year.Two: We are all our own worst critics. We see all of our deficits and fuckups. Meanwhile, when we see other people's work, it's because they landed something, solved some problem, gave some slick presentation, etc. Don't compare yourselves to others. You will invariably be comparing your messy practice sessions to their greatest hits.Three: When the great jazz guitarist Pat Metheny was asked by an interviewer how he got so good, he responded ""easy, I made sure I was the worst guy in every band I was in."" Talk to the people whose work you admire. Ask them how they think about problems. If you see a slick piece of code or a clever solution, give it the old \`git blame\`, figure out who wrote it, and message them saying it's cool and asking how they came up with it. Pay attention in code reviews. Get a mentor who is more senior in the same org and role as you. Even if you are the worst guy in the band right now, *that's the position where you do the most improving*.I've been where you are now, and it sucks, but it doesn't suck forever. Stick it out, ask lots of questions, and trust that you'll get better with time.",TheTarquin,2025-11-07 04:59:10,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1oql05h,False,
