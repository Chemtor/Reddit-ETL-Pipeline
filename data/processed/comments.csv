mwqygrb,"I personally like learnsql.com, Data Lemur, Udemy has a bunch of good SQL courses where you setup a database on your laptop and learn all the SQL syntax, query execution plans, optimizing queries, etc. that you could wanna know. Some even get into DBA stuff for the given RDBMS software if you wanna go that deep. I would use learnsql.com for learning and practice and then move onto Data Lemur for more interview style SQL questions. Then if you have more time do one of the Udemy courses so you actually get to setup your own database, play around with loading data into it, messing with indexes, and query execution plans for query tuning.When I was an Analyst, I used to find a couple free datasets, load it into PostgreSQL and just make up business questions about the dataset and then write a SQL query to answer the business question.

mx65fev,"It's a good write up, I agree with most of his points, especially about how 95% of companies don't need 'Big Data' solutions for their Little Data problems. But there are a few points I don't entirely agree with.I also work for a company that is relatively reasonable in its tech stack. We only have a few TB of data for more than 10 years of operations and most of it runs on an on-prem setup using mostly open source tools. No cloud bloat or any of that.> There’s a tool for ingestion. A tool for orchestration. A tool for transformation, reverse ETL, governance, monitoring and if you’re lucky, a tool for remembering why you started this project in the first place.I'm a big ELT proponent. Part of the ELT philosophy is that each part of your pipeline performs as few tasks as logically necessary.My ingest/outgest scripts run in python and they *only* do ingest/outgest. They don't perform a single transformation unless they absolutely have to.I run my transformations with dbt.I schedule my jobs with Airflow. I don't really see how I would orchestrate my pipeline unless with an orchestrator (CRON would also do fine). Or does the author imply we should have an alarms set somewhere so we can manually run these singular scripts he seems to such a big fan of?> But here’s the secret the consultants won’t tell you:> Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs. Faster answers. A fighting chance that someone on your team actually understands what the hell is going on.One script. One machine. One person who can debug it without a PhD in vendor certifications.I have seen these 'One script. One machine. One person.' solutions he's talking about. I've made a bit of a career out of refactoring them. Often that 'One person' fucked off some place else and now no one understands this one script that is taking 40 minutes to run every 30 minutes.These one scripts typically had hundreds of moving parts that seemed to perform tasks with varying degrees of usefulness and efficiency. Except it's almost impossible to figure out what part does what since it's all thrown together.If you One Script performs ingest/outgest and transform at the same time, good luck debugging your hot mess. If something goes wrong you've now got hundreds of lines of code to comb through to find the offending part.When something goes wrong in my stack, debugging is easy as hell.Does the problem happen between the source and my RAW schema? Well, just look in the ingestion scripts. Is it between RAW and the final data set? Check the dbt queries. Is it between the final data set and the consumer? Check the outgest scripts.When each moving part performs a single, clearly defined task, debugging is a lot easier.Yes, it is true in engineering that fewer moving parts typically means a less complex system, trying to cram as many functionalities in as few moving parts as possible is also not the best idea in general.Imagine building a house and having your water and your electricity lines all using the same pipes in the wall/floor. Sure, you've got to install fewer pipes, but good luck when one of your water lines has a leak.",ilikedmatrixiv,2025-06-11 09:21:41,28,dataengineering,t3_1l8gqta,False,

So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.But yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users.

You need to design the workflow, test it, deploy it, expose the data and of course maintain it. This is more or less what a typical DE does. Now, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source. During the early days, a business will usually go for a managed service to set up the data platform. If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities?

Another way to potentially manage access changes is with GitHub. GitHub feels a little hacky and more work than either of the two above. Another way is to connect access requests with a jira (or something similar) ticket and the ticket parameters map to specific snowflake roles.

mwhkdlw,"Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)Just to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.In our setup:* Airflow handles scheduling -- the ""when"" something should run (""run this job daily, but only after X completes"").* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the ""what"", ""where"", and ""how"" something runs (""run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs"").So why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?A few reasons:**1. Consistency:** We want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.**2. Security:** Engineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.**3. Simplification:** By offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.There are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.And just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",Pale-Fan2905,2025-06-07 13:36:19,4,dataengineering,t1_mwglt0m,True,

No more 3am pipeline debugging sessions.Three years ago our data team was drowning. Beautiful medallion architecture (bronze → silver → gold) that looked great in slides but was a nightmare to maintain. Every layer had schema changes, quality issues, debugging headaches. We spent more time figuring out which layer broke than building features.Breaking point: a simple schema change cascaded through 7 tables and killed reporting for two days. That's when we rebuilt everything around FITT principles.The four FITT principles:1. Functional - Pure functions only. Same input = same output, always. Made everything immutable by default. Storage is cheap, debugging corrupt state at 2am isn't.2. Idempotent - Run it 1000 times, same result. Recovery = just re-run it. Junior devs actually experiment now instead of being terrified.3. Tested - Tests as architectural components. Every pipeline has data quality, business logic, and integration tests. They're living documentation.4. Two-stage - Raw → Final, that's it. Raw data stays immutable forever. Final data ready for consumption. Everything in between is ephemeral.We ditched bronze/silver/gold entirely. Those layers were just arbitrary complexity.Key implementation patterns:Dev/Prod split: Dev uses yesterday's data + today's code. Prod uses today's data + yesterday's code. Never deploy untested.Git as truth: Want results from 6 months ago? Check out that commit and re-run against raw data.Incremental processing: Each increment is idempotent.

mx8dqb3,"Here's some general suggestions:1: Care more about what your file/module look like than about whether you use classes in the right way or follow code patterns. Avoid large interconnected codebases, have clear interfaces and responsibility splits with other teams. Your main measure of maintainability should be whether you can easily transfer ownership of your code to another team with little context.2: Simple imperative code in pipelines is perfect for most usecases. Be explicit and avoid magic. [Push for loops down and ifs up](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html) to make it at least possible to optimize code later and be very careful about functions that can't operate on batches. If you use streaming iterators, use your languages equivalent of chunked and call batch functions on chunks, don't call single element functions in an iterator.3: Understand the difference between struct of arrays and array of struct (aka row based vs column based), be aware of which of the two applies to the data formats you use and process things in their natural order. This combines nicely with chunking.4: If you use python, use ruff and uv, declare dependencies clearly in pyproject.toml, and use type hints on anything public. Prefer simple functions over classes, take protocol classes as input and spit out concrete data structures as output. Use asserts often, especially if something might need a comment.5: Make your data partitionable if possible. If you use a database, there should be a clear way to split it into (for example) ten smaller DBs with the same layout, and only need to copy small tables. Try to identify or create natural keys that are shared over the entire data pipeline that can be used to neatly split data without overlap.

mw9t5bi,"I'm not sure if this runs into being your first option, but can you make a table where you slice the `starts_at` and `ends_at` based on any change on any 'associated' dimension, and then also incorporate the relevant `starts_at` as a separate column for each table?That way when doing joins later you can do direct equality joins on the relevant date fields, but if you want to pick out a value at an arbitrary time -- end of each day, end of each week, end of each month, etc -- you can do so based on the `starts_at` and `ends_at` values.You wouldn't need to create this by explicitly joining each table based on ranges, you'd take all the `starts_at` and `ends_at` values from every table first, and use that to slice the start and end for the new table. You'd need to do the overlap joins then, but you'd only need to pull in the `starts_at` for each table where there's an overlap.If you have dbt macros, or can use jinja templates to help build the sql for you, or you're using a dataframe library, you should be able to make something adaptable to multiple tables being included.The benefit is you'll still get the full grain of every change across all tables, and you won't have to create dummy entries for periods where nothing changes, and you still get to use equijoins out to the original dims when using the table.

mwgy8qy,"I’ve been doing the first option for a few years and it works. I do it in three steps, using CTEs. 1. Union the valid_from and valid_to from all of the source scd tables to create a “spine” of every state change timestamp and person ID. The reason you have to stack the valid_froms and valid_tos vertically is to handle gaps in the source scds’ time ranges for cases where dims were deleted. 2. Join each scd table to that spine on person id and where the state change timestamp is within the scd time range, e.g. scd.valid_from <= spine.timestamp < coalesce(scd.valid_to, ‘9999-01-01’). 3. The spine timestamp becomes the new valid_from, and use a lead() window function to add a valid_to. To make it incremental, you’ll need to add a surrogate key built from person id and valid_from in step 3. And use that as the “id” in the incremental config to prevent duplicates. The incremental clause should filter each scd table to only include rows where the scd.valid_from is greater or equal to the max valid_to for each person in {{ this }}.I could dig up an example query if that would help.",chestnutcough,2025-06-07 10:54:26,2,dataengineering,t3_1l4ksvs,False,

The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Ingestion system is down when scheduled to run, crashes, etc - cannot run, this period never runs or only runs after someone wakes up and starts it. The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Infrequently-run scheduled processes often have enormous data volumes and run very slowly.

Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.It sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.1. Agile2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.If you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow.

mx42w9t,"I've had experience with multiple clients with similar use cases -- specifically dealing with many single tenant use cases (same schemas) and aggregating into a warehouse for analytics.A few questions you have to ask yourself: **What are you optimizing for downstream?** \-If your use case is dashboarding and analytical queries across large datasets, Redshift will scale better than Postgres. It’s columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.**Is it important for data to get into the ""warehouse"" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. **As for your questions:** 1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. 2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. 3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You’ll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. 5.

Sounds like your upload speed may be pretty slow as an organization if you're thinking about compressing before moving to the S3. Questions I would have:- How much time are you actually saving between uploading raw files vs time compressing and then uploading? Are you really saving time between running a compression, uploading then having spark load compressed files?- Are these daily files appended into your target tables or are you doing upserts? - What's the likelihood of needing to reload your tables from scratch? - Is the data easily partitioned outside of the daily extract? Generally, I recommend trying to keep the files as I receive them but there are reasons to do slight modifications. Reason being storage is cheap, compute is not. That first time you have to reload from your raw storage, even after just a couple of weeks of daily storage, you're probably ahead of the game in terms of cost running spark against gzip files. Again assuming you're using some kind of pay as you go system.Personally, for something like this I'd probably split the difference and convert the csv to parquet with snappy compression. That should give you a sizeable storage savings while still giving you performant reads if you need them down the line. Again a lot of this depends on what you have available to you, converting to parquet, depending on the data, will likely be more time consuming than just gziping the data but your reads should improve.

(also are you sure you want a row oriented file type over columnar) IMO you should look at sinking Parquet or even ORC as binary formats (especially columnar formats) will leads to better compression and faster query performance (remember that SEEK is literally one of the most expensive operations to perform both in terms of memory but also in runtime)",Surge_attack,2025-06-07 15:26:43,1,dataengineering,t3_1l5iv1q,False,
mwkx0ro,"> it's taking longer than I *feel* it should takeGZip compression isn't inherently ""splittable"" (mentioned already by another), because it doesn't provide a way to 'jump ahead' in the data and know where you are to start decompressing. This means you can't get the decompressed data any faster than a single node decompressing it.If you're doing dynamic schema it also has to do two passes over some portion of the data. So it will read a certain amount to figure the schema, then start back over again once it has the schema it has come up with.> (Option) Add a step to decompress the files before we read themThis is probably pointless, spark is doing this for you on-the-fly. The only reason to do so would be because you are reading the source multiple times. Even then, the extra file size and resulting network transfers will offset some of the gain, and you'd have to pay the 'cost' of fully processing the data at least once just to get to that point. If you did anything like this, you would have spark just take the original CSV data and save it to compressed parquet, so that later stages can work off of that for faster re-runs or recovery from a node failure.---There are some other things you can do, but anything effective will involve having the source do something different, because they're the ones producing the files.Uploading uncompressed will be faster for you to process it, since spark can split the read across all of its executors. If you have a lot of cores in your cluster this could be a significant speedup. The tradeoff is that storage costs will be ~3x higher, and it will take ~3x longer for the provider to upload the data.A potentially easy change for the provider is to upload multiple gzipped files. Since it is a CSV, if they don't have newline characters inside the data (it really should be replaced with an escape sequence), then they can split the file by line count and then gzip each file. You still get the compression, and when running the ingestion job you can give spark a glob (or list) to read multiple files as a single dataframe. That will let you split up the decompression work. Note that this is not about splitting *after* the compression, as that will cut off csv lines in the middle -- you want to split the raw CSV by line count *then* gzip each of those files.Another *possibly* easy change is to swap the compression algorithm to bz2. Iirc this one includes the ability to jump to blocks automatically, so spark can properly split the decompression.The best way might be to see if they can grab the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) -- it is a single standalone executable, so you wouldn't need any special installation scripts or anything, and as a CLI they just need to run a duckdb command instead of gzip. You can send [commands as arguments](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/arguments.html#passing-a-sequence-of-arguments) for the CLI, so you could make a command that will read the original CSV file then write it to parquet (with compression applied by default). The command would look like `duckdb -s ""COPY (SELECT * FROM read_csv('your_input_file.csv')) TO 'your_output_file.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);""`. If you read into the DuckDB docs you can also see how to specify the CSV schema so all the typing can be done correctly at the outset, which is handy for you because parquet will have actual types for its columns, which in addition to being compressed and splittable, will make the ingestion job faster.",azirale,2025-06-08 00:49:23,1,dataengineering,t3_1l5iv1q,False,

mx0yvcs,"I have thought about this a lot lately. I disagree with you when it comes to students. They absolutely SHOULD NOT use A.I. A.I. destroys your ability to think. It may not happen immediately, but it does. I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time. This isn't just happening to programmers. This is happening to other fields as well. The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it. Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool. It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning. This is also why you take so many math classes. Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world? Probably not, but that's not the point. The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills. The same goes for programmingI'm speaking from experience on this. I'm a 3rd year CS student. My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class. Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion. Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I. I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer. I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps. I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again. I actually retained the information that time.I have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code. I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects. This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design. Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity.

There was still a pretty decent learning curve moving from C to C++ but I was already familiar with doing shit with pointers and memory management.That being said, something I love about newer languages is not having to mess around with all that.

mw8ar7t,"C++ gives you an enormous amount of control over memory (manual allocation/deallocation), performance (fine-grained optimization) and system resources (via low-level access).This makes it a go-to for game engines (see Unreal), high-frequency trading systems (super important!), embedded systems, real-time applications, major parts of operating systems and browsers (like Chrome, which uses C++ heavily).But that power comes at a price, as you can easily shoot yourself in the foot.Because C++ does not force best practices, good C++ code often means that you need to know what not to use, to master idioms (e.g., RAII, SFINAE, Rule of 5) and to understand UB (Undefined Behavior), which is more common than you’d like. This fuels the mythology: you’re either a wizard or doomed.Unlike Python or JavaScript, you don’t get guardrails. Crashes, memory leaks, and security bugs are easy to write. Meanwhile, Rust, Go and others provide modern alternatives with safer defaults for many tasks. Python and Java are easier for most high-level work.

mw9621n,"I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the ""safe"" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.There are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.So all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.I could go on. But the overall point is that1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.C++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",TonySu,2025-06-06 03:14:19,3,learnprogramming,t3_1l4d5gi,False,
mw9seo1,">I understand that you need a ton of understanding and experience to write performant C++ code. And that even decent Python code will outperform bad/mediocre C++ code.Wait, what? This isn't even true. The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. Barring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. Yeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. The language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it. For example, template metaprogramming is functional programming, while your normal code tends to be object-oriented / imperative, so you need to learn two programming paradigms to properly program, which indeed is a lot. But most of people's problems with the language aren't really a problem if they use the right solution.

C++ is also unmanaged, not running in basically a VM like C# and Java, so it's a little more efficient in that regard. Also, you're relatively unrestricted in what you can do with C++, so if you know what you're doing, C++ is a very powerful language.Since the C++11 standard, C++ has gained a lot of more modern features too.

No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.Learning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.Please do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...First, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages. To gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.Expect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.What you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.And not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ...

mx5u7jl,"I’m not a math whiz either. The way I understood it was by reframing it as a way to describe scaling behavior. In other words, it’s about how much longer your code takes as the input gets bigger.O(1): constant time. This describes behavior that takes the same amount of time no matter how big the input gets. For example, accessing the first item in an array. It doesn’t matter how many elements are in the array, it always takes the same amount of time.O(n): linear time. This describes behavior that scales linearly as the input gets bigger. For example, printing each element in an array. As the input grows, so does the time.O(n²): quadratic time. This usually shows up when you have nested loops (a loop inside a loop) both running over the same input. For example, comparing every element in an array to every other element. The time it takes to complete a nested loop structure increases more and more as the input grows, even more than linearly.",5eeso,2025-06-11 07:28:13,73,learnprogramming,t3_1l8m6fx,False,

It only cares about the pattern of how task time increases with the list size.The most common and simple patterns are:* O(1) - Always equally fast: * MEANING: No matter how many things are on the list, the task always takes the same amount of time. * Example: Opening the front door of your house. Whether you have 10 guests or 1,000, the door takes the same amount of time to open.* O(n) - Slows down proportionally: * MEANING: If the list doubles, the task takes twice as long. * Example: Counting how many socks are in a basket. If there are twice as many socks, it takes twice as long to count them all.* O(n\^2) - Slows down very quickly: * MEANING: If the list doubles, the task takes four times as long. If it triples, it takes nine times longer. It's very inefficient for large lists. * Example: Introducing each person at a party to everyone else. If the party has twice as many people, the presentations become much longer.This is to know if your approach will work well when you have a lot of data.You want it to be O(1) or O(n) if possible, and avoid O(n\^2) when the list is large.",guillermokelly,2025-06-11 08:12:36,25,learnprogramming,t3_1l8m6fx,False,
mx5zav1,"People are often thrown into this class with only a vague notion of what a log in math is. This is a bad starting point right off the bat. Also, its VERY easy to get confused about WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING. Bad books; you can't tell if they are counting the comparisons or the swaps in a sort algorithm. Those numbers can be similar or very different.You are in part telling me without telling me that you don't understand the NOTATION. The concept aside, O(1) is notation for the simplest thing you can do: you do one operation (this can have several steps) and get the result. Eg array\[user\_input\] = 0; you go there, you do something, you are done. Sure, that is like 8 assembly instructions or something, but big-O is a conceptual level thing, not a detail level thing. You wanted to know how many assignments, you did 1.O(N) is similar. you iterate an array and add 5 to each element. How many times did you add 5? Well, you did it for whatever the size of the array is, but we didn't say... that is abstracted to the letter ""N' which just means ""some amount of them"". You write that one O(N), see how that works?looping over every element with nested loops is a multiply.. for(1-n){for (1-n again)} .. how many times does the inner part happen? Its N\^2 .. the outer loop does n inner loops for 1, n inner loops for 2, ... right? And that is unsurprisingly written O(N\^2).So the notation is O (some expression of N). some expression of N could be almost anything you might see in math, from N! to log(N) to N\^3 to sqrt(N) or whatnot. Big-O only keeps the dominant terms (eg 3n\^3 + 11n\^2 + 37) is just written O(n\^3) .. because in the big picture, the cubed term will soon dwarf the others and give you a general sense of how slow it will be.\-------------------a log is just an exponent, with its own math notation that is weird and a bunch of cool properties that you are told to memorize without being led to connect the dots, the first time you see them, and many people never get much past that part. I mean, its stuff you know, though, if you can just see past the notation and look at the numbers. 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ... you know these guys ... its the powers of 2. How many times, using only integers, can you cut the number 100 in half? Even rounding it up.. 50 (once), 25(twice) 13(three times), 7(4), 4(5),2(6),1(7) and done. Hmm. 2\^7 is... 128. Hmm. See the connection? The math problem is ""to what integer power do I raise 2 to get 100"". The answer is 6 or 7 depending on if you want to over shoot or under shoot the target. THAT IS A LOG problem, and its all you are going to see in big-O is powers of 2. No base 17 logs or e or anything from math that gets weird, just powers of 2, and that is the question it is asking and the answer. Its not that scary, when you see it written out, hopefully? All the log algorithms are about cutting the data in half over and over, just like that, for example think about how you search a physical book dictionary for a word: you open in the middle, and its more towards A or more towards Z, so you cut the half where it will be in half again... is it more towards M or Z... more towards M or S ... whatever... (and yea humans jump to the first letter section better than by halfs but play along with the blind approach ... this is just what a binary search does ... cuts the list in half until its down to 1 element and its found or not at that point). That is about 85% of the big o stuff. There will be other notations at the same time that denote best case, average case, worst case and so on that you just need to memorize (the notation, I mean, memorize THAT) and rules (like the dropping of constants and taking the dominating term of the equation that your code defines.there are not that many REAL in use big-O answers. There is 1, lg(n), N\*lg(n), N, N\^powers, and the ugly stuff like N! or 2\^N etc. And practical algorithms rarely go abouve N\^3 before someone gets mad and finds a better way (there are some things where there is no better way, but MOST stuff you see day in and day out has an answer N\^3 or better). I mean there are screwballs... shellsort for example often ends up with some form of O(N\^(x+1/x)) eg N\^7/6 was a common find back when I studied that algorithm. But shell sort needs a freakin PHD level analysis to find the complexity for many of the sequences and its not handed out lightly to students.

mx5uv2a,"Big-O notation is a fancy term for approximation. Basically you count the number of operations that your code performs.For example, the very first LeetCode problem: given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a given target. An example of non-optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: for i in range(len(nums) - 1): for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)): if nums[i] + nums[j] == target: return [i, j]It has a loop with n iterations (i index) and inside each iteration is another loop with n iterations (j index). So the code may evaluate the if statement up to n \* n times, hence O(n\*\*2) time complexity.An optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: prev_numbers = {} for i, num in enumerate(nums): complement = target - num if complement in prev_numbers: return [prev_numbers[complement], i] prev_numbers[num] = iIt has only a loop with n iterations. The code may evaluate the if statement up to n times max, hence O(n) complexity.Another common introduction to the notation is a binary search. In a binary search you halve the length of the list at each iteration. How many times you divide the length of the list (n) until it becomes 1? Roughly log(n) / log(2). Hence O(log(n)) complexity for binary search.Look up multiple tutorials and introductions and build your own understanding of the subject.

mx982ds,"So lots of other people have given good breakdowns on Big-O, but when it comes to practical applications I find where a lot of learners struggle isn't actually the time complexity part, it is the part where they look at real algorithms and figure out the Big O. Because they can't read and understand code well enough to make any conclusions on how many times some code might loop or the like.Like, look at some pseudo code like: function maxproduct(List l): int { int maxproduct, i, j = 0,0,0 while (i < l.length) { while ( i + j < l.length) { int product = l[i] * l[i+j] if (product > maxproduct) maxproduct = product j++ } i++ } return maxproduct }If the list contains 1 item, how many times will the ""`int product = l[i] * l[i+j`\]"" line be executed? What if it contains 10 items? 100?If you can look at the code and figure that type of thing out pretty quickly, then figuring out Big O becomes a lot easier to understand - you're really just talking about the relationship between the number of inputs and how many instructions and how one grows as the other grows.But if you *can't* look at a code block like that pretty quickly and tell me roughly how many times the interior loop will run based on the length of the list, your problem isn't really understanding Big O notation. It is that your programming knowledge isn't advanced enough to really be able to grasp it. So if that's the case, I'd put worrying about Big O aside and instead return to focusing on the basics of reading and writing simple code until you really get it and can read it easily before returning to more theoretical concepts like Big O.",PoMoAnachro,2025-06-11 19:39:41,2,learnprogramming,t3_1l8m6fx,False,

Identifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second. The thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table. With that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table. Further, if some rando in Timbuktu, or in the sandwich shop across the street, manages, against all odds, to generate the exact same GUID as one of yours, it doesn't matter, because *they're not putting it in your database.* I hope this helps you feel better.",doshka,2025-06-10 13:18:05,3,learnprogramming,t3_1l7trrk,False,

But when you've got external demands on you, you're forced into situations where you have to build or fix something and you have no clue how to do it - and maybe no one else on the planet does either - so you have to figure it out. That ""figuring it out"" is the actual vital skill people want.Of course, that puts you in the ""you need to have experience to get experience"" trap, so if you're just starting out the gold standard remains ""4 year B.Sc. in Computer Science + an internship"".

You must ""opt in"" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being ""virtual"" or ""non-virtual"", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.C++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.C++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.Python also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, ""generators"" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an ""eval"" facility which lets you evaluate code ""on the fly"" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++.

When you dominate the syntax you start to develop a skill to write the code without thinking in the semantics but in what can be possible output. It’s a process that takes time because we in normal days solving a problem we use the real logic but in programming you have the abstraction to representing real situations in a programming language. If you think in closing a door, you imagine the door fiscally and the knob, but in an algorithm you could think in the coordinate of the knob or if the door is open or close or even if there is a door, so after you have this clear in you mind so you translate each action in code. This is a process to take time to become automatic, similar to drive a manual transmission, the first times you really think a lot when changing the velocity, but after you don’t think on that at all. Furthermore, if you don’t know something exists (a solution) how can you know about it. I mean, my point is I am very ignorant about some music if I never listen before, but the first time you hear it you can know if you like. Solving problems is like that, you don’t know the solution and even where to start, but with practice and learning how others approach the problem you will develop this sense of recognising patterns. A way to deal with this more in practice is learning how to debug and learning debugging tools, so you can see the step by step of the code and the output.

This subreddit isn't called learnCoding either, it's called learnProgramming.IMHO what sets a programmer apart from a coder is that a programmer is capable of understanding (software) architecture decisions in their programming field (and maybe even make their own architecture decisions). A mobile app developer has learned the architecture layers of mobile apps, a backend enterprise application programmer has learned how to keep their growing projects maintainable, a frontend dev may know a thing or two about designs, ... .So what can you do? Understand that coding is one of many means at a programmer's disposal to achieve something greater. Then get a grasp on which field(s) of programming actually interest you.If you like coding, which usually involves breaking down a larger problem into many small steps, you can think of programming as doing the same ""breaking down problems"" into manageable chunks, just at a grander scale. Trust me, it's just as fulfilling to see planned parts of a program work well together as it is to write individual methods that do what they are supposed to do.If you still have absolutely no idea what to do, maybe think of a more-than-trivial, less-than-difficult business use-case and implement that into a program with an agile development style. A business use-case doesn't have to be money oriented, it can be anything you'd use in a business, including any open-source software idea that comes to your mind.While/after you get the right mindset how to approach program development, you can return to game development.

This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). I think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java.

Do you want to develop websites? Learn javascript. Do you want to develop operating systems/embedded systems? Learn C/C++. Scripting or task automation? Go with python. Keep in mind that once you have learned the general principles of programming (i.e learn to think like a programmer), learning a new language is very easy, because basically the only thing that changes is the syntax, and some quirks that each language may have, but the core concepts are always the same. Python is a good generic starting language to learn programming concepts because its syntax is not complex, and it has libraries for everything you might want to do. As for resources, I would suggest first using youtube tutorials/books to learn about different concepts (variables, operators, functions, classes, etc.), then figuring out what the best language is for your use case, and trying to solve leetcode challenges. Leetcode is a very good resource to teach you algorithmic thinking and program optimization.

So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school"" language - it’s got legs in the industry.If you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:For Cybersecurity:Python – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.Bash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.C/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.For General Dev / Building Stuff:JavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.Go – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.Since you're enjoying it already, I'd say:Stick with C# and get comfy building small projects.Start Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.Maybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.Also, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately.

mx0x1fx,"Can you give an example?Generally, it's a separate skill. Teaching as a TA or tutor helps practice; so does a client facing job like consulting. My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.My other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.It's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.I will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like ""I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\]."" If it's weird they'll just tell me and I'll give an answer that works with the weird.

Don't hate yourself just because you failed an interview. I flat out froze up in my first two interviews, it happens.The way you improve is by first looking up mock interviews on YouTube, and learning what a ""good job candidate"" is even supposed to look / sound like during a coding / behavioral / systems design interview. This is not one of those things that's ""obvious"" in the sense that you should ""just know"", especially if you don't come from a white collar background and aren't used to presenting yourself as a professional. You gotta at least see a good example.After that, you gotta do what you can to prep. Look up ""X interview questions"". Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description. You usually don't need to be extremely thorough, just some skimming to be sort of mentally and emotionally prepared for the kinds of questions you're going to run into. If the questions do seem wildly off from what you know, just do the homework and try your best to study up.And beyond that, you need to be honest with yourself. Did you really know the answer, just not how to phrase it? I did a lot of random LeetCode / Hackerrank before I even did my first coding interview. I knew ***nothing*** about DSA though, I relied entirely on my intuition to solve problems.

That is why everyone always suggests doing projects, because then you apply your recently gained knowledge, and then you learn!Books have the downside that it is tempting to skip through the boring stuff, and only read whatever confirms what you already know. They can give you a feeling that you totally understand things, because the book explains it so nicely.Interactive tutorials like free code camp and others, have the downside that they only ask you to answer predefined questions, and you risk becoming like a monkey pressing switches, without any idea of why or what you are doing. And since they tend ""finish"" every topic without ever returning, you forget the first things you ""learned"" before the course is complete.Video tutorials are mostly just watching someone else repeating a project they have done before - kind of like watching someone play a game they've already completed. It can be great for actually seeing what is going on, but like in life, there's a huge difference between seeing someone else doing things, and do them yourselves.My recommendation is to look around, try some different things, see what you like, and then focus on applying the knowledge to projects where you can't just fast-forward or skip to the page with the solution.

mwazsv0,"I’m a senior developer with around 15 years of professional experience. I too learned OOP and the MVC pattern (which was touted as the prime example of SOLID) at my university. Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.In my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.My point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.Just build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way.

Normally this would be done with a client/server setup. The client application talks to a server application which then stores the data in the database. Only the server application has access to the database.If your client application has a login process normally you store a password in the database as a hash (SHA128/256/512/1024) of a salt (random data) and the password. The salt and hash is stored in the database. When someone provides their password it is sent to the server which then grabs the salt, hashes it and the password and makes sure the result matches the hash in the database.The salt is to ensure someone can't calculate hashes of common passwords ahead of time and just scan your database for those hash results. The hash ensures nobody can see the user's password in the database nor can the reverse the hash to find the user's password.The salt needs to be random/different between users as well, you don't want two people with the same password having the same hash in the database.",pixel293,2025-06-11 23:51:44,1,learnprogramming,t3_1l97oga,False,

mxak8zf,"# Strategies for DB Access and Token Protection depends on your application architecture:# 1. Backend Service/API (Recommended for Web/Mobile Apps)(most secure and common approach for applications that need to access a database)* Client (web browser, mobile app) *does not* connect DIRECTLY to the database. Instead, it communicates with a secure backend API that handles the database connection and queries.* The client sends its authentication token (e.g., JWT, session token) to the backend API.* The backend API validates the token to authenticate the client.* The DB credentials (username, password, or connection string) are stored securely on the backend server, typically in environment variables, a secrets manager (like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault), or a secure configuration file *NOT* accessible by the client.* The backend uses *its own* secure database connection to fetch/store data, never exposing the credentials or the db token to the client.* Requires building and maintaining a backend service.# 2. Environment Variables & Secure Configuration (For Backend Services/Scripts)* For backend applications, scripts, or microservices that need direct database access, store the authentication tokens (database passwords, API keys, etc.) as environment variables on the server or in secure configuration files.* Requires careful server hardening and access control to prevent unauthorized access to these variables/files.# 3. Secrets Management Services (Highly Recommended for Cloud/Complex Deployments)* Cloud providers (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager) and third-party tools (HashiCorp Vault) offer dedicated services to store, retrieve, and manage sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.* The secrets manager then provides the database token/credentials to your application at runtime.* Many services also support automatic rotation of credentials, adding another layer of security.# 4. Database-Specific Authentication MethodsBeyond just username/password:* **IAM Authentication (AWS RDS, Azure SQL DB):** Use Identity and Access Management roles/users to authenticate directly with the database, rather than static passwords. This allows for fine-grained permissions and integrates with your cloud security policies.* **Kerberos/LDAP Integration:** Integrate database authentication with existing directory services.* **Client Certificates:** Use TLS client certificates for mutual authentication between your application and the database.",guillermokelly,2025-06-11 23:49:28,1,learnprogramming,t1_mxak6yl,False,

And humour is of course an even worse rabbit hole.> sometimes you find that you use the same words or phrases every timeSpecifically for this, remember that tech people like well-defined meanings. The whole ""use a thesaurus to avoid repeating yourself"" thing that English majors do in prose is actively frowned upon in comp-sci works. If you mean the same thing, use the same word again.Also what happens in real settings is that rarely used words are just not as present as other vocab, so we either need to think for a bit (either to mentally translate or to search for the word) and this is bloody exhausting. Just reusing the smaller core vocab is kind of a defence mechanism then.> Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges.

Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.I looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved.

In school you had a set schedule for classes. They didn’t do that because it was nice to look at. They didn’t it because it works. Even if a 14yo student didn’t want to do maths this week they still had 4 hours in class. Now you need to set those restrictions on yourself. You might have so many online lectures already set out but you need to structure your time around them and plan your evenings to fit in the homework (prescribed or self assigned) ensuring the info sticks. Clear your study environment so it only relates to study. No games trinkets or toys just what you need to work. You can add some bits later to decorate (months or years later) but start fresh and get everything set up for your mindset. When I’m sitting here I’m studying. Set out a plan. You want to learn Java make something in Java. Start with a concept:“I want to make a calorie tracker” what does it need? Calorie calculator, database to record entries, GUI, mobile app, are we going to have multiple users?That’s a lot to plan and make in one go so let’s break it down into each component and make the calculator first, next let’s focus on making multiple entries for one day so the app gives you daily totals, now we need to display different meals through the day and process what each one had, next let’s make a DB and record entries there so we can look back over a week (do we need a DB can we just make a file and read from that). Do some of the real planning they were trying to teach you in uni and design your own software architecture. In the morning I’m doing study on the stuff I missed 3 hours, take an hour break, evenings I’m doing project work 3 hours. You’ll have plenty of time for enjoying your summer besides. Treat it like a job and you’ll be ahead of everyone when you get back. They might have a year up but you can keep the project work going and have branch out skill to other areas giving you 3-4 large unique projects compared to the standard “every uni student” project. Avoid AI for the most part. Try to do it yourself, it’s hard but that’s exactly why you need to do it. AI can help guide your design choices after you’ve planned them. If you’re learning about arrays don’t switch to a list or hash map because the AI suggested it. Nail what you want first, then go back and make another project using more complex systems. Java isn’t that hard once you get going you can get into it fairly quick and projects are the best way to do that. When people say learn frameworks and libraries it’s really what tools you have and how you can use them. Best way to do that is with projects. Do your revision and get your studies back on track. Start building real projects and you’ll get a grip on what you need. Make the simple things first then bring them together.

mx1gprf,"> SQlite cant process 2 requests at the same timeThat information is somewhat outdated. What sqlite cannot do, is process multiple *WRITING* requests at the same time, as this requires exclusive access (either locking of the WAL (Write Ahead Log) or a pending db lock). sqlite does support multiple concurrent *READING* requests### WAL ModeSince WAL was introduced, if it is activated (by default sqlite uses the older rollback-journal), readers and writers do not block each other any more, and reading doesn't block other readers.So sqlite, with WAL enabled, supports multiple readers at the same time, and supports reading and writing at the same time. The only thing it doesn't support, is multiple writers at the same time, those are forced into sequential access, because they need to lock the WAL.https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html### Rollback JournalIn this mode, which is the default unless the journal pragma is set otherwise, sqlite still supports multiple readers and only one writer, but; other than with WAL, readers in this mode block writers, and vice versa.What this means (since sqlite version 3): If someone writes to the database, the DB goes into a `PENDING LOCK` mode...allowing current reads to finish, but disallowing further reads from the DB. As soon as the last read finishes, the database goes into `LOCKED` mode, the writing access does its thing, and then the lock clears.This means, with the older journal mode, if a lot of writes happen on a DB, read performance suffers.https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback",Big_Combination9890,2025-06-10 16:19:22,6,learnprogramming,t3_1l82ohn,False,

mx1k6ne,"## Concurrency considerationsMore specific to the concurrency issue: sqlite does indeed support concurrency within an application (aka. accessing the database from multiple threads), since the necessary serialization (db locks, journaling), is being taken care of by sqlite itself.This depends on whether sqlite was compiled with the `SQLITE_THREADSAFE` option or not. I haven't seen any sqlite distribution that wasn't for a loooong time.Good code should check however, wether the sqlite compilate used supports this, and if it does, which thread safety mode it uses. The catch here is that there are 2 different modes:`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 1` means multi-threading is supported, but auto-serialized. This is slower, but safer.`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 2` means true multi-threading is supported, but there is no auto serialization. If this is the case, and in many sqlite distros this is the default now, *threads cannot safely use the same connection concurretly*. In this case, a connection-pool is usually the way to go if you have multiple threads accessing the DB.https://sqlite.org/compile.html#threadsafe",Big_Combination9890,2025-06-10 16:35:47,2,learnprogramming,t1_mx1gprf,False,

(In SQLite, a ""connnection"" does not actually correspond to a network connection like in many other databases, but the terminology is the same.)Transactions are associated with particular connections, so you don't want to share a single connection between different user requests. Otherwise, one user would be able to see partial incomplete updates from another user's in-progress transaction.And locking happens at the granularity of connections, regardless of whether those connections are used in different processes, or different threads of the same process (as long as `SQLITE_THREADSAFE` is used, as you said).

The demand, i.e. desire, for R&D hasn't gone away- it's arguably only getting more intense than ever in strategic technologies what with all the ""but china""-isms. But the cost of financing R&D has ballooned between the hike in interest rates (keeping zombie companies on debt fueled life support, incentivizing borrowing to spend on growth, i.e. R&D) and loss of immediate tax breaks. (ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant ""refunds"", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.There is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** **This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",Kalekuda,2025-06-07 14:24:51,76,cscareerquestions,t3_1l5kbzs,False,

If you're focusing on profitability, cost cutting by reducing labor is a huge lever.2. Tax issues like Section 174 also have an effect. For big tech companies, it doesn't matter as much since these companies are very profitable and have strong cashflow. They're already paying a lot of corporate income taxes in most cases anyways.

Blanking can happen to anyone no matter how strong they are in a language, so attributing that to poor language skills is very presumptuous and shows their bias. As for blanking, a good technique for anyone else also struggling with this is to repeat the question and ask follow up questions. This will buy you time. You don't need to think to repeat the question and that will help you come up with follow ups, and the answers to those follow ups can help your mental gears get started while showing the interviewer your thought process.

Generally, what tends to work is talking through the individual manual steps id be doing to implement the task. So like if someone said ""why cant you just add X"", then I could say ""sure, I could, but the out of the box library doesn't do that.

mwclx25,"Few things to unpack:First is understanding why there's a sense of urgency, and whether it is warranted. If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.Second is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.If it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.The other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.As for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include.

There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?Hiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.So this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?Yes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).Again, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do.

That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.Even on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons.

My responsibilities include having a healthy service, so yes, I will work past 5PM if there is an outage. That is the expectation of me in my field of work. I can work till 8PM, wake up for an outage (while on call) at 12AM, etc. no issues because that's what I signed up for when I accepted the offer at that company.I also ran into a different situation where my manager brought a vague task to me, I broke it down and gave some design considerations. I suggested a path because I thought it balanced the pros/cons of delivery time & scalability in the future. The manager pushed for something that would've been delivered faster, but would have resulted in cutting corners and been more painful to scale later. I said this is what I think, but if this is what you want I'm happy to do it with your signoff. Obviously a year later when it had to scale, it was a painful process of untying knots to make things work. In our 1:1 retro, I highlighted a (probably passive aggressive) ""had it been done this way, it could've gone better"" and the manager asked why I didn't push harder for my design. At the end of the day, you're my boss - I don't care enough about this company to want to push things my way. I'll suggest, if you say otherwise - we'll do it your way no problem.Getting reprimanded about how they think I should care more etc. was eye-rolling.

These are all things you should be asking about in the reverse interview.Next time you job hop, make it a point to reverse interview.

You need to be the one rejecting companies you don't want to work for.That being said, I don't think your situation is that bad. Firstly, *you got a job*. In 2023, as a new grad. That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.Also, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.Anecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.All that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you.

mw3i43j,"Short answer: While I want to say ""YES, it will open doors for you!"" the reality is more akin to avoiding a penalty than actually helping you. Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.Not having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.When changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.Additionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies).

mwutiey,"PhD programs in the US don't usually have masters degrees are a prerequisite, and certainly CS PhD programs won't care about a masters in philosophy. They'll be looking at your academic background, research projects, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, fit with the program, GRE (if required), and stuff like that. I took a look at your philosophy of mind writing. It's... not good. You'll need to stop using chatGPT to help you write stuff. Even if you think it's your own voice and ideas, having an LLM rewrite your stuff will invariably introduce semantic shift as well as ideas that aren't your own. Using an LLM to help you write like this at all will instantly torpedo any academic aspirations you have. You're going to need to learn how to express your thoughts on your own. Chatting with LLMs can make you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're making deep insights, but that's the sycophantic nature of chatbots. But it's actually very shallow because it doesn't understand anything. It's just good at generating sentences and paragraphs that looks good on the surface. It might seem deep to someone who's deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well, but it's mostly just superficial repetition to an expert. You didn't engage any other thinkers at all, didn't connect anything you're saying to any published work, and there's just zero rigor. Be careful ""self-studying"" philosophy in this way. It's not preparing you for an academic program in philosophy. This is the equivalent of someone self-studying about CSS and learning how to change colors and themes on a webpage, and thinking that they've made some insightful leaps in the theory of computer science. So just be careful with that. If you want to learn how to do philosophy, you need to deeply engage with a large catalogue of serious literature.
